Extended BRS symmetry is used to prove gauge independence of the fermion
renormalization constant $Z_2$ in on-shell QED renormalization schemes. A
necessary condition for gauge independence of $Z_2$ in on-shell QCD
renormalization schemes is formulated. Satisfying this necessary condition
appears to be problematic at the three-loop level in QCD.
