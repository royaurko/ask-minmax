Astronomy has played a major part in the development of civilisations, not
only through conceptual developments, but most importantly through the very
practical gains obtained through the observation of Sun, Moon planets and
stars. Space sciences, including astronomy, have also played a major role in
the development of modern societies, as engine for most subsequent space
technology developments. Present trends tend to decrease the role of science in
space development. This trend should be reversed to give modern "societies"
their independence in space related matters that permeate the lives of all
inhabitants of the Earth.
