The set ${1, 25, 49}$ is a 3-term collection of integers which forms an
arithmetic progression of perfect squares. We view the set ${(1,1), (5,25),
(7,49)}$ as a 3-term collection of rational points on the parabola $y=x^2$
whose $y$-coordinates form an arithmetic progression. In this exposition, we
provide a generalization to 3-term arithmetic progressions on arbitrary conic
sections $\mathcal C$ with respect to a linear rational map $\ell: \mathcal C
\to \mathbb P^1$. We explain how this construction is related to rational
points on the universal elliptic curve $Y^2 + 4XY + 4kY = X^3 + kX^2$
classifying those curves possessing a rational 4-torsion point.
