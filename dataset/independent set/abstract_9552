We show how to construct, using an elementary extension of the Pinch
Technique, all off-shell Green's functions of a non-Abelian gauge theory so
that they are locally gauge-invariant and renormalization-group invariant
(RGI), as the S-matrix is, as well as being process-independent,
coupling-constant independent (dimensional transmutation), and satisfying
QED-like Ward identities. We call these PT-RGI Green's functions and outline
how to construct an approximate three-gluon PT-RGI vertex with three physical
scales and no dependence on the renormalization point $\mu$. Properties of the
PT-RGI Schwinger-Dyson equations are discussed, mostly in the context of a
modified form of $\phi^3_6$. The PT-RGI property of all off-shell Green's
functions, plus other work of long ago, leads to a near-realization of the old
dreams of S-matrix theorists.
