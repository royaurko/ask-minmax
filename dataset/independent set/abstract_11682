We present further evidence that gelation is an arrested phase separation in
attractive colloid-polymer mixtures, based on a method combining confocal
microscopy experiments with numerical simulations recently established in {\bf
Nature 453, 499 (2008)}. Our results are independent of the form of the
interparticle attractive potential, and therefore should apply broadly to any
attractive particle system with short-ranged, isotropic attractions. We also
give additional characterization of the gel states in terms of their structure,
inhomogeneous character and local density.
