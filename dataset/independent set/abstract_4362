We show that every strongly jump-traceable set obeys every benign cost
function. Moreover, we show that every strongly jump-traceable set is
computable from a computably enumerable strongly jump-traceable set. This
allows us to generalise properties of c.e.\ strongly jump-traceable sets to all
such sets. For example, the strongly jump-traceable sets induce an ideal in the
Turing degrees; the strongly jump-traceable sets are precisely those that are
computable from all superlow Martin-L\"{o}f random sets; the strongly
jump-traceable sets are precisely those that are a base for
$\text{Demuth}_{\text{BLR}}$-randomness; and strong jump-traceability is
equivalent to strong superlowness.
