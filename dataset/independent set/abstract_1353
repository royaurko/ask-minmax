The decomposition of a sample of images on a relevant subspace is a recurrent
problem in many different fields from Computer Vision to medical image
analysis. We propose in this paper a new learning principle and implementation
of the generative decomposition model generally known as noisy ICA (for
independent component analysis) based on the SAEM algorithm, which is a
versatile stochastic approximation of the standard EM algorithm. We demonstrate
the applicability of the method on a large range of decomposition models and
illustrate the developments with experimental results on various data sets.
