We present a new strategy for proving the Ambrose conjecture, a global
version of the Cartan local lemma. We introduce the concepts of linking curves,
unequivocal sets and sutured manifolds, and show that any sutured manifold
satisfies the Ambrose conjecture. We then prove that the set of sutured
Riemmanian manifolds contains a residual set of the metrics on a given smooth
manifold of dimension 3 by explicitely constructing linking curves of a special
type.
