The Ptolemy variety for SL(2, C) is an invariant of a topological ideal
triangulation of a compact 3-manifold M. It is closely related to Thurston's
gluing equation variety. The Ptolemy variety maps naturally to the set of
conjugacy classes of boundary-unipotent SL(2, C)-representations, but (like the
gluing equation variety) it depends on the triangulation, and may miss several
components of representations. In this paper, we define a Ptolemy variety,
which is independent of the choice of triangulation, and detects all
boundary-unipotent irreducible SL(2, C)-representations. We also define
variants of the Ptolemy variety for PSL(2, C)-representations, and
representations that are not necessarily boundary-unipotent. In particular, we
obtain an algorithm to compute the full A-polynomial. All the varieties are
topological invariants of M.
