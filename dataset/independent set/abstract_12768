The path to greater diversity, as we have seen, cannot be achieved by merely
hoping for a new search engine nor will government support for a single
alternative achieve this goal. What is instead required is to create the
conditions that will make establishing such a search engine possible in the
first place. I describe how building and maintaining a proprietary index is the
greatest deterrent to such an undertaking. We must first overcome this
obstacle. Doing so will still not solve the problem of the lack of diversity in
the search engine marketplace. But it may establish the conditions necessary to
achieve that desired end.
