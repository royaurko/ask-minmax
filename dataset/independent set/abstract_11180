In this paper we study the one-loop shift in the coupling constant in a
noncommutative pure U(N) Chern-Simons gauge theory in three dimensions. The
one-loop shift is shown to be a constant proportional to $N$, independent of
noncommutativity parameters, and non-vanishing for U(1) theory. Possible
physical and mathematical implications of this result are discussed.
