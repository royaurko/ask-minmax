The cross section for radiative capture of neutron on carbon-14 is calculated
using the model-independent formalism of halo effective field theory. The
dominant contribution from E1 transition is considered, and the cross section
is expressed in terms of elastic scattering parameters of the effective range
expansion. Contributions from both resonant and non-resonant interaction are
calculated. Significant interference between these leads to a capture
contribution that deviates from simple Breit-Wigner resonance form.
