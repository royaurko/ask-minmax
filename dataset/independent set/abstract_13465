The short-time asymptotic behavior of option prices for a variety of models
with jumps has received much attention in recent years. In the present work,
novel third-order approximations for close-to-the-money European option prices
under an infinite-variation CGMY L\'{e}vy model are derived, and are then
extended to a model with an additional independent Brownian component. The
asymptotic regime considered, in which the strike is made to converge to the
spot stock price as the maturity approaches zero, is relevant in applications
since the most liquid options have strikes that are close to the spot price.
Our results shed new light on the connection between both the volatility of the
continuous component and the jump parameters and the behavior of option prices
near expiration when the strike is close to the spot price. In particular, a
new type of transition phenomenon is uncovered in which the third order term
exhibits two distinct asymptotic regimes depending on whether $Y\in(1,3/2)$ or
$Y\in(3/2,2)$.
