Delorme suggested that the set of all complete intersection numerical
semigroups can be computed recursively. We have implemented this algorithm, and
particularized it to several subfamilies of this class of numerical semigroups:
free and telescopic numerical semigroups, and numerical semigroups associated
to an irreducible plane curve singularity. The recursive nature of this
procedure allows us to give bounds for the embedding dimension and for the
minimal generators of a semigroup in any of these families.
