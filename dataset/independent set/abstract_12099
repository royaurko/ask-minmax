The amplitude for Higgs decay to two photons is calculated in renormalizable
and unitary gauges using dimensional regularization at intermediate steps. The
result is finite, gauge independent, and in agreement with previously published
results. The large Higgs mass limit is examined using the Goldstone-boson
equivalence theorem as a check on the use of dimensional regularization and to
explain the absence of decoupling.
