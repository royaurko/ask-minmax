We study Lagrangian systems on a closed manifold. We link the
differentiability of Mather's beta-function with the topological complexity of
the complement of the Aubry set. As a consequence, when the dimension of the
manifold is less than or equal to two, the differentiability of the
beta-function at a given homology class is forced by the irrationality of the
homology class. As an application we prove the two-dimensional case of a
conjecture by Ricardo Mane.
