We consider the joint distribution of eigenvalue clusters of the Wigner
ensemble separated by macroscopic distances (i.e., on the same scale as the
difference between the edges of the semicircle law). We prove that under an
averaging condition, the correlation function governing any finite collection
of clusters converges to that of independence point processes. The proof relies
heavily on the machinery developed by Erdos, Ramirez, Schlein, and Yau.
