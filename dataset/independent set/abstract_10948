We derive a model-independent upper bound on the scale of Majorana-neutrino
mass generation. The upper bound is $4\pi v^2/\sqrt 3 m_\nu$, where $v \simeq
246$ GeV is the weak scale and $m_\nu$ is the Majorana neutrino mass. For
neutrino masses implied by neutrino oscillation experiments, all but one of
these bounds are less than the Planck scale, and they are all within a few
orders of magnitude of the grand-unification scale.
