A numerical model of the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect
for objects defined in terms of a triangular mesh is described. The algorithm
requires that each surface triangle can be handled independently, which implies
the use of a 1D thermal model. Insolation of each triangle is determined by an
optimized ray-triangle intersection search. Surface temperature is modeled with
a spectral approach; imposing a quasi-periodic solution we replace heat
conduction equation by the Helmholtz equation. Nonlinear boundary conditions
are handled by an iterative, FFT based solver. The results resolve the question
of the YORP effect in rotation rate independence on conductivity within the
nonlinear 1D thermal model regardless of the accuracy issues and homogeneity
assumptions. A seasonal YORP effect in attitude is revealed for objects moving
on elliptic orbits when a nonlinear thermal model is used.
