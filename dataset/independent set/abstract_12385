We extract ratios of $B \to K^*$ form factors at low hadronic recoil from
recent data on $B \to K^* \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays in a model-independent way. The
presented method will improve in the future with further (angular) studies in
semileptonic rare B-decays and advance our understanding of form factors, which
are important inputs in precision tests of the Standard Model.
