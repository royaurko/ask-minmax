Let $G=\{e^{tA}:t\in\mathbb{R}\}$ be a closed one-parameter subgroup of the
general linear group of matrices of order $n$ acting on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ by
matrix-vector multiplications. We assume that all eigenvalues of $A$ are
rationally related. We study conditions for which the set ${f(e^{t_{1}A}.)
,.,f(e^{t_{m}A}.)} $ is linearly dependent in $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) $ with
$1\leq p<\infty.$
