Killing-Yano one forms (duals of Killing vector fields) of a class of
spherically symmetric space-times characterized by four functions are derived
in a unified and exhaustive way. For well-known space-times such as those of
Minkowski, Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, Robertson-Walker and several
forms of de Sitter, these forms arise as special cases in a natural way.
Besides its two well-known forms, four more forms of de Sitter space-time are
also established with ten independent Killing vector fields for which four
different time evolution regimes can explicitly be specified by the symmetry
requirement. A family of space-times in which metric characterizing functions
are of the general form and admitting six or seven independent Killing vector
fields is presented.
