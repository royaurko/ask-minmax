A dilaton could be the dominant messenger between Standard Model fields and
dark matter. The measured dark matter relic abundance relates the dark matter
mass and spin to the conformal breaking scale. The dark matter-nucleon
spin-independent cross section is predicted in terms of the dilaton mass. We
compute the current constraints on the dilaton from LEP and Tevatron
experiments, and the gamma-ray signal from dark matter annihilation to dilatons
that could be observed by Fermi-LAT.
