Despite the obvious similarities in definitions and properties, the Nagata
ring and the Kronecker function ring have been classically treated
independently, when the coefficients are not in a Pr\"ufer domain. The purpose
of this paper is to study two different unified approaches to the Nagata rings
and the Kronecker function rings, which yield these rings and their classical
generalizations as special cases.
