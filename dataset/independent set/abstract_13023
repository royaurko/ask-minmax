An indentation testing method, which utilizes lateral contact of a long
cylindrical indenter, is developed for a thin transversely isotropic
incompressible elastic film deposited onto a smooth rigid substrate. It is
assumed that the material symmetry plane is orthogonal to the substrate
surface, and the film thickness is small compared to the cylinder indenter
length. The presented testing methodology is based on a least squares best fit
of the first-order asymptotic model to the depth-sensing indentation data for
recovering three independent elastic moduli which characterize an
incompressible transversely isotropic material. The case of a weakly
compressible material, which is important for biological tissues, is also
discussed.
