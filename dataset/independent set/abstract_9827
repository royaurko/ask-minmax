We study the length of the nodal set of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on
the $\spheredim$-dimensional sphere. It is well known that the eigenspaces
corresponding to $\eigval=n(n+\spheredim-1)$ are the spaces $\eigspc$ of
spherical harmonics of degree $n$, of dimension $\eigspcdim$. We use the
multiplicity of the eigenvalues to endow $\eigspc$ with the Gaussian
probability measure and study the distribution of the $\spheredim$-dimensional
volume of the nodal sets of a randomly chosen function. The expected volume is
proportional to $\sqrt{\eigval}$. One of our main results is bounding the
variance of the volume to be $O(\frac{\eigval}{\sqrt{\eigspcdim}})$.
  In addition to the volume of the nodal set, we study its Leray measure. For
every $n$, the expected value of the Leray measure is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}$.
We are able to determine that the asymptotic form of the variance is
$\frac{const}{\eigspcdim}$.
