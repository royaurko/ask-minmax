We argue directly from Witten's analysis of large $N_c$ baryons that the
structure of the $s$-wave low-spin baryon states in QCD becomes
spin-independent as $N_c\rightarrow\infty$. This property leads to $SU(6)$-like
behavior of static matrix elements, such as the axial-vector current matrix
elements recently studied by Dashen, Manohar and Jenkins. Our analysis suggests
a method for applying large $N_c$ results for $N_c=3$, even though the baryon
states for large $N_c$ are very different.
