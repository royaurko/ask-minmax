Intriguing phenomena such as subrecoil laser cooling of atoms, or aging
phenomenon in glasses, have in common that the systems considered do not reach
a steady-state during the experiments, although the experimental time scales
are very large compared to the microscopic ones. We revisit some standard
models describing these phenomena, and reformulate them in a unified framework
in terms of lifetimes of the microscopic states of the system. A universal
dynamical mechanism emerges, leading to a generic time-dependent distribution
of lifetimes, independently of the physical situation considered.
