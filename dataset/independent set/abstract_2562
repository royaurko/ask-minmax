As guideline for forthcoming experiments, we present predictions from Chiral
Effective Field Theory for polarized cross sections in low energy Compton
scattering for photon energies below 170 MeV, both on the proton and on the
neutron. Special interest is put on the role of the nucleon spin
polarizabilities which can be examined especially well in polarized Compton
scattering. We present a model-independent way to extract their energy
dependence and static values from experiment, interpreting our findings also in
terms of the low energy effective degrees of freedom inside the nucleon: The
polarizabilities are dominated by chiral dynamics from the pion cloud, except
for resonant multipoles, where contributions of the Delta(1232) resonance turn
out to be crucial. We therefore include it as an explicit degree of freedom. We
also identify some experimental settings which are particularly sensitive to
the spin polarizabilities.
