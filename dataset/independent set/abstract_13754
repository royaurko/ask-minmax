The dead-end depth of an element g of a group with finite generating set A is
the distance from g to the complement of the radius d(1,g) closed ball, in the
word metric d associated to A. We exhibit a finitely presented group K with two
finite generating sets A and B such that dead-end depth is unbounded on K with
respect to A but is at most two with respect to B.
