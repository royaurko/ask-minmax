We have examined the constraints on the anomalous $tq\gamma$ ($q=u,c$)
couplings through the process $pp\to p\gamma p\to pWbX$ at the LHC by
considering three forward detector acceptances: $0.0015< \xi < 0.5$, $0.0015<
\xi <0.15$ and $0.1< \xi < 0.5$. The sensitivity bounds on the anomalous
couplings have been obtained at the $95%$ confidence level in a model
independent effective lagrangian approach. We have found that the bounds on
these couplings can be highly improved compared to current experimental bounds.
