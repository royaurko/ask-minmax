B --> rho l nu decay is analyzed in the effective theory of heavy quark with
infinite mass limit. The matrix element relevant to the heavy to light vector
meson semileptonic decays is parametrized by a set of four heavy flavor-spin
independent universal wave functions at the leading order of effective theory.
The form factors are calculated at the leading 1/m_Q order using the light cone
sum rule method in the framework of effective theory. |V_{ub}| is then
extracted via B --> rho l nu decay mode.
