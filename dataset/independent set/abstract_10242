Epochal dynamics, in which long periods of stasis in population fitness are
punctuated by sudden innovations, is a common behavior in both natural and
artificial evolutionary processes. We use a recent quantitative mathematical
analysis of epochal evolution to estimate, as a function of population size and
mutation rate, the average number of fitness function evaluations to reach the
global optimum. This is then used to derive estimates of and bounds on
evolutionary parameters that minimize search effort.
