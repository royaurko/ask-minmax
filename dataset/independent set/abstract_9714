We investigate a stochastic search process in one dimension under the
competing roles of mortality, redundancy, and diversity of the searchers. This
picture represents a toy model for the fertilization of an oocyte by sperm. A
population of $N$ independent and mortal diffusing searchers all start at $x=L$
and attempt to reach the target at $x=0$. When mortality is irrelevant, the
search time scales as $\tau_D/\ln N$ for $\ln N\gg 1$, where $\tau_D\sim L^2/D$
is the diffusive time scale. Conversely, when the mortality rate $\mu$ of the
searchers is sufficiently large, the search time scales as $\sqrt{\tau_D/\mu}$,
independent of $N$. When searchers have distinct and high mortalities, a
subpopulation with a non-trivial optimal diffusivity are most likely to reach
the target. We also discuss the effect of chemotaxis on the search time and its
fluctuations.
