Let M be a compact surface and P be one dimensional manifold without
boundary, that is the line R^1 or a circle S^1. The classification of
path-components of the space of Morse maps from M into P was recently obtained
by S.V.Matveev and V.V.Sharko for the case P=R^1. For P=S^1 the classification
was obtained by the contributor. All this results can be reformulated as one
theorem: "Two Morse maps f,g:M \to P belong to the same path component of a
space of Morse mappings from M into P if and only if they are homotopic and
have the same number of crutucal points in each index and the same sets of
positive and negative boundary circles". Here we give another independent proof
of this theorem based on Lickorich's theorem on generators of homeotopy group
of surface.
