We say that a set system $\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ shatters a given set
$S\subseteq [n]$ if $2^S={F \cap S : F \in \mathcal{F}}$. The Sauer inequality
states that in general, a set system $\mathcal{F}$ shatters at least
$|\mathcal{F}|$ sets. Here we concentrate on the case of equality. A set system
is called shattering-extremal if it shatters exactly $|\mathcal{F}|$ sets. We
characterize shattering extremal set systems of Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension 1
in terms of their inclusion graphs. Also from the perspective of extremality,
we relate set systems of bounded Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension to their
projections.
