Three independent sets of data: i). series of filtergrams obtained in line
CaII K (393.416 nm) with the ground-based telescope Precision Solar Photometric
Telescope (PSPT) of Mauna Loa Solar Observatory; ii). series of filtergrams of
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in
{\lambda}160 nm and iii). series of magnetograms of Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI) of SDO have been processed to reveal reliably the existence of
spatial cellular structures on the solar photosphere at scale about of 300
arcsec. This scale is intermediate between supergranules and giant cells
(~30,000 and ~300,000 kilometers across, respectively). To identify the
different spatial structures the tens of two-dimensional power spectra (2DFFT)
have been averaged. For one-dimensional photometric cross sections of frames,
the Fourier power spectra (FFT) and wavelet transforms (Morlet 5-th order) have
been calculated.
