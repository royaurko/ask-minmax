We consider the refinement of the holographic entanglement entropy for the
holographic dual theories to the AdS solitons and AdS black holes, including
the corrected ones by the Gauss-Bonnet term. The refinement is obtained by
extracting the UV-independent piece of the holographic entanglement entropy,
the so-called renormalized entanglement entropy which is independent of the
choices of UV cutoff. Our main results are (i) the renormalized entanglement
entropies of the AdS$_{d+1}$ soliton for $d=4,5$ are neither monotonically
decreasing along the RG flow nor positive definite, especially around the
deconfinement/confinement phase transition; (ii) there is no topological
entanglement entropy for AdS$_5$ soliton even with Gauss-Bonnet correction;
(iii) for the AdS black holes, the renormalized entanglement entropy obeys an
expected volume law at IR regime, and the transition between UV and IR regimes
is a smooth crossover even with Gauss-Bonnet correction; (iv) based on AdS/MERA
conjecture, we postulate that the IR fixed-point state for the non-extremal AdS
soliton is a trivial product state.
