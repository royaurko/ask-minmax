We present an algorithm which computes a cylindrical algebraic decomposition
of a semialgebraic set using projection sets computed for each cell separately.
Such local projection sets can be significantly smaller than the global
projection set used by the Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) algorithm.
This leads to reduction in the number of cells the algorithm needs to
construct. We give an empirical comparison of our algorithm and the classical
CAD algorithm.
