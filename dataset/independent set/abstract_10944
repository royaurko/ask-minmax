Taking as input the best fit solar neutrino anomaly description, MSW LMA, and
the tritium beta decay results we estimate the allowed range of neutrino masses
independently of their nature. Adding the present bound on the effective
neutrino mass coming from neutrinoless double beta decay, we narrow this range
for Majorana neutrinos. We complete the discussion by considering future
perspectives on determining the neutrino masses, when the oscillation data will
be improved and the next experiments on $(\beta\beta)_{0\nu}$ and $^3H$ decay
give new bounds or obtain concrete life-times or distortions in the energy
distribution.
