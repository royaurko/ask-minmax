Let $\gamma(E)$ be the analytic capacity of a compact set $E$ and let
$\gamma_+(E)$ be the capacity of $E$ originated by Cauchy transforms of
positive measures. In this paper we prove that $\gamma(E)\approx\gamma_+(E)$
with estimates independent of $E$. As a corollary, we characterize removable
singularities for bounded analytic functions in terms of curvature of measures,
and we deduce that $\gamma$ is semiadditive, which solves a long standing
question of Vitushkin.
