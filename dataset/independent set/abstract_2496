To a polynomial $f$ over a non-archimedean local field $K$ and a character
$\chi$ of the group of units of the valuation ring of $K$ one associates
Igusa's local zeta function $Z(s,f,\chi)$. In this paper, we study the local
zeta function $Z(s,f,\chi)$ associated to a non-degenerate polynomial $f$, by
using an approach based on the p-adic stationary phase formula and N\'eron
p-desingularization. We give a small set of candidates for the poles of
$Z(s,f,\chi)$ in terms of the Newton polyhedron $ \Gamma(f)$ of $f$. We also
show that for almost all $\chi$, the local zeta function $Z(s,f,\chi)$ is a
polynomial in $q^{-s}$ whose degree is bounded by a constant independent of
$\chi$. Our second result is a description of the largest pole of $Z(s,f,
\chi_{\text{triv}})$ in terms of $ \Gamma(f)$ when the distance between
$\Gamma(f)$ and the origin is at most one.
