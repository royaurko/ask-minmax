Linear systems governed by continuous-time difference equations cover a wide
class of linear systems. From the Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach, we investigate
stability for such a class of systems. Sufficient conditions, and in some
particular cases, necessary and sufficient conditions for exponential stability
are established, for multivariable systems with commensurate or rationally
independent delays. A discussion on robust stability is proposed, for
parametric uncertainties and time-varying delays.
