We present a rejection method based on recursive covering of the probability
density function with equal tiles. The concept works for any probability
density function that is pointwise computable or representable by tabular data.
By the implicit construction of piecewise constant majorizing and minorizing
functions that are arbitrarily close to the density function the production of
random variates is arbitrarily independent of the computation of the density
function and extremely fast. The method works unattended for probability
densities with discontinuities (jumps and poles). The setup time is short,
marginally independent of the shape of the probability density and linear in
table size. Recently formulated requirements to a general and automatic
non-uniform random number generator are topped. We give benchmarks together
with a similar rejection method and with a transformation method.
