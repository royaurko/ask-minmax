In this article I review model-independent procedures for extracting
properties of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) from direct Dark
Matter detection experiments. Neither prior knowledge about the velocity
distribution function of halo Dark Matter particles nor about their mass or
cross sections on target nucleus is needed. The unique required information is
measured recoil energies from experiments with different detector materials.
