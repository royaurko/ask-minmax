In a recent contributor's work the cyclic behavior of maxima in a hierarchical
summation scheme was discovered. In the present note we show how the same
phenomenon appears in the scheme of conventional summation: the distribution of
maximum of $2^n$ independent copies of a sum of $n$ i.i.d. random variables
approaches, as $n$ grows, some helix in the space of distributions.
