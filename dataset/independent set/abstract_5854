We derive a class of formulae relating moments of B -> Xu l nu to B -> Xs
gamma in the shape function region, where m_X^2 ~ m_b Lambda_QCD. We also
derive an analogous class of formulae involving the decay B -> Xs l+ l-. These
results incorporate Lambda_QCD/m_b power corrections, but are independent of
leading and subleading hadronic shape functions. Consequently, they enable one
to determine |V_ub|/|V_tb V_ts*| to subleading order in a model-independent
way.
