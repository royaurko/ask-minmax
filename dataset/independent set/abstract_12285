A special customer must complete service from two servers in series, in
either order, each with an M/M/1 queueing system. It is assumed that the two
queueing system lengths are independent with initial numbers of customers a and
b at the instant when the special customer arrives. We find the expected total
time (ETT) for the special customer to complete service. We show that even if
the interarrival and service time parameters of two queues are identical, there
exist examples (specific values of the parameters and initial lengths) for
which the special customer surprisingly has a lower expected total time to
completion by joining the longer queue first rather than the shorter one.
