We consider n by n real matrices whose entries are non-degenerate random
variables that are independent but non necessarily identically distributed, and
show that the probability that such a matrix is singular is O(1/sqrt{n}). The
purpose of this note is to provide a short and elementary proof of this fact
using a Bernoulli decomposition of arbitrary non degenerate random variables.
