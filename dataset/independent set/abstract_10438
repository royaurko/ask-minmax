We demonstrate theoretically how a two-dimensional electron gas can be used
to probe local potential profiles using the Hall effect. For small magnetic
fields, the Hall resistance is inversely proportional to the average potential
profile in the Hall cross and is independent of the shape and the position of
this profile in the junction. The bend resistance, on the other hand, is much
more sensitive on the exact details of the local potential profile in the cross
junction.
