We provide an algebraic setting for cumulants and factorial moments through
the classical umbral calculus. Main tools are the compositional inverse of the
unity umbra, connected with the logarithmic power series, and a new umbra here
introduced, the singleton umbra. Various formulae are given expressing
cumulants, factorial moments and central moments by umbral functions.
