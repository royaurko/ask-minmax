In this paper we study kleinian groups of Schottky type whose limit set is a
wild knot in the sense of Artin and Fox. We show that, if the ``original knot''
fibers over the circle then the wild knot $\Lambda$ also fibers over the
circle. As a consequence, the universal covering of $\mathbb{S}^{3}-\Lambda$ is
$\mathbb{R}^{3}$. We prove that the complement of a dynamically-defined fibered
wild knot can not be a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold.
