This paper presents an improved methodology to generate Compact Thermal
Models "CTMs" by using (VHDL-AMS) modeling language. This methodology makes it
possible to have Boundary Conditions Independent "BCI" CTMs for multi chip
components and systems while taking into account the nonlinear thermal
conductivity of semiconductors and other materials.
