We translate Akin's notion of {\it good} (and related concepts) from measures
on Cantor sets to traces on dimension groups, and particularly for invariant
measures of minimal homeomorphisms (and their corresponding simple dimension
groups), this yields characterizations and examples, which translate back to
the original context. Good traces on a simple dimension group are characterized
by their kernel having dense image in their annihilating set of affine
functions on the trace space; this makes it possible to construct many examples
with seemingly paradoxical properties. In order to study the related property
of {\it refinability,} we consider goodness for sets of measures (traces on
dimension groups), and obtain partial characterizations in terms of (special)
convex subsets of Choquet simplices. These notions also very closely related to
unperforation of quotients of dimension groups by convex subgroups (that are
not order ideals), and we give partial characterizations. Numerous examples
illustrate the results.
