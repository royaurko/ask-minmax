We investigate the question of whether or not the orbit of a point in A/Q,
under the natural action of a subset S of Q, is dense in A/Q. We prove that if
the set S is a multiplicative semigroup which contains at least two
multiplicatively independent elements, one of which is an integer, then the
orbit under S of any point with irrational real coordinate is dense.
