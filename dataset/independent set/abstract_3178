We consider D-dimensional Einstein gravity coupled to (n-1) U(1) vector
fields and (n-2) dilatonic scalars. We find that for some appropriate
exponential dilaton couplings of the field strengths, the equations of motion
for the static charged ansatz can be reduced to a set of one-dimensional
SL(n,R) Toda equations. This allows us to obtain a general class of explicit
black holes with mass and (n-1) independent charges. The near-horizon geometry
in the extremal limit is AdS_2 x S^{D-2}. The n=2 case gives the
Reissner-Nordstrom solution, and the n=3 example includes the Kaluza-Klein
dyon. We study the global structure and the black hole thermodynamics and
obtain the universal entropy product formula. We also discuss the
characteristics of extremal multi-charge black holes that have positive, zero
or negative binding energies.
