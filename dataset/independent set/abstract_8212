Let A be a finite set of integers. For a polynomial f(x_1,...,x_n) with
integer coefficients, let f(A) = {f(a_1,...,a_n) : a_1,...,a_n \in A}. In this
paper it is proved that for every pair of normalized binary linear forms
f(x,y)=u_1x+v_1y and g(x,y)=u_2x+v_2y with integral coefficients, there exist
arbitrarily large finite sets of integers A and B such that |f(A)| > |g(A)| and
|f(B)| < |g(B)|.
