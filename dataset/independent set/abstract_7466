We develop a new real-space method which allows to evaluate the
Kubo-Greenwood conductivity of independent electrons in static aperiodic
potentials. We apply it to a numerical study of propagation modes in 3
dimensional quasiperiodic systems. The effect of quenched disorder is analysed
and for Fermi energies in pseudo-gaps, the conductivity can be stable or even
increase with disorder.
