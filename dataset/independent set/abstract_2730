The Invariant Subspace Problem ("ISP") for Hilbert space operators is known
to be equivalent to a question that, on its surface, seems surprisingly
concrete: For composition operators induced on the Hardy space H^2 by
hyperbolic automorphisms of the unit disc, is every nontrivial minimal
invariant subspace one dimensional (i.e., spanned by an eigenvector)? In the
hope of reviving interest in the contribution this remarkable result might
offer to the studies of both composition operators and the ISP, I revisit some
known results, weaken their hypotheses and simplify their proofs. Sample
results: If f is a hyperbolic disc automorphism with fixed points at a and b
(both necessarily on the unit circle), and C_f the composition operator it
induces on H^2, then for every function g in the subspace
[{(z-a)(z-a)]^(1/2)H^2, the doubly C_f-cyclic subspace generated by g contains
many independent eigenvectors; more precisely, the point spectrum of C_f's
restriction to that subspace intersects the unit circle in a set of positive
measure. Moreover, this restriction of C_f is hypercyclic (some forward orbit
is dense).
