We study the dependencies of spin asymmetries in diffractive leptoproduction
on the spin structure of the pomeron coupling. It is shown that the $A_{ll}$
asymmetry in diffractive processes is proportional to the fraction of the
initial proton momentum $x_p$ carried off by the pomeron. The resulting
asymmetries decrease with increasing energy for diffractive $J/\Psi$ production
and are energy independent for diffractive $Q \bar Q$ leptoproduction. The
connection of these asymmetries with the non-forward gluon distribution in the
proton is discussed.
