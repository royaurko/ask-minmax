We start by giving a survey to the theory of Borel*(\kappa) sets in the
generalized Baire space Baire({\kappa}) = {\kappa}^{\kappa}. In particular we
look at the relation of this complexity class to other complexity classes which
we denote by Borel({\kappa}), \Delta^1_1({\kappa}) and {\Sigma}^1_1({\kappa})
and the connections between Borel*(\kappa)-sets and the infinitely deep
language M_{{\kappa}^+{\kappa}}. In the end of the paper we prove the
consistency of Borel*(\kappa) \ne {\Sigma}^1_1({\kappa}).
