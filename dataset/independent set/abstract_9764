In this paper we analyze the structure of some sets of non-commutative
moments of elements in a finite von Neumann algebra M. If the fundamental group
of M is R_+\{0}, then the moment sets are convex, and if M is isomorphic to M
tensor M, then the sets are closed under pointwise multiplication. We introduce
a class of discrete groups that we call hyperlinear. These are the discrete
subgroups (with infinite conjugacy classes) of the unitary group of R^omega. We
prove that this class is strictly larger than the class of (i.c.c.) residually
finite groups. In particular, it contains the Baumslag group < a,b | a b^3 a^-1
= b^2 >. This leads to a previously unknown (non-hyperfinite) type II_1 factor
that can be embedded in R^omega. This is positive evidence for Connes's
conjecture that any separable II_1 factor can be embedded into R^omega.
