This is the first of a series of papers on a consistent model independent
analysis of the complete experimental information on the reaction $\pi N
\rightarrow \pi \pi N$ at pion momenta up to 500 MeV/c. The paper summarizes
the theoretical approach and details of the computational procedure. The
complete database on total cross sections in 5 $\pi \pi N$ channels is given
together with a critical discussion of their model independent analysis.
