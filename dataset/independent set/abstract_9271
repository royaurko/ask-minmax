We show that when the Hornberger--Sipe calculation of collisional decoherence
is carried out with the squared delta function a delta of energy instead of a
delta of the absolute value of momentum, following a method introduced by
Di\'osi, the corrected formula for the decoherence rate is simply obtained. The
results of Hornberger and Sipe and of Di\'osi are shown to be in agreement. As
an independent cross-check, we calculate the mean squared coordinate diffusion
of a hard sphere implied by the corrected decoherence master equation, and show
that it agrees precisely with the same quantity as calculated by a classical
Brownian motion analysis.
