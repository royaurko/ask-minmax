Superlattices composed of ferromagnetic La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 and ferroelectric
0.7Pb(Mg0,33Nb0.66)O3 0.3(PbTiO3) layers were fabricated on (100) LaAlO3
substrates by pulsed laser deposition technique. Ferromagnetic and frequency
independent ferroelectric hysteresis characteristics established the biferroic
nature of the superlattices. Influence of magnetic field was observed in tuning
the P-E characteristics of the superlattices. Similar effect was observed on
application of a high DC electric field to the samples. The nature of the
observed ferroelectric properties and their modulation by applied magnetic and
electric fields were thus discussed in connection to existence of dielectric
passive layers at the ferroelectric/ferromagnetic interface.
