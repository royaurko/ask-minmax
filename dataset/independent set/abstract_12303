We describe how the use of a different degeneration from that considered by
Eisenbud and Harris leads to a simple and characteristic-independent proof of
the Brill-Noether theorem using limit linear series. As suggested by the
degeneration, we prove an extended version of the theorem allowing for imposed
ramification at up to two points. Although experts in the field have long been
aware of the main ideas, we address some technical issues which arise in
proving the full version of theorem.
