Relying on the analysis of characteristics, we prove the uniqueness of
conservative solutions to the variational wave equation $u_{tt}-c(u)
(c(u)u_x)_x=0$. Given a solution $u(t,x)$, even if the wave speed $c(u)$ is
only H\"older continuous in the $t$-$x$ plane, one can still define forward and
backward characteristics in a unique way. Using a new set of independent
variables $X,Y$, constant along characteristics, we prove that $t,x,u$,
together with other variables, satisfy a semilinear system with smooth
coefficients. From the uniqueness of the solution to this semilinear system,
one obtains the uniqueness of conservative solutions to the Cauchy problem for
the wave equation with general initial data $u(0,\cdot)\in H^1(\mathbb{R})$,
$u_t(0,\cdot)\in L^2(\mathbb{R})$.
