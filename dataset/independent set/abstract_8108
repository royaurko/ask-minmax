ZF is a well investigated impredicative constructive version of
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. Using set terms, we axiomatize IZF with
Replacement, which we call \izfr, along with its intensional counterpart
\iizfr. We define a typed lambda calculus $\li$ corresponding to proofs in
\iizfr according to the Curry-Howard isomorphism principle. Using realizability
for \iizfr, we show weak normalization of $\li$. We use normalization to prove
the disjunction, numerical existence and term existence properties. An inner
extensional model is used to show these properties, along with the set
existence property, for full, extensional \izfr.
