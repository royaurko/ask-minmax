We show that an independent four-body momentum scale $\mu_{(4)}$ drives the
tetramer binding energy for fixed trimer energy (or three-body scale
$\mu_{(3)}$) and large scattering length ($a$). The three- and four-body forces
from the one-channel reduction of the atomic interaction near a Feshbach
resonance disentangle $\mu_{(4)}$ and $\mu_{(3)}$. The four-body independent
scale is also manifested through a family of Tjon-lines, with slope given by
$\mu_{(4)}/\mu_{(3)}$ for $a^{-1}=0$. There is the possibility of a new
renormalization group limit cycle due to the new scale.
