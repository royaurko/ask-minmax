Markov Population Model is a commonly used framework to describe stochastic
systems. Their exact analysis is unfeasible in most cases because of the state
space explosion. Approximations are usually sought, often with the goal of
reducing the number of variables. Among them, the mean field limit and the
quasi-equilibrium approximations stand out. We view them as techniques that are
rooted in independent basic principles. At the basis of the mean field limit is
the law of large numbers. The principle of the quasi-equilibrium reduction is
the separation of temporal scales. It is common practice to apply both limits
to an MPM yielding a fully reduced model. Although the two limits should be
viewed as completely independent options, they are applied almost invariably in
a fixed sequence: MF limit first, QE-reduction second. We present a framework
that makes explicit the distinction of the two reductions, and allows an
arbitrary order of their application. By inverting the sequence, we show that
the double limit does not commute in general: the mean field limit of a
time-scale reduced model is not the same as the time-scale reduced limit of a
mean field model. An example is provided to demonstrate this phenomenon.
Sufficient conditions for the two operations to be freely exchangeable are also
provided.
