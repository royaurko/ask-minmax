The representation of independence relations generally builds upon the
well-known semigraphoid axioms of independence. Recently, a representation has
been proposed that captures a set of dominant statements of an independence
relation from which any other statement can be generated by means of the
axioms; the cardinality of this set is taken to indicate the complexity of the
relation. Building upon the idea of dominance, we introduce the concept of
stability to provide for a more compact representation of independence. We give
an associated algorithm for establishing such a representation.We show that,
with our concept of stability, many independence relations are found to be of
lower complexity than with existing representations.
