We present a systematic performance analysis of first-principles
basin-hopping (BH) runs, with the target to identify all low-energy isomers of
small Si and Cu clusters described within density-functional theory. As
representative and widely employed move classes we focus on single-particle and
collective moves, in which one or all atoms in the cluster at once are
displaced in a random direction by some prescribed move distance, respectively.
The analysis provides detailed insights into the bottlenecks and governing
factors for the sampling efficiency, as well as simple rules-of-thumb for
near-optimum move settings, that are intriguingly independent of the distinctly
different chemistry of Si and Cu. At corresponding settings, the observed
performance of the BH algorithm employing two simple, general-purpose move
classes is already very good, and for the small systems studied essentially
limited by frequent revisits to a few dominant isomers.
