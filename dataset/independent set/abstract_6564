Let $S$ be a finite set of points in the plane and let $\mathcal{T}(S)$ be
the set of intersection points between pairs of lines passing through any two
points in $S$. We characterize all configurations of points $S$ such that
iteration of the above operation produces a dense set. We also discuss partial
results on the characterization of those finite point-sets with rational
coordinates that generate all of $\mathbb Q^2$ through iteration of
$\mathcal{T}$.
