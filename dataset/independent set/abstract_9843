Recently a new set of Parton Distribution Functions (NNPDF1.2) has been
produced and released by the NNPDF Collaboration. The inclusion of dimuon data
in the analysis allows a determination of the strange content of the proton
with faithful uncertainty estimation together with a precision determination of
electroweak parameters. In this contribution, we discuss some of the
implications of the NNPDF1.2 set, and in particular of its uncertainty
determination of the strange PDFs, for LHC phenomenology. First of all, we
study the impact on the electroweak boson production cross-section, with
special attention to the Z/W ratio. Then we revisit the top pair production
cross-section, and perform a comparison of partonic fluxes between various PDF
sets. Finally, we discuss the potential of using associated production of W
with a charm quark at the Tevatron and the LHC to constrain the proton
strangeness.
