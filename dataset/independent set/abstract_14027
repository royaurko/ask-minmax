So far, various multi-photon entangled states have been observed
experimentally by using different experimental set-ups. Here, we present a
scheme to realize many SLOCC-inequivalent states of three and four qubits via
projective measurements on suitable entangled states. We demonstrate how these
states can be observed experimentally in a single set-up and study the
feasibility of the implementation with present-day technology.
