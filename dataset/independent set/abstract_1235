We present a general technique for computing large deviations of nonlinear
functions of independent Bernoulli random variables. The method is applied to
compute the large deviation rate functions for subgraph counts in sparse random
graphs. Previous technology, based on Szemeredi's regularity lemma, works only
for dense graphs. Applications are also made to exponential random graphs and
three-term arithmetic progressions in random sets of integers.
