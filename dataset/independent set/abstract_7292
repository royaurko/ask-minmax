On the basis of local realism theory, nonlocal information is necessary for
violation of Bell's inequality. From a theoretical point of view, nonlocal
information is essentially the mutual information on distant outcome and
measurement setting. In this work we prove that if the measurement is free and
unbiased, the mutual information about the distant outcome and setting is both
necessary for the violation of Bell's inequality in the case with unbiased
marginal probabilities. In the case with biased marginal probabilities, we
point out that the mutual information about distant outcome cease to be
necessary for violation of Bell's inequality, while the mutual information
about distant measurement settings is still required. We also prove that the
mutual information about distant measurement settings must be contained in the
transmitted messages due to the freedom of measurement choices. Finally we
point out that the mutual information about both distant outcome and
measurement settings are necessary for a violation of information causality.
