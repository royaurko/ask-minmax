Dyson's Brownian motion model with the parameter $\beta=2$, which we simply
call the Dyson model in the present paper, is realized as an $h$-transform of
the absorbing Brownian motion in a Weyl chamber of type A. Depending on initial
configuration with a finite number of particles, we define a set of entire
functions and introduce a martingale for a system of independent complex
Brownian motions (CBMs), which is expressed by a determinant of a matrix with
elements given by the conformal transformations of CBMs by the entire
functions. We prove that the Dyson model can be represented by the system of
independent CBMs weighted by this determinantal martingale. From this CBM
representation, the Eynard-Mehta-type correlation kernel is derived and the
Dyson model is shown to be determinantal. The CBM representation is a useful
extension of $h$-transform, since it works also in infinite particle systems.
Using this representation, we prove the tightness of a series of processes,
which converges to the Dyson model with an infinite number of particles, and
the noncolliding property of the limit process.
