We describe a procedure for accurately determining luminosity distances to
Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) without knowledge of redshift. This procedure,
which may be used as an extension of any of the various distance determination
methods currently in use, is based on marginalizing over redshift, removing the
requirement of knowing $z$ a priori. We demonstrate that the Hubble diagram
scatter of distances measured with this technique is approximately equal to
that of distances derived from conventional redshift-specific methods for a set
of 60 nearby SNe Ia. This indicates that accurate distances for cosmological
SNe Ia may be determined without the requirement of spectroscopic redshifts,
which are typically the limiting factor for the number of SNe that modern
surveys can collect. Removing this limitation would greatly increase the number
of SNe for which current and future SN surveys will be able to accurately
measure distance. The method may also be able to be used for high-$z$ SNe Ia to
determine cosmological density parameters without redshift information.
