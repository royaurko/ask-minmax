Although histogram methods have been extremely effective for analyzing data
from Monte Carlo simulations, they do have certain limitations, including the
range over which they are valid and the difficulties of combining data from
independent simulations. In this paper, we describe an complementary approach
to extracting information from Monte Carlo simulations that uses the matrix of
transition probabilities. Combining the Transition Matrix with an N-fold way
simulation technique produces an extremely flexible and efficient approach to
rather general Monte Carlo simulations.
