In the talk different definitions of the black hole entropy are discussed and
compared. It is shown that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S^{BH}$ (defined by
the response of the free energy of a system containing a black hole on the
change of the temperature) differs from the statistical- mechanical entropy
$S^{SM}=-\mbox{Tr}(\hat{\rho}\ln \hat{\rho})$ (defined by counting internal
degrees of freedom of a black hole). A simple explanation of the universality
of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (i.e. its independence of the number and
properties of the fields which might contribute to $S^{SM}$) is given.
