We investigate the usage of rule dependency graphs and their colorings for
characterizing and computing answer sets of logic programs. This approach
provides us with insights into the interplay between rules when inducing answer
sets. We start with different characterizations of answer sets in terms of
totally colored dependency graphs that differ in graph-theoretical aspects. We
then develop a series of operational characterizations of answer sets in terms
of operators on partial colorings. In analogy to the notion of a derivation in
proof theory, our operational characterizations are expressed as
(non-deterministically formed) sequences of colorings, turning an uncolored
graph into a totally colored one. In this way, we obtain an operational
framework in which different combinations of operators result in different
formal properties. Among others, we identify the basic strategy employed by the
noMoRe system and justify its algorithmic approach. Furthermore, we distinguish
operations corresponding to Fitting's operator as well as to well-founded
semantics. (To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP))
