By a completely independent analytic calculation made in general covariant
gauge we confirm the known result for the massless $\alpha_s^3$ correction to
$R_{had}$ and check explicitly its gauge independence. We extend the
calculations to include contributions due to a hypothetical existence of a
colour octet of (light) neutral fermions known also under the name of gluinos.
