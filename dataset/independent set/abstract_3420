The effect of the helicity on the dynamics of the turbulent flows is
investigated. The aim is to disentangle the role of helicity in fixing the
direction, the intensity and the fluctuations of the energy transfer across the
inertial range of scales. We introduce an external parameter, $\alpha$, that
controls the mismatch between the number of positive and negative helically
polarized Fourier modes. We present the first set of direct numerical
simulations of Navier-Stokes equations from the fully symmetrical case,
$\alpha=0$, to the fully asymmetrical case, $\alpha=1$, when only helical modes
of one sign survive. We found a singular dependency of the direction of the
energy cascade on $\alpha$, measuring a positive forward flux as soon as only a
few modes with different helical polarities are present. On the other hand,
small-scales fluctuations are sensitive only to the degree of mode-reduction,
leading to a vanishing intermittency already for values of $\alpha \sim 0.1$
and independently of the degree of mirror symmetry-breaking. Our findings
suggest that intermittency is the result of a global mode-coupling in Fourier
space.
