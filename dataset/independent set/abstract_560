We investigate the dependence of the hardness of materials on their elastic
stiffness. This is possible by constructing a series of model potentials of the
Morse type; starting on modelling natural Cu, the model potential exhibit an
increased elastic modulus, while keeping all other potential parameters
(lattice constant, bond energy) unchanged. Using molecular-dynamics simulation,
we perform nanoindentation experiments on these model crystals. We find that
the crystal hardness scales with the elastic stiffness. Also the load drop,
which is experienced when plasticity sets in, increases in proportion to the
elastic stiffness, while the yield point, i.e., the indentation at which
plasticity sets in, is independent of the elastic stiffness.
