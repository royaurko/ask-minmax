We study the possible constraints on non-standard interaction(NSIs) in a
model independent way by considering the recent results from T2K and Daya Bay
neutrino oscillations experiments. Using perturbation method we present generic
formulas (suitable for T2K baseline and for large $\theta_{13}$ as evident from
Daya Bay) for the probability of oscillation for $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e$,
taking into account NSIs at source ($\epsilon^s$), detector ($\epsilon^d$) and
during propagation ($\epsilon^m$) of neutrinos through matter. Two separate
cases of perturbation with small (slightly large) NSI
($\epsilon_{\alpha\beta}^m \sim 0.03(0.18)$) are discussed in detail. Using
various possible presently allowed NSI values we reanalyze numerically the
$\theta_{13} - \delta$ allowed region given by recent T2K experimental data. We
obtain model independent constraints on NSIs in the
$\delta-\epsilon_{\alpha\beta}^m$ plane using the $\theta_{13}$ value as
measured by Daya Bay, where $\delta$ is the CP violating phase. Depending on
$\delta$ values significant constraints on $\epsilon_{e\tau}$ and
$\epsilon_{\tau\tau}$, in particular, are possible for both hierarchies of
neutrino masses. Corresponding to T2K's 66% confidence level result, the
constraints on $\epsilon_{\tau\tau}$ is shown to be independent of any $\delta$
value.
