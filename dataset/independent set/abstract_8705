We consider two kind of energy constraints when the output state is a
coherent state. One is a constraint on the total energy during a fixed period;
the other is a constraint on the total energy for a single code. The first
setting can be easily dealt with by using the conventional capacity formula.
The second setting requires the general capacity formula for a
classical-quantum channel.
