We enlarge the hom-sets of categories of complete lattices by introducing
`state transitions' as generalized morphisms. The obtained category will then
be compared with a functorial quantaloidal enrichment and a contextual
quantaloidal enrichment that uses a specific concretization in the category of
sets and partially defined maps ($Parset$).
