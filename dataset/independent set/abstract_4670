The CRESST-II cryogenic dark matter search aims for the detection of WIMPs
via elastic scattering off nuclei in CaWO$_4$ crystals. We present results from
a low-threshold analysis of a single upgraded detector module. This module
efficiently vetoes low energy backgrounds induced by $\alpha$-decays on inner
surfaces of the detector. With an exposure of \unit[29.35]{kg live days}
collected in 2013 we set a limit on spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering
which probes a new region of parameter space for WIMP masses below
\unit[3]{GeV/c$^2$}, previously not covered in direct detection searches. A
possible excess over background discussed for the previous CRESST-II phase 1
(from 2009 to 2011) is not confirmed.
