We present a new definition of influences in product spaces of continuous
distributions. Our definition is geometric, and for monotone sets it is
identical with the measure of the boundary with respect to uniform enlargement.
We prove analogs of the Kahn-Kalai-Linial (KKL) and Talagrand's influence sum
bounds for the new definition. We further prove an analog of a result of
Friedgut showing that sets with small "influence sum" are essentially
determined by a small number of coordinates. In particular, we establish the
following tight analog of the KKL bound: for any set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ of
Gaussian measure $t$, there exists a coordinate $i$ such that the $i$th
geometric influence of the set is at least $ct(1-t)\sqrt{\log n}/n$, where $c$
is a universal constant. This result is then used to obtain an isoperimetric
inequality for the Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and the class of sets
invariant under transitive permutation group of the coordinates.
