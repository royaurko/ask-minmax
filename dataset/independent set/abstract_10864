I review the implications of the axial anomaly in a thermal bath. I assume
that the Adler-Bardeen theorem applies at nonzero temperature, so that the
divergence of the axial current remains is independent of temperature.
Nevertheless, I argue that while the anomaly doesn't change with temperature,
``anomalous'' mesonic couplings do. This is verified by explicit calculations
in a low temperature expansion, and near the chiral phase transition.
