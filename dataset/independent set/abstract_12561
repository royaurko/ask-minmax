Recently, a BCJ dual of the color-ordered formula for Yang-Mills amplitude
was proposed, where the dual-trace factor satisfies cyclic symmetry and
KK-relation. In this paper, we present a systematic construction of the
dual-trace factor based on its proposed relations to kinematic numerators in
dual-DDM form. We show that the construction presented respects relabeling
symmetry. In addition, we show that using relabeling symmetry as conditions,
the same construction can be solved independently.
