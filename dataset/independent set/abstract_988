The Lorentzian AdS/CFT correspondence implies a map between local operators
in supergravity and non-local operators in the CFT. By explicit computation we
construct CFT operators which are dual to local bulk fields in the
semiclassical limit. The computation is done for general dimension in global,
Poincare and Rindler coordinates. We find that the CFT operators can be taken
to have compact support in a region of the complexified boundary whose size is
set by the bulk radial position. We show that at finite N the number of
independent commuting operators localized within a bulk volume saturates the
holographic bound.
