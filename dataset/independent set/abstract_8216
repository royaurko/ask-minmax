Delone sets of finite local complexity in Euclidean space are investigated.
We show that such a set has patch counting and topological entropy 0 if it has
uniform cluster frequencies and is pure point diffractive. We also note that
the patch counting entropy is 0 whenever the repetitivity function satisfies a
certain growth restriction.
