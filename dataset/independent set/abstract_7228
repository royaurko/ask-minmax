Korner and Marton established the capacity region for the 2-receiver
broadcast channel with degraded message sets. Recent results and conjectures
suggest that a straightforward extension of the Korner-Marton region to more
than 2 receivers is optimal. This paper shows that this is not the case. We
establish the capacity region for a class of 3-receiver broadcast channels with
2 degraded message sets and show that it can be strictly larger than the
straightforward extension of the Korner-Marton region. The key new idea is
indirect decoding, whereby a receiver who cannot directly decode a cloud
center, finds it indirectly by decoding satellite codewords. This idea is then
used to establish new inner and outer bounds on the capacity region of the
general 3-receiver broadcast channel with 2 and 3 degraded message sets. We
show that these bounds are tight for some nontrivial cases. The results suggest
that the capacity of the 3-receiver broadcast channel with degraded message
sets is as at least as hard to find as the capacity of the general 2-receiver
broadcast channel with common and private message.
