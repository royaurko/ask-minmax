We consider a geometric property of the closest-points projection to a
geodesic in Teichm\"uller space: the projection is called contracting if
arbitrarily large balls away from the geodesic project to sets of bounded
diameter. (This property always holds in negatively curved spaces.) It is
shown here to hold if and only if the geodesic is precompact, i.e. its image
in the moduli space is contained in a compact set. Some applications are
given, e.g. to stability properties of certain quasi-geodesics in
Teichm\"uller space, and to estimates of translation distance for
pseudo-Anosov maps.
