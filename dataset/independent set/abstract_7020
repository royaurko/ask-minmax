Topologically ordered systems in the presence of symmetries can exhibit new
structures which are referred to as symmetry enriched topological (SET) phases.
We introduce simple methods to detect the SET order directly from a complete
set of topologically degenerate ground state wave functions. In particular, we
first show how to directly determine the characteristic symmetry
fractionalization of the quasiparticles from the reduced density matrix of the
minimally entangled states. Second, we show how a simple generalization of a
non-local order parameter can be measured to detect SETs. The usefulness of the
proposed approached is demonstrated by examining two concrete model states
which exhibit SET: (i) a spin-1 model on the honeycomb lattice and (ii) the
resonating valence bond state on a kagome lattice. We conclude that the spin-1
model and the RVB state are in the same SET phases.
