A set is low if A' \le_T HALT. A set is superlow if A' \le_tt HALT. A set is
superduperlow if A' \le_btt HALT. While it was known that any superduperlow is
decidable it does not seem to be well known. We include two unpublished proofs
of this result: One from Carl Jockush and one from Frank Stephan.
