In this Snowmass whitepaper, we describe the impact of ongoing and proposed
intensity frontier experiments on the parameter space of the Minimally
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). We extend a set of phenomenological MSSM
(pMSSM) models to include non-zero CP-violating phases and study the
sensitivity of various flavor observables in these scenarios Future electric
dipole moment and rare meson decay experiments can have a strong impact on the
viability of these models that is relatively independent of the detailed
superpartner spectrum. In particular, we find that these experiments have the
potential to probe models that are expected to escape searches at the
high-luminosity LHC.
