The string one loop renormalization of the gauge coupling constants is
examined in abelian orbifold models. The contributions to string threshold
corrections independent of the compactification moduli fields are evaluated
numerically for several representative examples of orbifold models. We consider
cases with standard and non-standard embeddings as well as cases with discrete
Wilson lines background fields which match reasonably well with low energy
phenomenology. We examine one loop gauge coupling constants unification in a
description incorporating the combined effects of moduli dependent and
independent threshold corrections, an adjustable Kac-Moody level for the
hypercharge group factor and a large mass threshold associated with an
anomalous $U(1)$ mechanism.
