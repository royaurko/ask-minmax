The elastic charge form factors of the pion, kaon, D- and B-mesons are
calculated within a relativistic constituent quark model formulated on the
light-cone. Our parameter free predictions agree well with the available data.
The results are approximately independent of the assumed form of the light-cone
wave function, in particular they do not depend on the high momentum tail of
the wave function for energies accessible to present experiments.
