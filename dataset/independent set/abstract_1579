Let G be a profinite group which is topologically finitely generated, p a
prime number and d an integer. We show that the functor from rigid analytic
spaces over Q_p to sets, which associates to a rigid space Y the set of
continuous d-dimensional pseudocharacters G -> O(Y), is representable by a
quasi-Stein rigid analytic space X, and we study its general properties. Our
main tool is a theory of "determinants" extending the one of pseudocharacters
but which works over an arbitrary base ring; an independent aim of this paper
is to expose the main facts of this theory. The moduli space X is constructed
as the generic fiber of the moduli formal scheme of continuous formal
determinants on G of dimension d. As an application to number theory, this
provides a framework to study the generic fibers of pseudodeformation rings
(e.g. of Galois representations), especially in the "residually reducible"
case, and including when p <= d.
