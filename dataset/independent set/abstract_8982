We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for an algebraic set in a
group to have a fully characteristic radical. As a result, we see that if the
radical of a system of equation $S$ over a group $G$ is fully characteristic,
then there exists a class $\mathfrak{X}$ of subgroups of $G$ such that elements
of $S$ are identities of $\mathfrak{X}$.
