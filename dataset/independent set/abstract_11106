We derive the asymptotic traveling-wave solutions of the nonlinear
1-dimensional Balitsky-Kovchegov QCD equation for rapidity evolution in
momentum-space, with 1-loop running coupling constant and equipped with the
Balitsky-Kovchegov-Kuraev-Lipatov kernel at next-to-leading logarithmic
accuracy, conveniently regularized by different resummation schemes. Traveling
waves allow to define "universality classes" of asymptotic solutions, i.e.
independent of initial conditions and of the nonlinear damping. A dependence on
the resummation scheme remains, which is analyzed in terms of geometric scaling
properties.
