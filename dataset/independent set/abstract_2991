We study the phenomenology of same sign top pair production at the LHC in a
model-independent way. The complete set of dimension six operators involving
two top (or anti-top) quarks is introduced and the connection with all possible
t- or s-channel particle exchanges is established. Only in the former case,
same and opposite sign top pair production can be related. We find that while
current Tevatron data disfavor t-channel models, other production mechanisms
are viable and can be tested at the LHC.
