A rather general ergodic type scheme is presented on arbitrary sets X, as
they are generated by arbitrary mappings T : X \longrightarrow X. The
structures considered on X are given by suitable subsets of the set of all of
its finite partitions. Ergodicity is studied not with respect to subsets of X,
but with the {\it inverse limits} of families of finite partitions.
