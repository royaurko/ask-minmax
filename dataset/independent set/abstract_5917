We calculate the energy and the condensate fraction of a system of trapped
bosons interacting via a short-range two-body potential with positive
scattering length. The potential is attractive and has a two-body bound state.
When the scattering length is small compared to the trap length the system is
model independent: all potential models -- attractive, repulsive and zero-range
-- provide similar results. When the scattering length is large the attractive
model differs qualitatively from the repulsive and zero-range models. In this
regime the system with attractive potential becomes independent of the
scattering length, with both the energy and the condensate fraction converging
towards finite constants.
