We propose and analyze a two-level method for mimetic finite difference
approximations of second order elliptic boundary value problems. We prove that
the two-level algorithm is uniformly convergent, i.e., the number of iterations
needed to achieve convergence is uniformly bounded independently of the
characteristic size of the underling partition. We also show that the resulting
scheme provides a uniform preconditioner with respect to the number of degrees
of freedom. Numerical results that validate the theory are also presented.
