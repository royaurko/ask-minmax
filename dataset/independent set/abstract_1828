The theoretical evaluations of the Red Giant Branch Tip (TRGB) luminosity
presented in Salaris & Cassisi (1997) are extended to higher metallicities, and
compared with analogous independent results recently published. The comparison
between our ZAHB and TRGB distance scales for galactic globular clusters
presented in Salaris & Cassisi (1997) is now supplemented with a comparison
with the HIPPARCOS distance scale set by local subdwarfs with accurate parallax
determinations. The overall agreement between ZAHB and HIPPARCOS distances is
quite good. The ZAHB and TRGB distances to resolved galaxies are in good
agreement, whereas the comparison between TRGB and Cepheid distances, computed
by using the calibration suggested by Madore & Freedman (1991), reveals a
systematic discrepancy of the order of 0.12 mag. The TRGB distances are
systematically longer in comparison with the Cepheid ones. This result supports
the case for a revision of the zero point of the Cepheid distance scale, as
already suggested by other contributors on the basis of HIPPARCOS parallaxes. The
application of our TRGB distance scale to NGC3379, provides a new distance to
the Leo I group, which coupled with recent independent determinations of the
distance Coma cluster-Leo I, provides a determination of H_0 at the Coma
cluster in the range: H_0= 60+-11 Km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}.
