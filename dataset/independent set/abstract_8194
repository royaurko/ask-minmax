We prove that if $G$ is a graph and $r_1, ..., r_k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$
such that $\sum_{i=1}^k r_i \geq \Delta(G) + 2 - k$ then $V(G)$ can be
partitioned into sets $V_1, ..., V_k$ such that $\Delta(G[V_i]) \leq r_i$ and
$G[V_i]$ contains no non-complete $r_i$-regular components for each $1 \leq i
\leq k$. In particular, the vertex set of any graph $G$ can be partitioned into
$\left \lceil \frac{\Delta(G) + 2}{3} \right \rceil$ sets, each of which
induces a disjoint union of triangles and paths.
