In this paper another class of Dark Matter candidate particles: the
pseudoscalar and scalar light bosonic candidates, is discussed. Particular care
is devoted to the study of the processes for their detection (which only
involves electrons and photons/X-rays) in a suitable underground experimental
set-up. For this purpose the needed calculations are developed and various
related aspects and phenomenologies are discussed. In particular, it is shown
that - in addition to the WIMP cases already discussed elsewhere - there is
also possibility for a bosonic candidate to account for the 6.3 sigma C.L.
model independent evidence for the presence of a particle DM component in the
galactic halo observed by DAMA/NaI. Allowed regions in these scenarios are
presented also paying particular care on the cosmological interest of the
bosonic candidate.
