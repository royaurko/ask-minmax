Hadronic decays of Higgs bosons, not necessarily into b-quarks, have been
searched for using data collected at LEP-2. Such searches are complementary to
the usual Standard Model Higgs searches and lead to more model-independence.
Preliminary results obtained by the four LEP collaborations are presented for
the hZ production mechanism (using the q-qbarq-qbar, q-qbarnu-nubar and
q-qbarl+l- channels) and combined for the first time.
