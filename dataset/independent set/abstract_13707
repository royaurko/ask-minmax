We prove the following theorem: For a partially ordered set Q such that every
countable subset has a strict upper bound, there is a forcing notion satisfying
ccc such that, in the forcing model, there is a basis of the meager ideal of
the real line which is order-isomorphic to Q with respect to set-inclusion.
This is a variation of Hechler's classical result in the theory of forcing.
