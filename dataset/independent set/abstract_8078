We prove an extension results for the multiplier of an attracting periodic
orbit of a quadratic map as a function of the parameter. This has applications
to the problem of geometry of the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. In particular, we
prove that the size of p/q-limb of a hyperbolic component of the Mandelbrot set
of period n is O(4^n/p), and give an explicit condition on internal arguments
under which the Julia set of corresponding (unique) infinitely renormalizable
quadratic polynomial is not locally connected
