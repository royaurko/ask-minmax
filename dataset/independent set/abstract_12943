In this paper we have used simulations to make a conjecture about the
coverage of a $t$ dimensional subspace of a $d$ dimensional parameter space of
size $n$ when performing $k$ trials of Latin Hypercube sampling. This takes the
form $P(k,n,d,t)=1-e^{-k/n^{t-1}}$. We suggest that this coverage formula is
independent of $d$ and this allows us to make connections between building
Populations of Models and Experimental Designs. We also show that Orthogonal
sampling is superior to Latin Hypercube sampling in terms of allowing a more
uniform coverage of the $t$ dimensional subspace at the sub-block size level.
