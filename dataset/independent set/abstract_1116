We introduce systematically with the help of Weyl operators novel classes of
multipartite and multidimensional states which are all bound entangled for
arbitrary dimension. We find that the entanglement is bound due to different
reasons: unlockable due to the multi--particle nature and some states are in
addition bound due the fact being positive under partial transposition (PPT).
By a general construction (W simplices) we obtain classes of states which have
the same geometry concerning separability and entanglement independent of the
number of involved particle pairs. Moreover, we introduce a distillation
protocol and demonstrate for d=3 that for a certain set of states the
entanglement can be increased only up to a certain amount.
