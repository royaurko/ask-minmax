We consider the localization of independent electron orbitals in double-layer
two-dimensional electron systems in the strong magnetic field limit. Our study
is based on numerical Thouless number calculations for realistic microscopic
models and on transfer matrix calculations for phenomenological network models.
The microscopic calculations indicate a crossover regime for weak interlayer
tunneling in which the correlation length exponent appears to increase.
Comparison of network model calculations with microscopic calculations casts
doubt on their generic applicability.
