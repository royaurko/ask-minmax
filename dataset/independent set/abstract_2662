In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the covariation of two
diffusion processes when observations are subject to non-synchronicity.
Building on recent papers \cite{Hay-Yos03, Hay-Yos04}, we derive second-order
asymptotic expansions for the distribution of the Hayashi-Yoshida estimator in
a fairly general setup including random sampling schemes and non-anticipative
random drifts. The key steps leading to our results are a second-order
decomposition of the estimator's distribution in the Gaussian set-up, a
stochastic decomposition of the estimator itself and an accurate evaluation of
the Malliavin covariance. To give a concrete example, we compute the constants
involved in the resulting expansions for the particular case of sampling scheme
generated by two independent Poisson processes.
