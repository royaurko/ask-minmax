The Schroedinger functional provides a valuable tool to perform
non-perturbative renormalization on the lattice, in particular in a mass
independent scheme. We study two different types of chirally rotated
Schroedinger functional boundary conditions which have been recently proposed
to retain the bulk automatic O(a) improvement of massless Wilson fermions in
finite volume. We investigate the spectral properties and the quark propagators
which derive from these two proposals in the continuum at tree-level of
perturbation theory.
