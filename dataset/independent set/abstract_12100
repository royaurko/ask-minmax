We find through computer simulations that the fractional volume change on
freezing of polydisperse Lennard-Jones liquid decreases with increasing
polydispersity and approaches zero near a terminal polydispersity of 0.11,
independent of temperature. The transition however remains first order at
terminal polydispersity. Average inherent structure (IS) energy of the
crystalline phase increases nearly quadratically with polydispersity indices
({\delta}) and marked by a crossover to nearly constant IS energy in the
amorphous phase.
