We define and study a correspondence between the set of distinguished
G^0-conjugacy classes in a fixed connected component of a reductive group G
(with G^0 almost simple) and the set of (twisted) elliptic conjugacy classes in
the Weyl group. We also prove a homogeneity property related to this
correspondence.
