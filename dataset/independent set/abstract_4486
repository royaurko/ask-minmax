Three independent searches for an electric dipole moment (EDM) of the
positive and negative muons have been performed, using spin precession data
from the muon g-2 storage ring at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Details on
the experimental apparatus and the three analyses are presented. Since the
individual results on the positive and negative muon, as well as the combined
result, d=-0.1(0.9)E-19 e-cm, are all consistent with zero, we set a new muon
EDM limit, |d| < 1.9E-19 e-cm (95% C.L.). This represents a factor of 5
improvement over the previous best limit on the muon EDM.
