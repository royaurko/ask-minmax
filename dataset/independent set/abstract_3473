For a group $H$ and a subset $X$ of $H$, we let ${}^HX$ denote the set
$\{hxh^{-1} \mid h \in H, x \in X\}$, and when $X$ is a free-generating set of
$H$, we say that the set ${}^HX$ is a Whitehead subset of $H$.
  For a group $F$ and an element $r$ of $F$, we say that $r$ is Cohen-Lyndon
aspherical in $F$ if ${}^F\{r\}$ is a Whitehead subset of the subgroup of $F$
that is generated by ${}^F\{r\}$.
  In 1963, D. E. Cohen and R. C. Lyndon independently showed that in each free
group each non-trivial element is Cohen-Lyndon aspherical.
  In 1987, M. Edjvet and J. Howie showed that if $A$ and $B$ are locally
indicable groups, then each cyclically reduced element of $A \ast B$ that does
not lie in $A \cup B$ is Cohen-Lyndon aspherical in $A \ast B$.
  Using Bass-Serre Theory and the Edjvet-Howie Theorem, one can deduce the
local-indicability Cohen-Lyndon Theorem: if $F$ is a locally indicable group
and $T$ is an $F$-tree with trivial edge stabilizers, then each element of $F$
that fixes no vertex of $T$ is Cohen-Lyndon aspherical in $F$. Conversely, the
Cohen-Lyndon Theorem and the Edjvet-Howie Theorem are immediate consequences of
the local-indicability Cohen-Lyndon Theorem.
  In this article, we give a detailed review of Howie induction and arrange the
arguments of Edjvet and Howie into a Howie-inductive proof of the
local-indicability Cohen-Lyndon Theorem that does not use Magnus induction or
the Cohen-Lyndon Theorem. We conclude with a review of some standard
applications of Cohen-Lyndon asphericity.
