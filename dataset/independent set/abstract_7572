This talk reviews recent developments in the use of large $N_c$ QCD in the
description of baryonic resonances. The emphasis is on the model-independent
nature of the approach. Key issues discussed include the spin-flavor symmetry
which emerges at large $N_c$ and the direct use of scattering observables. The
connection to quark model approaches is stressed.
