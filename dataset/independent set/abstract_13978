We show that it is possible to find maximal violations of the CHSH-Bell
inequality using only position measurements on a pair of entangled
non-relativistic free particles. The device settings required in the CHSH
inequality are done by choosing one of two times at which position is measured.
For different assignments of the "+" outcome to positions, namely to an
interval, to a half line, or to a periodic set, we determine violations of the
inequalities, and states where they are attained. These results have
consequences for the hidden variable theories of Bohm and Nelson, in which the
two-time correlations between distant particle trajectories have a joint
distribution, and hence cannot violate any Bell inequality.
