This paper studies the problem of detecting dependence between two mixture
distributions, motivated by questions arising from statistical genomics. The
fundamental limits of detecting weak positive dependence are derived and an
oracle test statistic is proposed. It is shown that for mixture distributions
whose components are stochastically ordered, the oracle test statistic is
asymptotically optimal. Connections are drawn between dependency detection and
signal detection, where the goal of the latter is to detect the presence of
non-null components in a single mixture distribution. It is shown that the
oracle test for dependency can also be used as a signal detection procedure in
the two-sample setting, and there can achieve detection even when detection
using each sample separately is provably impossible. A nonparametric
data-adaptive test statistic is then proposed, and its closed-form asymptotic
distribution under the null hypothesis of independence is established.
Simulations show that the adaptive procedure performs as well as the oracle
test statistic, and that both can be more powerful than existing methods. In an
application to the analysis of the shared genetic basis of psychiatric
disorders, the adaptive test is able to detect genetic relationships not
detected by other procedures.
