This paper presents a graphical method for comparing performance of Markov
Chain Monte Carlo methods. Most researchers present comparisons of MCMC methods
using tables of figures of merit; this paper presents a graphical alternative.
It first discusses the computation of autocorrelation time, then uses this to
construct a figure of merit, log density function evaluations per independent
observation. Then, it demonstrates how one can plot this figure of merit
against a tuning parameter in a grid of plots where columns represent sampling
methods and rows represent distributions. This type of visualization makes it
possible to convey a greater depth of information without overwhelming the user
with numbers, allowing researchers to put their contributions into a broader
context than is possible with a textual presentation.
