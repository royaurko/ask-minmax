The flavour independence hypothesis for (tensor) glueball decays into
exclusive final states is not ruled out by the existing data. A new methodology
for testing its validity and accuracy is proposed in the framework of a
particular mixing scheme. As an important consequence of our analysis, a
relative factor of the order of 10 must be experimentally observed for the
ratio $\Gamma (\Theta \rightarrow K\bar{K})\Gamma (\Theta \rightarrow \pi
\pi)$, if flavour independence indeed is valid.
