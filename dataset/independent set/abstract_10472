We present an experimental and theoretical study of row switching in
two-dimensional Josephson junction arrays. We have observed novel dynamic
states with peculiar percolative patterns of the voltage drop inside the
arrays. These states were directly visualized using laser scanning microscopy
and manifested by fine branching in the current-voltage characteristics of the
arrays. Numerical simulations show that such percolative patterns have an
intrinsic origin and occur independently of positional disorder. We argue that
the appearance of these dynamic states is due to the presence of various
metastable superconducting states in arrays.
