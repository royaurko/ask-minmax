The NAIAD experiment (NaI Advanced Detector) for WIMP dark matter searches at
Boulby mine (UK) is described. The detector consists of an array of
encapsulated and unencapsulated NaI(Tl) crystals with high light yield. Six
crystals are collecting data at present. Data accumulated by four of them (10.6
kg x year exposure) have been used to set upper limits on the WIMP-nucleon
spin-independent and WIMP-proton spin-dependent cross-sections. Pulse shape
analysis has been applied to discriminate between nuclear recoils, as may be
caused by WIMP interactions, and electron recoils due to gamma background.
Various calibrations of crystals are presented.
