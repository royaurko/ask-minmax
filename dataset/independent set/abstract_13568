The isophotal wavelengths, flux densities, and AB magnitudes for Vega (alpha
Lyr) are presented for the Mauna Kea Observatories near-infrared filter set. We
show that the near-infrared absolute calibration for Vega determined by Cohen
et al. and Megessier are consistent within the uncertainties, so that either
absolute calibration may be used.
