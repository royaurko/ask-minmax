Let 0<\alpha<1/2. We show that the mixing time of a continuous-time
reversible Markov chain on a finite state space is about as large as the
largest expected hitting time of a subset of stationary measure at least \alpha
of the state space. Suitably modified results hold in discrete time and/or
without the reversibility assumption. The key technical tool is a construction
of a random set A such that the hitting time of A is both light-tailed and a
stationary time for the chain. We note that essentially the same results were
obtained independently by Peres and Sousi [arXiv:1108.0133].
