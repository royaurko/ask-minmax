We establish a pre-order principle. From the principle, we obtain a very
general set-valued Ekeland variational principle, where the objective function
is a set-valued map taking values in a quasi ordered linear space and the
perturbation contains a family of set-valued maps satisfying certain property.
From this general set-valued Ekeland variational principle, we deduce a number
of particular versions of set-valued Ekeland variational principle, which
include many known Ekeland variational principles, their improvements and some
new results.
