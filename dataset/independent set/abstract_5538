Hereditarily finite sets (sets which are finite and have only hereditarily
finite sets as members) are basic mathematical and computational objects, and
also stand at the basis of some programming languages. This raises the need for
efficient representation of such sets, for example by numbers. In 2008, Kirby
proposed an adjunctive hierarchy of hereditarily finite sets, based on the fact
that they can also be seen as built up from the empty set by repeated
adjunction, that is, by the addition of a new single element drawn from the
already existing sets to an already existing set. Determining the cardinality
$a_n$ of each level of this hierarchy, problem crucial in establishing whether
the natural adjunctive hierarchy leads to an efficient encoding by numbers, was
left open.
  In this paper we solve this problem. Our results can be generalized to
hereditarily finite sets with atoms, or can be further refined by imposing
restrictions on rank, on cardinality, or on the maximum level from where the
new adjoined element can be drawn. We also show that $a_n$ satisfies the
asymptotic formula $a_n = C^{2^n} + O(C^{2^{n-1}})$, for a constant $C \approx
1.3399$, which is a too fast asymptotic growth for practical purposes. We thus
propose a very natural variant of the adjunctive hierarchy, whose asymptotic
behavior we prove to be $\Theta(2^n)$. To our knowledge, this is the first
result of this kind.
