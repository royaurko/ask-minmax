Similar to the associated Legendre functions, the differential equation for
the associated Bessel functions $B_{l,m}(x)$ is introduced so that its form
remains invariant under the transformation $l\rightarrow -l-1$. A Rodrigues
formula for the associated Bessel functions as squared integrable solutions in
both regions $l<0$ and $l\geq 0$ is presented. The functions with the same $m$
but with different positive and negative values of $l$ are not independent of
each other, while the functions with the same $l+m$ ($l-m$) but with different
values of $l$ and $m$ are independent of each other. So, all the functions
$B_{l,m}(x)$ may be taken into account as the union of the increasing
(decreasing) infinite sequences with respect to $l$. It is shown that two new
different types of exponential generating functions are attributed to the
associated Bessel functions corresponding to these rearranged sequences.
