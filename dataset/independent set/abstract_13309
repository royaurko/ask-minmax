A commonly used model for fault-tolerant computation is that of cellular
automata. The essential difficulty of fault-tolerant computation is present in
the special case of simply remembering a bit in the presence of faults, and
that is the case we treat in this paper. We are concerned with the degree (the
number of neighboring cells on which the state transition function depends)
needed to achieve fault tolerance when the fault rate is high (nearly 1/2). We
consider both the traditional transient fault model (where faults occur
independently in time and space) and a recently introduced combined fault model
which also includes manufacturing faults (which occur independently in space,
but which affect cells for all time). We also consider both a purely
probabilistic fault model (in which the states of cells are perturbed at
exactly the fault rate) and an adversarial model (in which the occurrence of a
fault gives control of the state to an omniscient adversary). We show that
there are cellular automata that can tolerate a fault rate $1/2 - \xi$ (with
$\xi>0$) with degree $O((1/\xi^2)\log(1/\xi))$, even with adversarial combined
faults. The simplest such automata are based on infinite regular trees, but our
results also apply to other structures (such as hyperbolic tessellations) that
contain infinite regular trees. We also obtain a lower bound of
$\Omega(1/\xi^2)$, even with purely probabilistic transient faults only.
