We use kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to investigate current fluctuations in
boundary driven generalized exclusion processes, in different dimensions.
Simulation results are in full agreement with predictions based on the
additivity principle and the macroscopic fluctuation theory. The current
statistics are independent of the shape of the contacts with the reservoirs,
provided they are macroscopic in size. In general, the current distribution
depends on the spatial dimension. For the special cases of the symmetric simple
exclusion process and the zero-range process, the current statistics are the
same for all spatial dimensions.
