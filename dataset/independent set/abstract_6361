A radiatively-corrected mixing angle has to be independent of the choice of
renormalization scale to be a physical observable. At one-loop in MS-bar, this
only occurs for a particular value, p*, of the external momentum in the
two-point functions used to define the mixing angle: p*^2=(M1^2+M2^2)/2, where
M1, M2 are the physical masses of the two mixed particles. We examine two
important applications of this to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model:
the mixing angle for a) neutral Higgs bosons and b) stops. We find that this
choice of external momentum improves the scale independence (and therefore
provides a more reliable determination) of these mixing angles.
