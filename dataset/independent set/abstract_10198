In a peer-to-peer inference system, each peer can reason locally but can also
solicit some of its acquaintances, which are peers sharing part of its
vocabulary. In this paper, we consider peer-to-peer inference systems in which
the local theory of each peer is a set of propositional clauses defined upon a
local vocabulary. An important characteristic of peer-to-peer inference systems
is that the global theory (the union of all peer theories) is not known (as
opposed to partition-based reasoning systems). The main contribution of this
paper is to provide the first consequence finding algorithm in a peer-to-peer
setting: DeCA. It is anytime and computes consequences gradually from the
solicited peer to peers that are more and more distant. We exhibit a sufficient
condition on the acquaintance graph of the peer-to-peer inference system for
guaranteeing the completeness of this algorithm. Another important contribution
is to apply this general distributed reasoning setting to the setting of the
Semantic Web through the Somewhere semantic peer-to-peer data management
system. The last contribution of this paper is to provide an experimental
analysis of the scalability of the peer-to-peer infrastructure that we propose,
on large networks of 1000 peers.
