In this paper we construct explicit sampling sets and present reconstruction
algorithms for Fourier signals on finite vector spaces $G$, with $|G|=p^r$ for
a suitable prime $p$. The two sets have sizes of order $O(pt^2r^2)$ and
$O(pt^2r^3\log(p))$ respectively, where $t$ is the number of large coefficients
in the Fourier transform. The algorithms approximate the function up to a small
constant of the best possible approximation with $t$ non-zero Fourier
coefficients. The fastest of the algorithms has complexity
$O(p^2t^2r^3\log(p))$.
