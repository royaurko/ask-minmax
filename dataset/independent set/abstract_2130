We study nonparametric estimation of an unknown density function $f$ based on
the ranked-based observations obtained from a partially rank-ordered set (PROS)
sampling design. PROS sampling design has many applications in environmental,
ecological and medical studies where the exact measurement of the variable of
interest is costly but a small number of sampling units can be ordered with
respect to the variable of interest by any means other than actual measurements
and this can be done at low cost. PROS observations involve independent order
statistics which are not identically distributed and most of the commonly used
nonparametric techniques are not directly applicable to them. We first develop
kernel density estimates of $f$ based on an imperfect PROS sampling procedure
and study its theoretical properties. Then, we consider the problem when the
underlying distribution is assumed to be symmetric and introduce some plug-in
kernel density estimators of $f$. We use an EM type algorithm to estimate
misplacement probabilities associated with an imperfect PROS design. Finally,
we expand on various numerical illustrations of our results via several
simulation studies and a case study to estimate the distribution of wheat yield
using the total acreage of land which is planted in wheat as an easily obtained
auxiliary information.
  Our results show that the PROS density estimate performs better than its SRS
and RSS counterparts.
