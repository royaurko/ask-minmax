Given a rational map of the Riemann sphere and a subset $A$ of its Julia set,
we study the $A$-exceptional set, that is, the set of points whose orbit does
not accumulate at $A$. We prove that if the Hausdorff dimension of $A$ is
smaller than the dynamical dimension of the system then the Hausdorff dimension
of the $A$-exceptional set is larger than or equal to the dynamical dimension,
with equality in the particular case when the map is expansive. Furthermore, if
the topological entropy of $A$ is less than the topological entropy of the full
system then the $A$-exceptional set has full topological entropy.
