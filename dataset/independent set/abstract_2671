The gauge invariance of the muonium-antimuonium ($M\bar{M}$) oscillation time
scale is explicitly demonstrated in the Standard Model modified only by the
inclusion of singlet right-handed neutrinos and allowing for general
renormalizable interactions. The see-saw mechanism is exploited resulting in
three light Majorana neutrinos and three heavy Majorana neutrinos with mass
scale $M_R\gg M_W$. The leading order matrix element contribution to the
$M\bar{M}$ oscillation process is computed in $R_\xi$ gauge and shown to be
$\xi$ independent thereby establishing the gauge invariance to this order.
Present experimental limits resulting from the non-observation of the
oscillation process sets a lower limit on $M_R$ roughly of order 600 GeV.
