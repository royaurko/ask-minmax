We have measured the electrical resistivity of a single strand of a
ferromagnetic Ni nanowire of diameter 55 nm using a 4-probe method in the
temperature range 3 K-300 K. The wire used is chemically pure and is a high
quality oriented single crystalline sample in which the temperature independent
residual resistivity is determined predominantly by surface scattering. Precise
evaluation of the temperature dependent resistivity ($\rho$) allowed us to
identify quantitatively the electron-phonon contribution (characterized by a
Debye temperature $\theta_R$) as well as the spin-wave contribution which is
significantly suppressed upon size reduction.
