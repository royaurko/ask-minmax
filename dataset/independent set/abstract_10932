Using the on-shell scheme and the general linear R_xi gauge we have
calculated the one-loop amplitude W+ -> u_I d_j. In agreement with previous
work we have shown that the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix ought to be
renormalized. We show how to renormalize the CKM matrix and, at the same time,
obtain a gauge independent W decay amplitude.
