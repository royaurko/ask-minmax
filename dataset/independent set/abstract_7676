We prove a formula for Thom polynomials of Morin (or A_d) singularities in
any codimension. We use a combination of the test-curve method of Porteous, and
the localization methods in equivariant cohomology. Our formulas are
independent of the codimension, and they are computationally efficient for d
less than 7.
