To a function with values in the power set of a pre-ordered, separated
locally convex space a family of scalarizations is given which completely
characterizes the original function. A concept of a Legendre-Fenchel conjugate
for set-valued functions is introduced and identified with the conjugates of
the scalarizations. Using this conjugate, weak and strong duality results are
proven.
