An overview of non-directional direct detection methods is given. The
currently leading experiments for spin independent WIMPs interactions are using
simultaneous measurement of two quantities for event-by-event background
discrimination in cryogenic bolometers and noble gas like xenon. Besides these,
several interesting techniques have been developped, each having a specific
advantage concerning e.g energy threshold lowering or strong immunity to
ionizing radiations background. Technologies used and most recent results about
spin-dependent and spin-independent cases are presented.
