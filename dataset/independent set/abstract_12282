A model of two-component relativistic fluid is considered, and the thermal
nature of coupling between the fluid constituents is outlined. This thermal
coupling is responsible for non-ideality of the fluid composite where the
components are not fully independent. The interaction between particles is
reflected only in the equation of state of each component, but it deals nothing
with the coupling between the fluid components and does not influence the
hydrodynamic motion. A general form of two-fluid decomposition is formulated
for arbitrary interacting system.
