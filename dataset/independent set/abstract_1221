We consider a spectrally-negative Markov additive process as a model of a
risk process in random environment. Following recent interest in alternative
ruin concepts, we assume that ruin occurs when an independent Poissonian
observer sees the process negative, where the observation rate may depend on
the state of the environment. Using an approximation argument and spectral
theory we establish an explicit formula for the resulting survival
probabilities in this general setting.
  We also discuss an efficient evaluation of the involved quantities and
provide a numerical illustration.
