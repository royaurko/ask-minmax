We introduce the concept of escaping set for semigroups of transcendental
entire functions using Fatou-Julia theory. Several results of the escaping set
associated with the iteration of one transcendental entire function have been
extended to transcendental semigroups. We also investigate the properties of
escaping sets for conjugate semigroups and abelian transcendental semigroups.
Several classes of transcendental semigroups for which Eremenko's conjectures
hold have been provided.
