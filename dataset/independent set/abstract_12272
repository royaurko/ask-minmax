Harmonic theory provides a mathematical framework to describe the structure,
behavior, evolution and emergence of harmonic systems. A harmonic system is
context aware, contains elements that manifest characteristics either
collaboratively or independently according to system's expression and can
interact with its environment. This theory provides a fresh way to analyze
emergence and collaboration of "ad-hoc" and complex systems.
