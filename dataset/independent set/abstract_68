Answering several questions of Duffus, Frankl and R\"odl, we give asymptotics
for the logarithms of (i) the number of maximal antichains in the n-dimensional
Boolean algebra and (ii) the numbers of maximal independent sets in the
covering graph of the n-dimensional hypercube and certain natural subgraphs
thereof. The results in (ii) are implied by more general upper bounds on the
numbers of maximal independent sets in regular and biregular graphs. We also
mention some stronger possibilities involving actual rather than logarithmic
asymptotics.
