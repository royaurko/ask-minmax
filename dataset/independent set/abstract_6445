A point (x1, x2) with coordinates in a subfield of R of transcendence degree
one over Q, with 1, x1, x2 linearly independent over Q, may have a uniform
exponent of approximation by elements of Q^2 that is strictly larger than the
lower bound 1/2 given by Dirichlet's box principle. This appeared as a
surprise, in connection to work of Davenport and Schmidt, for points of the
parabola {(x, x^2) ; x in R}. The goal of this paper is to show that this
phenomenon extends to all real conics defined over Q, and that the largest
exponent of approximation achieved by points of these curves satisfying the
above condition of linear independence is always the same, independently of the
curve, namely 1/g \approx 0.618 where g denotes the golden ratio.
