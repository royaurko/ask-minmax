We firstly present definitions and properties in study of Maji
\cite{maji-2013} on neutrosophic soft sets. We then give a few notes on his
study. Next, based on \c{C}a\u{g}man \cite{cagman-2014}, we redefine the notion
of neutrosophic soft set and neutrosophic soft set operations to make more
functional. By using these new definitions we construct a decision making
method and a group decision making method which selects a set of optimum
elements from the alternatives. We finally present examples which shows that
the methods can be successfully applied to many problems that contain
uncertainties.
