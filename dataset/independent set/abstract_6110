New set-theoretical solutions to the Yang-Baxter Relation are constructed.
These solutions arise from the decompositions "in different order" of matrix
polynomials and $\theta$-functions. We also construct a "local action of the
symmetric group" in these cases, generalizations of the action of the symmetric
group $S_N$ given by the set-theoretical solution.
