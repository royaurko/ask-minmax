In this work we present the concept of tame $C$-semianalytic subset of a real
analytic manifold $M$ and study the main properties of this type of sets. Tame
$C$-semianalytic sets can be understood as globally defined semianalytic sets
with a neat behavior with respect to Zariski closure. This fact allows us to
develop a natural definition of irreducibility and the corresponding theory of
irreducible components for tame $C$-semianalytic sets. These concepts
generalize the parallel ones for: complex algebraic and analytic sets,
$C$-analytic sets, Nash sets and semialgebraic sets.
