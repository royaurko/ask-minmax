The covariant technique for calculating the heat kernel asymptotic expansion
for an elliptic differential second order operator is generalized to manifolds
with boundary. The first boundary coefficients of the asymptotic expansion
which are proportional to $t^{1/2}$ and $t^{3/2}$ are calculated. Our results
coincide with completely independent results of previous contributors.
