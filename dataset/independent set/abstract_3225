I demonstrate that the chart based approach to the study of the global
structure of Lorentzian manifolds induces a homeomorphism of the manifold into
a topological space as an open dense set. The topological boundary of this
homeomorphism is a chart independent boundary of ideal points equipped with a
topological structure and a physically motivated classification. I show that
this new boundary contains all other boundaries that can be presented as the
topological boundary of an envelopment. Hence, in particular, it is a
generalisation of Penrose's conformal boundary. I provide three detailed
examples: the conformal compactification of Minkowski spacetime, Scott and
Szekeres' analysis of the Curzon singularity and Beyer and Hennig's analysis of
smooth Gowdy symmetric generalised Taub-NUT spacetimes.
