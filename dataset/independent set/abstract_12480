In this article, for the radiative transport equation, we study inverse
problems of determining a time independent scattering coefficient or total
attenuation by boundary data on the complementary sub-boundary after making one
time input of a pair of a positive initial value and boundary data on a
suitable sub-boundary. The main results are Lipschitz stability estimates. We
can also prove the reverse inequality, which means that our estimates for the
inverse problems are the best possible. The proof is based on a Carleman
estimate with a linear weight function.
