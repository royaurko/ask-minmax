In this paper, we study an asynchronous randomized gossip algorithm under
unreliable communication. At each instance, two nodes are selected to meet with
a given probability. When nodes meet, two unreliable communication links are
established with communication in each direction succeeding with a time-varying
probability. It is shown that two particularly interesting cases arise when
these communication processes are either perfectly dependent or independent.
Necessary and sufficient conditions on the success probability sequence are
proposed to ensure almost sure consensus or $\epsilon$-consensus. Weak
connectivity is required when the communication is perfectly dependent, while
double connectivity is required when the communication is independent.
Moreover, it is proven that with odd number of nodes, average preserving turns
from almost forever (with probability one for all initial conditions) for
perfectly dependent communication, to almost never (with probability zero for
almost all initial conditions) for the independent case. This average
preserving property does not hold true for general number of nodes. These
results indicate the fundamental role the node interactions have in randomized
gossip algorithms.
