We study the existence of SRB measures of C 2 diffeomorphisms for attractors
whose bundles admit Holder continuous invariant (non-dominated) splittings. We
prove the existence when one subbundle has the non-uniform expanding property
on a set with positive Lebesgue measure and the other subbundle admits
non-positive Lyapunov exponents on a total probability set.
