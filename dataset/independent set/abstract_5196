The paper contains two results pointing to the lack of symmetry between
measure and category.
  Assume CH. There exists a strongly meager subset of the Cantor set that can
be mapped onto the Cantor set by a uniformly continuous function. (It is well
known that uniformly continuous image of a strongly null set is strongly null).
  A ZFC version of this result is also given.
