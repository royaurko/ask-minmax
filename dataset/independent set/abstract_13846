We report the first experimental test of an analytic image reconstruction
algorithm for optical tomography with large data sets. Using a continuous-wave
optical tomography system with 10^8 source-detector pairs, we demonstrate the
reconstruction of an absorption image of a phantom consisting of a
highly-scattering medium with absorbing inhomogeneities.
