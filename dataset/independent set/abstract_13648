A sequence of functions f_n: X -> R from a Baire space X to the reals is said
to converge in category iff every subsequence has a subsequence which converges
on all but a meager set. We show that if there exists a Souslin Tree then there
exists a nonatomic Baire space X such that every sequence which converge in
category converges everywhere on a comeager set. This answers a question of
Wagner and Wilczynski, Convergence of sequences of measurable functions, Acta
Math Acad Sci Hung 36(1980), 125-128.
