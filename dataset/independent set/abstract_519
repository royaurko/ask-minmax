Two independent groups (Giveon et al. 2002; Martin-Hernandez et al. 2002)
have recently investigated the Galactic metallicity gradient as probed by ISO
observations of mid-infrared emission lines from HII regions. We show that the
different gradients inferred by the two groups are due to differing source
selection and differing extinction corrections. We show that both data sets in
fact provide consistent results if identical assumptions are made in the
analysis. We present a consistent set of gradients in which we account for
extinction and variation in electron temperature across the disk.
