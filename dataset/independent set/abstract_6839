Families $\mathcal{A}_1, \mathcal{A}_2, ..., \mathcal{A}_k$ of sets are said
to be \emph{cross-intersecting} if for any $i$ and $j$ in $\{1, 2, ..., k\}$
with $i \neq j$, any set in $\mathcal{A}_i$ intersects any set in
$\mathcal{A}_j$. For a finite set $X$, let $2^X$ denote the \emph{power set of
$X$} (the family of all subsets of $X$). A family $\mathcal{H}$ is said to be
\emph{hereditary} if all subsets of any set in $\mathcal{H}$ are in
$\mathcal{H}$; so $\mathcal{H}$ is hereditary if and only if it is a union of
power sets. We conjecture that for any non-empty hereditary sub-family
$\mathcal{H} \neq \{\emptyset\}$ of $2^X$ and any $k \geq |X|+1$, both the sum
and product of sizes of $k$ cross-intersecting sub-families $\mathcal{A}_1,
\mathcal{A}_2, ..., \mathcal{A}_k$ (not necessarily distinct or non-empty) of
$\mathcal{H}$ are maxima if $\mathcal{A}_1 = \mathcal{A}_2 = ... =
\mathcal{A}_k = \mathcal{S}$ for some largest \emph{star $\mathcal{S}$ of
$\mathcal{H}$} (a sub-family of $\mathcal{H}$ whose sets have a common
element). We prove this for the case when $\mathcal{H}$ is \emph{compressed
with respect to an element $x$ of $X$}, and for this purpose we establish new
properties of the usual \emph{compression operation}. For the product, we
actually conjecture that the configuration $\mathcal{A}_1 = \mathcal{A}_2 = ...
= \mathcal{A}_k = \mathcal{S}$ is optimal for any hereditary $\mathcal{H}$ and
any $k \geq 2$, and we prove this for a special case too.
