We introduce an extension of the propositional calculus to include abstracts
of predicates and quantifiers, employing a single rule along with a novel
comprehension schema and a principle of extensionality, which are substituted
for the Bernays postulates for quantifiers and the comprehension schemata of ZF
and other set theories. We prove that it is consistent in any finite Boolean
subset lattice. We investigate the antinomies of Russell, Cantor, Burali-Forti,
and others, and discuss the relationship of the system to other set theoretic
systems ZF, NBG, and NF. We discuss two methods of axiomatizing higher order
quantification and abstraction, and then very briefly discuss the application
of one of these methods to areas of mathematics outside of logic.
