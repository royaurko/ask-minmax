Let G be a unipotent algebraic subgroup of some GL_m(C) defined over Q. We
describe an algorithm for finding a finite set of generators of the subgroup
G(Z) = G \cap GL_m(Z). This is based on a new proof of the result (in more
general form due to Borel and Harish-Chandra) that such a finite generating set
exists.
