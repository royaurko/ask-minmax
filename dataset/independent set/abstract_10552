In this modification of the Sznajd consensus model on the square lattice, two
people of arbitrary distance who agree in their opinions convince their nearest
neighbours of this opinion. Similarly to the mean field theory of Slanina and
Lavicka, the times needed to reach consensus are distributed exponentially and
are quite small. The width of the phase transition vanishes reciprocally to the
linear lattice dimension. Advertising has effects independent of the system
size. For more than two opinions, three opinions reach a consensus in roughly
half of the samples, and four only rarely and only for small lattices.
