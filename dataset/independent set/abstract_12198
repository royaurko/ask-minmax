We show that the rare events present in dissipated work that enters Jarzynski
equality, when mapped appropriately to the phenomenon of large deviations found
in a biased coin toss, are enough to yield a quantitative work probability
distribution for Jarzynski equality. This allows us to propose a recipe for
constructing work probability distribution independent of the details of any
relevant system. The underlying framework, developed herein, is expected to be
of use in modelling other physical phenomena where rare events play an
important role.
