In this survey paper we present the $L$--moves between braids and how they
can adapt and serve for establishing and proving braid equivalence theorems for
various diagrammatic settings, such as for classical knots, for knots in knot
complements, in c.c.o. 3--manifolds and in handlebodies, as well as for virtual
knots, for flat virtuals, for welded knots and for singular knots. The
$L$--moves are local and they provide a uniform ground for formulating and
proving braid equivalence theorems for any diagrammatic setting where the
notion of braid and diagrammatic isotopy is defined, the statements being first
geometric and then algebraic.
