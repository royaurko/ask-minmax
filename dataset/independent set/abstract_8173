autoScale.py is a program that performs an automatic finite-size scaling
analysis for given sets of simulated data. It implements a quite general
scaling assumption and optimizes an initial set of scaling parameters that
enforce a data collapse of the different data sets. The presented guide
describes how the program works, it presents a detailed example and finally
gives some hints on how to improve the results of a scaling analysis.
