Starting from a sequence of independent Wright-Fisher diffusion processes on
$[0,1]$, we construct a class of reversible infinite dimensional diffusion
processes on $\DD_\infty:= \{{\bf x}\in
  Let $M$ be a complete Riemnnian manifold and $\mu$ the distribution of the
diffusion process generated by $\ff 1 2\DD+Z$ where $Z$ is a $C^1$-vector
field. When $\Ric-\nn Z$ is bounded below and $Z$ has, for instance, linear
growth, the transportation-cost inequality with respect to the uniform distance
is established for $\mu$ on the path space over $M$. A simple example is given
to show the optimality of the condition.
