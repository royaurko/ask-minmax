For a locally convex vector space (l.c.v.s.) $E$ and an absolutely convex
neighborhood $V$ of zero, a bounded subset $A$ of $E$ is said to be
$V$-dentable (respectively, $V$-f-dentable) if for any $\epsilon>0$ there
exists an $x\in A$ so that $$x\notin \bar{co} (A\setminus (x+\epsilon V)) $$
(respectively, so that $$ x\notin {co} (A\setminus (x+\epsilon V))). $$ Here,
"$\bar{co}$" denotes the closure in $E$ of the convex hull of a set. We present
a theorem which says that for a wide class of bounded subsets $B$ of locally
convex vector spaces the following is true: $(V)$ every subset of $B$ is
$V$-dentable if and only if every subset of $B$ is $V$-f-dentable. The proof is
purely geometrical and independent of any related facts. As a consequence (in
the particular case where $B$ is complete convex bounded metrizable subset of a
l.c.v.s.), we obtain a positive solution to a 1978-hypothesis of Elias Saab
(see p. 290 in "On the Radon-Nikodym property in a class of locally convex
spaces", Pacific J. Math. 75, No. 1, 1978, 281-291).
