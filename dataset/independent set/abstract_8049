We find the primitive integer solutions to x^2+y^3=z^7. A nonabelian descent
argument involving the simple group of order 168 reduces the problem to the
determination of the set of rational points on a finite set of twists of the
Klein quartic curve X. To restrict the set of relevant twists, we exploit the
isomorphism between X and the modular curve X(7), and use modularity of
elliptic curves and level lowering. This leaves 10 genus-3 curves, whose
rational points are found by a combination of methods.
