This document reviews the definition of the kernel distance, providing a
gentle introduction tailored to a reader with background in theoretical
computer science, but limited exposure to technology more common to machine
learning, functional analysis and geometric measure theory. The key aspect of
the kernel distance developed here is its interpretation as an L_2 distance
between probability measures or various shapes (e.g. point sets, curves,
surfaces) embedded in a vector space (specifically an RKHS). This structure
enables several elegant and efficient solutions to data analysis problems. We
conclude with a glimpse into the mathematical underpinnings of this measure,
highlighting its recent independent evolution in two separate fields.
