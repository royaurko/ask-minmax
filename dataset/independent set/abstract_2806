During the September-October 2008 outburst of the accreting millisecond
pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658, the source was observed by both Suzaku and XMM-Newton
approximately 1 day apart. Spectral analysis reveals a broad relativistic Fe
K-alpha emission line which is present in both data-sets, as has recently been
reported for other neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries. The properties of the
Fe K line observed during each observation are very similar. From modeling the
Fe line, we determine the inner accretion disk radius to be 13.2 +/- 2.5
GM/c^2. The inner disk radius measured from the Fe K line suggests that the
accretion disk is not very receded in the island state. If the inner disk (as
measured by the Fe line) is truncated at the magnetospheric radius this implies
a magnetic field strength of ~3E8 G at the magnetic poles, consistent with
other independent estimates.
