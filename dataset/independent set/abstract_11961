We present an analysis of the normal-state Hall effect and magnetoresistance
in the heavy fermion superconductor CeIrIn${_5}$. It is demonstrated that the
modified Kohler's scaling--which relates the magnetoresistance to the Hall
angle--breaks down prior to the onset of superconductivity due to the presence
of a precursor state to superconductivity in this system. A model-independent,
single-parameter scaling of the Hall angle governed solely by this precursor
state is observed. Neither the Hall coefficient nor the resistivity exhibit
this scaling implying that this precursor state preferentially influences the
Hall channel.
