The first order loss function and its complementary function are extensively
used in practical settings. When the random variable of interest is normally
distributed, the first order loss function can be easily expressed in terms of
the standard normal cumulative distribution and probability density function.
However, the standard normal cumulative distribution does not admit a closed
form solution and cannot be easily linearised. Several works in the literature
discuss approximations for either the standard normal cumulative distribution
or the first order loss function and their inverse. However, a comprehensive
study on piecewise linear upper and lower bounds for the first order loss
function is still missing. In this work, we initially summarise a number of
distribution independent results for the first order loss function and its
complementary function. We then extend this discussion by focusing first on
random variable featuring a symmetric distribution, and then on normally
distributed random variables. For the latter, we develop effective piecewise
linear upper and lower bounds that can be immediately embedded in MILP models.
These linearisations rely on constant parameters that are independent of the
mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution of interest. We finally
discuss how to compute optimal linearisation parameters that minimise the
maximum approximation error.
