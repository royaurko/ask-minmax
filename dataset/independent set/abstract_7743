We study vibrational energy transport in a quasi 1-D harmonic chain with both
longitudinal and transverse vibrations. We demonstrate via both numerical
simulation and theoretic analysis that for 1-D atomic chain connected by 3D
harmonic springs, the coefficient of heat conduction changes it continuously
with its lattice constant, indicating the qualitative difference from the
corresponding 1-D case where the coefficient is independent of the lattice
constant.
