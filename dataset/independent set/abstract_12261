We report excess specific heat in a series of metallic glass forming liquids.
It is found that the excess specific heat relative to glass at glass transition
temperature Tg is constant and close to, where R is gas constant. In the
typical Pd40Ni10Cu30P20 metallic glass forming liquid, the excess specific heat
is independent of temperature. A quantitative description of the excess
specific heat is built up. The atomic translational diffusion is the origin of
the excess specific heat. The results provide a fundamental understanding to
the glass transition in metallic glasses.
