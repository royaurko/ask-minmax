We present preliminary results on the measurement of the I=1/2 $K \pi$
$\mathcal{S}$-wave through a model independent partial wave analysis of
$\eta_c$ decays to $K^0_S K^+ \pi^-$ and $K^+ K^- \pi^0$ produced in two-photon
interactions. We also perform a Dalitz plot analysis of the $J/\psi$ decays to
$\pi^+ \pi^- \pi^0$ and $K^+ K^- \pi^0$ produced by the initial state radiation
process.
