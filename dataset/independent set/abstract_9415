In order to examine the gravitational waves emitted from the neutron stars in
the tensor-vector-scalar (TeVeS) theory, we derive the perturbation equations
for relativistic stars, where for simplicity we omit the perturbations of
vector field. That is, we consider the perturbations of scalar and tensor
fields. With this assumption, we find that the axial gravitational waves, which
are corresponding to the oscillations of spacetime ($w$ modes), are independent
from the perturbations of scalar field and the effects of scalar field can be
mounted only via the background properties. Using two different equations of
state, we calculate the complex eigenfrequencies of axial $w$ modes and find
that the dependences of frequencies on the stellar compactness are almost
independent from the adopted equation of state and the parameter in TeVeS.
Additionally, these dependences of frequencies of axial $w$ modes in TeVeS is
obviously different from those expected in the general relativity. Thus the
direct observations of gravitational waves could reveal the gravitational
theory in the strong-field regime.
