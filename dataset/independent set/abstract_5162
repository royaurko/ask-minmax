We obtain a new version of the Uncertainty Principle for functions with
Fourier transforms supported on a lacunary set of intervals. This is a
generalization of Zygmund's theorem on lacunary trigonometric series to the
real line in the spirit of the Logvinenko-Sereda theorem for relatively dense
sets.
