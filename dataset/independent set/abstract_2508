We study the problem of coexistence in a two-type competition model governed
by first-passage percolation on $\Zd$ or on the infinite cluster in Bernoulli
percolation. Actually, we prove for a large class of ergodic stationary passage
times that for distinct points $x,y\in\Zd$, there is a strictly positive
probability that $\{z\in\Zd;d(y,z)<d(x,z)\}$ and $\{z\in\Zd;d(y,z)>d(x,z)\}$
are both infinite sets. We also show that there is a strictly positive
probability that the graph of time-minimizing path from the origin in
first-passage percolation has at least two topological ends. This generalizes
results obtained by H{\"a}ggstr{\"o}m and Pemantle for independent exponential
times on the square lattice.
