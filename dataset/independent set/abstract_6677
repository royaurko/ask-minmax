We study the periodicity of nim-sequences for subtraction games having
subtraction sets with three elements. In particular, we give solutions in
several cases, and we describe how these subtraction sets can be augmented by
additional numbers without changing the nim-sequences. The paper concludes with
a conjecture on ultimately bipartite subtraction games.
