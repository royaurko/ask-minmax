A semi-empirical formalism is presented for deriving interatomic potentials
for materials such as caesium or cerium which exhibit volume collapse phase
transitions. It is based on the Finnis-Sinclair second moment tight binding
approach, but incorporates two independent bands on each atom. The potential is
cast in a form suitable for large-scale molecular dynamics, the computational
cost being the evaluation of short ranged pair potentials. Parameters for a
model potential for caesium are derived and tested.
