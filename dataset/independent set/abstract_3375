We show that the one-particle density matrix $\rho$ can be used to
characterize the interaction-driven many-body localization transition in closed
fermionic systems. The natural orbitals (the eigenstates of $\rho$) are
localized in the many-body localized phase and spread out when one enters the
delocalized phase, while the occupation spectrum (the set of eigenvalues of
$\rho$) reveals the distinctive Fock-space structure of the many-body
eigenstates, exhibiting a step-like discontinuity in the localized phase. The
associated one-particle occupation entropy is small in the localized phase and
large in the delocalized phase, with diverging fluctuations at the transition.
We analyze the inverse participation ratio of the natural orbitals and find
that it is independent of system size in the localized phase.
