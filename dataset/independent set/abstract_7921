In Reinforcement Learning (RL), it is common to use optimistic initialization
of value functions to encourage exploration. However, such an approach
generally depends on the domain, viz., the scale of the rewards must be known,
and the feature representation must have a constant norm. We present a simple
approach that performs optimistic initialization with less dependence on the
domain.
