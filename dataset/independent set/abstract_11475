We describe the design of a single beam, multiple species atom source in
which the flux of any component can be separately adjusted. Using this design
we have developed a 23Na-6Li atom source for ultracold atom experiments. The
fluxes of lithium and sodium are independently tunable, allowing operation as a
single 23Na or 6Li source as well as a double source with equal atomic fluxes
in each component.
