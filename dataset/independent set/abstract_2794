Percolation is perhaps the simplest example of a process exhibiting a phase
transition and one of the most studied phenomena in statistical physics. The
percolation transition is continuous if sites/bonds are occupied independently
with the same probability. However, alternative rules for the occupation of
sites/bonds might affect the order of the transition. A recent set of rules
proposed by Achlioptas et al. [Science 323, 1453 (2009)], characterized by
competitive link addition, was claimed to lead to a discontinuous connectedness
transition, named "explosive percolation". In this work we survey a numerical
study of the explosive percolation transition on various types of graphs, from
lattices to scale-free networks, and show the consistency of these results with
recent analytical work showing that the transition is actually continuous.
