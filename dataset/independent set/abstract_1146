The Hosoya index $Z (G)$ of a graph $G$ is defined as the total number of
edge independent sets of $G$. In this paper, we extend the research of [J. Ou,
On extremal unicyclic molecular graphs with maximal Hosoya index,
\textit{Discrete Appl. Math.} 157 (2009) 391--397.] and [Y. Ye, X. Pan, H. Liu,
Ordering unicyclic graphs with respect to Hosoya indices and Merrifield-Simmons
indices, \textit{MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem.} 59 (2008) 191--202.] and
order the largest $n-1$ unicyclic graphs with respect to the Hosoya index.
