We study subharmonic functions whose Laplacian is supported on a null set and
in connected components of of the complement to the support admit harmonic
extensions to larger sets. We prove that if such a function has a piecewise
holomorphic derivative, then it is locally piecewise harmonic. In generic cases
it coincides locally with the maximum of finitely many harmonic functions.
Moreover, we describe the support when the holomorphic derivative satisfies a
global algebraic equation. The proofs follow classical patterns and our methods
may also be of independent interest.
