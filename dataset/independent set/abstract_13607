On the basis of the Kadyshevsky equal-time (quasipotential) approach, a set
of partial-wave equations is derived for the wave function of a gluonium, a
bound state of two gluons. The field operators of constituent gluons are
considered as six component quantities according to the Joos-Weinberg
$2(2S+1)$- component approach. The quasiclassical quantization condition for
relativistic two-particle states and the above set could be used for
calculations of gluonium energy levels.
