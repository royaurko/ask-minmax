We report the result of a search for neutrino oscillations using precise
measurements of the recoil electron energy spectrum and zenith angle variations
of the solar neutrino flux from 1258 days of neutrino-electron scattering data
in Super-Kamiokande. The absence of significant zenith angle variation and
spectrum distortion places strong constraints on neutrino mixing and mass
difference in a flux-independent way. Using the Super-Kamiokande flux
measurement in addition, two allowed regions at large mixing are found.
