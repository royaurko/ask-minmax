We report measurements of the zero-field resistivity in dilute 2D electron
system in silicon at temperatures down to 35 mK. This extends the previously
explored range of temperatures by almost an order of magnitude. On the metallic
side, the resistivity near the metal-insulator transition continues to decrease
with decreasing temperature and shows no low-temperature up-turn. At the
critical electron density, the resistivity is found to be
temperature-independent in the entire temperature range 35 mK to 1 K.
