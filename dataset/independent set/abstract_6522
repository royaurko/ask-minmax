We prove that P-sel, the class of all P-selective sets, is EXP-immune, but is
not EXP/1-immune. That is, we prove that some infinite P-selective set has no
infinite EXP-time subset, but we also prove that every infinite P-selective set
has some infinite subset in EXP/1. Informally put, the immunity of P-sel is so
fragile that it is pierced by a single bit of information.
  The above claims follow from broader results that we obtain about the
immunity of the P-selective sets. In particular, we prove that for every
recursive function f, P-sel is DTIME(f)-immune. Yet we also prove that P-sel is
not \Pi_2^p/1-immune.
