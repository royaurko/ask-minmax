We demonstrate that the largest measured mass of a neutron star establishes
an upper bound to the energy density of observable cold matter. An equation of
state-independent expression satisfied by both normal neutron stars and
self-bound quark matter stars is derived for the largest energy density inside
stars as a function their masses. The largest observed mass sets the lowest
upper limit to the density. Implications from existing and future neutron star
mass measurements are discussed.
