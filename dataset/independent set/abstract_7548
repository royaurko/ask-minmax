We show that, independently of the size of the quark condensate, chiral
symmetry correlates the two S-wave \pi\pi scattering lengths. In view of this
constraint, the new precision data on K_{e_4} decay allow a remarkably accurate
determination of these quantities. The result confirms the hypothesis that the
quark condensate is the leading order parameter.
