This paper reports the tenth-order QED contribution to the g-2 of electron
and muon from two gauge-invariant sets, Set I(g) and Set I(h). In the case of
electron g-2 Set I(g) consists of 9 Feynman diagrams which have a 4th-order
vacuum-polarization loop containing another 4th-order vacuum-polarization loop.
Set I(h) consists of 30 Feynman diagrams which have a proper 6th-order
vacuum-polarization loop containing a second-order vacuum-polarization loop.
The results of numerical integration, including mass-dependent terms containing
one closed loop of muon, are 0.028 597 (4) (alpha/pi)^5 for Set I(g) and 0.001
685 (13) (alpha/pi)^5 for Set I(h), respectively. We also report the
contributions of Set I(g) and Set I(h) to the muon anomaly. Diagrams included
are those containing electron, muon, and tau-lepton loops. Their sums are 2.640
9 (4) (alpha/pi)^5 and -0.564 8 (11) (alpha/pi)^5, respectively. The sum of
contributions of Sets I(g) and I(h) containing only electron loops are in fair
agreement with the recently obtained asymptotic analytic results.
