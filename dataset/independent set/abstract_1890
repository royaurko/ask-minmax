The Cryogenic Dark Matter search experiment (CDMS) employs low-temperature Ge
and Si detectors to detect WIMPs via their elastic scattering of target nuclei.
The last analysis with an germanium exposure of 397.8 kg-days resulted in zero
observed candidate events, setting an upper limit on the spin-independent
WIMP-nucleon cross-section of 6.6 x 10^{-44} cm^2 (4.6 x 10^{-44} cm^2, when
previous CDMS Soudan data is included) for a WIMP mass of 60 GeV. The
improvements in the surface event rejection capability for the current analysis
with an germanium exposure about a factor of 2.5 greater than used in the last
analysis will be discussed. To increase the sensitivity beyond the 1 x 10^{-44}
cm^2 benchmark new 1 inch thick detectors have been developed. A first tower
consisting of six of these detectors has been successfully installed at the
Soudan site. These detectors will be used in a 15 kg SuperCDMS stage with an
expected sensitivity on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering
cross-section of 5 x 10^{-45} cm^2. In addition, the CDMS Collaboration has
started to look for signatures of non WIMP dark matter particles, which may
explain the annual modulation signature observed by DAMA.
