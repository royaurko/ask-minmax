Content delivery networks deliver much of the web and video content in the
world by deploying a large distributed network of servers. We model and analyze
a simple paradigm for client-side server selection that is commonly used in
practice where each user independently measures the performance of a set of
candidate servers and selects the one that performs the best. For web (resp.,
video) delivery, we propose and analyze a simple algorithm where each user
randomly chooses two or more candidate servers and selects the server that
provided the best hitrate (resp., bitrate). We prove that the algorithm
converges quickly to an optimal state where all users receive the best hitrate
(resp., bitrate), with high probability. We also show that if each user chose
just one random server instead of two, some users receive a hitrate (resp.,
bitrate) that tends to zero. We simulate our algorithm and evaluate its
performance with varying choices of parameters, system load, and content
popularity.
