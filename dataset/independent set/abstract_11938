A method for the simultaneous determination of the energy scales for b-quark
jets and light jets, the jet energy resolution, and the top quark mass at
hadron colliders is presented. The method exploits the unique kinematics of
events with top-antitop pair production, where one of the top quarks involves a
leptonic and one a hadronic W boson decay. The paper shows a feasibility study
of how this simultaneous measurement can be performed at the upcoming LHC
experiments ATLAS and CMS.
