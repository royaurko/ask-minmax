After our work was published, Frink and Mei{\ss}ner \cite{FM06} pointed out
that our {\cal O}(q^3) three-flavour meson-baryon chiral Lagrangian was not
minimal. Here, we discuss their findings and revise ours accordingly. We find
that eight monomials in our ${\cal O}(q^3)$ Lagrangian are not independent, but
in addition, two monomials were wrongly discarded, which, as a result, makes
the agreement in the number of independent monomials with \cite{FM06} complete.
