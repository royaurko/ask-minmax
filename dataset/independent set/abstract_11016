We present a method of computing any one-loop integral in lattice
perturbation theory by systematically expanding around its continuum limit. At
any order in the expansion in the lattice spacing, the result can be written as
a sum of continuum loop integrals in analytic regularization and a few genuine
lattice integrals (``master integrals''). These lattice master integrals are
independent of external momenta and masses and can be computed numerically. At
the one-loop level, there are four master integrals in a theory with only
bosonic fields, seven in HQET and sixteen in QED or QCD with Wilson fermions.
