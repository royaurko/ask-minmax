We use a generalised real-time path formalism with properly regularised
propagators based on Le Bellac and Mabilat \cite{belmab} and calculate the
effective potential and the higher order derivative terms of the effective
action in the case of real scalar fields at finite temperature. We consider
time-dependent fields in thermal equilibrium and concentrate on the quadratic
part of the expanded effective action which has been associated with problems
of non-analyticity at the zero limits of the four external momenta at finite
temperature. We derive the effective potential and we explicitly show its
independence of the initial time of the system when we include both paths of
our time contour. We also derive the second derivative in the field term and
recover the Real Time (RTF) and the Imaginary Time Formalism (ITF) and show
that the divergences associated with the former are cancelled as long as we set
the regulators zero in the end. Using an alternative method we write the field
in its Taylor series form and we first derive RTF and ITF in the appropriate
limits, check the analyticity properties in each case and do the actual time
derivative expansion of the field up to second order in the end. We agree with
our previous results and discuss an interesting term which arises in this
expansion. Finally we discuss the initial time-dependence of the quadratic part
of the effective action before the expansion of the field as well as of the
individual terms after the expansion.
