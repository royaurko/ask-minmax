We consider eigenvalues of a product of n non-Hermitian, independent random
matrices. Each matrix in this product is of size N\times N with independent
standard complex Gaussian variables. The eigenvalues of such a product form a
determinantal point process on the complex plane (Akemann and Burda J. Phys A:
Math. Theor. 45 (2012) 465201), which can be understood as a generalization of
the finite Ginibre ensemble. As N\rightarrow\infty, a generalized infinite
Ginibre ensemble arises. We show that the set of absolute values of the points
of this determinantal process has the same distribution as
{R_1^{(n)},R_2^{(n)},...}, where R_k^{(n)} are independent, and (R_k^{(n)})^2
is distributed as the product of n independent Gamma variables Gamma(k,1). This
enables us to find the asymptotics for the hole probabilities, i.e. for the
probabilities of the events that there are no points of the process in a disc
of radius r with its center at 0, as r\rightarrow\infty. In addition, we solve
the relevant overcrowding problem: we derive an asymptotic formula for the
probability that there are more than m points of the process in a fixed disk of
radius r with its center at 0, as m\rightarrow\infty.
