The ground state of a spinor Bose liquid is ferromagnetic, while the softest
excitation above the ground state is the magnon mode. The dispersion relation
of the magnon in a one-dimensional liquid is periodic in the wavenumber q with
the period 2\pi n, determined by the density n of the liquid. Dynamic
correlation functions, such as e.g. spin-spin correlation function, exhibit
power-law singularities at the magnon spectrum, $\omega\to\omega_m(q,n)$.
Without using any specific model of the inter-particle interactions, we relate
the corresponding exponents to independently measurable quantities
$\partial\omega_m/\partial q$ and $\partial\omega_m/\partial n$.
