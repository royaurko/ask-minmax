We present the theory, design, and realization of a polarization-insensitive
metamaterial absorber for terahertz frequencies. We derive
geometrical-independent conditions for effective medium absorbers in general,
and for resonant metamaterials specically. Our fabricated design reaches and
absorptivity of 78% at 1.145 Thz
