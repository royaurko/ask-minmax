The EDELWEISS-II collaboration has completed a direct search for WIMP dark
matter with an array of ten 400-g cryogenic germanium detectors in operation at
the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane. The combined use of thermal phonon
sensors and charge collection electrodes with an interleaved geometry enables
the efficient rejection of gamma-induced radioactivity as well as near-surface
interactions. A total effective exposure of 384 kg.d has been achieved, mostly
coming from fourteen months of continuous operation. Five nuclear recoil
candidates are observed above 20 keV, while the estimated background is 3.0
events. The result is interpreted in terms of limits on the cross-section of
spin-independent interactions of WIMPs and nucleons. A cross-section of
4.4x10^-8 pb is excluded at 90%CL for a WIMP mass of 85 GeV. New constraints
are also set on models where the WIMP-nucleon scattering is inelastic.
