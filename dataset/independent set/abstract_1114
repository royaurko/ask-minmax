Suppose Alice and Bob make local two-outcome measurements on a shared
entangled state. For any d, we show that there are correlations that can only
be reproduced if the local dimension is at least d. This resolves a conjecture
of Brunner et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 210503 (2008) and establishes that the
amount of entanglement required to maximally violate a Bell inequality must
depend on the number of measurement settings, not just the number of
measurement outcomes. We prove this result by establishing the first lower
bounds on a new generalization of Grothendieck's constant.
