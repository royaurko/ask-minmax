$\mathit{C}$-clones are polymorphism sets of so-called clausal relations, a
special type of relations on a finite domain, which first appeared in
connection with constraint satisfaction problems in [Creignou et al. 2008]. We
completely describe the relationship w.r.t. set inclusion between maximal
$\mathit{C}$-clones and maximal clones. As a main result we obtain that for
every maximal $\mathit{C}$-clone there exists exactly one maximal clone in
which it is contained. A precise description of this unique maximal clone, as
well as a corresponding completeness criterion for $\mathit{C}$-clones is
given.
