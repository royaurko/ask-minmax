We prove that if y" = f(y,y',t) is a generic Painleve equation from among the
classes II to V then any collection of distinct solutions and their derivatives
are algebraically independent over C(t). (Already proved by Nishioka for the
single Painleve I equation). For generic Painleve VI we prove a slightly weaker
statement.
