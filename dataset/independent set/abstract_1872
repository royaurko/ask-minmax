Consider any random graph model where potential edges appear independently,
with possibly different probabilities, and assume that the minimum expected
degree is omega(ln n). We prove that the adjacency matrix and the Laplacian of
that random graph are concentrated around the corresponding matrices of the
weighted graph whose edge weights are the probabilities in the random model.
While this may seem surprising, we will see that this matrix concentration
phenomenon is a generalization of known results about the Er\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi
model. In particular, we will argue that matrix concentration is implicit the
theory of quasi-random graph properties.
  We present two main applications of the main result. In bond percolation over
a graph G, we show that the Laplacian of the random subgraph is typically very
close to the Laplacian of G. As a corollary, we improve upon a bound for the
spectral gap due to Chung and Horn that was derived via much more complicated
methods.
  In inhomogeneous random graphs, there are points X_1,...,X_n uniformly
distributed on the interval [0,1] and each pair is connected with probability p
kappa(X_i,X_j). We show that if \ln n/n<< p<< 1 and kappa is bounded, then the
adjacency matrix of the random graph is close to an integral operator defined
in terms of kappa.
  Our main proof tool is a new concentration inequality for matrix martingales
that generalizes Freedman's inequality for the standard scalar setting.
