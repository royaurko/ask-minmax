It is easy to show that the lower and the upper box dimensions of a bounded
set in Euclidean space are invariant with respect to the ambient space. In this
article we show that the Minkowski content of a Minkowski measurable set is
also invariant with respect to the ambient space when normalized by an
appropriate constant. In other words, the value of the normalized Minkowski
content of a bounded, Minkowski measurable set is intrinsic to the set.
