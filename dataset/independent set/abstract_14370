The famous conjecture of V.Ya.Ivrii (1978) says that {\it in every billiard
with infinitely-smooth boundary in a Euclidean space the set of periodic orbits
has measure zero}. In the present paper we study the complex algebraic version
of Ivrii's conjecture for quadrilateral orbits in two dimensions, with
reflections from complex algebraic curves. We present the complete
classification of 4-reflective algebraic counterexamples: billiards formed by
four complex algebraic curves in the projective plane that have open set of
quadrilateral orbits.
