We present the complete set of Feynman rules producing the rational terms of
kind R_2 needed to perform any 1-loop calculation in the Electroweak Standard
Model. Our formulae are given both in the R_xi gauge and in the Unitary gauge,
therefore completing the results in the 't Hooft-Feynman gauge already
presented in a previous publication. As a consistency check, we verified, in
the case of the process H -> gamma gamma and in a few other physical cases, the
independence of the total Rational Part R_1+R_2 on the chosen gauge. In
addition, we explicitly checked the equivalence of the limits xi -> infinity
after or before the loop momentum integration in the definition of the Unitary
gauge at 1-loop.
