We introduce the Voronoi functional of a triangulation of a finite set of
points in the Euclidean plane and prove that among all geometric triangulations
of the point set, the Delaunay triangulation maximizes the functional. This
result neither extends to topological triangulations in the plane nor to
geometric triangulations in three and higher dimensions.
