This article presents an extended model of gravity obtained by gauging the
AdS-Mawell algebra. It involves additional fields that shift the spin
connection, leading effectively to theory of two independent connections.
Extension of algebraic structure by another tetrad gives rise to the model
described by a pair of Einstein equations.
