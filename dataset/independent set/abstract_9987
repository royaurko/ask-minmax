We introduce a definition of admissibility for subintervals in interval
exchange transformations. Using this notion, we prove a property of the natural
codings of interval exchange transformations, namely that any derived set of a
regular interval exchange set is a regular interval exchange set with the same
number of intervals. Derivation is taken here with respect to return words. We
characterize the admissible intervals using a branching version of the Rauzy
induction. We also study the case of regular interval exchange transformations
defined over a quadratic field and show that the set of factors of such a
transformation is primitive morphic. The proof uses an extension of a result of
Boshernitzan and Carroll.
