Gold nanowires generated by mechanical stretching have been shown to adopt
only three kinds of configurations where their atomic arrangements adjust such
that either the [100], [111] or [110] zone axes lie parallel to the elongation
direction. We have analyzed the relationship between structural rearrangements
and electronic transport behavior during the elongation of Au nanowires for
each of the three possibilities. We have used two independent experiments to
tackle this problem, high resolution transmission high resolution electron
microscopy to observe the atomic structure and a mechanically controlled break
junction to measure the transport properties. We have estimated the conductance
of nanowires using a theoretical method based on the extended H\"uckel theory
that takes into account the atom species and their positions. Aided by these
calculations, we have consistently connected both sets of experimental results
and modeled the evolution process of gold nanowires whose conductance lies
within the first and third conductance quanta. We have also presented evidence
that carbon acts as a contaminant, lowering the conductance of one-atom-thick
wires.
