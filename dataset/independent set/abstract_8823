Given a finite set $X\subseteq\R$ we characterize the diagonals of
self-adjoint operators with spectrum $X$. Our result extends the Schur-Horn
theorem from a finite dimensional setting to an infinite dimensional Hilbert
space analogous to Kadison's theorem for orthogonal projections and the second
contributor's result for operators with three point spectrum.
