We characterize the role of the spin-orbit coupling between electrons and the
confining potential of the edge in nonequilibrium 2D homogeneous electronic
gas. We derive a simple analytical result for the magnitude of the current
induced spin polarization at the edge and prove that it is independent of the
details of the confinement edge potential and the electronic density within
realistic values of the parameters of the considered models. While the
amplitude of the spin accumulation is comparable to the experimental values of
extrinsic spin Hall effect in similar samples, the spatial extent of edge
induced effect is restricted to the distances of the order of Fermi wavelength
($\sim$ 10nm).
