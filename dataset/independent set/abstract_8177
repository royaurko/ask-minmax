In this paper we prove a strong maximum principle for certain parabolic
systems of equations. In particular, our methods place no restriction on the
regularity of the boundary of the convex set in which the system takes its
values, and therefore our results hold for any convex set. We achieve this
through the use of viscosity solutions and their corresponding strong maximum
principle.
