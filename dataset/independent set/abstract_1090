We introduce a natural set of asymptotic conditions in the spacelike
stretched AdS sector of topologically massive gravity. The Poisson bracket
algebra of the canonical generators is shown to have the form of the
semi-direct sum of a $u(1)$ Kac-Moody and a Virasoro algebra, with central
charges. Using the Sugawara construction, we prove that the asymptotic symmetry
coincides with the conformal symmetry, described by two independent Virasoro
algebras with central charges. The result is in complete agreement with the
hypothesis made in [6].
