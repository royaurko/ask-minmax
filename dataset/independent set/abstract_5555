In the present paper we are interested in properties of forcing notions
which measure in a sense the distance between the ground model reals and the
reals in the extension. We look at the ways the ``new'' reals can be
aproximated by ``old'' reals. We consider localizations for infinite subsets
of omega. Though each member of [omega]^omega can be identified with its
increasing enumeration, the (standard) localizations of the enumeration does
not provide satisfactory information on successive points of the set. They
give us ``candidates'' for the n-th point of the set but the same candidates
can appear several times for distinct n. That led to a suggestion that we
should consider disjoint subsets of omega as sets of ``candidates'' for
successive points of the localized set. We have two possibilities. Either we
can demand that each set from the localization contains a limited number of
members of the localized set or we can postulate that each intersection of
that kind is large. Localizations of this kind are studied in section 1. In
the second section we investigate localizations of infinite subsets of omega
by sets of integers from the ground model. These localizations might be
thought as localizations by partitions of omega into successive intervals.
