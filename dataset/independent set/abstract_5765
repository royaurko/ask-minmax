Among the various "rare" semi-leptonic decays of $B$-mesons the $B \to K^*
\ell^+ \ell^-$ mode is of special interest. This is because it has the highest
branching ratio among all the semi-leptonic B decays within the SM. This
channel also provides us with a very large number of possible observables, such
as the Forward Backward (FB) asymmetry, lepton polarization asymmetry etc. Of
special interest is the zero which the FB asymmetry has in this decay mode. In
this work we have studied this zero in the most general model independent
framework.
