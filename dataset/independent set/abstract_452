We present the results of a new global analysis of DIS data characterized by
an enlarged neutrino and antineutrino data set. Special emphasis is given to
the strange sector. The strange sea distribution is determined independently of
the non strange sea. The possibility of a charge asymmetry, s(x) different from
sbar(x), is tested.
