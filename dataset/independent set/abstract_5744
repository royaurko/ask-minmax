We perform an updated model-independent analysis using all the latest solar
neutrino data, including the one coming from remarkably high statistics
SuperKamiokande experiment. We confirm that the astrophysical solutions to the
solar neutrino problem are extremely disfavored. We also present a new way of
illuminating the suppression pattern of various solar neutrino flux, which
indicates that the strong suppression of $^{7}$Be neutrinos is no more true
once the neutrino flavor conversion is taken into account.
