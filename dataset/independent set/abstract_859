In r-neighbour bootstrap percolation on a graph G, a (typically random) set A
of initially 'infected' vertices spreads by infecting (at each time step)
vertices with at least r already-infected neighbours. This process may be
viewed as a monotone version of the Glauber dynamics of the Ising model, and
has been extensively studied on the d-dimensional grid $[n]^d$. The elements of
the set A are usually chosen independently, with some density p, and the main
question is to determine $p_c([n]^d,r)$, the density at which percolation
(infection of the entire vertex set) becomes likely.
  In this paper we prove, for every pair $d \ge r \ge 2$, that there is a
constant L(d,r) such that $p_c([n]^d,r) = [(L(d,r) + o(1)) / log_(r-1)
(n)]^{d-r+1}$ as $n \to \infty$, where $log_r$ denotes an r-times iterated
logarithm. We thus prove the existence of a sharp threshold for percolation in
any (fixed) number of dimensions. Moreover, we determine L(d,r) for every pair
(d,r).
