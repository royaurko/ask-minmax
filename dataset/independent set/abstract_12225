The EDELWEISS-II experiment uses cryogenic heat-and-ionization detectors in
order to detect the rare interactions from possible WIMP dark matter particles
on Germanium nuclei. Recently, new-generation detectors with an interleaved
electrode geometry were developped and validated, enabling an outstanding
rejection of gamma-rays and surface interactions. We present here preliminary
results of a one-year WIMP search carried out with ten of such detectors in the
Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane. A sensitivity to the spin-independent
WIMP-nucleon cross-section of 5 \times 10-8 pb was achieved using a 322 kg
