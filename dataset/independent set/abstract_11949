An Ito-Skorokhod bi-linear equation driven by infinitely many independent
colored noises is considered in a normal triple of Hilbert spaces. The special
feature of the equation is the appearance of the Wick product in the definition
of the Ito-Skorokhod integral, requiring innovative approaches to computing the
solution. A chaos expansion of the solution is derived and several truncations
of this expansion are studied. A recursive approximation of the solution is
suggested and the corresponding approximation error bound is computed.
