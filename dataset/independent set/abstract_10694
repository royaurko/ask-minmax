We study the curvature strength and visibility of the central singularity
arising in Tolman-Bondi-de Sitter collapse. We find that the singularity is
visible and Tipler strong along an infinite number of timelike geodesics,
independently of the initial data, and thus stable against perturbations of the
latter.
