A new Nilsson single-particle structure is proposed for neutron-rich nuclei
near $^{132}$Sn. In general, a large reduction in spin-orbit interaction is
required and the neutron $N = 82$ gap persists in the new set of parameters.
The ground state deformations for several isotopic chains are studied with this
set and compared with the results of the standard set and with measured ones.
Collective bands in two even-even, neutron-rich nuclei are calculated using
the Projected Shell Model with the new set of parameters and improved agreement
with existing data is found.
