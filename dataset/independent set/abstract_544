By random complex zeroes we mean the zero set of a random entire function
whose Taylor coefficients are independent complex-valued Gaussian variables,
and the variance of the k-th coefficient is 1/k!. This zero set is distribution
invariant with respect to isometries of the complex plane. We study large
fluctuations of random complex zeroes and show that they obey the asymptotic
law that was discovered some time ago by Jancovici, Lebowitz and Manificat for
charge fluctuations of a Coulomb system of particles.
