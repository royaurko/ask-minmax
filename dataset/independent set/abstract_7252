A cellular automaton is a parallel synchronous computing model, which
consists in a juxtaposition of finite automata whose state evolves according to
that of their neighbors. It induces a dynamical system on the set of
configurations, i.e. the infinite sequences of cell states. The limit set of
the cellular automaton is the set of configurations which can be reached
arbitrarily late in the evolution.
  In this paper, we prove that all properties of limit sets of cellular
automata with binary-state cells are undecidable, except surjectivity. This is
a refinement of the classical "Rice Theorem" that Kari proved on cellular
automata with arbitrary state sets.
