Families of unconditionally $\tau$-closed and $\tau$-algebraic sets in a
group are defined, which are natural generalizations of unconditionally closed
and algebraic sets defined by Markov. A sufficient condition for the
coincidence of these families is found. In particular, it is proved that these
families coincide in any group of cardinality at most $\tau$. This result
generalizes both Markov's theorem on the coincidence of unconditionally closed
and algebraic sets in a countable group (as is known, they may be different in
an uncountable group) and Podewski's theorem on the topologizablity of any
ungebunden group.
