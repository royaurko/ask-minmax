In this paper, we will show that a periodic nonlinear, time-varying
dissipative system that is defined on a genus-p surface contains one or more
invariant sets which act as attractors. Moreover, we shall generalize a result
in [Martins, 2004] and give conditions under which these invariant sets are not
homeomorphic to a circle individually, which implies the existence of chaotic
behaviour. This is achieved by studying the appearance of inversely unstable
solutions within each invariant set.
