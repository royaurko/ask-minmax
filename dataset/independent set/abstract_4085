It is shown that, for any given $p\ge5$, $A>0$, and $B>0$, the exact upper
bound on ${\operatorname{\mathsf{E}}}|\sum X_i|^p$ over all independent
zero-mean random variables (r.v.'s) $X_1,\dots,X_n$ such that
$\sum{\operatorname{\mathsf{E}}} X_i^2=B$ and
$\sum{\operatorname{\mathsf{E}}}|X_i|^p=A$ equals
$c^p{\operatorname{\mathsf{E}}}|\Pi_{\lambda}-\lambda|^p$, where
$(\lambda,c)\in(0,\infty)^2$ is the unique solution to the system of equations
$c^p\lambda=A$ and $c^2\lambda=B$, and $\Pi_\lambda$ is a Poisson r.v.\ with
mean $\lambda$. In fact, a more general result is obtained, as well as other
related ones. As a tool used in the proof, a calculus of variations of moments
of infinitely divisible distributions with respect to variations of the L\'evy
characteristics is developed.
