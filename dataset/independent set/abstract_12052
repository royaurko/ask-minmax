We consider a square-integrable semimartingale and investigate the convex
order relations between its discrete, continuous and predictable quadratic
variation. As the main results, we show that if the semimartingale has
conditionally independent increments and symmetric jump measure, then its
discrete realized variance dominates its quadratic variation in increasing
convex order. The results have immediate applications to the pricing of options
on realized variance. For a class of models including time-changed Levy models
and Sato processes with symmetric jumps our results show that options on
variance are typically underpriced, if quadratic variation is substituted for
the discretely sampled realized variance.
