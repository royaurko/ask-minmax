Balance equations are derived from Enskog's kinetic equation for a
two-dimensional system of hard disks using Grad's moment expansion method. This
set of equations constitute an extended hydrodynamics for moderately dense
bi-dimensional fluids. The set of independent hydrodynamic fields in the
present formulations are: density, velocity, temperature {\em and
also}--following Grad's original idea--the symmetric and traceless pressure
tensor $p_{ij}$ and the heat flux vector $\mathbf q^{k}$. An approximation
scheme similar in spirit to one made by Grad in his original work is made. Once
the hydrodynamics is derived it is used to discuss the nature of a simple
one-dimensional heat conduction problem. It is shown that, not too far from
equilibrium, the nonequilibrium pressure in this case only depends on the
density, temperature and heat flux vector.
