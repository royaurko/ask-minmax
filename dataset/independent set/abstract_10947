Trimaximal mixing is the mixing hypothesis with maximal symmetry. In
trimaximal mixing there remains a still worrying conflict between the large
values of $\Delta m^2$ preferred by the atmospheric fits (possibly supported by
the early K2K data) and reactor limits on $\nu_e$-mixing. However, the latest
solar results do seem to point to energy-independent (ie. `no-scale') solar
solutions, like the trimaximal solution.
