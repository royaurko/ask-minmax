We derive analytical expressions for the quasiparticle lifetime tau, the
effective mass m*, and the Green's function renormalization factor Z for a 2D
Fermi liquid with electron-electron interaction in the presence of the Rashba
spin-orbit interaction. We find that the modifications are independent of the
Rashba band index rho, and occur in second order of the spin-orbit coupling
alpha. In the derivation of these results, we also discuss the screening of the
Coulomb interaction, as well as the susceptibility and the self-energy in small
alpha.
