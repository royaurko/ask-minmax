We present benchmark points for Pure General Gauge Mediation (GGM) models
specifically optimised for early LHC searches. The pure GGM set-up is as
defined in our previous paper arXiv:0910.2674: namely we adopt the minimal
set-up in which B_mu is generated only through gauge interactions, and as a
result tan beta is a prediction rather than an input. The only input parameters
are messenger masses together with two independent scales which generate
gaugino and scalar masses. The parameter space favoured by current experimental
data includes an interesting region with light gluinos (m_g < 500 GeV and
relatively heavy squarks) and a bino-like NLSP where early discovery is likely.
We also find interesting regions of parameter space where the NLSP is a stau or
stau/neutralino co-NLSP and the squark masses are relatively low. We present
benchmark points which are typical for each of these three regions, and give
the spectrum, branching ratios, and also the overall 2 -> 2 cross-sections.
