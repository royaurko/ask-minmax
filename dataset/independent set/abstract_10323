Recent observations of entropy of intracluster medium (ICM) at high redshift
are not consistent with a redshift independent entropy floor. In order to
interpret these observations, we study models in which the entropy of ICM is
enhanced at the epoch of cluster formation (z_f), which then passively evolves
as a result of radiative cooling until the epoch of observation (z_o). We
confirm that a z-independent entropy floor is incompatible with the
observations. We find that models in which energy deposition into the ICM
increases with redshift (scaling approximately as $\sim M_cl^0.6 (1+z_f)^2.2$)
are consistent with observations of low and high redshift clusters. Possible
sources of such non-gravitational heating are briefly discussed.
