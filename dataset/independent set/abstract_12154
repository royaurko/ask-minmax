We analyze the singular spectrum of selfadjoint operators which arise from
pasting a finite number of boundary relations with a standard interface
condition. A model example for this situation is a Schroedinger operator on a
star-shaped graph with continuity and Kirchhoff conditions at the interior
vertex. We compute the multiplicity of the singular spectrum in terms of the
spectral measures of the Weyl functions associated with the single
(independently considered) boundary relations. This result is a generalization
and refinement of Theorem of I.S. Kac.
