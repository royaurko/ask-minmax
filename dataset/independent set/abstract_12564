We examine the sensitivity to the couplings of the Higgs boson to neutral
gauge bosons in a model independent way at the Large Hadron electron Collider
(LHeC). We have obtained the constraints on anomalous couplings for $HZZ$
vertex via the process $e^{-}p\rightarrow e^{-}HqX$. We find the accessible
limits of the anomalous coupling $b_{Z}$ as $(-0.12,0.43)$ and $(-0.10,0.33)$,
while the limits on coupling $\beta_{Z}$ as ($-0.32,0.32$) and $(-0.24,0.24)$
at the electron beam energy $E_{e}=60$ GeV and $E_{e}=140$ GeV, respectively.
