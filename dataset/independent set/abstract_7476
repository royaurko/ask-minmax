We investigate the effect of an incipient ferrolectric transition on vertex
corrections to the superconducting pairing interaction. The vertex corrections
for small momentum transfers are large independent of the type of Boson
responsible for the superconducting transition. The electron-phonon interaction
is found to be enhanced by a nearly ferroelectric medium. We discuss
application to the cuprate superconductors.
