QCD-inspired phenomenological analysis of experimental moments of proton and
deuteron structure functions F2 have been presented. The obtained results on
the d/u ratio at large-x, isospin dependence of higher twists and comparison
with Lattice QCD calculations were discussed. We remind shortly these results:
the obtained ratio is consistent with the asymptotic limit d/u-->0 at x-->1,
the total contribution of higher twists is found to be isospin independent and
the non-singlet moments are in excellent agreement with the Lattice data. We
present here some details of the analysis triggered by the public discussion.
