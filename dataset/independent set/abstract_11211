A new class of integrable theories of 0+1 and 1+1 dimensional dilaton gravity
coupled to any number of scalar fields is introduced. These models are
reducible to systems of independent Liouville equations whose solutions must
satisfy the energy and momentum constraints. The constraints are solved thus
giving the explicit analytic solution of the theory in terms of arbitrary
chiral fields. In particular, these integrable theories describe spherically
symmetric black holes and branes of higher dimensional supergravity theories as
well as superstring motivated cosmological models.
