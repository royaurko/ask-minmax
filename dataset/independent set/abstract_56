We show that there are polynomial-time algorithms to compute maximum
independent sets in the categorical products of two cographs and two
splitgraphs. The ultimate categorical independence ratio of a graph G is
defined as lim_{k --> infty} \alpha(G^k)/n^k. The ultimate categorical
independence ratio is polynomial for cographs, permutation graphs, interval
graphs, graphs of bounded treewidth and splitgraphs. When G is a planar graph
of maximal degree three then alpha(G \times K_4) is NP-complete. We present a
PTAS for the ultimate categorical independence ratio of planar graphs. We
present an O^*(n^{n/3}) exact, exponential algorithm for general graphs. We
prove that the ultimate categorical independent domination ratio for complete
multipartite graphs is zero, except when the graph is complete bipartite with
color classes of equal size (in which case it is 1/2).
