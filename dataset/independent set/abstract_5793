We present supergravity solutions for 1/8-supersymmetric black supertubes
with three charges and three dipoles. Their reduction to five dimensions yields
supersymmetric black rings with regular horizons and two independent angular
momenta. The general solution contains seven independent parameters and
provides the first example of non-uniqueness of supersymmetric black holes. In
ten dimensions, the solutions can be realized as D1-D5-P black supertubes. We
also present a worldvolume construction of a supertube that exhibits three
dipoles explicitly. This description allows an arbitrary cross-section but
captures only one of the angular momenta.
