In this paper, we give an algebraic completeness theorem for constructive
logic with strong negation in terms of finite rough set-based Nelson algebras
determined by quasiorders. We show how for a quasiorder $R$, its rough
set-based Nelson algebra can be obtained by applying the well-known
construction by Sendlewski. We prove that if the set of all $R$-closed
elements, which may be viewed as the set of completely defined objects, is
cofinal, then the rough set-based Nelson algebra determined by a quasiorder
forms an effective lattice, that is, an algebraic model of the logic $E_0$,
which is characterised by a modal operator grasping the notion of "to be
classically valid". We present a necessary and sufficient condition under which
a Nelson algebra is isomorphic to a rough set-based effective lattice
determined by a quasiorder.
