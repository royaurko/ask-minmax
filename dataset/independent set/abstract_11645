Recall that a group $G$ is a Camina group if every nonlinear irreducible
character of $G$ vanishes on $G \setminus G'$. Dark and Scoppola classified the
Camina groups that can occur. We present a different proof of this
classification using Theorem 2, which strengthens a result of Isaacs on Camina
pairs. Theorem 2 is of independent interest.
