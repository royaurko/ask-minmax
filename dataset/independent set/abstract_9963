Inferences in directed acyclic graphs associated with probability sets and
probability intervals are NP-hard, even for polytrees. In this paper we focus
on such inferences, and propose: 1) a substantial improvement on Tessems A / R
algorithm FOR polytrees WITH probability intervals; 2) a new algorithm FOR
direction - based local search(IN sets OF probability) that improves ON
existing methods; 3) a collection OF branch - AND - bound algorithms that
combine the previous techniques.The first two techniques lead TO approximate
solutions, WHILE branch - AND - bound procedures can produce either exact OR
approximate solutions.We report ON dramatic improvements ON existing techniques
FOR inference WITH probability sets AND intervals, IN SOME cases reducing the
computational effort BY many orders OF magnitude.
