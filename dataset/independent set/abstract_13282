Consider the ensemble of real symmetric Toeplitz matrices, each independent
entry an i.i.d. random variable chosen from a fixed probability distribution p
of mean 0, variance 1, and finite higher moments. Previous investigations
showed that the limiting spectral measure (the density of normalized
eigenvalues) converges weakly and almost surely, independent of p, to a
distribution which is almost the standard Gaussian. The deviations from
Gaussian behavior can be interpreted as arising from obstructions to solutions
of Diophantine equations. We show that these obstructions vanish if instead one
considers real symmetric palindromic Toeplitz matrices, matrices where the
first row is a palindrome. A similar result was previously proved for a related
circulant ensemble through an analysis of the explicit formulas for
eigenvalues. By Cauchy's interlacing property and the rank inequality, this
ensemble has the same limiting spectral distribution as the palindromic
Toeplitz matrices; a consequence of combining the two approaches is a version
of the almost sure Central Limit Theorem. Thus our analysis of these
Diophantine equations provides an alternate technique for proving limiting
spectral measures for certain ensembles of circulant matrices.
