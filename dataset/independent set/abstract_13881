We propose a new method to solve the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equations for
weakly bound nuclei, which works for both spherical and axially deformed cases.
In this approach, the quasiparticle wave functions are expanded in a complete
set of analytical Poschl-Teller-Ginocchio and Bessel/Coulomb wave functions.
Correct asymptotic properties of the quasiparticle wave functions are endowed
in the proposed algorithm. Good agreement is obtained with the results of the
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculation using the box boundary condition for a set
of benchmark spherical and deformed nuclei.
