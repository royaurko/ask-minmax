Model-independent observables to pick out the Abelian Z' signal in the Bhabha
process are introduced at energies >= 200 GeV. They measure separately the
Z'-induced vector and axial-vector four-fermion contact couplings. The analysis
of the LEP2 data constrains the value of the Z'-induced vector four-fermion
coupling at the 2-sigma confidence level that corresponds to the Abelian Z'
boson with the mass of order 1 TeV.
