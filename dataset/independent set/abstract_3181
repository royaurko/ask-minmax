This paper considers models of large-scale networks where nodes are
characterized by a set of states describing their local behavior, and by an
explicit mobility model over a two-dimensional lattice. A stochastic model is
given as a Markov population process that is, in general, infeasible to analyze
due to the massive state space sizes involved. Building on recent results on
fluid approximation, such a process admits a limit behavior as a system of
ordinary differential equations, whose size is, unfortunately, dependent on the
number of points in the lattice. Assuming an unbiased random walk model of
nodes mobility, we prove convergence of the stochastic process to the solution
of a system of partial differential equations of reaction-diffusion type. This
provides a macroscopic view of the model which becomes independent of the
lattice granularity, by approximating inherently discrete stochastic movements
with continuous, deterministic diffusions. We illustrate the practical
applicability of this result by modeling a network of mobile nodes with on/off
behavior performing file transfers with connectivity to 802.11 access points. A
numerical validation shows high quality of the approximation even for low
populations and coarse lattices, and excellent speed of convergence with
increasing system sizes.
