The comparison of different sets of PDFs structure functions with the
description of the whole sets of experimental data of electromagnetic form
factors of the proton and neutron is made in the frame work of our model of
t-dependence of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) and some other models.
It is shown that despite a small difference of the description of the inelastic
processes by the different sets of PDF there is an essentially large difference
in the description of electromagnetic form factors of the nucleons.
