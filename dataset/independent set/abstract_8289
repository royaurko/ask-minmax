We study sets of commuting reflection functors in the derived category of
sheaves on Calabi-Yau varieties. We show that such a collection is determined
by a set of mutually orthogonal spherical objects. We also show that when the
spherical objects are locally-free sheaves then the kernel of the composite
transform parametrizes properly torsion-free with zero-dimensional singularity
sets and conversely that such a kernel gives rise to a collection of mutually
orthogonal spherical vector bundles. We do this using a more detailed analysis
of the reason why spherical twists give equivalences.
