Based on the theory of multivariate time changes for Markov processes, we
show how to identify affine processes as solutions of certain time change
equations. The result is a strong version of a theorem presented by J. Kallsen
(2006) which provides a representation in law of an affine process as a
time-change transformation of a family of independent L\'evy processes.
