The effects of charge independence breaking of nucleon-nucleon interaction on
the bulk properties of nuclear matter are investigated. Our results indicate
that at high densities, the inclusion of charge dependence in the
nucleon-nucleon potential affects the bulk properties of nuclear matter.
However, at low densities, this effect is not considerable. It is seen that the
change of our results for the nuclear matter calculations due to the breaking
of the charge independence increases by increasing density. It is shown that
the energy contribution of the $^1S_0$ channel is sensitive to considering the
charge dependence in the nucleon-nucleon interaction. It is indicated that the
effects of charge independence breaking on the calculated equation of state of
nuclear matter are ignorable.
