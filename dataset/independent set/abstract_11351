Gaussian random field on general ultrametric space is introduced as a
solution of pseudodifferential stochastic equation. Covariation of the
introduced random field is computed with the help of wavelet analysis on
ultrametric spaces.
  Notion of ultrametric Markovianity, which describes independence of
contributions to random field from different ultrametric balls is introduced.
We show that the random field under investigation satisfies this property.
