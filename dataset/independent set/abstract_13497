We present comparisons of direct detection data for "light WIMPs" with an
anapole moment interaction (ADM) and a magnetic dipole moment interaction
(MDM), both assuming the Standard Halo Model (SHM) for the dark halo of our
galaxy and in a halo-independent manner. In the SHM analysis we find that a
combination of the 90% CL LUX and CDMSlite limits or the new 90% CL SuperCDMS
limit by itself exclude the parameter space regions allowed by DAMA, CoGeNT and
CDMS-II-Si data for both ADM and MDM. In our halo-independent analysis the new
LUX bound excludes the same potential signal regions as the previous XENON100
bound. Much of the remaining signal regions is now excluded by SuperCDMS, while
the CDMSlite limit is much above them. The situation is of strong tension
between the positive and negative search results both for ADM and MDM. We also
clarify the confusion in the literature about the ADM scattering cross section.
