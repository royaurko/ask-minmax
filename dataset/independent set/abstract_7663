McGrail has shown the existence of a model completion for the universal
theory of fields on which a finite number of commuting derivations act and,
independently, Yaffe has shown the existence of a model completion for the
univeral theory of fields on which a fixed Lie algebra acts as derivations. We
show how to derive the second result from the first.
