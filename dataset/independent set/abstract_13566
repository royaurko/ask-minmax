We recently reported the first detection of an astrophysical gamma-ray
polarization from GRB021206 using the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar
Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) spacecraft. Our analysis suggested gamma-ray
polarization at an astoundingly high level, 80+/-20%. A recent manuscript
re-analyzes this event in the RHESSI data, and sets an upper limit on potential
polarization of 4.1% -- clearly inconsistent with our initial analysis. This
manuscript raises a number of important concerns about the analysis, which are
already being addressed in a separate methods paper under preparation. We note
here, however, that the limit set on the potential polarization by this
re-analysis is significantly underestimated using their novel statistical
methods.
