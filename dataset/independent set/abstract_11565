We show that the Coulomb drag effect exhibits saturation at small
temperatures, when calculated to the third order in the interlayer
interactions. The zero-temperature transresistance is inversely proportional to
the third power of the dimensionless sheet conductance. The effect is therefore
the strongest in low mobility samples. This behavior should be contrasted with
the conventional (second order) prediction that the transresistance scales as a
certain power of temperature and is almost mobility-independent. The result
demonstrates that the zero-temperature drag is not an unambiguous signature of
a strongly-coupled state in double-layer systems.
