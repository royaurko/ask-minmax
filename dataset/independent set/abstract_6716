In Diagonally Non-Computable Functions and Bi-Immunity, Carl Jockusch and
Andrew Lewis proved that every DNC function computes a bi-immune set. They
asked whether every DNC function computes an effectively bi-immune set. We
construct a DNC function that computes no effectively bi-immune set, thereby
answering their question in the negative.
