We prove that if y" = f(y,y',t,\alpha, \beta,..) is a generic Painleve
equation (i.e. an equation in one of the families PI-PVI but with the complex
parameters \alpha, \beta,.. algebraically independent) then any algebraic
dependence over C(t) between a set of solutions and their derivatives
(y_1,..,y_n,y_1',..,y_n') is witnessed by a pair of solutions and their
derivatives (y_i,y_i',y_j,y_j'). The proof combines work by the Japanese school
on "irreducibility" of the Painleve equations, with the trichomoty theorem for
strongly minimal sets in differentially closed fields.
