In the present article, using a further generalization of the algebraic
method of separation of variables, the Dirac equation is separated in a family
of space-times where it is not possible to find a complete set of first order
commuting differential operators. After separating variables, the Dirac
equation is reduced to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations and
some exact solutions corresponding to cosmological backgrounds and
gravitational waves are computed in terms of hypergeometric functions. By
passing, the Klein Gordon equation in this background field is discussed.
