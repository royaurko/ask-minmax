Given a closed, convex and pointed cone K in R^n, we present a result which
infers K-irreducibility of sets of K-quasipositive matrices from strong
connectedness of certain bipartite digraphs. The matrix-sets are defined via
products, and the main result is relevant to applications in biology and
chemistry. Several examples are presented.
