In this note we generalize and prove a recent conjecture of Varchenko
concerning the number of critical points of a (multivalued) meromorphic
function $\phi$ on an algebraic manifold. Under certain conditions, this number
turns out to coincide with the Euler characteristic (up to a sign) of the
complement of the divisor of $\phi$. A few variants of this basic situation are
also discussed. Two independent proofs are given, respectively using Chern
classes and Morse theory
  In its original form, this counting problem arises (in special cases) in
evaluating the asymptotics of correlation functions of Wess--Zumino--Witten
conformal field theory.
