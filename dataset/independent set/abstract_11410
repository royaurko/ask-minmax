We determine conditions for the quantisation of graphs using the Dirac
operator for both two and four component spinors. According to the
Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture for such systems with time-reversal symmetry
the energy level statistics are expected, in the semiclassical limit, to
correspond to those of random matrices from the Gaussian symplectic ensemble.
This is confirmed by numerical investigation. The scattering matrix used to
formulate the quantisation condition is found to be independent of the type of
spinor. We derive an exact trace formula for the spectrum and use this to
investigate the form factor in the diagonal approximation.
