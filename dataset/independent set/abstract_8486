When a random field $(X_t, \ t\in {\mathbb R}^2)$ is thresholded on a given
level $u$, the excursion set is given by its indicator $~1_{[u, \infty)}(X_t)$.
The purpose of this work is to study functionals (as established in stochastic
geometry) of these random excursion sets, as e.g. the capacity functional as
well as the second moment measure of the boundary length. It extends results
obtained for the one-dimensional case to the two-dimensional case, with tools
borrowed from crossings theory, in particular Rice methods, and from integral
and stochastic geometry.
