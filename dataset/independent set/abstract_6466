We give an axiomatization of confidence transfer - a known conditioning
scheme - from the perspective of expectation-based inference in the sense of
Gardenfors and Makinson. Then, we use the notion of belief independence to
"filter out" different proposal s of possibilistic conditioning rules, all are
variations of confidence transfer. Among the three rules that we consider, only
Dempster's rule of conditioning passes the test of supporting the notion of
belief independence. With the use of this conditioning rule, we then show that
we can use local computation for computing desired conditional marginal
possibilities of the joint possibility satisfying the given constraints. It
turns out that our local computation scheme is already proposed by Shenoy.
However, our intuitions are completely different from that of Shenoy. While
Shenoy just defines a local computation scheme that fits his framework of
valuation-based systems, we derive that local computation scheme from II(,8) =
tI(,8 I a) * II(a) and appropriate independence assumptions, just like how the
Bayesians derive their local computation scheme.
