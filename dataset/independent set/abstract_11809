We perform direct numerical simulations of forced and freely decaying 3D
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in order to model magnetic field evolution
during cosmological phase transitions in the early Universe. Our approach
assumes the existence of a magnetic field generated either by a process during
inflation or shortly thereafter, or by bubble collisions during a phase
transition. We show that the final configuration of the magnetic field depends
on the initial conditions, while the velocity field is nearly independent of
initial conditions.
