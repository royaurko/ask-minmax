We study the activation process in undirected graphs known as bootstrap
percolation: a vertex is active either if it belongs to a set of initially
activated vertices or if at some point it had at least r active neighbors, for
a threshold r that is identical for all vertices. A contagious set is a vertex
set whose activation results with the entire graph being active. Let m(G,r) be
the size of a smallest contagious set in a graph G.
  We examine density conditions that ensure that a given n-vertex graph G=(V,E)
has a small contagious set. With respect to the minimum degree, we prove that
if G has minimum degree n/2 then m(G,2)=2. We also provide tight upper bounds
on the number of rounds until all nodes are active. For n >= k >= r, we denote
by M(n,k,r) the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex graph G satisfying
m(G,r)>k. We determine the precise value of M(n,k,2) and M(n,k,k) assuming that
n is sufficiently large compared to k.
