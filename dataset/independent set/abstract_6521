We show that the decidability of the first-order theory of the language that
combines Boolean algebras of sets of uninterpreted elements with Presburger
arithmetic operations. We thereby disprove a recent conjecture that this theory
is undecidable. Our language allows relating the cardinalities of sets to the
values of integer variables, and can distinguish finite and infinite sets. We
use quantifier elimination to show the decidability and obtain an elementary
upper bound on the complexity.
  Precise program analyses can use our decidability result to verify
representation invariants of data structures that use an integer field to
represent the number of stored elements.
