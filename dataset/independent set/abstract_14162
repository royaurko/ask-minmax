We use the Pieri and Giambelli formulas of arXiv:0809.4966 and
arXiv:1109.6669 and the calculus of raising operators developed in
arXiv:0811.2781 and arXiv:0812.0639 to prove a tableau formula for eta
polynomials of arXiv:1109.6669 and the Stanley symmetric functions which
correspond to Grassmannian elements of the Weyl group $W_n$ of type $D_n$. We
define the skew elements of $W_n$ and exhibit a bijection between the set of
reduced words for any skew element $w$ in $W_n$ and a set of certain standard
typed tableaux on a skew shape $\lambda/\mu$ associated to $w$.
