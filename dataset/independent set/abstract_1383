We examine a density-independent modification of the Vicsek model in which a
particle interacts with neighbors defined by Delaunay triangulation. To
feasibly simulate the model, an algorithm for repairing the triangulation over
time was developed. This algorithm may also be applied to any time-varying
two-dimensional Delaunay triangulation. This model exhibits a continuous phase
transition with noise, and a distinct set of critical exponents were measured
which satisfy a hyperscaling relationship. The critical exponents are found to
vary between a low and high velocity regime, but they are robust under the
inclusion of a repulsive interaction. We present evidence that the correlation
length approximately scales with the size of the system even in the ordered
phase.
