We study the computably enumerable sets in terms of the: (a) Kolmogorov
complexity of their initial segments; (b) Kolmogorov complexity of finite
programs when they are used as oracles. We present an extended discussion of
the existing research on this topic, along with recent developments and open
problems. Besides this survey, our main original result is the following
characterization of the computably enumerable sets with trivial initial segment
prefix-free complexity. A computably enumerable set $A$ is $K$-trivial if and
only if the family of sets with complexity bounded by the complexity of $A$ is
uniformly computable from the halting problem.
