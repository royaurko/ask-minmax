In this article we prove estimates for the topological pressure of the set of
points whose Birkhoff time averages are far from the space averages
corresponding to the unique equilibrium state that has a weak Gibbs property.
In particular, if $f$ has an expanding repeller and $\phi$ is an H\"older
continuous potential we prove that the topological pressure of the set of
points whose accumulation values of Birkhoff averages belong to some interval
$I\subset \mathbb R$ can be expressed in terms of the topological pressure of
the whole system and the large deviations rate function. As a byproduct we
deduce that most irregular sets for maps with the specification property have
topological pressure strictly smaller than the whole system. Some extensions to
a non-uniformly hyperbolic setting, level-2 irregular sets and hyperbolic flows
are also given.
