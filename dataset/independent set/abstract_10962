We discuss the photon to meson transition form factor for virtual photons,
which can be measured in e+ e- collisions. We demonstrate that this form factor
is independent of the shape of the meson distribution amplitude over a wide
kinematical range. This leads to a parameter-free prediction of perturbative
QCD to leading twist accuracy, which has a status comparable to the famous
leading-twist prediction of the cross section ratio R.
