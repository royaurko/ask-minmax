Fusion coefficients for affine Lie algebras are fixed by the corresponding
tensor-product coefficients and a set of threshold levels. It is shown how the
information concerning the threshold level is coded in the fusion basis, which
is a set of inequalities that completely describes the fusion coefficients. The
construction of the su(2) fusion basis is presented in detail.
