The purpose of this article is to produce effective versions of some rigidity
results in algebra and geometry. On the geometric side, we focus on the
spectrum of primitive geodesic lengths for arithmetic hyperbolic 2-- and
3--manifolds. By work of Reid and Chinburg--Hamilton--Long--Reid, this spectrum
determines the commensurability class of the manifold. We establish effective
versions of these rigidity results by ensuring that, for two incommensurable
arithmetic manifolds of bounded volume, the primitive length sets must disagree
for a length that can be bounded as a function of volume. We also prove an
effective version of a similar rigidity result recently established by the
second contributor with Reid on a surface analog of the primitive length spectrum
for hyperbolic 3--manifolds. These effective results have corresponding
algebraic analogs involving maximal subfields and quaternion subalgebras of
quaternion algebras. To prove these effective rigidity results, we establish
results on the asymptotic behavior of certain algebraic and geometric counting
functions which are of independent interest.
