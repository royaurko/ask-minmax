We construct new supersymmetric solutions, including AdS bubbles, in an N=2
truncation of five-dimensional N=8 gauged supergravity. This particular
truncation is given by N=2 gauged supergravity coupled to two vector multiples
and three incomplete hypermultiplets, and was originally investigated in the
context of obtaining regular AdS bubble geometries with multiple active
R-charges. We focus on cohomogeneity-one solutions corresponding to objects
with two equal angular momenta and up to three independent R-charges.
Curiously, we find a new set of zero and negative mass solitons asymptotic to
AdS_5/Z_k, for k \ge 3, which are everywhere regular without closed timelike
curves.
