We propose a new homomorphic encryption scheme based on the hardness of
decoding under independent random noise from certain affine families of codes.
Unlike in previous lattice-based homomorphic encryption schemes, where the
message is hidden in the noisy part of the ciphertext, our scheme carries the
message in the affine part of the transformation and applies noise only to
achieve security. Our scheme can tolerate noise of arbitrary magnitude, as long
as the noise vector has sufficiently small hamming weight (and its entries are
independent).
  Our design achieves "proto-homomorphic" properties in an elementary manner:
message addition and multiplication are emulated by pointwise addition and
multiplication of the ciphertext vectors. Moreover, the extremely simple nature
of our decryption makes the scheme easily amenable to bootstrapping. However,
some complications are caused by the inherent presence of noticeable encryption
error. Our main technical contribution is the development of two new techniques
for handling this error in the homomorphic evaluation process.
  We also provide a definitional framework for homomorphic encryption that may
be useful elsewhere.
