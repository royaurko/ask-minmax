In real world everything is an object which represents particular classes.
Every object can be fully described by its attributes. Any real world dataset
contains large number of attributes and objects. Classifiers give poor
performance when these huge datasets are given as input to it for proper
classification. So from these huge dataset most useful attributes need to be
extracted that contribute the maximum to the decision. In the paper, attribute
set is reduced by generating reducts using the indiscernibility relation of
Rough Set Theory (RST). The method measures similarity among the attributes
using relative indiscernibility relation and computes attribute similarity set.
Then the set is minimized and an attribute similarity table is constructed from
which attribute similar to maximum number of attributes is selected so that the
resultant minimum set of selected attributes (called reduct) cover all
attributes of the attribute similarity table. The method has been applied on
glass dataset collected from the UCI repository and the classification accuracy
is calculated by various classifiers. The result shows the efficiency of the
proposed method.
