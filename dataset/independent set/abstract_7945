We give a presentation of the fundamental exterior differential system
introduced in [arxiv1112.3213] and apply it to the case of dimension 3. Here we
find new global invariants of the intrinsic geometry of oriented Riemaniann
3-manifolds. A new independent proof for dim 2 and 3 gives further insight on
the, fundamentally important, differential system.
