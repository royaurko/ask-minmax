We introduce a voting model that is similar to a Keynesian beauty contest and
analyze it from a mathematical point of view. There are two types of
voters-copycat and independent-and two candidates. Our voting model is a
binomial distribution (independent voters) doped in a beta binomial
distribution (copycat voters). We find that the phase transition in this system
is at the upper limit of $t$, where $t$ is the time (or the number of the
votes). Our model contains three phases. If copycats constitute a majority or
even half of the total voters, the voting rate converges more slowly than it
would in a binomial distribution. If independents constitute the majority of
voters, the voting rate converges at the same rate as it would in a binomial
distribution. We also study why it is difficult to estimate the conclusion of a
Keynesian beauty contest when there is an information cascade.
