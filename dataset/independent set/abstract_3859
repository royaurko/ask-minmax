During the Arizona Winter School 2008 (held in Tucson, AZ) we worked on the
following problems:
  a) (Expanding a remark by S. Lang). Define $E_0 = \overline{\mathbb{Q}}$
Inductively, for $n \geq 1$, define $E_n$ as the algebraic closure of the field
generated over $E_{n-1}$ by the numbers $\exp(x)=e^x$, where $x$ ranges over
$E_{n-1}$. Let $E$ be the union of $E_n$, $n \geq 0$. Show that Schanuel's
Conjecture implies that the numbers $\pi, \log \pi, \log \log \pi, \log \log
\log \pi, \ldots $ are algebraically independent over $E$.
  b) Try to get a (conjectural) generalization involving the field $L$ defined
as follows. Define $L_0 = \overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. Inductively, for $n \geq 1$,
define $L_n$ as the algebraic closure of the field generated over $L_{n-1}$ by
the numbers $y$, where $y$ ranges over the set of complex numbers such that
$e^y\in L_{n-1}$. Let $L$ be the union of $L_n$, $n \geq 0$.
  We were able to prove that Schanuel's Conjecture implies $E$ and $L$ are
linearly disjoint over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$.
