In Bayesian nonparametric models, Gaussian processes provide a popular prior
choice for regression function estimation. Existing literature on the
theoretical investigation of the resulting posterior distribution almost
exclusively assume a fixed design for covariates. The only random design result
we are aware of (van der Vaart & van Zanten, 2011) assumes the assigned
Gaussian process to be supported on the smoothness class specified by the true
function with probability one. This is a fairly restrictive assumption as it
essentially rules out the Gaussian process prior with a squared exponential
kernel when modeling rougher functions. In this article, we show that an
appropriate rescaling of the above Gaussian process leads to a rate-optimal
posterior distribution even when the covariates are independently realized from
a known density on a compact set. The proofs are based on deriving sharp
concentration inequalities for frequentist kernel estimators; the results might
be of independent interest.
