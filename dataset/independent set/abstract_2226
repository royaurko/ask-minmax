A new method to study the effects of neutrino masses on a supernova neutrino
signal is proposed. The method relies exclusively on the analysis of the full
statistics of neutrino events, it is independent of astrophysical assumptions,
and does not require the observation of any additional phenomenon to trace
possible delays in the neutrino arrival times. The sensitivity of the method to
the sub-eV neutrino mass range, defined as the capability of disentangling at
95% c.l. the case $m_\nu=1$eV from $m_\nu=0$, is tested by analyzing a set of
synthetic neutrino samples modeled according to the signal that could be
detected at SuperKamiokande. For a supernova at the Galactic center success is
achieved in more than 50% of the cases. It is argued that a future Galactic
supernova yielding several thousands of inverse $\beta$ decays might provide
enough information to explore a neutrino mass range somewhat below 1 eV.
