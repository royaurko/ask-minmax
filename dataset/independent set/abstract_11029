We comment on the relation of our previous work on the classical gluodynamics
of high energy nuclear collisions to recent work by Lappi (hep-ph/0303076).
While our results for the non-perturbative number liberation coefficient agree,
those for the energy disagree by a factor of 2. This discrepancy can be traced
to an overall normalization error in our non-perturbative formula for the
energy. When corrected for, all previous results are in excellent agreement
with those of Lappi. The implications of the results of these two independent
computations for RHIC phenomenology are noted.
