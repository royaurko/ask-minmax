Axial vector torsion in the Einstein-Cartan space $U_{4}$ is considered here.
By picking a particular term from the SO(4,1) Pontryagin density and then
modifying it in a SO(3,1) invariant way, we get a Lagrangian density with
Lagrange multipliers. Then considering torsion and torsion-less connection as
independent fields, it has been found that $\kappa$ and $\lambda$ of
Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian, appear as integration constants in such a way that
$\kappa$ has been found to be linked with the topological Nieh-Yan density of
$U_{4}$ space.
