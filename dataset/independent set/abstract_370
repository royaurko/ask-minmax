A set of general relations between the spin-independent and spin-dependent
potentials of heavy quark and anti-quark interactions are derived from
reparameterization invariance in the Heavy Quark Effective Theory. It covers
the Gromes relation and includes some new interesting relations which are
useful in understanding the spin-independent and spin-dependent relativistic
corrections to the leading order nonrelativistic potential.
