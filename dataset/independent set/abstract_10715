It is well known that carriers of astrophysical information are massless
spinning particles. These carriers are photons, neutrinos and, expectedly,
gravitons. All these particles are emitted during supernova events. Information
carried by these particles characterize their sources, but such information are
affected by the trajectories of the carriers. Recently, it is shown that these
trajectories are spin dependent. Knowing these trajectories and the arrival
times of such particles to the detectors, a spin dependent model is constructed
and compared with the conventional spin independent model.
