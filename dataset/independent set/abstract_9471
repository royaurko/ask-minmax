We describe various classes of infinitely presented groups that are
condensation points in the space of marked groups. A well-known class of such
groups consists of finitely generated groups admitting an infinite minimal
presentation. We introduce here a larger class of condensation groups, called
infinitely independently presentable groups, and establish criteria which allow
one to infer that a group is infinitely independently presentable. In addition,
we construct examples of finitely generated groups with no minimal
presentation, among them infinitely presented groups with Cantor-Bendixson rank
1, and we prove that every infinitely presented metabelian group is a
condensation group.
