We take a fresh look at the logics of informational dependence and
independence of Hintikka and Sandu and Vaananen, and their compositional
semantics due to Hodges. We show how Hodges' semantics can be seen as a special
case of a general construction, which provides a context for a useful
completeness theorem with respect to a wider class of models. We shed some new
light on each aspect of the logic. We show that the natural propositional logic
carried by the semantics is the logic of Bunched Implications due to Pym and
O'Hearn, which combines intuitionistic and multiplicative connectives. This
introduces several new connectives not previously considered in logics of
informational dependence, but which we show play a very natural role, most
notably intuitionistic implication. As regards the quantifiers, we show that
their interpretation in the Hodges semantics is forced, in that they are the
image under the general construction of the usual Tarski semantics; this
implies that they are adjoints to substitution, and hence uniquely determined.
As for the dependence predicate, we show that this is definable from a simpler
predicate, of constancy or dependence on nothing. This makes essential use of
the intuitionistic implication. The Armstrong axioms for functional dependence
are then recovered as a standard set of axioms for intuitionistic implication.
We also prove a full abstraction result in the style of Hodges, in which the
intuitionistic implication plays a very natural r\^ole.
