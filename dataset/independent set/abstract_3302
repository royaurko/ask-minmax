The dynamic properties of the quiet Sun photosphere can be investigated by
analyzing the pair dispersion of small-scale magnetic fields (i.e., magnetic
elements).
  By using $25$ hr-long Hinode magnetograms at high spatial resolution
($0".3$), we tracked $68,490$ magnetic element pairs within a supergranular
cell near the disk center.
  The computed pair separation spectrum, calculated on the whole set of
particle pairs independently of their initial separation, points out what is
known as a super-diffusive regime with spectral index $\gamma=1.55\pm0.05$, in
agreement with the most recent literature, but extended to unprecedented
spatial and temporal scales (from granular to supergranular). Furthermore, for
the first time, we investigated here the spectrum of the mean square
displacement of pairs of magnetic elements, depending on their initial
separation $r_0$. We found that there is a typical initial distance above
(below) which the pair separation is faster (slower) than the average. A
possible physical interpretation of such a typical spatial scale is also
provided.
