Many socio-economic phenomena are characterized by the appearance of a few
"hit" products having a substantially higher popularity compared to their often
equivalent competitors, reflected in a bimodal distribution of response
(success). Using the example of box-office performance of movies, we show that
the empirically observed bimodality can emerge via self-organization in a model
where agents (theatres) independently decide whether to adapt a new movie. The
response exhibits extreme variability even in the absence of learning or
communication between agents and suggests that properly timing the release is a
key determinant of box-office success.
