We derive a closed form expression for the long wavelength limit of the
effective action for hard thermal loops in an external gravitational field. It
is a function of the metric, independent of time derivatives. It is compared
and contrasted with the static limit, and with the corresponding limits in an
external Yang-Mills field.
