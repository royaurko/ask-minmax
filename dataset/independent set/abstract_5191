We characterize those standard models M of ZFC which are embeddable, as the
class of all standard sets, in a model of internal set theory IST. The
necessary and sufficient condition is that 1) there is a wellordering < of M
which does not destroy the ZFC schemata, and 2) the truth relation for (M,<)
does not destroy Separation.
  The result is interpreted as the answer for the question in the title.
