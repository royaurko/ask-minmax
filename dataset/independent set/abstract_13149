We investigate the effects on cosmological clustering statistics of empirical
biasing, where the galaxy distribution is a local transformation of the
present-day Eulerian density field. The effects of the suppression of galaxy
numbers in voids, and their enhancement in regions of high density, are
considered, independently and in combination. We compare results from numerical
simulations with the predictions of simple analytic models. We find that the
bias is generally scale-dependent, so that the shape of the galaxy power
spectrum differs from that of the underlying mass distribution. The degree of
bias is always a monotonic function of scale, tending to an asymptotic value on
scales where the density fluctuations are linear. The scale dependence is often
rather weak, with many reasonable prescriptions giving a bias which is nearly
independent of scale. We have investigated whether such an Eulerian bias can
reconcile a range of theoretical power spectra with the twin requirements of
fitting the galaxy power spectrum and reproducing the observed mass-to-light
ratios in clusters. It is not possible to satisfy these constraints for any
member of the family of CDM-like power spectra in an Einstein - de Sitter
universe when normalised to match COBE on large scales and galaxy cluster
abundances on intermediate scales. We discuss what modifications of the mass
power spectrum might produce agreement with the observational data.
