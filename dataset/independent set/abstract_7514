We propose a method for measuring the hadron charge asymmetry in $\ee$
collisions which is based upon the fragmentation function formalism, and is
largely independent of modelling of fragmentation effects. Furthermore, in this
method, QCD radiative corrections can be accounted for in a systematic way.
