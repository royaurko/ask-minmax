We have mapped the central 10'x10' of the dense core TMC-1C at 450, 850 and
1200 microns using SCUBA on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope and MAMBO on the
IRAM 30m telescope. We show that although one can, in principle, use images at
these wavelengths to map the emissivity spectral index, temperature and column
density independently, noise and calibration errors would have to be less than
2% to accurately derive these three quantities from a set of three emission
maps. Because our data are not this free of errors, we use our emission maps to
fit the dust temperature and column density assuming a constant value of the
emissivity spectral index and explore the effects of noise on the derived
physical parameters. We find that the derived extinction values for TMC-1C are
large for a starless core (80 mag Av), and the derived temperatures are low (6
K) in the densest regions of the core, using our derived value of beta = 1.8.
