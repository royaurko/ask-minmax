QCD at finite, flavor independent quark mass is analyzed by using bottom-up
holography in the Veneziano limit, where the backreaction of quarks to the
gluon dynamics is fully included. The dependence on the quark mass of
observables such as the bound state masses, the chiral condensate, the
S-parameter, and the critical temperatures is studied. Many of the results are
argued to be universal, i.e., independent of the details of the holographic
model, and compared to explicit computations in the V-QCD models. The effect of
adding four-fermion operators in QCD is also discussed.
