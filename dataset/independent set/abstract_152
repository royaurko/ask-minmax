We present strong versions of Marstrand's projection theorems and other
related theorems. For example, if E is a plane set of positive and finite
s-dimensional Hausdorff measure, there is a set X of directions of Lebesgue
measure 0, such that the projection onto any line with direction outside X, of
any subset F of E of positive s-dimensional measure, has Hausdorff dimension
min(1,s), i.e. the set of exceptional directions is independent of F. Using
duality this leads to results on the dimension of sets that intersect families
of lines or hyperplanes in positive Lebesgue measure.
