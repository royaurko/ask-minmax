We derive an expression for the quasinormal modes of scalar perturbations in
near extreme d-dimensional Schwarzschild-de Sitter and Reissner-Nordstrom-de
Sitter black holes. We show that, in the near extreme limit, the dynamics of
the scalar field is characterized by a Poschl-Teller effective potential. The
results are qualitatively independent of the spacetime dimension and field
mass.
