We show that fluctuations in elliptic anisotropy in heavy-ion collisions can
be used to significantly reduce the contribution of transverse-momentum
conservation, and of all background effects independent on the orientation of
the reaction plane, from an observable of the chiral magnetic effect. We argue
that for a given impact parameter, the magnetic field is approximately
independent of the fluctuating shape of the fireball.
