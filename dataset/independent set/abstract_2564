Methods are set forth for determining the hadron electromagnetic structure in
the sub-$N\bar{N}$-threshold timelike region of the virtual-photon ``mass'' and
for investigating the nucleon weak structure in the spacelike region from
experimental data on the process $\pi N\to e^+e^- N$ at low energies. These
methods are formulated using the unified description of photoproduction,
electroproduction, and inverse electroproduction of pions in the first
resonance region in the framework of the dispersion-relation model and on the
basis of the model-independent properties of inverse electroproduction.
Applications of these methods are also shown.
