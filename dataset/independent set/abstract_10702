For the non-rotating BTZ black hole, the distributional curvature tensor
field is found. It is shown to have singular parts proportional to a
$\delta$-distribution with support at the origin. This singularity is related,
through Einstein field equations, to a point source. Coordinate invariance and
independence on the choice of differentiable structure of the results are
addressed.
