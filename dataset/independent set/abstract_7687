We consider the joint distribution of real and imaginary parts of eigenvalues
of random matrices with independent real entries with mean zero and unit
variance. We prove the convergence of this distribution to the uniform
distribution on the unit disc without assumptions on the existence of a density
for the distribution of entries. We assume however that the entries have
sub-Gaussian tails or are sparsely non-zero.
