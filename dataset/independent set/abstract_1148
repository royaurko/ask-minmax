Thomassen proved that any plane graph of girth 5 is list-colorable from any
list assignment such that all vertices have lists of size two or three and the
vertices with list of size two are all incident with the outer face and form an
independent set. We present a strengthening of this result, relaxing the
constraint on the vertices with list of size two. This result is used to bound
the size of the 3-list-coloring critical plane graphs with one precolored face.
