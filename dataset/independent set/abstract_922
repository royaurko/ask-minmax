We consider radiation transport theory applied to non-dispersive but
refractive media. This setting is used to discuss Minkowski's and Abraham's
electromagnetic momentum, and to derive conservation equations independent of
the choice of momentum definition. Using general relativistic kinetic theory,
we derive and discuss a radiation gas energy-momentum conservation equation
valid in arbitrary curved spacetime with diffractive media.
