Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a statistical method often used to
decompose a complex dataset in its independent sub-parts. It is a powerful
technique to solve a typical Blind Source Separation problem. A fast
calculation of the gamma ray sky observed by GLAST, assuming the expected
instrumental response, has been implemented. The simulated images were used to
test the capability of the ICA method in identifying the sources.
