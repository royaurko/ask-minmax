A new limit for the neutron electric dipole moment has been recently
reported. This new limit is obtained by combining the result from a previous
experiment with the result from a more recent experiment that has much worse
statistical accuracy. We show that the old result has a systematic error
possibly four times greater than the new limit, and under the circumstances,
averaging of the old and new results is statistically invalid. The conclusion
is that it would be more appropriate to quote two independent but mutually
supportive limits as obtained from each experiment separately.
