A $k$-uniform family of subsets of $[n]$ is intersecting if it does not
contain a disjoint pair of sets. The study of intersecting families is central
to extremal set theory, dating back to the seminal Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem of
1961 that bounds the largest such families. A recent trend has been to
investigate the structure of set families with few disjoint pairs.
  Friedgut and Regev proved a general removal lemma, showing that when $\gamma
n \le k \le (\tfrac12 - \gamma)n$, a set family with few disjoint pairs can be
made intersecting by removing few sets. Our main contribution in this paper is
to provide a simple proof of a special case of this theorem, when the family
has size close to $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$. However, our theorem holds for all $2 \le
k < \tfrac12 n$ and provides sharp quantitative estimates.
  We then use this removal lemma to settle a question of Bollob\'as, Narayanan
and Raigorodskii regarding the independence number of random subgraphs of the
Kneser graph $K(n,k)$. The Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem shows $\alpha(K(n,k)) =
\binom{n-1}{k-1}$. For some constant $c > 0$ and $k \le cn$, we determine the
sharp threshold for when this equality holds for random subgraphs of $K(n,k)$,
and provide strong bounds on the critical probability for $k \le \tfrac12
(n-3)$.
