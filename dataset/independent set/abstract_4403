321 Galactic fundamental-mode Cepheids with good B,V,I photometry by
Berdnikov et al. 2000 and with homogenized color excesses E(B-V) based on
Fernie et al. 1995 are used to determine their P-C relation in the range
0.4<log P<1.6. Distances of 25 Cepheids in open clusters (Feast 1999) and of 28
Cepheids with BBW distances (Gieren et al. 1998) are used in a first step to
determine the absorption coefficients R_B=4.17, R_V=3.17, and R_I=1.89. The two
sets define two independent P-L relations which agree very well in slope. They
are therefore combined into a single mean Galactic P-L relation. Galactic
Cepheids are redder in (B-V) than those in LMC and SMC as shown by the over
1000 Cloud Cepheids with good standard B,V,I photometry by Udalski et al 1999.
Also the (B-V), (V-I) two-color diagrams differ between Cepheids in the Galaxy
and the Clouds, attributed both to the effects of metallicity differences, on
the spectral energy distributions of the Cepheids and to a shift in the
effective temperature of the middle of the instability strip for LMC and SMC
relative to the Galaxy by about Delta log Te ~ 0.02 at M_V=-4.0 mag, hotter for
both LMC and SMC. Differences in the P-C relations between the Galaxy and the
Clouds show that there cannot be a universal P-L relation from galaxy-to-galaxy
in any given color. The inferred non-uniqueness of the slope of the P-L
relations in the Galaxy, LMC, and SMC is born out by the observations. The
Cloud Cepheids follow a shallower overall slope of the P-L relations in B,V,I
than the Galactic ones. LMC and SMC Cepheids are brighter in V than in the
Galaxy by up to 0.5 mag at short periods and fainter at long periods.
