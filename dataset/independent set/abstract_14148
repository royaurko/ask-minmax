We consider the problem of determining the maximum induced density of a graph
H in any graph on n vertices. The limit of this density as n tends to infinity
is called the inducibility of H. The exact value of this quantity is known only
for a handful of small graphs and a specific set of complete multipartite
graphs. Answering questions of Brown-Sidorenko and Exoo we determine the
inducibility of K_{1,1,2} and the paw graph. The proof is obtained using
semi-definite programming techniques based on a modern language of extremal
graph theory, which we develop in full detail in an accessible setting.
