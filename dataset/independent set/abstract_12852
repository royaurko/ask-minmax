We make comparison of the dynamics of the diagonal and nondiagonal Bianchi IX
models near the cosmological singularity. Applying the dynamical system methods
leads to the result that in both cases the spaces of critical points are of the
nonhyperbolic type. However, the topologies of the critical spaces are quite
different. We conjecture that the nondiagonal case may correspond to a new type
of chaos different from the one specific to the commonly known diagonal one.
Obtained results are independent, to some extent, on the choice of the
variables parameterizing the physical phase space.
