From the analysis of a set of airborne images of ship wakes, we show that the
wake angles decrease as $U^{-1}$ at large velocities, in a way similar to the
Mach cone for supersonic airplanes. This previously unnoticed Mach-like regime
is in contradiction with the celebrated Kelvin prediction of a constant angle
of $19.47\degree$ independent of the ship's speed. We propose here a model,
confirmed by numerical simulations, in which the finite size of the disturbance
explains this transition between the Kelvin and Mach regimes at a Froude number
$Fr = U/\sqrt{gL} \simeq 0.5$, where $L$ is the hull ship length.
