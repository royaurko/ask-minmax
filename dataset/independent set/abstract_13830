We discuss the twistor correspondence between complex vector bundles over a
self-dual four-dimensional manifold and holomorphic bundles over its twistor
space and describe the moduli space of self-dual Yang-Mills fields in terms of
Cech and Dolbeault cohomology sets. The cohomological description provides the
geometric interpretation of symmetries of the self-dual Yang-Mills equations.
