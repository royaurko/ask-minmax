In this paper we study the dynamics of regular polynomial automorphisms of
C^n. These maps provide a natural generalization of complex Henon maps in C^2
to higher dimensions. For a given regular polynomial automorphism f we
construct a filtration in C^n which has particular escape properties for the
orbits of f. In the case when f is hyperbolic we obtain a complete description
of its orbits. In the second part of the paper we study the Hausdorff and box
dimension of the Julia sets of f. We show that the Julia set J has positive box
dimension, and (provided f is not volume preserving) that the filled-in Julia
set K has box dimension strictly less than 2n. Moreover, if f is hyperbolic,
then the Hausdorff dimension of the forward/backward Julia set J^{+/-} is
strictly less than 2n.
