The detection of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) was one of
the most important cosmological discoveries of the last century. With the
development of interferometric gravitational wave detectors, we may be in a
position to detect the gravitational equivalent of the CMB in this century. The
Cosmic Gravitational Background (CGB) is likely to be isotropic and stochastic,
making it difficult to distinguish from instrument noise. The contribution from
the CGB can be isolated by cross-correlating the signals from two or more
independent detectors. Here we extend previous studies that considered the
cross-correlation of two Michelson channels by calculating the optimal signal
to noise ratio that can be achieved by combining the full set of interferometry
variables that are available with a six link triangular interferometer. In
contrast to the two channel case, we find that the relative orientation of a
pair of coplanar detectors does not affect the signal to noise ratio. We apply
our results to the detector design described in the Big Bang Observer (BBO)
mission concept study and find that BBO could detect a background with
$\Omega_{gw} > 2.2 \times 10^{-17}$.
