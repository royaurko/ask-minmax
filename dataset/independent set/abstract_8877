In this paper, we show how certain ``stability phenomena'' in unpointed model
categories provide the sets of homotopy classes with the structure of abelian
heaps, i.e. abelian groups without a choice of a zero. In contrast with the
classical situation of stable (pointed) model categories, these sets can be
empty.
