Seismology of stars that exhibit solar-like oscillations develops a growing
interest with the wealth of observational results obtained with the CoRoT and
Kepler space-borne missions. In this framework, relations between asteroseismic
quantities and stellar parameters provide a unique opportunity to derive
model-independent determinations of stellar parameters (e.g., masses and radii)
for a large sample of stars. I review those scaling relations with particular
emphasis on the underlying physical processes governing those relations, as
well as their uncertainties.
