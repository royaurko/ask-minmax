Distance-preserving mappings (DPMs) are mappings from the set of all q-ary
vectors of a fixed length to the set of permutations of the same or longer
length such that every two distinct vectors are mapped to permutations with the
same or even larger Hamming distance than that of the vectors. In this paper,
we propose a construction of DPMs from ternary vectors. The constructed DPMs
improve the lower bounds on the maximal size of permutation arrays.
