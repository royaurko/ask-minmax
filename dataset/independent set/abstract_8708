Using the KKM technique, we establish some existence results for
variational-hemivariational inequalities involving monotone set valued mappings
on bounded, closed and convex subsets in reflexive Banach spaces. We also
derive several sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions in the case
of unbounded subsets.
