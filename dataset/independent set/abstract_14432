Given a point set P in 2D, the problem of finding the smallest set of unit
disks that cover all of P is NP-hard. We present a simple algorithm for this
problem with an approximation factor of 25/6 in the Euclidean norm and 2 in the
max norm, by restricting the disk centers to lie on parallel lines. The run
time and space of this algorithm is O(n log n) and O(n) respectively. This
algorithm extends to any Lp norm and is asymptotically faster than known
alternative approximation algorithms for the same approximation factor.
