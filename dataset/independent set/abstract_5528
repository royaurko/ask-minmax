Set differential equations are usually formulated in terms of the Hukuhara
differential, which implies heavy restrictions for the nature of a solution. We
propose to reformulate set differential equations as ordinary differential
equations in a Banach space by identifying the convex and compact subsets of
$\R^d$ with their support functions. Using this representation, we demonstrate
how existence and uniqueness results can be applied to set differential
equations. We provide a simple example, which can be treated in support
function representation, but not in the Hukuhara setting.
