This paper investigates the property of the penalized estimating equations
when both the mean and association structures are modelled. To select variables
for the mean and association structures sequentially, we propose a hierarchical
penalized generalized estimating equations (HPGEE2) approach. The first set of
penalized estimating equations is solved for the selection of significant mean
parameters. Conditional on the selected mean model, the second set of penalized
estimating equations is solved for the selection of significant association
parameters. The hierarchical approach is designed to accommodate possible model
constraints relating the inclusion of covariates into the mean and the
association models. This two-step penalization strategy enjoys a compelling
advantage of easing computational burdens compared to solving the two sets of
penalized equations simultaneously. HPGEE2 with a smoothly clipped absolute
deviation (SCAD) penalty is shown to have the oracle property for the mean and
association models. The asymptotic behavior of the penalized estimator under
this hierarchical approach is established. An efficient two-stage penalized
weighted least square algorithm is developed to implement the proposed method.
The empirical performance of the proposed HPGEE2 is demonstrated through
Monte-Carlo studies and the analysis of a clinical data set.
