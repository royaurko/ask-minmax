We present an analysis of sets of matrices with rank less than or equal to a
specified number $s$. We provide a simple formula for the normal cone to such
sets, and use this to show that these sets are prox-regular at all points with
rank exactly equal to $s$. The normal cone formula appears to be new. This
allows for easy application of prior results guaranteeing local linear
convergence of the fundamental alternating projection algorithm between sets,
one of which is a rank constraint set. We apply this to show local linear
convergence of another fundamental algorithm, approximate steepest descent. Our
results apply not only to linear systems with rank constraints, as has been
treated extensively in the literature, but also nonconvex systems with rank
constraints.
