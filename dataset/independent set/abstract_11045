Supersymmetric scenarios with inverted mass hierarchy can be hard to observe
at a hadron collider, particularly for the non-strongly interacting sector. We
show how the production of stau-pairs via gauge boson fusion, along with hard
jets in the high rapidity region, can be instrumental in uncovering the
signatures of such scenarios. We demonstrate this both in a model-independent
way and with reference to some specific, well-motivated models.
