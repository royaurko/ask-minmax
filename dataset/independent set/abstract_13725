We consider the dimensions of finite type of representations of a partially
ordered set, i.e. such that there is only finitely many isomorphism classes of
representations of this dimension. We give a criterion for a dimension to be of
finite type. We also characterize those dimensions of finite type, for which
there is an indecomposable representation of this dimension, and show that
there can be at most one indecomposable representation of any dimension of
finite type. Moreover, if such a representation exists, it only has scalar
endomorphisms.
