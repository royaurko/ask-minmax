In recent years much attention has been enjoyed by topological spaces which
are dominated by second countable spaces. The origin of the concept dates back
to the 1979 paper of Talagrand in which it was shown that for a compact space
X, Cp(X) is dominated by P, the set of irrationals, if and only if Cp(X) is
K-analytic. Cascales extended this result to spaces X which are angelic and
finally in 2005 Tkachuk proved that the Talagrand result is true for all
Tychnoff spaces X. In recent years, the notion of P-domination has enjoyed
attention independent of Cp(X). In particular, Cascales, Orihuela and Tkachuk
proved that a Dieudonne complete space is K-analytic if and only if it is
dominated by P. A notion related to P-domination is that of strong P-
domination. Christensen had earlier shown that a second countable space is
strongly P-dominated if and only if it is completely metrizable. We show that a
very small modification of the definition of P-domination characterizes Borel
subsets of Polish spaces.
