This work presents the design of a reliable decentralized state feedback
control for a class of uncertain interconnected polytopic continous systems. A
model of failures in actuators is adopted which considers outages or partial
degradation in independent actuators. The control is developed using the
concept of guaranteed cost control and a new LMI characterization using
polytopic Lyapunov functions.
