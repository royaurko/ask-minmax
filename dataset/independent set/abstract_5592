This paper reports the tenth-order QED contribution to lepton g-2 from
diagrams of three gauge-invariant sets VI(d), VI(g), and VI(h), which are
obtained by including various fourth-order radiative corrections to the
sixth-order g-2 containing light-by-light-scattering subdiagrams. In the case
of electron g-2, they consist of 492, 480, and 630 vertex Feynman diagrams,
respectively. The results of numerical integration, including mass-dependent
terms containing muon loops, are 1.8418(95) (alpha/pi)^5 for the Set VI(d),
-1.5918(65) (alpha/pi)^5 for the Set VI(g), and 0.1797(40) (alpha/pi)^5 for the
Set VI(h), respectively. We also report the contributions to the muon g-2,
which derive from diagrams containing an electron, muon or tau lepton loop:
Their sums are -5.876(802) (alpha/pi)^5 for the Set VI(d), 5.710(490)
(alpha/pi)^5 for the Set VI(g), and -8.361(232) (alpha/pi)^5 for the Set VI(h),
respectively.
