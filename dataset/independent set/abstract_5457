Let $E_{\la}(z)=\la {\rm exp}(z), \ \lambda\in \mathbb C$ be the complex
exponential family. For all functions in the family there is a unique
asymptotic value at 0 (and no critical values). For a fixed $\la$, the set of
points in $\mathbb C$ with orbit tending to infinity is called the escaping
set. We prove that the escaping set of $E_{\la}$ with $\la$ Misiurewicz (that
is, a parameter for which the orbit of the singular value is strictly
preperiodic) is a connected set.
