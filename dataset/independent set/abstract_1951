Let $(\mathbf{B}, \|\cdot\|)$ be a real separable Banach space. Let $\{X,
X_{n}; n \geq 1\}$ be a sequence of i.i.d. {\bf B}-valued random variables and
set $S_{n} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i},~n \geq 1$. Let $\{a_{n}; n \geq 1\}$ and
$\{b_{n}; n \geq 1\}$ be increasing sequences of positive real numbers such
that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n} = \infty$ and $\left\{b_{n}/a_{n};~ n
\geq 1 \right\}$ is a nondecreasing sequence. In this paper, we provide a
comparison theorem for the law of large numbers for i.i.d. {\bf B}-valued
random variables. That is, we show that $\displaystyle \frac{S_{n}- n
\mathbb{E}\left(XI\{\|X\| \leq b_{n} \} \right)}{b_{n}} \rightarrow 0$ almost
surely (resp. in probability) for every {\bf B}-valued random variable $X$ with
$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mathbb{P}(\|X\| > b_{n}) < \infty$ (resp. $\lim_{n
\rightarrow \infty}n\mathbb{P}(\|X\| > b_{n}) = 0$) if $S_{n}/a_{n} \rightarrow
0$ almost surely (resp. in probability) for every symmetric {\bf B}-valued
random variable $X$ with $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mathbb{P}(\|X\| > a_{n}) <
\infty$ (resp. $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}n\mathbb{P}(\|X\| > a_{n}) = 0$). To
establish this comparison theorem for the law of large numbers, we invoke two
tools: 1) a comparison theorem for sums of independent {\bf B}-valued random
variables and, 2) a symmetrization procedure for the law of large numbers for
sums of independent {\bf B}-valued random variables. A few consequences of our
main results are provided.
