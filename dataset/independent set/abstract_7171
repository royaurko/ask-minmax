A new set of discrete ordinates is proposed for one-dimensional radiative
transfer in spheres with central symmetry. The set is structured with
un-normalized circular functions. This resulted in a conservative and closed
set of discrete ordinates equations that need not starter intensity: N
equations with N unknowns. The angular derivative of the transfer equation is
represented by a set of angular parameters that are calculated directly and
without recursion from the abscissas and weights of the quadrature and without
the constraint of asymptotic conditions. An analytic solution is obtained in
infinite homogeneous and heterogeneous cold media for monochromatic radiation.
Graphical and tabulated data validate the proposed set of discrete ordinates at
all radial positions ranging from 10^(-7) to 10^7 within round-off errors
