Two different topics relevant for DA$\Phi$NE and CEBAF, respectively, are
covered. First we analyze the rare radiative eta decay mode
$\eta\to\pi\pi\gamma\gamma$ within the framework of chiral perturbation theory
at ${\cal O}(p^4)$. We then discuss virtual Compton scattering off the nucleon
at low energies. Predictions for the two spin-independent generalized
polarizabilities are shown.
