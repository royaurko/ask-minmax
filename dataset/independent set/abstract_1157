We present a new Monte Carlo generator for Direct top and Single top
production via flavour-changing neutral currents (FCNC). This new tool
calculates the cross section and generates events with Next-to-Leading order
precision for the Direct top process and Leading-Order precision for all other
FCNC single top processes. A set of independent dimension six FCNC operators
has been implemented - including four-fermion operators - where at least one
top-quark is present in the interaction.
