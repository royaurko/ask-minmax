The main goal of this paper is to provide an alternative proof of the
following theorem of Petty: in the normed space of dimension at least three,
every 3-element equilateral set can be extended to a 4-element equilateral set.
Our approach is based on the result of Kramer and N\'emeth about inscribing a
simplex into a convex body. To prove the theorem of Petty, we shall also
establish that for every 3 points in the normed plane, forming an equilateral
set of the common distance $p$, there exists a fourth point, which is
equidistant to the given points with the distance not larger than $p$. We will
also improve the example given by Petty and obtain the existence of a smooth
and strictly convex norm in $\mathbb{R}^n$, which contain a maximal 4-element
equilateral set. This shows that the theorem of Petty cannot be generalized to
higher dimensions, even for smooth and strictly convex norms.
