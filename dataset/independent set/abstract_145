A theorem of Hoffman gives an upper bound on the independence ratio of
regular graphs in terms of the minimum \lambda of the spectrum of the adjacency
matrix. To complement this result we use random eigenvectors to gain lower
bounds in the vertex-transitive case. For example, we prove that the
independence ratio of a 3-regular transitive graph is at least q = 1/2 -
3/(4\pi) \arccos((1-\lambda)/4). The same bound holds for infinite transitive
graphs: we construct factor of i.i.d. independent sets for which the
probability that any given vertex is in the set is at least q-o(1).
  We also show that the set of the distributions of factor of i.i.d. processes
is not closed provided that the spectrum of the graph is uncountable.
