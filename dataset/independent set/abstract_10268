We examine the implications of a beat frequency modulated model of T Tauri
accretion. In particular we show that measurements of the variability of
accretion generated lines can be used in conjunction with existing photometry
to obtain a measurement of the underlying photospheric and disc flux. This
provides an independent way of checking spectral energy distribution modelling.
In addition, we show how spectroscopy of T Tauri stars can reveal the
inclination angle between the magnetic axis and the plane of the disc.
