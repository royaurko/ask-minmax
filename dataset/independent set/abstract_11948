We study directed transport in a classical deterministic dissipative system.
We consider the generic case of mixed phase space and show that large ratchet
currents can be generated thanks to the presence, in the Hamiltonian limit, of
transporting stability islands embedded in the chaotic sea. Due to the
simultaneous presence of chaos and dissipation the stationary value of the
current is independent of initial conditions, except for initial states with
very small measure.
