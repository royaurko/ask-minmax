We give a classification theorem for a class of C*-algebras which are direct
limits of extensions of circle algebras by purely infinite C*-algebras. The
invariant consists of the following: (1) the set of Murray-von Neumann
equivalence classes of projections; (2) the set of homotopy classes of
hyponormal partial isometries; (3) a map d; and (4) total K-theory.
