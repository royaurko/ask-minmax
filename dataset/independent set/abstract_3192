We present the new version of the Mathematica package SARAH which provides
the same features for a non-supersymmetric model as previous versions for
supersymmetric models. This includes an easy and straightforward definition of
the model, the calculation of all vertices, mass matrices, tadpole equations,
and self-energies. Also the two-loop renormalization group equations for a
general gauge theory are now included and have been validated with the
independent Python code PyR@te. Model files for FeynArts, CalcHep/CompHep,
WHIZARD and in the UFO format can be written, and source code for SPheno for
the calculation of the mass spectrum, a set of precision observables, and the
decay widths and branching ratios of all states can be generated. Furthermore,
the new version includes routines to output model files for Vevacious for both,
supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric, models. Global symmetries are also
supported with this version and by linking Susyno the handling of Lie groups
has been improved and extended.
