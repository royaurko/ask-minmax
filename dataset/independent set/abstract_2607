Strong repulsive interactions within a one dimensional Fermi system in a
two-probe configuration normally lead to a reduced off-resonance conductance.
We show that if the repulsive interaction extends to the contact regions, a
strong increase of the conductance may occur, even for systems where one would
expect to find a reduced conductance. An essential ingredient in our
calculations is a momentum-space representation of the leads, which allows a
high energy resolution. Further, we demonstrate that these results are
independent of the high-energy cutoff and that the relevant scale is set by the
Fermi velocity.
