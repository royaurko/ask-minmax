We investigate the one-loop contributions to S and T oblique parameteres in
gauge-Higgs unification. We show that these parameters are finite in five
dimensional space-time, but are divergent in more than five dimensions.
Remarkably, however, we find that a particular linear combination of S and T
parameters, S - 4 \cos \theta_{W} T, becomes finite for six dimensional
space-time, though each of these parameters is divergent. This is because, in
the Gauge-Higgs unification scenario, the operators relevant for S and T
parameters are not independent, but are included in a unique higher dimensional
gauge invariant operator. Thus the predictable linear combination is model
independent, irrespectibly of the detail of the matter content.
