We prove an asymptotic Cram\'er's theorem, that is, if the sequence $(X_{n}+
Y_{n})_{n\geq 1}$ converges in law to the standard normal distribution and for
every $n\geq 1$ the random variables $X_{n}$ and $Y_{n}$ are independent, then
$(X_{n})_{n\geq 1}$ {\it and } $(Y_{n}) _{n\geq 1}$ converge in law to a normal
distribution. Then we compare this result with recent criteria for the central
convergence obtained in terms of Malliavin derivatives.
