We show that when a procedure is made to remove the tension between a
supernova Ia (SN Ia) data set and observations from BAO and CMB, there might be
the case where the same SN Ia set built with two different light-curve fitters
behaves as two separate and distinct supernova sets, and the tension found by
some contributors between supernova sets actually could be due to tension or
inconsistency between fitters. We also show that the information of the fitter
used in an SN Ia data set could be relevant to determine whether phantom type
models are favored or not when such a set is combined with the BAO/CMB joint
parameter.
