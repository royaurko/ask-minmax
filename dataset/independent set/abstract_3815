The nonlinear features of the relationships between concentrations of aerosol
and volatile organic compounds (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in urban
environments are derived directly from data of long-term routine measurements
of NOx, VOC, and total suspended particulate matter (PM). The main idea of the
method used for the analysis is creation of special empirical models based on
artificial neural networks. These models which are in essence the nonlinear
extension of commonly used linear statistical models are believed to provide
the best fit for the real (nonlinear) PM-NOx-VOC relationships under different
atmospheric conditions. It is believed that such models may be useful in
context of various scientific and practical problems concerning atmospheric
aerosols. The method is demonstrated by the example of two empirical models
created with independent data-sets collected at two air quality monitoring
stations at South Coast Air Basin, California. It is shown that in spite of
considerable distance between the monitoring stations (more than 50 km) and
thus substantially different environmental conditions, the empirical models
manifest several common qualitative features. Specifically, it is found that,
under definite conditions, the decrease of the level of NOx or VOC may lead to
the increase of mass concentration of aerosol. It is argued that these features
are caused by the nonlinear dependence of hydroxyl radical on VOC and NOx.
