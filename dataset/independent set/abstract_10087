We study reproducing kernels, and associated reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces (RKHSs) $\mathscr{H}$ over infinite, discrete and countable sets $V$. In
this setting we analyze in detail the distributions of the corresponding Dirac
point-masses of $V$. Illustrations include certain models from neural networks:
An Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a neural network-configuration in which a
hidden layer of weights are randomly sampled, and where the object is then to
compute resulting output. For RKHSs $\mathscr{H}$ of functions defined on a
prescribed countable infinite discrete set $V$, we characterize those which
contain the Dirac masses $\delta_{x}$ for all points $x$ in $V$. Further
examples and applications where this question plays an important role are: (i)
discrete Brownian motion-Hilbert spaces, i.e., discrete versions of the
Cameron-Martin Hilbert space; (ii) energy-Hilbert spaces corresponding to
graph-Laplacians where the set $V$ of vertices is then equipped with a
resistance metric; and finally (iii) the study of Gaussian free fields.
