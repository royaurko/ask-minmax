This paper, in french, gives a new approach to the concept of Maximally Even
Sets based on discrete Fourier transform, with several elementary but
interesting and previously unpublished results. Maximally Even Sets have been
invented by musicologists but have been found to bear deep relationships to
other areas of science, such as the Ising model in Physics. They describe
economically and characterise many famous 'scales' or subsets of the cyclic
group as modelised here.
