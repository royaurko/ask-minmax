A model of independent pair parton interactions is proposed, according to
which, hadron interactions are represented by a set of independent binary
parton collisions. The final multiplicity distribution is described by a
convolution of the negative binomial distributions in each of the partonic
collisions. As a result, it is given by a weighted sum of negative binomial
distributions with parameters multiplied by the number of active pairs. Its
shape and moments are considered. Experimental data on multiplicity
distributions in high energy $p\bar p$ processes are well fitted by these
distributions. Predictions for the CERN Large Hadron Collider and higher
energies are presented. The difference between $e^+e^-$ and $p\bar p$ processes
is discussed.
