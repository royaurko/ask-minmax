Solar neutrinos coming from different nuclear reactions are now detected with
a high statistics. Consequently, an accurate spectroscopic analysis of the
neutrino fluxes arriving on the Earth's detectors become available, in the
context of neutrino oscillations. In this work, we explore the possibility of
using this information to infer the radial profile of the electronic density in
the solar core. So, we discuss the constraints on the Sun's density and
chemical composition that can be determined from solar neutrino observations.
This approach constitutes an independent and alternative diagnostic to the
helioseismic investigations already done. The direct inversion method, that we
propose to get the radial solar electronic density profile, is almost
independent of the solar model.
