Antitubercular activity of Sulfathiazole Derivitives series were subjected to
Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) Analysis with an attempt to
derive and understand a correlation between the Biologically Activity as
dependent variable and various descriptors as independent variables. QSAR
models generated using 28 compounds. Several statistical regression expressions
were obtained using Partial Least Squares (PLS) Regression, Multiple Linear
Regression (MLR) and Principal Component Regression (PCR) methods. The among
these methods, Partial Least Square Regression (PLS) method has shown very
promising result as compare to other two methods. A QSAR model was generated by
a training set of 18 molecules with correlation coefficient r (r square) of
0.9191, significant cross validated correlation coefficient (q square) of
0.8300, F test of 53.5783, r square for external test set pred_r square
-3.6132, coefficient of correlation of predicted data set pred_r_se square
1.4859 and degree of freedom 14 by Partial Least Squares Regression Method.
