We give some new methods for perfect reconstruction from frame and sampling
erasures in finitely many steps. By bridging an erasure set we mean replacing
the erased Fourier coefficients of a function with respect to a frame by
appropriate linear combinations of the non-erased coefficients. We prove that
if a minimal redundancy condition is satisfied bridging can always be done to
make the reduced error operator nilpotent of index 2 using a bridge set of
indices no larger than the cardinality of the erasure set. This results in
perfect reconstruction of the erased coefficients in one final matricial step.
We also obtain a new formula for the inverse of an invertible partial
reconstruction operator. This leads to a second method of perfect
reconstruction from frame and sampling erasures in finitely many steps. This
gives an alternative to the bridging method for many (but not all) cases. The
methods we use employ matrix techniques only of the order of the cardinality of
the erasure set, and are applicable to rather large finite erasure sets for
infinite frames and sampling schemes as well as for finite frame theory. Some
new classification theorems for frames are obtained and some new methods of
measuring redundancy are introduced based on our bridging theory.
