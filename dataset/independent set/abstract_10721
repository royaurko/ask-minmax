A relativistic 3-brane can be given a conformally invariant, gauge-type,
formulation provided the embedding space is six-dimensional. The implementation
of conformal invariance requires the use of a modified measure, independent of
the metric in the action. A brane-world scenario without the need of a
cosmological constant in 6D can be constructed. Thus, no ``old'' cosmological
constant problem appears at this level.
