In the accompanying Comment [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 67}, 056501 (2003)], I.
Lindgren and S. Salomonson claim to prove for the Kohn-Sham kinetic energy
functional of ground state electron density that a Fr\"echet functional
derivative exists, equivalent to a multiplicative local potential function. If
true, this result would imply an exact Thomas-Fermi theory for ground states of
noninteracting electrons. However, such a theory is not consistent with the
exclusion principle for more than one electron of each spin. The simplest
counterexample is the lowest triplet state of a noninteracting two-electron
atom. If only the total electron density were normalized, as in Thomas-Fermi
theory, the lowest state would collapse into a doubly-occupied $1s$
spin-orbital. Two independent parameters $\epsilon_{1s}$ and $\epsilon_{2s}$
are required to maintain independent subshell normalization. The argument
presented by these contributors is discussed in the light of this unphysical
implication.
