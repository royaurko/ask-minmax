We evaluate the electric and magnetic screening masses from the long-distance
behavior of the (temporal and spatial) gluon correlation functions, for pure
SU(2) gauge theory at finite temperature. In order to investigate the gauge
dependence of the screening masses we consider seven different gauges. We also
evaluate these masses using different definitions of the lattice gluon field,
corresponding to discretization errors of different orders.
