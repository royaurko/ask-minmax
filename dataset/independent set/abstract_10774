We verify that summing 2D DT geometries correctly reproduces the Polyakov
action for the conformal mode, including all ghost contributions, at large
volumes. The Gaussian action is reproduced even for central charges greater
than one lending strong support to the hypothesis that the space of all
possible dyamical triangulations approximates well the space of physically
distinct metrics independent of the precise nature of the matter coupling.
