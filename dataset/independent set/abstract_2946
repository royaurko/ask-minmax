We study the equidistribution of Fekete points in a compact complex manifold.
These are extremal point configurations defined through sections of powers of a
positive line bundle. Their equidistribution is a known result. The novelty of
our approach is that we relate them to the problem of sampling and
interpolation on line bundles, which allows us to estimate the equidistribution
of the Fekete points quantitatively. In particular we estimate the
Kantorovich-Wasserstein distance of the Fekete points to its limiting measure.
  The sampling and interpolation arrays on line bundles are a subject of
independent interest, and we provide necessary density conditions through the
classical approach of Landau, that in this context measures the local dimension
of the space of sections of the line bundle. We obtain a complete geometric
characterization of sampling and interpolation arrays in the case of compact
manifolds of dimension one, and we prove that there are no arrays of both
sampling and interpolation in the more general setting of semipositive line
bundles.
