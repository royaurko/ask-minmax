73 broadband optical spectra of dwarf stars later than F0 have been obtained
from the Nearby Stars Project website. The number of absorption lines is
computed for each spectrum between 6000 and 6200 Angstrom. A correlation is
found between the density of lines K$\lambda$ and the spectral type. This
method is independent of calibration process, does not require high resolution
or high signal to noise data and does not make use of a large library of
standard spectra.
