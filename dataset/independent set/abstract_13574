We investigate the distributions of the link overlap, P(Q), in 3-dimensional
Ising spin glasses. We use clustering methodology to identify a set of pairs of
states from different Gibbs states, and calculate its contribution to P(Q). We
find that the distribution over this set does not become trivial as the system
size increases.
