William Browder in his paper "Surgery and the theory of differentiable
transformation groups" developed surgery techniques to study semi-free actions
of S1 on homotopy spheres, under the additional assumption that the fixed point
set is a homotopy sphere. He used this surgery to show how to construct such
actions. In this paper, I discussed a similar theory for semi-free actions of
S3 on homotopy spheres. An open problem is raised at the end of the paper.
