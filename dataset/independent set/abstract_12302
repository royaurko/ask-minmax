Mader asked to explicitly construct dense graphs for which the size of the
largest clique minor is sublinear in the number of vertices. Such graphs exist
as a random graph almost surely has this property. This question and variants
were popularized by Thomason over several articles. We answer these questions
by showing how to explicitly construct such graphs using blow-ups of small
graphs with this property. This leads to the study of a fractional variant of
the clique minor number, which may be of independent interest.
