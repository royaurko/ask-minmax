We study the dynamics of the collision between two fermions in Hubbard model
with on-site interaction strength $U$. The exact solution shows that the
scattering matrix for two-wavepacket collision is separable into two
independent parts, operating on spatial and spin degrees of freedom,
respectively. The S-matrix for spin configuration is equivalent to that of
Heisenberg-type pulsed interaction with the strength depending on $U$ and
relative group velocity $\upsilon _{r}$. This can be applied to create distant
EPR pair, through a collision process for two fermions with opposite spins in
the case of $\left\vert \upsilon _{r}/U\right\vert =1$,\ without the need for
temporal control and measurement process. Multiple collision process for many
particles is also discussed.
