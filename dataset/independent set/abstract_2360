Technicolor represents a viable alternative to the Higgs mechanism for
generating gauge boson masses. Searches for technicolor particles rho_T and
pi_T have been performed in the data collected by the DELPHI experiment at LEP
at centre-of-mass energies between 192 and 208 GeV corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 452 pb^{-1}. Good agreement is observed with the SM
expectation in all channels studied. This is translated into an excluded region
in the (M_{pi_T},M_{rho_T}) plane. The rho_T production is excluded for all 90
< M_{rho_T} < 206.7 GeV/c^2. Assuming a point-like interaction of the pi_T with
gauge bosons, an absolute lower limit on the charged pi_T mass at 95% CL is set
at 79.8 GeV/c^2, independently of other parameters of the technicolor model.
