Our aim is to give some insights about how to approach the formal description
of situations where one has to conciliate several contradictory statements,
rules, laws or ideas. We show that such a conciliation structure can be
naturally defined on a topological space endowed with the set of its closed
sets and that this specific structure is a kind of "dualization" of the sheaf
concept where "global" and "local" levels are reversed.
