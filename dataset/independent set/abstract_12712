Composition methodologies in the current literature are mainly to promote
estimation efficiency via direct composition, either, of initial estimators or
of objective functions. In this paper, composite estimation is investigated for
both estimation efficiency and bias reduction. To this end, a novel method is
proposed by utilizing a regression relationship between initial estimators and
values of model-independent parameter in an asymptotic sense. The resulting
estimators could have smaller limiting variances than those of initial
estimators, and for nonparametric regression estimation, could also have faster
convergence rate than the classical optimal rate that the corresponding initial
estimators can achieve. The simulations are carried out to examine its
performance in finite sample situations.
