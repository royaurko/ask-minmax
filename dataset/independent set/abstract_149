We construct isotrivial and non-isotrivial elliptic curves over
$\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ with an arbitrarily large set of separable integral points.
As an application of this construction, we prove that there are isotrivial
log-general type varieties over $\mathbb_{F}_q(t)$ with a Zariski dense set of
separable integral points. This provides a counterexample to a natural
translation of the Lang-Vojta conjecture to the function field setting. We also
show that our main result provides examples of elliptic curves with an explicit
and arbitrarily large set of linearly independent points.
