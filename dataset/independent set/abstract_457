For a sequence p=(p(1),p(2), ...) let G(n,p) denote the random graph with
vertex set {1,2, ...,n} in which two vertices i, j are adjacent with
probability p(|i-j|), independently for each pair. We study how the
convergence of probabilities of first order properties of G(n,p), can be
affected by the behaviour of p and the strength of the language we use.
