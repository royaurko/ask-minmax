The Erdos-Szekeres theorem states that for any natural k there is a natural
number g(k) such that any set of at least g(k) points on a plane in general
position contains a set of k points that are the extreme points of a convex
polytope. We generalize and refine this theorem, having the general-position
condition removed and a convex polygon defined as an ordered sequence of points
such that the union of the edges of the polygon coincides with the boundary of
its convex hull.
