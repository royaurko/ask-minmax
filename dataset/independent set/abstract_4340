It is shown that from two strings that are partially random and independent
(in the sense of Kolmogorov complexity) it is possible to effectively construct
polynomially many strings that are random and pairwise independent. If the two
initial strings are random, then the above task can be performed in polynomial
time. It is also possible to construct in polynomial time a random string, from
two strings that have constant randomness rate.
