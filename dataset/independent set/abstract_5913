In this note the ILC's capabilities for detecting WIMPs and measuring their
properties are studied. The expected signal cross section is derived in a
model-independent way from the observed relic density of Dark Matter. Signal
events are detected by means of initial state radiation (ISR). The study is
performed with a full simulation of the ILD detector. The results show that
WIMPs are observable at the ILC if their coupling to electrons is not too small
(O(0.1)). Their masses can be measured with a precision of 1 to 2 GeV. The
accessible phase space can be increased significantly using polarised beams,
especially if the positrons are polarised as well.
