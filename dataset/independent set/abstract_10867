The asymptotics of pion charge form factor is obtained in the framework of
relativistic Hamiltonian dynamics for the infinite value limit of momentum
transfer and zero value limit of constituent--quark mass. It is shown that this
asymptotics is the same as given by the perturbative QCD and is determined by
relativistic kinematics only, being independent on the constituent quarks
interaction in pion.
