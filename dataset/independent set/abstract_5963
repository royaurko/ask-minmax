We study the Eguchi-Kawai reduction in the strong-coupling domain of gauge
theories via the gravity dual of N=4 super-Yang-Mills on R^3xS^1. We show that
D-branes geometrize volume independence in the center-symmetric vacuum and give
supergravity predictions for the range of validity of reduced large-N models at
strong coupling.
