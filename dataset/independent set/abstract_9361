We argue that the theory of a massive higher spin field coupled to
electromagnetism in flat space possesses an intrinsic, model independent,
finite upper bound on its UV cutoff. By employing the Stueckelberg formalism we
do a systematic study to quantify the degree of singularity of the massless
limit in the cases of spin 2, 3, 3/2, and 5/2. We then generalize the results
for arbitrary spin to find an expression for the maximum cutoff of the theory
as a function of the particle's mass, spin, and electric charge. We also
briefly explain the physical implications of the result and discuss how it
could be sharpened by use of causality constraints.
