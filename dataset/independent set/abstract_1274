In 1992, Wilf and Zeilberger conjectured that a hypergeometric term in
several discrete and continuous variables is holonomic if and only if it is
proper. Strictly speaking the conjecture does not hold, but it is true when
reformulated properly: Payne proved a piecewise interpretation in 1997, and
independently, Abramov and Petkovsek in 2002 proved a conjugate interpretation.
Both results address the pure discrete case of the conjecture. In this paper we
extend their work to hypergeometric terms in several discrete and continuous
variables and prove the conjugate interpretation of the Wilf-Zeilberger
conjecture in this mixed setting.
