By means of contact-density chain-growth simulations, we investigate a simple
lattice model of a flexible polymer interacting with an attractive substrate.
The contact density is a function of the numbers of monomer-substrate and
monomer-monomer contacts. These contact numbers represent natural order
parameters and allow for a comprising statistical study of the conformational
space accessible to the polymer in dependence of external parameters such as
the attraction strength of the substrate and the temperature. Since the contact
density is independent of the energy scales associated to the interactions, its
logarithm is an unbiased measure for the entropy of the conformational space.
By setting explicit energy scales, the thus defined, highly general
microcontact entropy can easily be related to the microcanonical entropy of the
corresponding hybrid polymer-substrate system.
