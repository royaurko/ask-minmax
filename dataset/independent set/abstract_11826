Values of surface tension of most of organic liquids are of the same order of
magnitude. The natural explanation for this lies in the fact that surface
tension is governed by London dispersion forces, which are independent of the
permanent dipole moment of molecules. The surface tension of organic liquids
(with the exception of polymers and polymer solutions) depends on the
ionization potential and the diameter of the molecule only. These parameters
vary slightly for organic liquids.
