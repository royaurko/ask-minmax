The effects of dominant sequential interactions are investigated in an
exactly solvable feed-forward layered neural network model of binary units and
patterns near saturation in which the interaction consists of a Hebbian part
and a symmetric sequential term. Phase diagrams of stationary states are
obtained and a new phase of cyclic correlated states of period two is found for
a weak Hebbian term, independently of the number of condensed patterns $c$.
