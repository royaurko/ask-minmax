Meyer and Nest showed that the Baum--Connes map is equivalent to a map on
$K$-theory of two different crossed products. This approach is strongly
categorial in method since its bases is to regard Kasparov's theory $KK^G$ as a
triangulated category. We have tried to translate this approach to the realm of
inverse semigroup equivariant $C^*$-algebras, but have not succeeded yet. We
present here our partial results, some of which may be of independent interest,
for example Bott periodicity, the definitions of induction functors and
compatible $L^2(G)$-spaces, and a Cuntz picture of $KK^G$.
