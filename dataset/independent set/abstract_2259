The observational record of turbulence within the molecular gas phase of the
interstellar medium is summarized. We briefly review the analysis methods used
to recover the velocity structure function from spectroscopic imaging and the
application of these tools on sets of cloud data. These studies identify a
near-invariant velocity structure function that is independent of local the
environment and star formation activity. Such universality accounts for the
cloud-to-cloud scaling law between the global line-width and size of molecular
clouds found by Larson (1981) and constrains the degree to which supersonic
turbulence can regulate star formation. In addition, the evidence for large
scale driving sources necessary to sustain supersonic flows is summarized.
