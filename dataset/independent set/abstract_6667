We describe primitive and prime ideals in the C*-algebra C*(E) of a graph E
satisfying Condition (K), together with the topologies on each of these spaces.
In particular, we find that primitive ideals correspond to the set of maximal
tails disjoint union the set of finite-return vertices, and that prime ideals
correspond to the set of clusters of maximal tails disjoint union the set of
finite-return vertices.
