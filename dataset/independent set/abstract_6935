Let A be a compact set in the right-half plane and $\Gamma(A)$ the set in
$\mathbb{R}^{3}$ obtained by rotating A about the vertical axis. We investigate
the support of the limit distribution of minimal energy point charges on
$\Gamma(A)$ that interact according to the Riesz potential 1/r^{s}, 0<s<1,
where r is the Euclidean distance between points. Potential theory yields that
this limit distribution coincides with the equilibrium measure on $\Gamma(A)$
which is supported on the outer boundary of $\Gamma(A)$. We show that there are
sets of revolution $\Gamma(A)$ such that the support of the equilibrium measure
on $\Gamma(A)$ is {\bf not} the complete outer boundary, in contrast to the
Coulomb case s=1. However, the support of the limit distribution on the set of
revolution $\Gamma(R+A)$ as R goes to infinity, is the full outer boundary for
certain sets A, in contrast to the logarithmic case (s=0).
