We provide two certificates of convexity for arbitrary basic semi-algebraic
sets of $\R^n$. The first one is based on a necessary and sufficient condition
whereas the second one is based on a sufficient (but simpler) condition only.
Both certificates are obtained from any feasible solution of a related
semidefinite program and so can be obtained numerically (however, up to machine
precision).
