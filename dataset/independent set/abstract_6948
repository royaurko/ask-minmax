The aim of this paper is to estimate the $L^2$-norms of vector-valued Riesz
transforms $R_{\nu}^s$ and the norms of Riesz operators on Cantor sets in
$\R^d$, as well as to study the distribution of values of $R_{\nu}^s$. Namely,
we show that this distribution is "uniform" in the following sense. The values
of $|R_{\nu}^s|^2$ which are comparable with its average value are attended on
a "big" portion of a Cantor set. We apply these results to give examples
demonstrating the sharpness of our previous estimates for the set of points
where Riesz transform is large, and for the corresponding Riesz capacities. The
Cantor sets under consideration are different from the usual corner Cantor
sets. They are constructed by means a certain process of regularization
introduced in the paper.
