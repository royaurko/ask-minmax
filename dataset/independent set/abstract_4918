In this paper, we give some sufficient conditions for the infinite collisions
of independent simple random walks on a wedge comb with profile $\{f(n), n\in
\ZZ\}$. One interesting result is that if $f(n)$ has a growth order as $n\log
n$, then two independent simple random walks on the wedge comb will collide
infinitely many times. Another is that if $\{f(n); n\in \ZZ\}$ are given by
i.i.d. non-negative random variables with finite mean, then for almost all
wedge comb with such profile, three independent simple random walks on it will
collide infinitely many times.
