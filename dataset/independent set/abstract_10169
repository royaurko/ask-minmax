We consider the dynamics of semi-hyperbolic semigroups generated by finitely
many rational maps on the Riemann sphere. Assuming that the nice open set
condition holds it is proved that there exists a geometric measure on the Julia
set with exponent $h$ equal to the Hausdorff dimension of the Julia set. Both
$h$-dimensional Hausdorff and packing measures are finite and positive on the
Julia set and are mutually equivalent with Radon-Nikodym derivatives uniformly
separated from zero and infinity. All three fractal dimensions, Hausdorff,
packing and box counting are equal. It is also proved that for the canonically
associated skew-product map there exists a unique $h$-conformal measure.
Furthermore, it is shown that this conformal measure admits a unique Borel
probability absolutely continuous invariant (under the skew-product map)
measure. In fact these two measures are equivalent, and the invariant measure
is metrically exact, hence ergodic.
