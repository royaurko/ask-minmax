We show that the symmetry of the spin zigzag chain E phase of the
orthorhombic perovskite manganites and nickelates allows for the existence of a
finite ferroelectric polarization. The proposed microscopic mechanism is
independent of spin-orbit coupling. We predict that the polarization induced by
the E-type magnetic order can potentially be enhanced by up to two orders of
magnitude with respect to that in the spiral magnetic phases of TbMnO3 and
similar multiferroic compounds.
