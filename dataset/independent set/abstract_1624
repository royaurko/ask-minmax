Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we probe the scale-dependence of
thermalization in strongly coupled field theories following a quench, via
calculations of two-point functions, Wilson loops and entanglement entropy in
d=2,3,4. In the saddlepoint approximation these probes are computed in AdS
space in terms of invariant geometric objects - geodesics, minimal surfaces and
minimal volumes. Our calculations for two-dimensional field theories are
analytical. In our strongly coupled setting, all probes in all dimensions share
certain universal features in their thermalization: (1) a slight delay in the
onset of thermalization, (2) an apparent non-analyticity at the endpoint of
thermalization, (3) top-down thermalization where the UV thermalizes first. For
homogeneous initial conditions the entanglement entropy thermalizes slowest,
and sets a timescale for equilibration that saturates a causality bound over
the range of scales studied. The growth rate of entanglement entropy density is
nearly volume-independent for small volumes, but slows for larger volumes.
