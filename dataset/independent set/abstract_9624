We propose Markov two-components processes (M2CP) as a probabilistic model of
asynchronous systems based on the trace semantics for concurrency. Considering
an asynchronous system distributed over two sites, we introduce concepts and
tools to manipulate random trajectories in an asynchronous framework: stopping
times, an Asynchronous Strong Markov property, recurrent and transient states
and irreducible components of asynchronous probabilistic processes. The
asynchrony assumption implies that there is no global totally ordered clock
ruling the system. Instead, time appears as partially ordered and random. We
construct and characterize M2CP through a finite family of transition matrices.
M2CP have a local independence property that guarantees that local components
are independent in the probabilistic sense, conditionally to their
synchronization constraints. A synchronization product of two Markov chains is
introduced, as a natural example of M2CP.
