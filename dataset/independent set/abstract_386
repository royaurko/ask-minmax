An introduction is given to the logic of sheaves of structures and to set
theoretic forcing constructions based on this logic. Using these tools, it is
presented an alternative proof of the independence of the Continuum Hypothesis;
which simplifies and unifies the classical boolean and intuitionistic
approaches, avoiding the difficulties linked to the categorical machinery of
the topoi based approach.
