We study spin chains for superconformal quiver gauge theories in the moduli
space of N=2 orbifolds. Independent of integrability, which is generally
broken, we use the centrally extended SU(2|2) symmetry of the magnons to fix
their dispersion relations and two-body S-matrices, as functions of the exactly
marginal couplings.
