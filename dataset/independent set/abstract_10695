If the spatial curvature of the universe is positive, then the curvature term
will always dominate at early enough times in a slow-rolling inflationary
epoch. This enhances inflationary effects and hence puts limits on the possible
number of e-foldings that can have occurred, independently of what happened
before inflation began and in particular without regard for what may have
happened in the Planck era. We use a simple multi-stage model to examine this
limit as a function of the present density parameter $\Omega_0$ and the epoch
when inflation ends.
