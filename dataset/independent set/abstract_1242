The speech feature extraction has been a key focus in robust speech
recognition research; it significantly affects the recognition performance. In
this paper, we first study a set of different features extraction methods such
as linear predictive coding (LPC), mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC)
and perceptual linear prediction (PLP) with several features normalization
techniques like rasta filtering and cepstral mean subtraction (CMS). Based on
this, a comparative evaluation of these features is performed on the task of
text independent speaker identification using a combination between gaussian
mixture models (GMM) and linear and non-linear kernels based on support vector
machine (SVM).
