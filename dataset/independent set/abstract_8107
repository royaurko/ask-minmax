Let $G$ be a connected, simply-connected, and almost simple algebraic group,
and let $\sigma$ be a Dynkin automorphism on $G$. In this paper, we get a
bijection between the set of $\st$-invariant MV cycles (polytopes) for $G$ and
the set of MV cycles (polytopes) for $G^\st$, which is the fixed point subgroup
of $G$; moreover, this bijection can be restricted to the set of MV cycles
(polytopes) in irreducible representations. As an application, we obtain a new
proof of the twining character formula.
