A factor effect study was conducted on a set of observations at the
contingency of a series of plant species and bacteria species regarding the
antibacterial activity of essential oil extracts. The study reveals a very good
agreement between the observations and the hypothesis of independent and
multiplicative effect of plant and bacteria species factors on the
antibacterial activity. Shaping of the observable to a Negative Binomial
distribution allowed the separation of two convoluted Gamma distributions in
the observable further assigned to the distribution of factors. Statistics of
the Gamma distribution allowed estimating the ratio between diversity of plants
factors and bacteria factors in the antibacterial activity of essential oils
extracts.
