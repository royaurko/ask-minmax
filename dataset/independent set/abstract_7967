We propose a two-loop induced neutrino mass model, in which we show some
bench mark points to satisfy the observed neutrino oscillation, the constraints
of lepton flavor violations, and the relic density in the co-annihilation
system satisfying the current upper bound on the spin independent scattering
cross section with nuclei. We also discuss new sources of muon anomalous
magnetic moment.
