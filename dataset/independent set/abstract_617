We study four-dimensional non-extremal charged rotating black holes in
ungauged and gauged supergravity. In the ungauged case, we obtain rotating
black holes with four independent charges, as solutions of N=2 supergravity
coupled to three abelian vector multiplets. This is done by reducing the theory
along the time direction to three dimensions, where it has an O(4,4) global
symmetry. Applied to the reduction of the uncharged Kerr metric,
O(1,1)^4\subset O(4,4) transformations generate new solutions that correspond,
after lifting back to four dimensions, to the introduction of four independent
electromagnetic charges. In the case where these charges are set pairwise
equal, we then generalise the four-dimensional rotating black holes to
solutions of gauged N=4 supergravity, with mass, angular momentum and two
independent electromagnetic charges. The dilaton and axion fields are
non-constant. We also find generalisations of the gauged and ungauged solutions
to include the NUT parameter, and for the ungauged solutions, the acceleration
parameter too. The solutions in gauged supergravity provide new gravitational
backgrounds for a further study of the AdS_4/CFT_3 correspondence at non-zero
temperature.
