We show that for convex domains in Euclidean space, Cheeger's isoperimetric
inequality, spectral gap of the Neumann Laplacian, exponential concentration of
Lipschitz functions, and the a-priori weakest requirement that Lipschitz
functions have \emph{arbitrarily slow} uniform tail-decay, are all
quantitatively equivalent (to within universal constants, independent of the
dimension). This substantially extends previous results of Maz'ya, Cheeger,
Gromov--Milman, Buser and Ledoux. As an application, we conclude a sharp
quantitative stability result for the spectral gap of convex domains under
convex perturbations which preserve volume (up to constants) and under maps
which are ``on-average'' Lipschitz. We also provide a new characterization (up
to constants) of the spectral gap of a convex domain, as one over the square of
the average distance from the ``worst'' subset having half the measure of the
domain. In addition, we easily recover and extend many previously known lower
bounds on the spectral gap of convex domains, due to Payne--Weinberger,
Li--Yau, Kannan--Lov\'asz--Simonovits, Bobkov and Sodin. The proof involves
estimates on the diffusion semi-group following Bakry--Ledoux and a result from
Riemannian Geometry on the concavity of the isoperimetric profile. Our results
extend to the more general setting of Riemannian manifolds with density which
satisfy the $CD(0,\infty)$ curvature-dimension condition of Bakry-\'Emery.
