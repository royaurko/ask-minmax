We show that pure Yang-Mills theories with Lorentz violation are
renormalizable to all orders in perturbation theory. To do this, we employ the
algebraic renormalization technique. Specifically, we control the breaking
terms with a suitable set of external sources which, eventually, attain certain
physical values. The Abelian case is also analyzed as a starting point. The
main result is that the renormalizability of the usual Maxwell and Yang-Mills
sectores are both left unchanged. Furthermore, in contrast to Lorentz violating
QED, the odd CPT violation sector of Yang-Mills theories renormalizes
independently. Moreover, the method induces, in a natural way, mass terms for
the gauge field while the photon remains massless (at least n the sense of a
Proca-like term). The entire analysis is carried out at the Landau gauge.
