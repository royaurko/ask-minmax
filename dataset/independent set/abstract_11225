I explain how the Lax-Phillips theory can be applied to a purely innovating
time series and compute the corresponding scattering function. I then associate
such a time series to an algebraic curve (of genus at least 1) over a finite
field and show that the Riemann Hypothesis (proven long ago) holds if and only
if the scattering is causal (this causality is not independently established,
though).
