We discuss here some flavor structure aspects of the complete theory of
supersymmetry without R-parity addressed from the perspective of fitting
neutrino oscillation data based on the recent Super-Kamiokande result. The
single-VEV parametrization of supersymmetry without R-parity is first reviewed,
illustrating some important features not generally appreciated. For the flavor
structure discussions, a naive, flavor model independent, analysis is
presented, from which a few interesting things can be learned.
