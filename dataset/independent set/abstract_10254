Relativistic blast wave models predict the spectrum of the emitted
synchrotron radiation. The electrons in the shocked region are heated to a Wien
distribution whose ``temperature'' is $1/3$ of the mean electron energy. This
energy scale determines a characteristic (break) frequency of synchrotron
radiation. At much lower frequencies a spectrum $F_nu \propto \nu^{1/3}$ is
predicted independently of details of the emitting region. This is consistent
with the observed soft X-ray spectra of GRB. It implies low visible and radio
intensities, unless there are collective emission processes.
