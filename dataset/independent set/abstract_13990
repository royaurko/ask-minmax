A parametrization of multipartite separable states in a finite-dimensional
Hilbert space is suggested. It is proved to be a diffeomorphism between the set
of zero-trace operators and the interior of the set of separable density
operators. The result is applicable to any tensor product decomposition of the
state space. An analytical criterion for separability of density operators is
established in terms of the boundedness of a sequence of operators.
