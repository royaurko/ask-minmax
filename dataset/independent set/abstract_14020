With the help of the Drinfeld twist or factorizing F-matrix for the
eight-vertex solid-on-solid (SOS) model, we find that in the F-basis provided
by the twist the two sets of pseudo-particle creation operators simultaneously
take completely symmetric and polarization free form. This allows us to obtain
the explicit and completely symmetric expressions of the two sets of Bethe
states of the model.
