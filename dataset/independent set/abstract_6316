We study general methods to build forking-like notions in the framework of
tame abstract elementary classes (AECs) with amalgamation. We show that
whenever such classes are categorical in a high-enough cardinal, they admit a
good frame: a forking-like notion for types of singleton elements.
  $\mathbf{Theorem}$ (Superstability from categoricity)
  Let $K$ be a $(<\kappa)$-tame AEC with amalgamation. If $\kappa =
\beth_\kappa > \text{LS} (K)$ and $K$ is categorical in a $\lambda > \kappa$,
then:
  * $K$ is stable in all cardinals $\ge \kappa$.
  * $K$ is categorical in $\kappa$.
  * There is a type-full good $\lambda$-frame with underlying class
$K_\lambda$.
  Under more locality conditions, we prove that the frame extends to a global
independence notion (for types of arbitrary length).
  $\mathbf{Theorem}$ (A global independence notion from categoricity)
  Let $K$ be a densely type-local, fully tame and type short AEC with
amalgamation. If $K$ is categorical in unboundedly many cardinals, then there
exists $\lambda \ge \text{LS} (K)$ such that $K_{\ge \lambda}$ admits a global
independence relation with the properties of forking in a superstable
first-order theory.
  Modulo an unproven claim of Shelah, we deduce that Shelah's categoricity
conjecture follows from the weak generalized continuum hypothesis and the
existence of unboundedly many strongly compact cardinals.
