We show that, if the Julia set of a transcendental entire function is locally
connected, then it takes the form of a spider's web in the sense defined by
Rippon and Stallard. In the opposite direction, we prove that a spider's web
Julia set is always locally connected at a dense subset of buried points. We
also show that the set of buried points (the residual Julia set) can be a
spider's web.
