We construct a semiparametric estimator in case-control studies where the
gene and the environment are assumed to be independent. A discrete or
continuous parametric distribution of the genes is assumed in the model. A
discrete distribution of the genes can be used to model the mutation or
presence of certain group of genes. A continuous distribution allows the
distribution of the gene effects to be in a finite-dimensional parametric
family and can hence be used to model the gene expression levels. We leave the
distribution of the environment totally unspecified. The estimator is derived
through calculating the efficiency score function in a hypothetical setting
where a close approximation to the samples is random. The resulting estimator
is proved to be efficient in the hypothetical situation. The efficiency of the
estimator is further demonstrated to hold in the case-control setting as well.
