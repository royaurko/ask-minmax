We use computer simulations to investigate the static properties of a simple
glass-forming fluid in which the positions of a finite fraction of the
particles has been frozen in. By probing the equilibrium distribution of the
overlap between independent configurations of the liquid, we find strong
evidence that this random pinning induces a glass transition. At low
temperatures, our numerical findings are consistent with the existence of a
random first order phase transition rounded by finite size effects.
