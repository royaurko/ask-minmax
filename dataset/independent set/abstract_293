We consider the problem of discriminating between states of a specified set
with maximum confidence. For a set of linearly independent states unambiguous
discrimination is possible if we allow for the possibility of an inconclusive
result. For linearly dependent sets an analogous measurement is one which
allows us to be as confident as possible that when a given state is identified
on the basis of the measurement result, it is indeed the correct state.
