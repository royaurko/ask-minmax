Ferroelectricity is observed in orthorhombic $HoMnO_3$ and $YMnO_3$ at the
magnetic lock-in transitions into an E-type structure or an incommensurate
phase with a temperature independent wave vector, respectively. In $HoMnO_3$
the ferroelectric polarization strongly depends on the external magnetic field
indicating the involvement of the rare earth moment order in this compound. The
results are discussed within the framework of recent theoretical models, in
particular the double exchange driven polar displacements predicted for E-type
magnetic structures.
