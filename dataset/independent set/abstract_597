We provide a sharp lower bound for the perimeter of the inner parallel sets
of a convex body $\Omega$. The bound depends only on the perimeter and inradius
of the original body and states that \[ |\partial\Omega_t| \geq
\Bigl(1-\frac{t}{R_{in}}\Bigr)^{n-1}_+ |\partial \Omega|. \] In particular the
bound is independent of any regularity properties of $\partial\Omega$. As a
by-product of the proof we establish precise conditions for equality. The
proof, which is rather straightforward, is based on the construction of an
extremal set for a certain optimization problem and the use of basic properties
of mixed volumes.
