Some remarkable properties of the beta distribution are based on relations
involving independence between beta random variables such that a parameter of
one among them is the sum of the parameters of an other (see (1.1) et (1.2)
below). Asci, Letac and Piccioni \cite{6} have used the real
beta-hypergeometric distribution on $ \reel$ to give a general version of these
properties without the condition on the parameters. In the present paper, we
extend the properties of the real beta to the beta distribution on symmetric
matrices, we use on the positive definite matrices the division algorithm
defined by the Cholesky decomposition to define a matrix-variate
beta-hypergeometric distribution, and we extend to this distribution the
proprieties established in the real case by Asci, Letac and Piccioni
