The Merrifield-Simmons conjectures states a relation between the distance of
vertices in a simple graph $G$ and the number of independent sets, denoted as
$\sigma(G)$, in vertex-deleted subgraphs. Namely, that the sign of the term
$\sigma(G_{-u}) \cdot \sigma(G_{-v}) - \sigma(G) \cdot \sigma(G_{-u-v})$ only
depends on the parity of the distance of $u$ and $v$ in $G$. We prove this
statement in the case of parity graphs and give some evidence that this result
may not be further generalized to other classes of graphs.
