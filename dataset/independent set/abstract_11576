A calculation of the deuteron polarization observables $A^d_y$, $A_{yy}$,
$A_{xx}$, $A_{xz}$ and the differential cross-section for elastic
nucleon-deuteron scattering at incident deuteron energies 270 and 880 MeV in
lab is presented. A comparison of the calculations with two different deuteron
wave-functions derived from the Bonn-CD $NN$-potential model and the dressed
bag quark model is carried out. A model-independent approach, based on an
optical potential framework, is used in which a nucleon-nucleon $T$-matrix is
assumed to be local and taken on the energy shell, but still depends on the
internal nucleon momentum in a deuteron.
