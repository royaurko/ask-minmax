We present generalization of the Bloom variety theorem of ordered algebras in
fuzzy setting. We introduce algebras with fuzzy orders which consist of sets of
functions which are compatible with particular binary fuzzy relations called
fuzzy orders. Fuzzy orders are defined on universe sets of algebras using
complete residuated lattices as structures of degrees. In this setting, we show
that classes of models of fuzzy sets of inequalities are closed under suitably
defined formations of subalgebras, homomorphic images, and direct products.
Conversely, we prove that classes having these closure properties are definable
by fuzzy sets of inequalities.
