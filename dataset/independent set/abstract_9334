Optically-trapped two-component Fermi gases near a broad Feshbach resonance
exhibit universal thermodynamics, where the properties of the gas are
independent of the details of the two-body scattering interactions. We present
a global proof that such a universal gas obeys the virial theorem for {\it any}
trapping potential $U$ and any spin mixture, without assuming either the local
density approximation or harmonic confinement. The total energy of the gas is
given in scale invariant form by $E=<\epsilon\partial U/\partial\epsilon>$,
where $\epsilon$ is an {\it arbitrary} energy scale in terms of which all
length and energy scales that appear in the confining potential are written.
This result enables model-independent energy measurement in traps that are
anharmonic as well as anisotropic by observing only the cloud profile, and
provides a consistency check for many-body calculations in the universal
regime.
