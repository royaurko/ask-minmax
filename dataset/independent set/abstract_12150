Given an edge-independent random graph G(n,p), we determine various facts
about the cohomology of graph products of groups for the graph G(n,p). In
particular, the random graph product of a sequence of finite groups is a
rational duality group with probability tending to 1 as n goes to infinity.
This includes random right angled Coxeter groups as a special case.
