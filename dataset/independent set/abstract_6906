We extend the validity of a Gromov's dimension comparison estimate for
topological hypersurfaces to sufficiently large classes of rectifiable sets,
arising from Sobolev mappings. Our tools are a suitably weak exterior
differentiation for pullback differential forms and a new low rank property for
Sobolev mappings.
