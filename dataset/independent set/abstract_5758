We study electron-electron contact-interaction searches in the process
e^+e^-\to e^+e^- at a future e^+e^- Linear Collider with both beams
longitudinally polarized. We evaluate the model-independent constraints on the
coupling constants, emphasizing the role of beam polarization, and make a
comparison with the case of e^+e^-\to\mu^+\mu^-.
