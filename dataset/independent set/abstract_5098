In this paper we prove three theorems about the theory of Borel sets in
models of ZF without any form of the axiom of choice. We prove that if B is a
G-delta-sigma set, then either B is countable or B contains a perfect subset.
Second, we prove that if the real line is the countable union of countable
sets, then there exists an F-sigma-delta set which is uncountable but contains
no perfect subset. Finally, we construct a model of ZF in which we have an
infinite Dedekind finite set of reals which is F-sigma-delta.
