In this paper we consider the Anderson model with decaying randomness and
show that statistics near the band edges in the absolutely continuous spectrum
in dimensions $d \geq 3$ is independent of the randomness and agrees with that
of the free part. We also consider the operators at small coupling and identify
the length scales at which the statistics agrees with the free one in the limit
when the coupling constant goes to zero.
