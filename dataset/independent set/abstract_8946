We present finite sets of generators of the full automorphism groups of three
singular K3 surfaces, on which the alternating group of degree 6 acts
symplectically. We also present a finite set of generators of the full
automorphism group of an associated Enriques surface, on which the Mathieu
group M_{10} acts.
