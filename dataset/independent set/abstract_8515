In this article we construct new minimal intersection sets in $AG(r,q^2)$
with respect to hyperplanes, of size $q^{2r-1}$ and multiplicity $t$, where
$t\in \{ q^{2r-3}-q^{(3r-5)/2}, q^{2r-3}+q^{(3r-5)/2}-q^{(3r-3)/2}\}$, for $r$
odd or $t \in \{ q^{2r-3}-q^{(3r-4)/2}, q^{2r-3}-q^{r-2}\}$, for $r$ even. As a
byproduct, for any odd $q$ we get a new family of two-character multisets in
$PG(3,q^2)$. The essential idea is to investigate some point-sets in
$AG(r,q^2)$ satisfying the opposite of the algebraic conditions required in [1]
for quasi--Hermitian varieties.
