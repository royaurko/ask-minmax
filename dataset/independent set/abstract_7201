In the theory of algebraic group actions on affine varieties, the concept of
a Kempf-Ness set is used to replace the categorical quotient by the quotient
with respect to a maximal compact subgroup. By making use of the recent
achievements of "toric topology" we show that an appropriate notion of a
Kempf-Ness set exists for a class of algebraic torus actions on quasiaffine
varieties (coordinate subspace arrangement complements) arising in the
Batyrev-Cox "geometric invariant theory" approach to toric varieties. We
proceed by studying the cohomology of these "toric" Kempf-Ness sets. In the
case of projective non-singular toric varieties the Kempf-Ness sets can be
described as complete intersections of real quadrics in a complex space.
