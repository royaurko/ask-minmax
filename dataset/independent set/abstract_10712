The teleparallel versions of the Einstein and the Landau-Lifshitz
energy-momentum complexes of the gravitational field are obtained. By using
these complexes, the total energy of the universe, which includes the energy of
both the matter and the gravitational fields, is then obtained. It is shown
that the total energy vanishes independently of both the curvature parameter
and the three dimensionless coupling constants of teleparallel gravity.
