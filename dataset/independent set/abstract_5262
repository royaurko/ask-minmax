We introduce several classes of set-valued maps with generalized convexity.
We obtain minimax theorems for set-valued maps which satisfy the introduced
properties and are not continuous, by using a fixed point theorem for weakly
naturally quasi-concave set-valued maps defined on a simplex in a topological
vector space.
