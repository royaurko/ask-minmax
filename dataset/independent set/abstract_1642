In March 2009, the DZero Collaboration first observed the electroweak
production of single top quarks at 5 sigma significance. We measured the cross
section for the combined s-channel and t-channel production modes, and set a
lower limit on the CKM matrix element |V_tb|. Since then, we have used the same
dataset to measure the t-channel production mode independently, the combined
cross section in the hadronically-decaying tau lepton final state, and the
width and lifetime of the top quark, and we have set upper limits on
contributions from anomalous flavor-changing neutral currents. This paper
describes these new measurements, as presented at the 3rd International
Workshop on Top Quark Physics, held in Brugge, Belgium, May 31 - June 4, 2010.
