We report a method for making horizontal wrap-gate nanowire transistors with
up to four independently controllable wrap-gated segments. While the step up to
two independent wrap-gates requires a major change in fabrication methodology,
a key advantage to this new approach, and the horizontal orientation more
generally, is that achieving more than two wrap-gate segments then requires no
extra fabrication steps. This is in contrast to the vertical orientation, where
a significant subset of the fabrication steps needs to be repeated for each
additional gate. We show that cross-talk between adjacent wrap-gate segments is
negligible despite separations less than 200 nm. We also demonstrate the
ability to make multiple wrap-gate transistors on a single nanowire using the
exact same process. The excellent scalability potential of horizontal wrap-gate
nanowire transistors makes them highly favourable for the development of
advanced nanowire devices and possible integration with vertical wrap-gate
nanowire transistors in 3D nanowire network architectures.
