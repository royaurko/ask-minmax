In this paper we introduce a fuzzy version of symport/antiport membrane
systems. Our fuzzy membrane systems handle possibly inexact copies of reactives
and their rules are endowed with threshold functions that determine whether a
rule can be applied or not to a given set of objects, depending of the degree
of accuracy of these objects to the reactives specified in the rule. We prove
that these fuzzy membrane systems generate exactly the recursively enumerable
finite-valued fuzzy sets of natural numbers.
