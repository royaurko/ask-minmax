It has been shown recently, in a joint work with Michel Dubois-Violette and
Marc Wambst (see math.QA/0203035), that Koszul property of $N$-homogeneous
algebras (as defined in the original paper) becomes natural in a $N$-complex
setting. A basic question is to define the differential of the bimodule Koszul
complex of an $N$-homogeneous algebra, e.g., for computing its Hochschild
homology. The differential defined here uses $N$-complexes. That puts right the
wrong differential presented in the original paper in a 2-complex setting.
Actually, as we shall see, it is impossible to avoid $N$-complexes in defining
the differential, whereas the bimodule Koszul complex is a 2-complex.
