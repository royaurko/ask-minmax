It is shown that $A:=H_{1,\eta}(G)$, the Sympectic Reflection Algebra, has
$T_G$ independent traces, where $T_G$ is the number of conjugacy classes of
elements without eigenvalue 1 belonging to the finite group $G$ generated by
the system of symplectic reflections.
  Simultaneously, we show that the algebra $A$, considered as a superalgebra
with a natural parity, has $S_G$ independent supertraces, where $S_G$ is the
number of conjugacy classes of elements without eigenvalue -1 belonging to $G$.
  We consider also $A$ as a Lie algebra $A^L$ and as a Lie superalgebra $A^S$.
  It is shown that if $A$ is a simple associative algebra, then the
supercommutant $[A^{S},A^{S}]$ is a simple Lie superalgebra having at least
$S_G$ independent supersymmetric invariant non-degenerate bilinear forms, and
the quotient $[A^L,A^L]/([A^L,A^L]\cap\mathbb C)$ is a simple Lie algebra
having at least $T_G$ independent symmetric invariant non-degenerate bilinear
forms.
