The time-independent Schroedinger and Klein-Gordon equations - as well as any
other Helmholtz-like equation - were recently shown to be associated with exact
sets of ray-trajectories (coupled by a "Wave Potential" function encoded in
their structure itself) describing any kind of wave-like features, such as
diffraction and interference. This property suggests to view Wave Mechanics as
a direct, causal and realistic, extension of Classical Mechanics, based on
exact trajectories and motion laws of point-like particles "piloted" by de
Broglie's matter waves and avoiding the probabilistic content and the
wave-packets both of the standard Copenhagen interpretation and of Bohm's
theory.
