We show that the linear viscoelastic materials, and more generally the
physical phenomena to which Biot's relaxation theory is relevant, can be put in
correspondance with the laws of processes with independent increments. In the
one dimensional case this correspondence is one to one with subordinators and
gives rise naturally to a conjugation relation on subordinators.
