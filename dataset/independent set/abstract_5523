Given a finite set $X$ of points in $R^n$ and a family $F$ of sets generated
by the pairs of points of $X$, we explore conditions for the sets that allow us
to guarantee the existence of a positive-fraction subfamily $F'$ of $F$ for
which the sets have non-empty intersection. This allows us to show the
existence of weak epsilon-nets for these families. We also prove a topological
variation of weak epsilon-nets for convex sets.
