A two species reaction-diffusion model, in which particles diffuse on a
one-dimensional lattice and annihilate when meeting each other, has been
investigated. Mean field equations for general choice of reaction rates have
been solved exactly. Cluster mean field approximation of the model is also
studied. It is shown that, the general form of large time behavior of one- and
two-point functions of the number operators, are determined by the diffusion
rates of the two type of species, and is independent of annihilation rates.
