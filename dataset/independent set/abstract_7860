We study Aharony dualities for 3d N=2 gauge theories of classical gauge group
with one adjoint and fundamental matters. We work out the 3d superconformal
index for the dual pairs to find the perfect matchings. Along with it, we
enumerate the independent monopole operators parametrizing the Coulomb branches
and confirm the nonperturbative truncation of the chiral rings, consistent with
the proposed dualities.
