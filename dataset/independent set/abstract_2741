Assume that one aims to simulate an event of unknown probability $s\in (0,1)$
which is uniquely determined, however only its approximations can be obtained
using a finite computational effort. Such settings are often encountered in
statistical simulations. We consider two specific examples. First, the exact
simulation of non-linear diffusions, second, the celebrated Bernoulli factory
problem of generating an $f(p)-$coin given a sequence $X_1,X_2,...$ of
independent tosses of a $p-$coin (with known $f$ and unknown $p$). We describe
a general framework and provide algorithms where this kind of problems can be
fitted and solved. The algorithms are straightforward to implement and thus
allow for effective simulation of desired events of probability $s.$ In the
case of diffusions, we obtain the algorithm of \cite{BeskosRobertsEA1} as a
specific instance of the generic framework developed here. In the case of the
Bernoulli factory, our work offers a statistical understanding of the
Nacu-Peres algorithm for $f(p) = \min\{2p, 1-2\varepsilon\}$ (which is central
to the general question) and allows for its immediate implementation that
avoids algorithmic difficulties of the original version.
