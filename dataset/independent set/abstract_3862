Early deep inelastic scattering (DIS) experiments at SLAC discovered partons,
identified them as quarks and gluons, and restricted the set of the candidate
theories for strong interactions to those exhibiting the asymptotic freedom
property. The next generation DIS experiments at FNAL and CERN confirmed the
predictions of QCD for the size of the scaling violation effects in the nucleon
structure functions. The QCD fits to their data resulted in determining the
momentum distributions of the point-like constituents of nucleons.
Interpretation of data coming from all these experiments and, in the case of
the SLAC experiments, even an elaboration of the running strategies, would not
have been possible without a precise understanding of the electromagnetic
radiative corrections. In this note I recollect the important milestones,
achieved in the period preceding the HERA era, in the high precision
calculations of the radiative corrections to DIS, and in the development of the
methods of their experimental control. I present subsequently the measurement
strategies and discuss the advanced radiative correction tools for the HERA
experimental program, with an emphasis on their role in the first, model
independent, measurement of the partonic densities in the small-$x_{Bj}$
region. These notes are dedicated to Staszek Jadach as a contribution to the
celebration of his 60th-birthday.
