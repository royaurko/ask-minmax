We continue our investigation on the Nambu-Poisson description of M5-brane in
a large constant C-field background (NP M5-brane theory) constructed in
Refs.[1, 2]. In this paper, the low energy limit where the NP M5-brane theory
is applicable is clarified. The background independence of the NP M5-brane
theory is made manifest using the variables in the BLG model of multiple
M2-branes. An all order solution to the Seiberg-Witten map is also constructed.
