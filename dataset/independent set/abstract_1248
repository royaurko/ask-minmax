We consider $N\times N$ random matrices of the form $H = W + V$ where $W$ is
a real symmetric Wigner matrix and $V$ a random or deterministic, real,
diagonal matrix whose entries are independent of $W$. We assume subexponential
decay for the matrix entries of $W$ and we choose $V$ so that the eigenvalues
of $W$ and $V$ are typically of the same order. For a large class of diagonal
matrices $V$ we show that the rescaled distribution of the extremal eigenvalues
is given by the Tracy-Widom distribution $F_1$ in the limit of large $N$. Our
proofs also apply to the complex Hermitian setting, i.e., when $W$ is a complex
Hermitian Wigner matrix.
