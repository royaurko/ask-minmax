We study the flavor-dependent neutrino spectra formation in the core of a
supernova (SN) by means of Monte Carlo simulations. A high-statistics neutrino
signal from a galactic SN may contain information that severely constrains the
parameter space for neutrino oscillations. Therefore, reliable predictions for
flavor-dependent fluxes and spectra are urgently needed. In all traditional
hydrodynamic simulations the nu_mu,tau and nu_mu,tau-bar interactions commonly
included are rather schematic. With our Monte Carlo simulations we find that
the most relevant sources for nu_mu,tau and nu_mu,tau-bar are traditionally not
included. In comparing our numerical results for all flavors we find the
standard hierarchy of mean energies nu_e < nu_e-bar < nu_mu,tau, with, however,
very similar values for nu_mu,tau and nu_e-bar. The luminosities of nu_mu,tau
and nu_mu,tau-bar can differ by up to a factor of 2 from L_nue-bar and L_nue,
the latter two are very similar. The Garching Group obtains similar results
from their self-consistent simulation with the full set of interactions. These
results are almost orthogonal to the previous standard picture of exactly equal
luminosities of all flavors and differences in mean energies of up to a factor
of 2. Existing concepts for identifying oscillation effects in a SN neutrino
signal need to be revised. We present two methods for detecting the
earth-matter effect that are rather independent of predictions from SN
simulations.
