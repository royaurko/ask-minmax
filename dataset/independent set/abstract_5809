From velocity-gated small-angle correlation functions the emission chronology
can be deduced for non-identical particles, if the emission is independent.
This is not the case for non-identical particles that originate from two-body
decay of fragments. Experimental results may contain contributions from both
independent emission and two-body decay, so care is needed in interpreting the
velocity-gated correlation functions. It is shown that in some special cases,
it is still possible to deduce the emission chronology, even if there is a
contribution from two-body decay.
