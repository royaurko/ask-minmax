We study hierarchical segmentation in the framework of edge-weighted graphs.
We define ultrametric watersheds as topological watersheds null on the minima.
We prove that there exists a bijection between the set of ultrametric
watersheds and the set of hierarchical segmentations. We end this paper by
showing how to use the proposed framework in practice in the example of
constrained connectivity; in particular it allows to compute such a hierarchy
following a classical watershed-based morphological scheme, which provides an
efficient algorithm to compute the whole hierarchy.
