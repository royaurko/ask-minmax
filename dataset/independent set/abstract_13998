In a previous paper, we have given an algebraic model to the set of
intervals. Here, we apply this model in a linear frame. We define a notion of
diagonalization of square matrices whose coefficients are intervals. But in
this case, with respect to the real case, a matrix of order $n$ could have more
than $n$ eigenvalues (the set of intervals is not factorial). We consider a
notion of central eigenvalues permits to describe criterium of diagonalization.
As application, we define a notion of Exponential mapping.
