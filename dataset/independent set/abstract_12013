A new approach to solving the Time-Dependent Self-Consistent-Field equations
is developed based on the double quotient formulation of Tsiper [J. Phys. B, 34
L401 (2001)]. Dual channel, quasi-independent non-linear optimization of these
quotients is found to yield convergence rates approaching those of the best
case (single channel) Tamm-Dancoff approximation. This formulation is
variational with respect to matrix truncation, admitting linear scaling
solution of the matrix-eigenvalue problem, which is demonstrated for bulk
excitons in the polyphenylene vinylene oligimer and the (4,3) carbon nanotube
segment.
