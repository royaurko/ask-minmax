We report evidence for $N(1710)P_{11}$, $N(1875)P_{11}$, $N(1900)P_{13}$,
$\Delta(1600)P_{33}$, $\Delta(1910)P_{31}$, and $\Delta(1920)P_{33}$, and find
indications that $N(1900)P_{13}$ might have a companion state at 1970\,MeV. The
controversial $\Delta(1750)P_{31}$ is not seen. The evidence is derived from a
study of data on pion- and photo-induced hyperon production, but other data are
included as well. Most of the resonances reported here were found in the
Karlsruhe-Helsinki (KH84) and the Carnegie-Mellon (CM) analyses but were
challenged recently by the Data Analysis Center at GWU. Our analysis is
constrained by the energy independent $\pi N$ scattering amplitudes from either
KH84 or GWU. The two $\pi N$ amplitudes from KH84 or GWU, respectively, lead to
slightly different $\pi N$ branching ratios of contributing resonances but the
debated resonances are required in both series of fits.
