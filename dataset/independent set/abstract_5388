Harborth [{\it Elemente der Mathematik}, Vol. 33 (5), 116--118, 1978] proved
that every set of 10 points in the plane, no three on a line, contains an empty
convex pentagon. From this it follows that the number of disjoint empty convex
pentagons in any set of $n$ points in the plane is least
$\lfloor\frac{n}{10}\rfloor$. In this paper we prove that every set of 19
points in the plane, no three on a line, contains two disjoint empty convex
pentagons. We also show that any set of $2m+9$ points in the plane, where $m$
is a positive integer, can be subdivided into three disjoint convex regions,
two of which contains $m$ points each, and another contains a set of 9 points
containing an empty convex pentagon. Combining these two results, we obtain
non-trivial lower bounds on the number of disjoint empty convex pentagons in
planar points sets. We show that the number of disjoint empty convex pentagons
in any set of $n$ points in the plane, no three on a line, is at least
$\lfloor\frac{5n}{47}\rfloor$. This bound has been further improved to
$\frac{3n-1}{28}$ for infinitely many $n$.
