Creation of electron or exciton by external fields in a system with initially
statistically independent unrelaxed vibrational modes leads to an initial
condition term. The contribution of this term in the time convolution
generalized master equation approach is studied in second order of the
perturbation theory in the path integral formalism. The developed approach,
applied for analysis of dynamics in the photosynthetic reaction center,
exhibits the key role of the initial condition terms at the primary stage of
electron transfer.
