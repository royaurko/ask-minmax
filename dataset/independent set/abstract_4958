The goals of this paper are to obtain theoretical models of what happens when
a computer calculates the rotation set of a homeomorphism, and to find a good
algorithm to perform simulations of this rotation set. To do that we introduce
the notion of observable rotation set, which takes into account the fact that
we can only detect phenomenon appearing on positive Lebesgue measure sets; we
also define the asymptotic discretized rotation set which in addition takes
into account the fact that the computer calculates with a finite number of
digits It appears that both theoretical results and simulations suggest that
the asymptotic discretized rotation set is a much better approximation of the
rotation set than the observable rotation set, in other words we need to do
coarse roundoff errors to obtain numerically the rotation set.
