We propose a new method of finding the mutually unbiased bases for three
qubits. The key element is the construction of the table of
striation-generating curves in the discrete phase space. We derive a system of
equations in the Galois field GF(8) and show that the solutions of these
equations are sufficient for the construction of the general sets of complete
mutually unbiased bases. A few examples are presented in order to show how our
algorithm works in the cases: striation table with three, two axes, and one and
no axis in the discrete phase space.
