Let F be a square integrable Maass form on the Siegel upper half space of
rank 2 for the Siegel modular group Sp(4, Z) with Laplace eigenvalue lambda.
If, in addition, F is a joint eigenfunction of the Hecke algebra, we show a
power-saving sup-norm bound in terms of lambda (relative to the generic bound)
for F restricted to a compact set. As an auxiliary result of independent
interest we prove new uniform bounds for spherical functions on semisimple Lie
groups.
