We propose a multi-agent algorithm able to automatically discover relevant
regularities in a given dataset, determining at the same time the set of
configurations of the adopted parametric dissimilarity measure yielding compact
and separated clusters. Each agent operates independently by performing a
Markovian random walk on a suitable weighted graph representation of the input
dataset. Such a weighted graph representation is induced by the specific
parameter configuration of the dissimilarity measure adopted by the agent,
which searches and takes decisions autonomously for one cluster at a time.
Results show that the algorithm is able to discover parameter configurations
that yield a consistent and interpretable collection of clusters. Moreover, we
demonstrate that our algorithm shows comparable performances with other similar
state-of-the-art algorithms when facing specific clustering problems.
