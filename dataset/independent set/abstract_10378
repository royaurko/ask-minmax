It is widely held that the Random Energy Model (REM) describes the freezing
transition of a variety of types of heteropolymers. We demonstrate that the
hallmark property of REM, statistical independence of the energies of states
over disorder, is violated in different ways for models commonly employed in
heteropolymer freezing studies. The implications for proteins are also
discussed.
