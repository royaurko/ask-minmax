We study in this report the so-called Strictly Subgaussian (SSub) random
variables (r.v.), which form a very interest subclass of Subgaussian (Sub)
r.v., and obtain the exact exponential bounds for tail of distribution for sums
of independent and disjoint such a variables, not necessary to be identical
distributed, and give some new examples of SSub variables to show the exactness
of our estimates.
  We extend also these results on the case of sums of subgaussian martingale
differences, and show that the mixture of (Strictly) Subgaussian r.v. forms
also (Strictly) subgaussian variable.
