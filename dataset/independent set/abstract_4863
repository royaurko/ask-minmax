Recently, Feng and Xiang \cite{FX113} found a new construction of skew
Hadamard difference sets in elementary abelian groups. In this paper, we
introduce a new invariant for equivalence of skew Hadamard difference sets,
namely triple intersection numbers modulo a prime, and discuss inequivalence
between Feng-Xiang skew Hadamard difference sets and the Paley difference sets.
As a consequence, we show that their construction produces infinitely many skew
Hadamard difference sets inequivalent to the Paley difference sets.
