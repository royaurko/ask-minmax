We develop a generic reprersentation-independent contraction procedure for
obtaining, for instance, $R_{\sf h}$ and $L$ operators of arbitrary dimensions
for the quantized ${\cal U}_{\sf h}(osp(2|1))$ algebra corresponding to the
classical $r_2$ matrix from the pertinent quantities of the standard q-deformed
${\cal U}_q(osp(2|1))$ algebra. Also the quantized ${\bf U_h}(osp(2|1))$
algebra corresponding to the classical $r_1$ matrix comprising of the
generators of the classical $sl(2)$ algebra is obtained in terms of a nonlinear
basis set.
