Physics concepts have often been borrowed and independently developed by
other fields of science. In this perspective a significant example is that of
entropy in Information Theory. The aim of this paper is to provide a short and
pedagogical introduction to the use of data compression techniques for the
estimate of entropy and other relevant quantities in Information Theory and
Algorithmic Information Theory. We consider in particular the LZ77 algorithm as
case study and discuss how a zipper can be used for information extraction.
