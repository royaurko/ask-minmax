In this paper, we study a class of backward stochastic Volterra integral
equations driven by Teugels martingales associated with an independent L\'{e}vy
process and an independent Brownian motion (BSVIELs). We prove the existence
and uniqueness as well as stability of the adapted M-solutions for those
equations. Moreover, a duality principle and then a comparison theorem are
established. As an application, we derive a class of dynamic risk measures by
means of M-solutions of certain BSVIELs.
