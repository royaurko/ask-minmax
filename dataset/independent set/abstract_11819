Cervenka et al. have recently reported ferromagnetism along graphite steps.
We present Magnetic Force microscopy (MFM) data showing that the signal along
the steps is independent of an external magnetic field. Moreover, by combining
Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) and MFM, we are able to separate the
electrostatic and magnetic interactions along the steps obtaining an upper
bound for the magnetic force gradient of about16 microN/m, a figure six times
lower than the lowest theoretical bound reported by Cervenka et al. Our
experiments suggest absence of MFM signal in graphite at room temperature.
