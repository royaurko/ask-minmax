We study Graver test sets for families of linear multi-stage stochastic
integer programs with varying number of scenarios. We show that these test sets
can be decomposed into finitely many ``building blocks'', independent of the
number of scenarios, and we give an effective procedure to compute these
building blocks. The paper includes an introduction to Nash-Williams' theory of
better-quasi-orderings, which is used to show termination of our algorithm. We
also apply this theory to finiteness results for Hilbert functions.
