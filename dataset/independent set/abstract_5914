This paper considers how to measure the magnitude of the sum of independent
random variables in several ways. We give a formula for the tail distribution
for sequences that satisfy the so called Levy property. We then give a
connection between the tail distribution and the pth moment, and between the
pth moment and the rearrangement invariant norms.
