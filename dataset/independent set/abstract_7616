A new way of supersymmetry breaking involving a dynamical parameter is
introduced. It is independent of particle phenomenology and gauge groups. The
only requirement is that Lorentz invariance be valid strictly infinitesimally
(i. e. Spin(1,3) be for some values of the parameter replaced by a compact
group G locally isomorphic to Spin(1,3).
