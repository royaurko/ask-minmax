We consider (graph-)group-valued random element $\xi$, discuss the properties
of a mean-set $\ME(\xi)$, and prove the generalization of the strong law of
large numbers for graphs and groups. Furthermore, we prove an analogue of the
classical Chebyshev's inequality for $\xi$ and Chernoff-like asymptotic bounds.
In addition, we prove several results about configurations of mean-sets in
graphs and discuss computational problems together with methods of computing
mean-sets in practice and propose an algorithm for such computation.
