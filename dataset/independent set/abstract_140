Let G be a graph with maximum degree \Delta whose vertex set is partitioned
into parts V(G) = V_1 \cup ... \cup V_r. A transversal is a subset of V(G)
containing exactly one vertex from each part V_i. If it is also an independent
set, then we call it an independent transversal. The local degree of G is the
maximum number of neighbors of a vertex v in a part V_i, taken over all choices
of V_i and v \not \in V_i. We prove that for every fixed \epsilon > 0, if all
part sizes |V_i| >= (1+\epsilon)\Delta and the local degree of G is o(\Delta),
then G has an independent transversal for sufficiently large \Delta. This
extends several previous results and settles (in a stronger form) a conjecture
of Aharoni and Holzman. We then generalize this result to transversals that
induce no cliques of size s. (Note that independent transversals correspond to
s=2.) In that context, we prove that parts of size |V_i| >=
(1+\epsilon)[\Delta/(s-1)] and local degree o(\Delta) guarantee the existence
of such a transversal, and we provide a construction that shows this is
asymptotically tight.
