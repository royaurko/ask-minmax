We analyse the Witten-Woronowicz's type deformations of the Lie superalgebras
spl(N,1) and obtain deformations parametrized by N(N-1)/2 independent
parameters for N>2 and by three parameters for N=2. For some of these algebras,
finite dimensional representations can be constructed in terms of finite
difference operators, providing operators that are relevant for the
classification of quasi exactly solvable, finite difference equations.
