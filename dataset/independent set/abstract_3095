We demonstrate that point-like defects in non-collinear magnets give rise to
a highly dispersive structure in the magnon scattering, violating a standard
paradigm of its momentum independence. For a single impurity spin coupled to a
prototypical non-collinear antiferromagnet we find that the resolvent is
dominated by a distinct dispersive structure with its momentum-dependence set
by the magnon dispersion and shifted by the ordering vector. This feature is a
consequence of umklapp scattering off the impurity-induced spin texture, which
arises due to the non-collinear ground state of the host system. Detailed
results for the staggered and uniform magnetization of this texture as well as
the T-matrix from numerical linear spin-wave theory are presented.
