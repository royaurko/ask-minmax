It's a common knowledge that the quasielastic neutrino-neutron and
antineutrino-proton cross sections tend to the same constant as (anti)neutrino
energy becomes high. In this paper we calculate the exact expression of the
limit in terms of the parameters describing quasielastic scattering. We check
that even at very high energies only small absolute values of the four-momentum
transfer contribute to the cross section, hence the Fermi theory can be
applied. The dipole approximation of the form factors allows to perform
analytic calculations. Obtained results are neutrino-flavour independent.
