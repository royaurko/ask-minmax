The problem of hypothesis testing is examined from both the historical and
Bayesian points of view in the case that sampling is from an underlying joint
probability distribution and the hypotheses tested for are those of
independence and dependence of the underlying distribution. Exact results for
the Bayesian method are provided. Asymptotic Bayesian results and historical
method test quantities are compared, and historical method quantities are
interpreted in terms of clearly defined Bayesian quantities. The asymptotic
Bayesian test relies upon a statistic that is primarily mutual information.
