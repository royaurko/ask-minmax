Assuming that agents' preferences satisfy first-order stochastic dominance,
we show how the Expected Utility paradigm can rationalize all optimal
investment choices: the optimal investment strategy in any behavioral
law-invariant (state-independent) setting corresponds to the optimum for an
expected utility maximizer with an explicitly derived concave non-decreasing
utility function. This result enables us to infer the utility and risk aversion
of agents from their investment choice in a non-parametric way. We relate the
property of decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA) to distributional
properties of the terminal wealth and of the financial market. Specifically, we
show that DARA is equivalent to a demand for a terminal wealth that has more
spread than the opposite of the log pricing kernel at the investment horizon.
