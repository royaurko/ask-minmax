Large N matrices can describe covariant derivatives in curved space. Applying
this interpretation to the IKKT matrix model, the field equation of gravity is
derived from the matrix equation of motion. We study classical solutions of
this field equation with torsion degrees of freedom in empty spacetime. Time
dependent solutions with homogeneity and isotropy, and time independent
solutions with spherical symmetry are investigated under particular settings of
torsions.
