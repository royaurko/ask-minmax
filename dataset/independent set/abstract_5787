The associative superalgebra of observables of 3-particle Calogero model
giving all wavefunctions of the model via standard Fock procedure has 2
independent supertraces. It is shown here that when the coupling constant \nu
is equal to n+1/3, n-1/3 or n+1/2 for any integer n the existence of 2
independent supertraces leads to existence of nontrivial two-sided ideal in the
superalgebra of observables.
