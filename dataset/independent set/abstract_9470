We parameterize the enhancement of threshold effects away from hadronic
endpoint that arise due to the steeply falling nature of parton distribution
functions, within the context of soft-collinear effective theory. This is
accomplished in a process-independent way by directly linking the charac-
teristic scale of soft and collinear radiation, \lambda, to the shape of the
pdfs. This allows us quantify the power corrections to partonic threshold
resummation as a function of the invariant mass and rapidity of the final
state. In the context of SCET, being able to compute \lambda in a
process-independent manner allows us to determine the correct scale for
threshold resummation after integration with the pdfs, without any additional
procedure.
