We show that some set-theoretic assumptions (for example Martin's Axiom)
imply that there is no translation invariant Borel hull operation on the family
of Lebesgue null sets and on the family of meager sets in (in R^n). We also
prove that if the meager ideal admits a monotone Borel hull operation, then
there is also a monotone Borel hull operation on the sigma-algebra of sets with
the property of Baire.
