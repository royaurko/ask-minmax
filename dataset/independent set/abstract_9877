We prove that for any partition of the plane into a closed set $C$ and an
open set $O$ and for any configuration $T$ of three points, there is a
translated and rotated copy of $T$ contained in $C$ or in $O$. Apart from that,
we consider partitions of the plane into two sets whose common boundary is a
union of piecewise linear curves. We show that for any such partition and any
configuration $T$ which is a vertex set of a non-equilateral triangle there is
a copy of $T$ contained in the interior of one of the two partition classes.
Furthermore, we give the characterization of these "polygonal" partitions that
avoid copies of a given equilateral triple. These results support a conjecture
of Erdos, Graham, Montgomery, Rothschild, Spencer and Straus, which states that
every two-coloring of the plane contains a monochromatic copy of any
nonequilateral triple of points; on the other hand, we disprove a stronger
conjecture by the same contributors, by providing non-trivial examples of
two-colorings that avoid a given equilateral triple.
