Recently, Dziembowski et al. introduced the notion of non-malleable codes
(NMC), inspired from the notion of non-malleability in cryptography and the
work of Gennaro et al. in 2004 on tamper proof security. Informally, when using
NMC, if an attacker modifies a codeword, decoding this modified codeword will
return either the original message or a completely unrelated value.
  The definition of NMC is related to a family of modifications contributorized to
the attacker. In their paper, Dziembowski et al. propose a construction valid
for the family of all bit-wise independent functions.
  In this article, we study the link between the second version of the Wire-Tap
(WT) Channel, introduced by Ozarow and Wyner in 1984, and NMC. Using
coset-coding, we describe a new construction for NMC w.r.t. a subset of the
family of bit-wise independent functions. Our scheme is easier to build and
more efficient than the one proposed by Dziembowski et al.
