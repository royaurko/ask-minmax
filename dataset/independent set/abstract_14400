Radio frequency reflectometry is demonstrated in a sub-micron undoped
AlGaAs/GaAs device. Undoped single electron transistors (SETs) are attractive
candidates to study single electron phenomena due to their charge stability and
robust electronic properties after thermal cycling. However these devices
require a large top-gate which is unsuitable for the fast and sensitive radio
frequency reflectometry technique. Here we demonstrate rf reflectometry is
possible in an undoped SET.
