We consider fixed points of the Feigenbaum (periodic-doubling) operator whose
orders tend to infinity. It is known that the hyperbolic dimension of their
Julia sets go to 2. We prove that the Lebesgue measure of these Julia sets tend
to zero. An important part of the proof consists in applying martingale theory
to a stochastic process with non-integrable increments.
