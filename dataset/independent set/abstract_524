A topological space is called P_2 ( P_3, P_{<omega} ) if and only if it does
not contain two (three, finitely many) uncountable open sets with empty
intersection.
  We show that
 (i)   there are  0-dimensional P_{<omega} spaces  of size 2^omega,
 (ii)  there are compact P_{<omega} spaces of size omega_1,
 (iii) the existence of a Psi-like examples for a compact P_{<omega} space of
size omega_1  is independent of ZFC,
 (iv)  it is consistent that 2^omega  is as large as you wish but every first
countable (and so every compact) P_2 space has cardinality<=omega_1.
