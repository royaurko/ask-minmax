We show that the set of points with non-dense forward orbit under a
$C^{1+\theta}$-Anosov diffeomorphism with conformality on unstable manifolds is
a winning set for Schmidt games. We also show that for a
$C^{1+\theta}$-expanding endomorphism the set of points with non-dense forward
orbit is a winning set for certain variants of Schmidt games. These generalize
some results of J. Tseng in \cite{tseng} and \cite{tseng1} for $C^2$-expanding
endomorphisms on the circle and certain Anosov diffeomorphisms on the
$2$-torus.
