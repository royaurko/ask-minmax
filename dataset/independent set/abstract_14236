A family of sets $\cF \subseteq 2^{[n]}$ is defined to be $l$-trace
$k$-Sperner if for any $l$-subset $L$ of $[n]$ the family of traces $\cF|_L=\{F
\cap L: F \in \cF\}$ does not contain any chain of length $k+1$. In this paper
we prove that for any positive integers $l',k$ with $l'<k$ if $\cF$ is
$(n-l')$-trace $k$-Sperner, then $|\cF| \le (k-l'+o(1))\binom{n}{\lfloor
n/2\rfloor}$ and this bound is asymptotically tight.
