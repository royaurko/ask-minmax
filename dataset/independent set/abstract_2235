We initiate numerical studies of differentially rotating magnetised (proto)
neutron stars by studying - through construction from first principles - the
coupling between an assumed differential rotation and an impressed magnetic
field. For a perfect incompressible, homogeneous, non-dissipative fluid sphere
immersed in an ambient plasma, we solve the (coupled) azimuthal components of
the Navier-Stokes equation and the Maxwell induction equation. The assumed
time--independent poloidal field lines get dragged by the rotating fluid and
produce toroidal magnetic fields. Surface magnetic fields take away energy
redistributing the angular momentum to produce rigid rotation along poloidal
field lines. Due to absence of viscous dissipation, sustained torsional
oscillations are set up within the star. However, the perpetual oscillations of
neighbouring `closed' field lines get increasingly out of phase with time,
leading to structure build up as in Liu & Shapiro (2004) implying the
importance of taking into account diffusion (Spruit 1999) for realistic
modeling.
