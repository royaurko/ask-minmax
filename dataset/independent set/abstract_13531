In the weak-field and slow-motion approximation of general relativity, the
rotation of a body discriminates between the opposite directions of motion of a
pair of counter-revolving tests particles orbiting it along geometrically
identical trajectories: it is the so-called gravitomagnetic clock effect. In
this paper, we analytically calculate the gravitomagnetic corrections to both
the draconitic and to the anomalistic periods of arbitrarily inclined,
quasi-circular orbits for a generic orientation of the spin axis of the
primary. While the anomalistic period is left unchanged, the draconitic one
experiences a generally non-vanishing correction which, to zero order in the
eccentricity, gains a minus sign if the velocity of the test particle is
reversed. As a result, a gravitomagnetic draconitic clock effect arises since a
generally non-zero difference of the draconitic periods of a pair of
counter-orbiting test particles arises. Remarkably, it is independent of their
initial conditions, with some advantages from an experimental point of view
because, in principle, the data could be collected independently of each other
and at different epochs. Numerically integrations of the equations of motion
confirm our analytical results. The relativistic time difference turns out to
be up to about $0.5$ ms and $0.1$ ms around Jupiter and the Sun, respectively,
while it is as little as $0.6$ $\mu$s around the Earth.
