White dwarfs in globular clusters offer additional possibilities to determine
distances and ages of globular clusters, provided their spectral types and
masses are known. We therefore started a project to obtain spectra of white
dwarfs in the globular clusters NGC 6397 and NGC 6752. All observed white
dwarfs show hydrogen-rich spectra and are therefore classified as DA. Analysing
the multi-colour photometry of the white dwarfs in NGC 6752 yields an average
gravity of log g = 7.84 and 0.53 Msolar as the most probable average mass for
globular cluster white dwarfs. Using this average gravity we try to determine
independent temperatures by fitting the white dwarf spectra. While the stellar
parameters determined from spectroscopy and photometry usually agree within the
mutual error bars, the low resolution and S/N of the spectra prevent us from
setting constraints stronger than the ones derived from the photometry alone.
For the same reasons the white dwarf spectra obtained for NGC 6397
unfortunately do not provide an independent distance estimate of sufficient
accuracy to distinguish between the long and short distance scale for globular
clusters.
