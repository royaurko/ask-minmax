This paper contains a new proof of the formation of trapped spheres, in
vacuum spacetimes, by the focusing of gravitational waves, from generic data.
The first such result was obtained by Christodoulou [Chr]. We exploit the same
physical mechanism, but give a logically independent construction of these
spacetimes.
