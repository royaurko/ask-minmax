We introduce a mean-field theoretical framework to describe multiple totally
asymmetric simple exclusion processes (TASEPs) with different lattice lengths,
entry and exit rates, competing for a finite reservoir of particles. We present
relations for the partitioning of particles between the reservoir and the
lattices: these relations allow us to show that competition for particles can
have non-trivial effects on the phase behavior of individual lattices. For a
system with non-identical lattices, we find that when a subset of lattices
undergoes a phase transition from low to high density, the entire set of
lattice currents becomes independent of total particle number. We generalize
our approach to systems with a continuous distribution of lattice parameters,
for which we demonstrate that measurements of the current carried by a single
lattice type can be used to extract the entire distribution of lattice
parameters. Our approach applies to populations of TASEPs with any distribution
of lattice parameters, and could easily be extended beyond the mean-field case.
