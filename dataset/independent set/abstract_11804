It seems to be a common belief that the space in which we live is a
space-time manifold of dimension at least four. In the present article we wish
to draw attention to a slightly different possibility - a space-time
pseudomanifold (or even a generalized pseudomanifold of one dimension or
another). Basically, a pseudomanifold is in a sense a manifold K with certain
irremovable singularities inherited in the topological structure of K, and
prior and independent to any metric or differential structure imposed on K. We
explain this term for dimension 3, but it holds analogously for higher
dimensions as well ([5], [2,Sec.4]).
