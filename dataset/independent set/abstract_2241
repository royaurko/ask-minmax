The helium-atmosphere (DB) white dwarfs are commonly thought to be the
descendants of the hotter PG1159 stars, which initially have uniform He/C/O
atmospheres. In this evolutionary scenario, diffusion builds a pure He surface
layer which gradually thickens as the star cools. In the temperature range of
the pulsating DB white dwarfs (T_eff ~ 25,000 K) this transformation is still
taking place, allowing asteroseismic tests of the theory. We have obtained
dual-site observations of the pulsating DB star CBS114, to complement existing
observations of the slightly cooler star GD358. We recover the 7 independent
pulsation modes that were previously known, and we discover 4 new ones to
provide additional constraints on the models. We perform objective global
fitting of our updated double-layered envelope models to both sets of
observations, leading to determinations of the envelope masses and pure He
surface layers that qualitatively agree with the expectations of diffusion
theory. These results provide new asteroseismic evidence supporting one of the
central assumptions of spectral evolution theory, linking the DB white dwarfs
to PG1159 stars.
