In this work we apply point canonical transformations to solve some classes
of nonautonomous nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation namely, those which possess
specific cubic and quintic - time and space dependent - nonlinearities. In this
way we generalize some procedures recently published which resort to an ansatz
to the wavefunction and recover a time and space independent nonlinear equation
which can be solved explicitly. The method applied here allow us to find wide
localized (in space) soliton solutions to the nonautonomous nonlinear
Schr\"{o}dinger equation, which were not presented before. We also generalize
the external potential which traps the system and the nonlinearities terms.
