The spectral theorem of many-body Green's function theory relates
thermodynamic correlations to Green's functions. More often than not, the
matrix governing the equations of motion has zero eigenvalues. In this case,
the standard text-book approach requires both commutator and anti-commutator
Green's functions to obtain equations for that part of the correlation which
does not lie in the null space of the matrix. In this paper, we show that this
procedure fails if the projector onto the null space is dependent on the
momentum vector. We propose an alternative formulation of the theory in terms
of the non-null space alone and we show that a solution is possible if one can
find a momentum-independent projector onto some subspace of the non-null space.
To do this, we enlist the aid of the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the
equation of motion matrix in order to project out the null space, thus reducing
the size of the matrix and eliminating the need for the anti-commutator Green's
function. We extend our previous work, dealing with a ferromagnetic Heisenberg
monolayer and a momentum-independent projector onto the null space, where both
multilayer films and a momentum-dependent projector are considered. We develop
the numerical methods capable of handling these cases and offer a computational
algorithmus that should be applicable to any similar problem arising in Green's
function theory.
