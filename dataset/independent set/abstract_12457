We analyze the large-N behavior of SU(N) lattice gauge theories with adjoint
fermions by studying volume-reduced models, as pioneered by Eguchi and Kawai.
We perform simulations on a single-site lattice for Nf = 1 and Nf = 2 Wilson
Dirac fermions with values of N up to 53. We show for both values of Nf that in
the large-N limit there is a finite region, containing both light and heavy
fermions, of unbroken center symmetry where the theory exhibits volume
independence. Using large-N reduction we attempt to calculate physical
quantities such as the string tension and meson masses.
