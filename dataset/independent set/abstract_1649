Motivated by the recent interest in light WIMPs of mass ~O(10 GeV), an
extension of the elastic, spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross-section limits
resulting from the CRESST-II commissioning run (2007) are presented.
Previously, these data were used to set cross-section limits from 1000 GeV down
to ~17 GeV, using tungsten recoils, in 47.9 kg-days of exposure of calcium
tungstate. Here, the overlap of the oxygen and calcium bands with the
acceptance region of the commissioning run data set is reconstructed using
previously published quenching factors. The resulting elastic WIMP cross
section limits, accounting for the additional exposure of oxygen and calcium,
are presented down to 5 GeV.
