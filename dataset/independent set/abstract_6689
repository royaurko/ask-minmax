Similarity measure is a very important topic in fuzzy set theory. Torra
(2010) proposed the notion of hesitant fuzzy set(HFS), which is a
generalization of the notion of Zadeh' fuzzy set. In this paper, some new
similarity measures for HFSs are developed. Based on the proposed similarity
measures, a method of multiple attribute decision making under hesitant fuzzy
environment is also introduced. Additionally, a numerical example is given to
illustrate the application of the proposed similarity measures of HFSs to
decision-making.
