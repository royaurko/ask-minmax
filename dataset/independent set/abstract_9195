The chiral superstring measure constructed in the earlier papers of this
series for general gravitino slices is examined in detail for slices supported
at two points x_\alpha. In this case, the invariance of the measure under
infinitesimal changes of gravitino slices established previously is
strengthened to its most powerful form: the measure is shown, point by point on
moduli space, to be locally and globally independent from the points x_\alpha,
as well as from the superghost insertion points p_a, q_\alpha introduced
earlier as computational devices. In particular, the measure is completely
unambiguous. The limit x_\alpha = q_\alpha is then well defined. It is of
special interest, since it elucidates some subtle issues in the construction of
the picture-changing operator Y(z) central to the BRST formalism. The formula
for the chiral superstring measure in this limit is derived explicitly.
