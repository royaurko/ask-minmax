Recently the Bose-Einstein phenomenon has been proposed as possible physical
mechanism underlying the spontaneous symmetry breaking in cold gauge theories.
The mechanism is natural and we use it to drive the electroweak symmetry
breaking. It can be implemented in different ways while here we present a
simple model in which the Bose-Einstein sector is felt only indirectly by all
of the standard model fields. The structure of the corrections due to the new
mechanism is general and independent on the model used here leading to
experimental signatures which can be disentangled from other known extensions
of the standard model.
