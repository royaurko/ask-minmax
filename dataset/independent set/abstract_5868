A coded modulation system is considered in which nonbinary coded symbols are
mapped directly to nonbinary modulation signals. It is proved that if the
modulator-channel combination satisfies a particular symmetry condition, the
codeword error rate performance is independent of the transmitted codeword. It
is shown that this result holds for both linear-programming decoders and
sum-product decoders. In particular, this provides a natural modulation mapping
for nonbinary codes mapped to PSK constellations for transmission over
memoryless channels such as AWGN channels or flat fading channels with AWGN.
