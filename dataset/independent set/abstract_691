Let $X_{i,n},n\in \mathbb{N},1\leq i\leq n$, be a triangular array of
independent $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued Gaussian random vectors with correlation
matrices $\Sigma_{i,n}$. We give necessary conditions under which the row-wise
maxima converge to some max-stable distribution which generalizes the class of
H\"{u}sler-Reiss distributions. In the bivariate case, the conditions will also
be sufficient. Using these results, new models for bivariate extremes are
derived explicitly. Moreover, we define a new class of stationary, max-stable
processes as max-mixtures of Brown-Resnick processes. As an application, we
show that these processes realize a large set of extremal correlation
functions, a natural dependence measure for max-stable processes. This set
includes all functions $\psi(\sqrt{\gamma(h)}),h\in \mathbb{R}^d$, where $\psi$
is a completely monotone function and $\gamma$ is an arbitrary variogram.
