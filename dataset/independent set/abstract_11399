We consider the long-time evolution of weakly perturbed discrete nonlinear
Schroedinger breathers. While breather growth can occur through nonlinear
interaction with one single initial linear mode, breather decay is found to
require excitation of at least two independent modes. All growth and decay
processes of lowest order are found to disappear for breathers larger than a
threshold value.
