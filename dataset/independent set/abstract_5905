The problem of gauge symmetry in higher derivative Lagrangian systems is
discussed from a Hamiltonian point of view. The number of independent gauge
parameters is shown to be in general {\it{less}} than the number of independent
primary first class constraints, thereby distinguishing it from conventional
first order systems. Different models have been considered as illustrative
examples. In particular we show a direct connection between the gauge symmetry
and the W-algebra for the rigid relativistic particle.
