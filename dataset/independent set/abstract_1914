An effective interaction approach is used to describe the interactions
between the spin 0 or spin 1/2 dark matter particle and the degrees of freedom
of the standard model. This approach is applicable to those models in which the
dark matter particles do not experience the standard-model interactions, e.g.,
hidden-sector models. We explore the effects of these effective interaction
operators on (i) dark matter relic density, (ii) spin-independent and
spin-dependent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross sections, (iii) cosmic
antiproton and gamma ray fluxes from the galactic halo due to dark matter
annihilation, and (iv) monojet and monophoton production plus missing energy at
the Tevatron and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We combine the experimental
data of relic density from WMAP7, spin-independent cross section from XENON100,
spin-dependent cross section from XENON10, ZEPLIN-III, and SIMPLE, cosmic
antiproton flux from PAMELA, cosmic gamma-ray flux from ${\it Fermi}$-LAT, and
the monojet and monophoton data from the Tevatron and the LHC, to put the most
comprehensive limits on each effective operator.
