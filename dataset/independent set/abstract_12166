We investigate the a theorem for nonsupersymmetric gauge-Yukawa theories
beyond the leading order in perturbation theory. The exploration is first
performed in a model-independent manner and then applied to a specific relevant
example. Here, a rich fixed point structure appears including the presence of a
merging phenomenon between non-trivial fixed points for which the a theorem has
not been tested so far.
