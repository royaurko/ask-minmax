We compute the dimension-2 gluon pair condensate $g^2<{AA}>$ and the
dimension-4 mixed quark-gluon condensate $<\bar{q}gA\cdot\gamma{q}>$ in Landau
gauge within the framework of global color model. The result for the dynamical
gluon mass is within the range given by other independent determinations. The
obtained mixed Landau gauge condensate $<\bar{q}gA\cdot\gamma{q}>$ is clearly
dependent on the definitions of the condensates. We show that the consistent
result may be obtained when the same definitions are used.
