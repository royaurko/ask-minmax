A slalom is a sequence of finite sets of length omega. Slaloms are ordered by
coordinatewise inclusion with finitely many exceptions. Improving earlier
results of Mildenberger, Shelah and Tsaban, we prove consistency results
concerning existence and non-existence of an increasing sequence of a certain
type of slaloms which covers a bounded set of functions in the Baire space.
