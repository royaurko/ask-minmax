Classical Kolmogorov's and Rosenthal's inequalities for the maximum partial
sums of random variables are basic tools for studying the strong laws of large
numbers. In this paper, motived by the notion of independent and identically
distributed random variables under the sub-linear expectation initiated by Peng
(2006, 2008b), we introduce the concept of negative dependence of random
variables and establish Kolmogorov's and Rosenthal's inequalities for the
maximum partial sums of negatively dependent random variables under the
sub-linear expectations. As an application, we show that Kolmogorov's strong
law of larger numbers holds for independent and identically distributed under a
continuous sub-linear expectation if and only if the corresponding Choquet
integral is finite.
