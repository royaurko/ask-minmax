Recall that Tamarkin's construction arXiv:math/9803025, arXiv:math/0003052
gives us a map from the set of Drinfeld associators to the set of homotopy
classes of L-infinity quasi-isomorphisms for Hochschild cochains of a
polynomial algebra. Due to results of V. Drinfeld (Algebra i Analiz 2, (1990))
and T. Willwacher arXiv:1009.1654 both the source and the target of this map
are equipped with natural actions of the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group
$GRT_1$. In this paper, we use the result from arXiv:1305.4699 to prove that
this map from the set of Drinfeld associators to the set of homotopy classes of
L-infinity quasi-isomorphisms for Hochschild cochains is $GRT_1$-equivariant.
