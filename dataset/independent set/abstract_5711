The four LEP experiments ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL have performed decay-mode
independent searches for scalar bosons, flavour-independent Higgs boson
searches, searches for Higgs bosons in the Standard Model and several
Two-Higgs-Doublet models and searches for doubly charged Higgs bosons at
centre-of-mass energies up to 209 GeV. The results obtained and mostly combined
by the LEP Higgs working group are discussed.
