Leptons, quarks and gauge bosons are assumed to be pointlike particles in the
Standard Model. Stringent bounds on the radii of quarks and leptons and their
weak anomalous magnetic moments can be derived from the high-precision
measurements at LEP and SLC. We find a model-independent bound of $R\lsim
10^{-17}cm$ for quark and lepton radii. HERA will provide complementary
information on the electromagnetic static properties of the quarks and the
parameters of the charged quark currents.
