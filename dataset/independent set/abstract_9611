Let $\mathcal X=\{\mathcal X_t:\, t\geq0,\, \mathcal X_0=0\}$ be a mean zero
$\beta$-stable random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ with inhomogeneous jump rates
$\{\tau_i^{-1}: i\in\mathbb{Z}\}$, with $\beta\in(1,2]$ and $\{\tau_i:
i\in\mathbb{Z}\}$ a family of independent random variables with common marginal
distribution in the basin of attraction of an $\alpha$-stable law,
$\alpha\in(0,1)$. In this paper we derive results about the long time behavior
of this process, in particular its scaling limit, given by a $\beta$-stable
process time-changed by the inverse of another process, involving the local
time of the $\beta$-stable process and an independent $\alpha$-stable
subordinator; we call the resulting process a quasistable process. Another such
result concerns aging. We obtain an (integrated) aging result for $\mathcal X$.
