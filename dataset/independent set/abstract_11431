We measured angular distributions of recoil-polarization response functions
for neutral pion electroproduction for W=1.23 GeV at Q^2=1.0 (GeV/c)^2,
obtaining 14 separated response functions plus 2 Rosenbluth combinations; of
these, 12 have been observed for the first time. Dynamical models do not
describe quantities governed by imaginary parts of interference products well,
indicating the need for adjusting magnitudes and phases for nonresonant
amplitudes. We performed a nearly model-independent multipole analysis and
obtained values for Re(S1+/M1+)=-(6.84+/-0.15)% and Re(E1+/M1+)=-(2.91+/-0.19)%
that are distinctly different from those from the traditional Legendre analysis
based upon M1+ dominance and sp truncation.
