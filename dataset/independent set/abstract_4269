We propose a new and robust method to test the consistency of the cosmic
evolution given by a cosmological model. It is realized by comparing the
combined quantity r_d^CMB/D_V^SN, which is derived from the comoving sound
horizon r_d from cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements and the
effective distance D_V derived from low-redshift Type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia)
data, with direct and independent r_d/D_V obtained by baryon acoustic
oscillation (BAO) measurements at median redshifts. We apply this test method
for the Lambda-CDM and wCDM models, and investigate the consistency of the
derived value of r_d/D_V from Planck 2015 and the SN Ia data sets of Union2.1
and JLA (z<1.5), and the r_d/D_V directly given by BAO data from
six-degree-field galaxy survey (6dFGS), Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7
Main Galaxy Survey (SDSS-DR7 MGS), DR11 of SDSS-III, WiggleZ and Ly-alpha
forecast surveys from Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Data (BOSS) DR-11 over
0.1<z<2.36. We find that r_d^CMB/D_V^SN for both non-flat Lambda-CDM and flat
wCDM models with Union2.1 and JLA data are well consistent with the BAO and CMB
measurements within 1-sigma CL. Future surveys will further tight up the
constraints significantly, and provide stronger test on the consistency.
