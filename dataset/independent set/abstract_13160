Using 220 Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) redshifts and luminosities derived from the
luminosity-variability relationship of Fenimore & Ramirez-Ruiz (2000), we show
that there exists a significant correlation between the GRB luminosity and
redshift. In particular, we find that the evolution of the average luminosity
can be parameterized as L ~ (1+z)^(1.4 +- 0.5), where z is the burst redshift.
We discuss the possible reasons behind this evolution and compare it to other
known sources that exhibit similar behavior. In addition, we use non-parametric
statistical techniques to independently estimate the distributions of the
luminosity and redshift of bursts, accounting for the evolution (in contrast to
previous studies which have assumed that the luminosity function is independent
of redshift). We present these distributions and discuss their implications.
Most significantly, we find a co-moving rate density of GRBs that continues to
increase to (1+z) ~ 10. From this estimate of the GRB rate density, we then use
the population synthesis codes of Fryer et al. (1999) to estimate the star
formation rate at high redshifts, based on different progenitor models of GRBs.
We find that no matter what the progenitor or population synthesis model, the
star formation rate increases or remains constant to very high redshifts (z ~
10).
