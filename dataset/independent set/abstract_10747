Lorentz violation in a brane-world scenario is presented and used to obtain a
relationship between the speed of gravitational waves in the bulk and that on
the brane. Lorentz violating effects would manifest themselves in gravitational
waves travelling with a greater speed in the bulk than on the brane and this
effect is independent of the signature of the extra dimension.
