Results on two-particle angular correlations for charged particles emitted in
proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies of 0.9, 2.36, and 7 TeV are
presented, using data collected with the CMS detector over a broad range of
pseudorapidity (eta) and azimuthal angle (phi). Short-range correlations in
Delta(eta), which are studied in minimum bias events, are characterized using a
simple "independent cluster" parametrization in order to quantify their
strength (cluster size) and their extent in eta (cluster decay width).
Long-range azimuthal correlations are studied differentially as a function of
charged particle multiplicity and particle transverse momentum using a 980
inverse nb data set at 7 TeV. In high multiplicity events, a pronounced
structure emerges in the two-dimensional correlation function for particle
pairs with intermediate transverse momentum of 1-3 GeV/c, 2.0< |Delta(eta)|
<4.8 and Delta(phi) near 0. This is the first observation of such a long-range,
near-side feature in two-particle correlation functions in pp or p p-bar
collisions.
