The Brewster effect is extended to single-layer metafilms. In contrast to
bulk media, the Brewster effect in metafilms can be realized by tailoring the
radiation pattern of a distribution of meta-atoms rather than the effective
medium parameters. A metafilm composed of bi-anisotropic split-ring resonators
is designed based on the theory, and its characteristics are numerically
analyzed. The simulation demonstrates that there exists a condition for which
the polarization of the reflected wave becomes independent of the incident
polarization at a particular angle of incidence.
