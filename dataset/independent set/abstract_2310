We show that generalised extreme value statistics -the statistics of the k-th
largest value among a large set of random variables- can be mapped onto a
problem of random sums. This allows us to identify classes of non-identical and
(generally) correlated random variables with a sum distributed according to one
of the three (k-dependent) asymptotic distributions of extreme value
statistics, namely the Gumbel, Frechet and Weibull distributions. These
classes, as well as the limit distributions, are naturally extended to real
values of k, thus providing a clear interpretation to the onset of Gumbel
distributions with non-integer index k in the statistics of global observables.
This is one of the very few known generalisations of the central limit theorem
to non-independent random variables. Finally, in the context of a simple
physical model, we relate the index k to the ratio of the correlation length to
the system size, which remains finite in strongly correlated systems.
