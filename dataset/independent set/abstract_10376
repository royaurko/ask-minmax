We study the critical behavior of period doubling in two coupled
one-dimensional maps with a single maximum of order $z$. In particurlar, the
effect of the maximum-order $z$ on the critical behavior associated with
coupling is investigated by a renormalization method. There exist three fixed
maps of the period-doubling renormalization operator. For a fixed map
associated with the critical behavior at the zero-coupling critical point,
relevant eigenvalues associated with coupling perturbations vary depending on
the order $z$, whereas they are independent of $z$ for the other two fixed
maps. The renormalization results for the zero-coupling case are also confirmed
by a direct numerical method.
