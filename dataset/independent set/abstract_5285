Let $G=(V(G),E(G))$ be a simple graph. A non-empty set $S\subseteq V (G)$ is
a weakly connected dominating set in $G$ if the subgraph obtained from $G$ by
removing all edges each joining any two vertices in $V (G)\setminus S$ is
connected. In this paper we consider some certain graphs and study the number
of their weakly connected dominating sets.
