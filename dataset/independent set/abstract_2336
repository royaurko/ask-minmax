Quantum states of the diagonal Bianchi type IX model with negative
cosmological constant $\Lambda$ are obtained by transforming the Chern-Simons
solution in Ashtekar's variables to the metric representation. We apply our
method developed earlier for $\Lambda>0$ and obtain five linearly independent
solutions by using the complete set of topologically inequivalent integration
contours in the required generalized Fourier-transformation. A caustic in
minisuperspace separates two Euclidean regimes at small and large values of the
scale parameter from a single classically interpretable Lorentzian regime in
between, corresponding to the fact that classically these model-Universes
recollapse. Just one particular solution out of the five we find gives a
normalizable probability distribution on both branches of the caustic. However,
in contrast to the case of positive cosmological constant, this particular
solution neither satisfies the semi-classical no-boundary condition, nor does
the special initial condition it picks out for $\hbar \to 0$ evolve into a
classically interpretable Universe.
