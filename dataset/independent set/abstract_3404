While the Sauter-Schwinger effect describes non-perturbative
electron-positron pair creation from vacuum by a strong and slowly varying
electric field $E_{\mathrm{strong}}$ via tunnelling, the dynamically assisted
Sauter-Schwinger effect corresponds to a strong (exponential) enhancement of
the pair creation probability by an additional weak and fast electric or
electromagnetic pulse $E_{\mathrm{weak}}$. Using the WKB and worldline
instanton method, we find that this enhancement mechanism strongly depends on
the shape of the fast pulse. For the Sauter profile $1/\cosh^2(\omega t)$
considered previously, the threshold frequency $\omega_{\mathrm{crit}}$ (where
the enhancement mechanism sets in) is basically independent of the magnitude
$E_{\mathrm{weak}}$ of the weak pulse -- whereas for a Gaussian pulse
$\exp(-\omega^2t^2)$, an oscillating profile $\cos(\omega t)$ or a standing
wave $\cos(\omega t)\cos(kx)$, the value of $\omega_{\mathrm{crit}}$ does
depend (logarithmically) on $E_{\mathrm{weak}}/E_{\mathrm{strong}}$.
