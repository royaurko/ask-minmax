The relation between two--dimensional integrable systems and
four--dimen\-sional self--dual Yang--Mills equations is considered. Within the
twistor description and the zero--curvature representation a method is given to
associate self--dual Yang-Mills connections with integrable systems of the
  Korteweg--de Vries and non--linear Schr\"odinger type or principal chiral
models.
  Examples of self--dual connections are constructed that as points in the
moduli do not have two independent conformal symmetries.
