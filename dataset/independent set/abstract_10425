The doping-induced metal-insulator transition in two-chain systems of
correlated fermions is studied using a solvable limit of the t-J model and the
fact that various strong- and weak-coupling limits of the two-chain model are
in the same phase, i.e. have the same low-energy properties. It is shown that
the Luttinger-liquid parameter K_\rho takes the universal value unity as the
insulating state (half-filling) is approached, implying dominant d-type
superconducting fluctuations, independently of the interaction strength. The
crossover to insulating behavior of correlations as the transition is
approached is discussed.
