We study the motion of independent particles in a dynamical random
environment on the integer lattice. The environment has a product distribution.
For the multidimensional case, we characterize the class of spatially ergodic
invariant measures. These invariant distributions are mixtures of inhomogeneous
Poisson product measures that depend on the past of the environment, and we
also investigate the correlations in this measure. For dimensions one and two,
we also prove convergence to equilibrium from spatially ergodic initial
distributions. In the one-dimensional situation we study fluctuations of net
current seen by an observer traveling at a deterministic speed. When this
current is centered by its quenched mean its limit distributions are the same
as for classical independent particles.
