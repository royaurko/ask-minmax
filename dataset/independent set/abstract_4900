When initially-independent subsystems are made to contact, {\it coherence}
can develop due to interaction between them. We exemplify and demonstrate this
paradigm through several scenarios of two initially-independent Bose-Einstein
condensates which are allowed to collide. The build-up of coherence depends
strongly on time, interaction strength and other parameters of each condensate.
Implications are discussed.
