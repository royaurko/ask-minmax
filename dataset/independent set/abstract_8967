This paper presents a five-valued representation of bifuzzy sets. This
representation is related to a five-valued logic that uses the following
values: true, false, inconsistent, incomplete and ambiguous. In the framework
of five-valued representation, formulae for similarity, entropy and syntropy of
bifuzzy sets are constructed.
