We prove qualitatively sharp heat kernel bounds in the setting of
Fourier-Bessel expansions when the associated type parameter $\nu$ is
half-integer. Moreover, still for half-integer $\nu$, we also obtain sharp
estimates of all kernels subordinated to the heat kernel. Analogous estimates
for general $\nu > -1$ are conjectured. Some consequences concerning the
related heat semigroup maximal operator are discussed.
