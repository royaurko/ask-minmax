We establish a framework to construct a global solution in the space of
finite energy to a general form of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in
$\mathbb{R}^2$. Our characterization yields a partially regular solution,
smooth away from a 2-dimensional locally finite Hausdorff measure set. This
construction relies on approximation by discretization, using the special
geometry to express an equivalent system whose highest order terms are linear
and the translation of the machinery of linear estimates on the fundamental
solution from the continuous setting into the discrete setting. This method is
quite general and accommodates more general geometries involving targets that
are compact smooth hypersurfaces.
