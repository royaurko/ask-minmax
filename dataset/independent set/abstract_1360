We study the loxodromic elements for the action of Out(F_n) on the free
splitting complex of the rank n free group F_n. We prove that each outer
automorphism is either loxodromic, or has bounded orbits without any periodic
point, or has a periodic point; and we prove that all three possibilities can
occur. We also prove that two loxodromic elements are either co-axial or
independent, meaning that their attracting/repelling fixed point pairs on the
Gromov boundary of the free splitting complex are either equal or disjoint as
sets. Each of the alternatives in these results is also characterized in terms
of the attracting/repelling lamination pairs of an outer automorphism. As an
application, each attracting lamination determines its corresponding repelling
lamination independent of the outer automorphism. As part of this study we
describe the structure of the subgroup of Out(F_n) that stabilizes the fixed
point pair of a given loxodromic outer automorphism, and we give examples which
show that this subgroup need not be virtually cyclic. As an application, the
action of Out(F_n) on the free splitting complex is not acylindrical, and its
loxodromic elements do not all satisfy the WPD property of Bestvina and
Fujiwara.
