The aim of the paper is to provide a constructive method for recovering a
unitary matrix from experimental data. Since there is a natural immersion of
unitary matrices within the set of double stochastic ones, the problem to solve
is to find necessary and sufficient criteria that separate the two sets. A
complete solution is provided for the 3-dimensional case, accompanied by a
$\chi^2$ test necessary for the reconstruction of a unitary matrix from error
affected data.
