We give two examples of periodic Gaussian processes, having entropy numbers
of exactly same order but radically different small deviations. Our
construction is based on classical Knopp's result yielding of existence of
continuous nowhere differentiable functions, and more precisely on Loud's
functions. We also obtain a general lower bound for small deviations using the
majorizing measure method. We show on examples that our bound is sharp. We also
apply it to Gaussian independent sequences and to the generic class of
ultrametric Gaussian processes.
