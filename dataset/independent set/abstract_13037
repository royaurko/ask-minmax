A probabilistic approach to the study of the number of zeros of complex
harmonic polynomials was initiated by W. Li and A. Wei (2009), who derived a
Kac-Rice type formula for the expected number of zeros of random harmonic
polynomials with independent Gaussian coefficients. They also provided
asymptotics for a complex version of the Kostlan ensemble. Here we determine
asymptotics for the alternative truncated model that was recently proposed by
J. Hauenstein, D. Mehta, and the contributors. Our results confirm (and sharpen)
their (3/2)-powerlaw conjecture that had been formulated on the basis of
computer experiments.
