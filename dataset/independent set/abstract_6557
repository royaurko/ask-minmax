We study the occupation measure of various sets for a symmetric transient
random walk in $Z^d$ with finite variances. Let $\mu^X_n(A)$ denote the
occupation time of the set $A$ up to time $n$. It is shown that $\sup_{x\in
Z^d}\mu_n^X(x+A)/\log n$ tends to a finite limit as $n\to\infty$. The limit is
expressed in terms of the largest eigenvalue of a matrix involving the Green's
function of $X$ restricted to the set $A$. Some examples are discussed and the
connection to similar results for Brownian motion is given.
