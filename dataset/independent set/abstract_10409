We consider a Lattice Gas model in which the sites interact via
infinite-ranged random couplings independently distributed with a Gaussian
probability density. This is the Lattice Gas analogue of the well known
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Ising Spin Glass. We present results of replica
approach in the Replica Symmetric approximation. Even with zero-mean of the
couplings a line of first order liquid-gas transitions occurs. Replica Symmetry
Breaking should give up to a glassy transition inside the liquid phase.
