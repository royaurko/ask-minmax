We study the different rates of escape of points under iteration by
holomorphic self-maps of $\mathbb C^*=\mathbb C\setminus\{ 0\}$ for which both
0 and $\infty$ are essential singularities. Using annular covering lemmas we
construct different types of orbits, including fast escaping and arbitrarily
slowly escaping orbits to either 0, $\infty$ or both. We also prove several
properties about the set of fast escaping points for this class of functions.
In particular, we show that there is an uncountable collection of disjoint sets
of fast escaping points each of which has the Julia set as its boundary.
