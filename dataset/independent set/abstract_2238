The EDELWEISS collaboration is searching for WIMP dark matter using natural
Ge cryogenic detectors. The whole data set of the first phase of the experiment
contains a fiducial exposure of 4.8 kg.day on Ge-73, the naturally present
(7.8%), high-spin Ge isotope. The sensitivity of the experiment to the
spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon interactions is evaluated using the
model-independent framework proposed by Tovey et al.
