Two thought experiments are described in which ruler measurements of spatial
intervals are performed in different reference frames. They demonstrate that
such intervals are frame-independent as well as independent of the nature of
the space-time transformation equations. As explained in detail elsewhere, the
`length contraction' effect of conventional special relativity theory is
therefore spurious and unphysical.
