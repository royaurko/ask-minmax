For any polynomial map with a single critical point, we prove that its lower
Lyapunov exponent at the critical value is negative if and only if the map has
an attracting cycle. Similar statement holds for the exponential maps and some
other complex dynamical systems. We prove further that for the unicritical
polynomials with positive area Julia sets almost every point of the Julia set
has zero Lyapunov exponent. Part of this statement generalizes as follows:
every point with positive upper Lyapunov exponent in the Julia set of an
arbitrary polynomial is not a Lebegue density point.
