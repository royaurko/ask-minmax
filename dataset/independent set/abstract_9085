We consider the collisions of large nuclei using the theory of McLerran and
Venugopalan. The two nuclei are ultra-relativistic and sources of non-abelian
Weizs\"acker-Williams fields. These sources are in the end averaged over all
color orientations locally with a Gaussian weight. We show that there is a
solution of the equations of motion for the two nucleus scattering problem
where the fields are time and rapidity independent before the collision. After
the collision the solution depends on proper time, but is independent of
rapidity. We show how to extract the produced gluons from the classical
evolution of the fields.
