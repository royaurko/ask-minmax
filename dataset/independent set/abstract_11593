We present a tableau-based algorithm for deciding satisfiability for
propositional dynamic logic (PDL) which builds a finite rooted tree with
ancestor loops and passes extra information from children to parents to
separate good loops from bad loops during backtracking. It is easy to
implement, with potential for parallelisation, because it constructs a
pseudo-model ``on the fly'' by exploring each tableau branch independently. But
its worst-case behaviour is 2EXPTIME rather than EXPTIME. A prototype
implementation in the TWB (http://twb.rsise.anu.edu.au) is available.
