We obtain some results about continuum-wise expansive homeomorphisms, such as
non-existence of stable points and presence of non-trivial connected components
within the local stable and unstable sets. These facts have been of importance
in theorems of classification of expansive homeomorphisms. They are achieved
now, however, by new and self contained techniques that hold on more general
settings.
