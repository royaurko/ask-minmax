We show that gamma distributions provide models for departures from
randomness since every neighbourhood of an exponential distribution contains a
neighbourhood of gamma distributions, using an information theoretic metric
topology. We derive also the information geometry of the 3-manifold of McKay
bivariate gamma distributions, which can provide a metrization of departures
from randomness and departures from independence for bivariate processes. The
curvature objects are derived, including those on three submanifolds. As in the
case of bivariate normal manifolds, we have negative scalar curvature but here
it is not constant and we show how it depends on correlation. These results
have applications, for example, in the characterization of stochastic
materials.
