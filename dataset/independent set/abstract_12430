Lepton polarization asymmetries for the flavor-changing neutral current
(FCNC) dileptonic decays of {\Lambda}b baryons are calculated using
single-component analytic (SCA) and multicomponent numerical (MCN) form
factors. We show that these polarization asymmetries are insensitive to the
transition form factors and, thus, the effects of QCD in the nonperturbative
regime. Therefore, these observables can provide somewhat model independent
ways of extracting the Wilson coefficients.
