In a network, a node is said to incur a delay if its encoding of each
transmitted symbol involves only its received symbols obtained before the time
slot in which the transmitted symbol is sent (hence the transmitted symbol sent
in a time slot cannot depend on the received symbol obtained in the same time
slot). A node is said to incur no delay if its received symbol obtained in a
time slot is available for encoding its transmitted symbol sent in the same
time slot. Under the classical model, every node in the network incurs a delay.
In this paper, we investigate the multimessage multicast network (MMN) under a
generalized-delay model which allows some nodes to incur no delay. We obtain
the capacity regions for three classes of MMNs with zero-delay nodes, namely
the deterministic network dominated by product distribution, the MMN consisting
of independent DMCs and the wireless erasure network. In addition, we show that
for any MMN belonging to one of the above three classes, the set of achievable
rate tuples under the generalized-delay model and under the classical model are
the same, which implies that the set of achievable rate tuples for the MMN does
not depend on the delay amounts incurred by the nodes in the network.
