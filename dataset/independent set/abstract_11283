By a hole we mean a disc that contains no flat chaotic analytic zero points
(i.e. zeroes of a random entire function whose Taylor coefficients are
independent complex-valued Gaussian variables, and the variance of the k-th
coefficient is 1/k!). A given disc of radius r has a probability of being a
hole, - the hole probability. We show that for large r the hole probability
decays as exp(-cr^4).
