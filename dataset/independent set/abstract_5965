A class of graphs is nowhere dense if for every integer r there is a finite
upper bound on the size of cliques that occur as (topological) r-minors. We
observe that this tameness notion from algorithmic graph theory is essentially
the earlier stability theoretic notion of superflatness. For subgraph-closed
classes of graphs we prove equivalence to stability and to not having the
independence property.
