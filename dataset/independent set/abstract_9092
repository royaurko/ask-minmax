Contrary to what has been often claimed in the literature, we clarify that
the hard photon-gluon cross section $\gg_{\rm hard}(x)$ in polarized deep
inelastic scattering calculated in the gauge-invariant factorization scheme
does {\it not} involve any soft contributions and hence it is genuinely {\it
hard}. We show that the polarized proton structure function $g_1^p(x)$ up to
the next-to-leading order of $\alpha_s$ is independent of the factorization
convention, e.g., the gauge-invariant or chiral-invariant scheme, chosen in
defining $\gg_{\rm hard}(x)$ and the quark spin density. Thereby, it is not
pertinent to keep disputing which factorization prescription is correct or
superior. The hard-gluonic contribution to $\Gamma_1^p$, the first moment of
$g_1^p(x)$, is purely factorization dependent. Nevertheless, we stress that
even though hard gluons do not contribute to $\Gamma_1^p$ in the
gauge-invariant scheme, the gluon spin component in a proton, which is
factorization independent, should be large enough to perturbatively generate a
negative sea polarization via the axial anomaly. We briefly comment on how to
study the $Q^2$ evolution of parton spin distributions to the next-to-leading
order of QCD in the chiral-invariant factorization scheme.
