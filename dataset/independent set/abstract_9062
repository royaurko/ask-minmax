In this paper we provide a classification of plane symmetric kinematic
self-similar perfect fluid and dust solutions. In the perfect fluid and dust
cases, kinematic self-similar vectors for the tilted, orthogonal and parallel
cases have been explored in the first, second, zeroth and infinite kinds with
different equations of state. We obtain total of eleven plane symmetric
kinematic self-similar solutions out of which six are independent. The perfect
fluid case gives two solutions for infinite tilted and infinite orthogonal
kinds. In the dust case, we have four independent solutions in the first
orthogonal, infinite tilted, infinite orthogonal and infinite parallel kinds.
The remaining cases provide contradiction. It is interesting to mention that
some of these solutions turn out to be vacuum.
