We discuss the regularization and renormalization of QED with Lorentz and CPT
violation, and argue that the coefficient of the Chern-Simons term is an
independent parameter not determined by gauge invariance. We also study these
issues in a model with spontaneous breaking of Lorentz and CPT symmetries and
find an explicit relation with the ABJ anomaly. This explains the observed
convergence of the induced Chern-Simons term.
