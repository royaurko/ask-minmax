In this work a generalized Pauli's theorem (proved by D. S. Shirokov for two
sets $e^a, h^a$, $a=1,...,n$ of Clifford algebra elements $Cl(p,q)$, $p+q=n$)
is extended to the case, when one or both sets of elements depends smoothly on
points $x$ of the Euclidian space. We prove that in this case for any point
$x_0$ of Euclidian space there exists $\epsilon$-neighborhood $O_\epsilon(x_0)$
and there exists smooth function $T : O_\epsilon(x_0)\to Cl(p,q)$ such that two
sets of Clifford algebra elements are connected by a similarity transformation
$h^a(x)=T(x)^{-1}e^a(x)T(x)$, $a=1,...,n$ in $O_\epsilon(x_0)$.
