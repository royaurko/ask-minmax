Earlier described model amplitudes are used in this paper to evaluate both
cross sections and density matrices for two-photon mediated resonance
production in e^+e^- collisions. All 25 q\bar{q} low-lying ^1S_0, ^3P_J and
^1D_2 resonances can thus be treated. Two independent methods are described to
obtain the resonance production density matrices and cross sections. These
density matrices combined with a resonance decay density matrix give the
detailed angular distributions of the resonance decay products. For two
particular decays, \chi_{c2},\chi_{c1}\to\gamma J/\psi the details are given.
Several numerical results are presented as well.
