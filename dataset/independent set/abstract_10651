An algorithm to calculate the density of states, based on the well-known
Wang-Landau method, is introduced. Independent random walks are performed in
different restricted ranges of energy, and the resultant density of states is
modified by a function of time, F(t)=1/t, for large time. As a consequence, the
calculated density of state, gm(E,t), approaches asymptotically the exact value
gex(E) as 1/sqrt(t), avoiding the saturation of the error. It is also shown
that the growth of the interface of the energy histogram belongs to the random
deposition universality class.
