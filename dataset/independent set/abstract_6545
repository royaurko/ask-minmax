We define the similarity boundary of a self-similar set and use it to analyze
the properties of self-similar sets in the general setting of any complete
metric space. The similarity boundary is an attempt at extending the concept of
the topological boundary in a way that is consistent with our intuitive
understanding of the term boundary. We also show how with the analysis of the
similarity boundary, we can restrict ourselves to the space $K$ and disregard
the ambient space.
