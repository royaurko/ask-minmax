Let $G$ be a finite group. Let ${\rm{cd}}(G)$ be the set of all complex
irreducible character degrees of $G.$ In this paper, we will show that if
${\rm{cd}}(G)={\rm{cd}}(H),$ where $H$ is the simple Ree group
${}^2F_4(q^2),q^2\geq 8,$ then $G\cong H\times A,$ where $A$ is an abelian
group. This verifies Huppert's Conjecture for the simple Ree groups
${}^2F_4(q^2)$ when $q^2\geq 8.$
