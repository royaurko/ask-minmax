Time shifts beyond the correlation time of the logic and reference signals
create new elements that are orthogonal to the original components. This fact
can be utilized to increase the number of dimensions of the logic space while
keeping the number of reference noises fixed. Using just a single noise and
time shifts can realize exponentially large hyperspaces with large numbers of
dimensions. Other, independent applications of time shifts include holographic
noise-based logic systems and changing commutative operations into
non-commuting ones. For the sake of simplicity, these ideas are illustrated by
deterministic time shifts, even though random timing and random time shifts
would yield the most robust systems.
