We consider the equations of motion of the full heterotic string field theory
including both the Neveu-Schwarz and the Ramond sectors. It is shown that they
can be formulated in the form of an infinite number of first-order equations
for an infinite number of independent string fields. We prove that the
conventional equations of motion are obtaned by solving the extra equations for
the extra string fields with a certain assumptions at the linearized level. The
conventional gauge transformations are also obtained from those in this
first-order formulation, which is clarified by deriving some lower oder
transformations explicitly.
