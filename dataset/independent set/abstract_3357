Since the pioneering work of Arthur Ashkin, optical tweezers have become an
indispensable tool for contactless manipulation of micro- and nanoparticles.
Nowadays optical tweezers are employed in a myriad of applications
demonstrating the importance of these tools. While the basic principle of
optical tweezers is the use of a strongly focused laser beam to trap and
manipulate particles, ever more complex experimental set-ups are required in
order to perform novel and challenging experiments. With this article, we
provide a detailed step- by-step guide for the construction of advanced optical
manipulation systems. First, we explain how to build a single-beam optical
tweezers on a home-made microscope and how to calibrate it. Improving on this
design, we realize a holographic optical tweezers, which can manipulate
independently multiple particles and generate more sophisticated wavefronts
such as Laguerre-Gaussian beams. Finally, we explain how to implement a speckle
optical tweezers, which permit one to employ random speckle light fields for
deterministic optical manipulation.
