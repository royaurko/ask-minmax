We combine ideas of Scott and Swarup on good position for almost invariant
subsets of a group with ideas of Sageev on constructing cubings from such sets.
We construct cubings which are more canonical than in Sageev's original
construction. We also show that almost invariant sets can be chosen to be in
very good position.
