We present two independent methods for studying the global stellar parameter
space (mass M, age, initial chemical composition X_0, Z_0) of HD 49933 with
seismic data. Using a local minimization and an MCMC algorithm, we obtain
consistent results for the determination of the stellar properties: M = 1.1 -
1.2 M_solar, Age ~ 3.0 Gyr, Z_0 ~ 0.008. A description of the error ellipses
can be defined using Singular Value Decomposition techniques, and this is
validated by comparing the errors with those from the MCMC method.
