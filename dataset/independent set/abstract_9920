In this paper, we give a theoretical analysis for the algorithms to compute
functional decomposition for multivariate polynomials based on differentiation
and homogenization which are proposed by Ye, Dai, Lam (1999) and Faug$\mu$ere,
Perret (2006, 2008, 2009). We show that a degree proper functional
decomposition for a set of randomly decomposable quartic homogenous polynomials
can be computed using the algorithm with high probability. This solves a
conjecture proposed by Ye, Dai, and Lam (1999). We also propose a conjecture
such that the decomposition for a set of polynomials can be computed from that
of its homogenization with high probability. Finally, we prove that the right
decomposition factors for a set of polynomials can be computed from its right
decomposition factor space. Combining these results together, we prove that the
algorithm can compute a degree proper decomposition for a set of randomly
decomposable quartic polynomials with probability one when the base field is of
characteristic zero, and with probability close to one when the base field is a
finite field with sufficiently large number under the assumption that the
conjeture is correct.
