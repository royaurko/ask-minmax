We show that the flat chaotic analytic zero points (i.e. zeroes of a random
entire function whose Taylor coefficients are independent complex-valued
Gaussian random variables, and the variance of the k-th coefficient is 1/k!)
can be regarded as a random perturbation of a lattice in the plane. The
distribution of the distances between the zeroes and the lattice points is
shift-invariant and has a Gaussian-type decay of the tails.
