A general introduction to Lorentz and CPT violation is presented. The
observable effects of the breakdown of such fundamental symmetries in neutrinos
are outlined and different experimental searches of some of the key signals of
Lorentz violation are discussed. A novel powerful method to study
model-independent neutrino oscillations is reviewed and then used to illustrate
a new global model of neutrino oscillations based on Lorentz violation
consistent with atmospheric, accelerator, reactor, and solar neutrino data.
