A generalization of Gauss's principle is used to derive the error laws
corresponding to Types II and VII distributions in Pearson's classification
scheme. Student's $r$-pdf (Type II) governs the distribution of the internal
energy of a uniform, linear chain, Ising model, while analytic continuation of
the uniform exchange energy converts it into a Student $t$-density (Type VII)
for the position of a random walk in a single spatial dimension. Higher
dimensional spaces, corresponding to larger degrees of freedom and
generalizations to multidimensional Student $r$- and $t$-densities, are
obtained by considering independent and identically distributed random
variables, having rotationally invariant densities, whose entropies are
additive and generating functions are multiplicative.
