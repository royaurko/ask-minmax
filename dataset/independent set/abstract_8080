We show that geometric disorder leads to purely singular continuous spectrum
generically.
  The main input is a result of Simon known as the ``Wonderland theorem''.
Here, we provide an alternative approach and actually a slight strengthening by
showing that various sets of measures defined by regularity properties are
generic in the set of all measures on a locally compact metric space.
  As a byproduct we obtain that a generic measure on euclidean space is
singular continuous.
