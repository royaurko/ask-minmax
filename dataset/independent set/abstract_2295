Rate-independence for stresses within a granular material is a basic tenet of
many models for slow dense granular flows. By contrast, logarithmic rate
dependence of stresses is found in solid-on-solid friction, in geological
settings, and elsewhere. In this work, we show that logarithmic rate-dependence
occurs in granular materials for plastic (irreversible) deformations that occur
during shearing but not for elastic (reversible) deformations, such as those
that occur under moderate repetitive compression. Increasing the shearing rate,
\Omega, leads to an increase in the stress and the stress fluctuations that at
least qualitatively resemble what occurs due to an increase in the density.
Increases in \Omega also lead to qualitative changes in the distributions of
stress build-up and relaxation events. If shearing is stopped at t=0, stress
relaxations occur with \sigma(t)/ \sigma(t=0) \simeq A \log(t/t_0). This
collective relaxation of the stress network over logarithmically long times
provides a mechanism for rate-dependent strengthening.
