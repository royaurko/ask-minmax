We determine the constructive dimension of points in random translates of the
Cantor set. The Cantor set "cancels randomness" in the sense that some of its
members, when added to Martin-Lof random reals, identify a point with lower
constructive dimension than the random itself. In particular, we find the
Hausdorff dimension of the set of points in a Cantor set translate with a given
constructive dimension.
