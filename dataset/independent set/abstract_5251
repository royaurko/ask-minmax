Certain subsets of limit sets of geometrically finite Fuchsian groups with
parabolic elements are considered. It is known that Jarn\'{\i}k limit sets
determine a "weak multifractal spectrum" of the Patterson measure in this
situation. This paper will describe a natural generalisation of these sets,
called strict Jarn\'{\i}k limit sets, and show how these give rise to another
weak multifractal spectrum. Number-theoretical interpretations of these results
in terms of continued fractions will also be given.
