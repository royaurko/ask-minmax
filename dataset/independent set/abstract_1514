By combining OSSE, SMM and TGRS observations of the galactic center region,
Purcell et al. (1997) and Cheng et al. (1997) produced the first maps of
galactic positron annihilation. That data-set has been augmented with
additional data, both recent and archival, and re-analyzed to improve the
spectral fitting. The improved spectral fitting has enabled the first maps of
positronium continuum emission and the most extensive maps of 511 keV line
emission. Bulge and disk combinations have been compared with the 511 keV line
data, demonstrating that extended bulges are favored over a GC point source for
every disk model tested. This result is independent of whether OSSE-only,
OSSE/SMM, or OSSE/SMM/TGRS data-sets are used. The estimated bulge to disk
ratio (and to a lesser extent the total flux) is shown to be dependent upon the
assumption of bulge shape. A positive latitude enhancement is shown to have an
effect upon the B/D ratio, but this effect is secondary to the choice of bulge
shape.
