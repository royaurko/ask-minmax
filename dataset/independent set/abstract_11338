We characterize asymptotic collective behaviour of rectangular random
matrices, the sizes of which tend to infinity at different rates: when embedded
in a space of larger square matrices, independent rectangular random matrices
are asymtotically free with amalgamation over a subalgebra. Therefore we can
define a "rectangular free convolution", linearized by cumulants and by an
analytic integral transform, called the "rectangular R-transform".
