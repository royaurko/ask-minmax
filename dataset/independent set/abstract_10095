A fundamental notion of decision-theoretic rough sets is the concept of loss
functions, which provides a powerful tool of calculating a pair of thresholds
for making a decision with a minimum cost. In this paper, time-dependent loss
functions which are variations of the time are of interest because such
functions are frequently encountered in practical situations, we present the
relationship between the pair of thresholds and loss functions satisfying
time-dependent uniform distributions and normal processes in light of bayesian
decision procedure. Subsequently, with the aid of bayesian decision procedure,
we provide the relationship between the pair of thresholds and loss functions
which are time-dependent interval sets and fuzzy numbers. Finally, we employ
several examples to illustrate that how to calculate the thresholds for making
a decision by using time-dependent loss functions-based decision-theoretic
rough sets.
