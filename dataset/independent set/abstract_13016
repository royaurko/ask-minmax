We revisit electromagnetic field propagation through tight-binding arrays of
coupled photonic waveguides, with properties independent of the propagation
distance, and recast it as a symmetry problem. We focus our analysis on
photonic lattices with underlying symmetries given by three well-known groups,
$SU(2)$, $SU(1,1)$ and Heisenberg-Weyl, to show that disperssion relations,
normal states and impulse functions can be constructed following a
Gilmore-Perelomov coherent state approach. Furthermore, this symmetry based
approach can be followed for each an every lattice with an underlying symmetry
given by a dynamical group.
