Parameter testing algorithms are using constant number of queries to estimate
the value of a certain parameter of a very large finite graph. It is well-known
that graph parameters such as the independence ratio or the edit-distance from
3-colorability are not testable in bounded degree graphs. We prove, however,
that these and several other interesting graph parameters are testable in
bounded degree graphs of subexponential growth.
