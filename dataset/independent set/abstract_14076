In this paper, we test the consistency of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) Data-set
and Supernovae Union2 (SNU2) via the so-called {\it multi-dimensional
consistency test} under the assumption that $\Lambda$CDM model is a potentially
correct cosmological model. We find that the probes are inconsistent with
$1.456\sigma$ and $85.47%$ in terms of probability. With this observation, it
is concluded that GRBs can be combined with SNU2 to constrain cosmological
models.
