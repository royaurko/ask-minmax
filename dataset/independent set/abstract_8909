We study the set covering polyhedron related to circulant matrices. In
particular, our goal is to characterize the first Chv\'atal closure of the
usual fractional relaxation. We present a family of valid inequalities that
generalizes the family of minor inequalities previously reported in the
literature and includes new facet-defining inequalities. Furthermore, we
propose a polynomial time separation algorithm for a particular subfamily of
these inequalities.
