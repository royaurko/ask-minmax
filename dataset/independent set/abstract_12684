Using the BaBar measurements of the Dalitz plots for the decays $B^0 \to
K^+\pi^0\pi^-$, $B^0 \to K^0\pi^+\pi^-$, $B^+ \to K^+\pi^+\pi^-$, $B^0 \to K^+
K^0 K^-$, and $B^0 \to K^0 K^0 \bar K^0$, we demonstrate that it is possible to
cleanly extract the weak phase $\gamma$. An advantage of this Dalitz-plot
method is that one can obtain many independent measurements of $\gamma$,
thereby reducing its statistical error. An accurate determination of the
errors, however, requires detailed knowledge of the data. Hopefully, an
experimental group will repeat the analysis, and obtain precise values of the
errors.
