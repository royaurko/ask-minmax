We analyze the resilience under photon loss of the bi-partite entanglement
present in multi-photon states produced by parametric down-conversion. The
quantification of the entanglement is made possible by a symmetry of the states
that persists even under polarization-independent losses. We examine the
approach of the states to the set of states with a positive partial transpose
as losses increase, and calculate the relative entropy of entanglement. We find
that some bi-partite distillable entanglement persists for arbitrarily high
losses.
