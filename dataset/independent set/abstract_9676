The purpose of this study was to investigate the magnetotransport properties
of the Ge(0.743)Pb(0.183)Mn(0.074)Te mixed crystal. The results of
magnetization measurements indicated that the compound is a spin-glass-like
diluted magnetic semiconductor with critical temperature TSG = 97.5 K.
Nanoclusters in the sample are observed. Both, matrix and clusters are
magnetically active. Resistivity as a function of temperature has a minimum at
30 K. Below the minimum a variable-range hopping is observed, while above the
minimum a metallic-like behavior occurs. The crystal has high hole
concentration, p = 6.6E20 cm-3, temperature-independent. Magnetoresistance
amplitude changes from -0.78 to 1.18% with increase of temperature. In the
magnetotransport measurements we observed the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) with
hysteresis loops. Calculated AHE coefficient, RS = 2.0E6 m3/C, is temperature
independent. The analysis indicates the extrinsic skew scattering mechanism to
be the main physical mechanism responsible for AHE in
Ge(0.743)Pb(0.183)Mn(0.074)Te alloy.
