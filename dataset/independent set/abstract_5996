We investigate the order of the $r$-th, $1\le r < +\infty$, central moment of
the length of the longest common subsequence of two independent random words of
size $n$ whose letters are identically distributed and independently drawn from
a finite alphabet. When all but one of the letters are drawn with small
probabilities, which depend on the size of the alphabet, a lower bound is shown
to be of order $n^{r/2}$. This result complements a generic upper bound also of
order $n^{r/2}$.
