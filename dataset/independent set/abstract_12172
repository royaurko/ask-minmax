We apply the Discharging Method to prove the 1,2,3-Conjecture and the
1,2-Conjecture for graphs with maximum average degree less than 8/3. Stronger
results on these conjectures have been proved, but this is the first
application of discharging to them, and the structure theorems and reducibility
results are of independent interest.
