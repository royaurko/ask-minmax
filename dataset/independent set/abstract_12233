A fast-wave pulse in a simple, cold, inhomogeneous MHD model plasma is
constructed by Fourier superposition over frequency of harmonic waves that are
singular at their respective Alfven resonances. The pulse partially reflects
before reaching the resonance layer, but also partially tunnels through to it
to mode convert to an Alfven wave. The exact absorption/conversion coefficient
for the pulse is shown to be given precisely by a function of transverse
wavenumber tabulated in Paper I of this sequence, and to be independent of
frequency and pulse width.
