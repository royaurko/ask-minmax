We introduce a new method for controlling the false discovery rate
(FDR)---the expected fraction of spurious discoveries among all the
discoveries---in the context of decentralized linear models. Our method targets
the scenario where many research groups---possibly the number of which is
random---are independently testing a common set of hypotheses and then sending
summary statistics to a coordinating center in an online manner. Based on the
knockoffs framework introduced by Barber and Cand\`es (2014), our procedure
starts by applying the knockoff filter to each linear model and then aggregates
the summary statistics via one-shot communication in a novel way. This method
gives exact FDR control non-asymptotically without any knowledge of the noise
variances or making any assumption about sparsity of the signal. In certain
settings, it has a communication complexity that is optimal up to a logarithmic
factor.
