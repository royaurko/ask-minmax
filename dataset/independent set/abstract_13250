If the expectation value of the right-handed (rhd) sneutrino comes to
dominate the universe, its decay naturally leads to successful leptogenesis, as
well as significant dilution of dangerous inflationary relics, such as the
gravitino. The resulting baryon asymmetry is independent of other cosmological
initial conditions. This attractive variant of leptogenesis requires at least
one of the rhd neutrinos to have small Yukawa coupling and to have mass ~ 10^6
GeV, much smaller than the grand unified (GUT) scale. We show that these
features naturally arise in the context of independently motivated and
successful 5d orbifold GUTs with inverse-GUT-scale-sized extra dimensions. Rhd
neutrinos are realized as bulk fields N_i with 5d bulk masses, while Yukawa
couplings and lepton-number-violating masses for the N_i are localized at the
SM boundary. The exponential suppression of the would-be N_i zero-modes leads
to the desired small 4d Yukawa couplings and small masses for the rhd neutrino
states. The see-saw prediction for the lhd neutrino mass scale is automatically
maintained. We show that this realization of rhd neutrinos is nicely
accommodated within an attractive orbifold-GUT flavour model, where all flavour
hierarchies have a geometrical origin.
