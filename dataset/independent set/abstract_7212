Model sets (or cut and project sets) provide a familiar and commonly used
method of constructing and studying nonperiodic point sets. Here we extend this
method to situations where the internal spaces are no longer Euclidean, but
instead spaces with p-adic topologies or even with mixed Euclidean/p-adic
topologies.
  We show that a number of well known tilings precisely fit this form,
including the chair tiling and the Robinson square tilings. Thus the scope of
the cut and project formalism is considerably larger than is usually supposed.
Applying the powerful consequences of model sets we derive the diffractive
nature of these tilings.
