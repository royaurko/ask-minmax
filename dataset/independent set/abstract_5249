In this paper, we set up a general correspondence between the algebra
properties of $\bN$ and the sets defined by dynamical properties. In
particular, we obtain a dynamical characterization of C-sets, where C-sets are
the sets satisfying the strong Central Sets Theorem. As an application, we show
that Rado systems are solvable in C-sets.
