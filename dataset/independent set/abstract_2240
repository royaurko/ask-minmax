Results on steady TeV $\gamma$-ray point source search using data taken from
the Tibet HD (Feb. 1997 -- Sep. 1999) and Tibet III (Nov. 1999 -- Oct. 2001)
arrays are presented. From $0^{\circ}$ to $60^{\circ}$ in declination,
significant excesses from the well-known steady source Crab Nebula and the high
state of the flare type source Markarian 421 are observed. Because the levels
of significance from other positions are not sufficiently high, 90% confidence
level upper limits on the flux are set assuming different power law spectra. To
allow crosschecking, two independently developed analyses are used in this
work.
