We show that the radio, X-ray and gamma-ray spectrum of the supernova remnant
RX J1713.7-3946 can be accounted for with the simplest emission model, where
all of these emissions are attributed to a population of relativistic electrons
interacting with the cosmic microwave background radiation, IR interstellar
photons, and a background magnetic field. With a spectral inversion method
(Johns & Lin 1992), the parent electron distribution and its uncertainties are
derived from the observed photon spectrum. These results are independent on the
model of particle acceleration and strongly support the leptonic scenario for
the TeV emission.
