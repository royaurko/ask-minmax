New Abelian vector bosons can kinetically mix with the hypercharge gauge
boson of the Standard Model. This letter computes the model independent limits
on vector bosons with masses from 1 GeV to 1 TeV. The limits arise from the
numerous e+e- experiments that have been performed in this energy range and
bound the kinetic mixing by epsilon < 0.03 for most of the mass range studied,
regardless of any additional interactions that the new vector boson may have.
