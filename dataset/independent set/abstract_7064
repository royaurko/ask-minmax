The minimal sets within a collection of sets are defined as the ones which do
not have a proper subset within the collection, and the maximal sets are the
ones which do not have a proper superset within the collection. Identifying
extremal sets is a fundamental problem with a wide-range of applications in SAT
solvers, data-mining and social network analysis. In this paper, we present two
novel improvements of the high-quality extremal set identification algorithm,
\textit{AMS-Lex}, described by Bayardo and Panda. The first technique uses
memoization to improve the execution time of the single-threaded variant of the
AMS-Lex, whilst our second improvement uses parallel programming methods. In a
subset of the presented experiments our memoized algorithm executes more than
$400$ times faster than the highly efficient publicly available implementation
of AMS-Lex. Moreover, we show that our modified algorithm's speedup is not
bounded above by a constant and that it increases as the length of the common
prefixes in successive input \textit{itemsets} increases. We provide
experimental results using both real-world and synthetic data sets, and show
our multi-threaded variant algorithm out-performing AMS-Lex by $3$ to $6$
times. We find that on synthetic input datasets when executed using $16$ CPU
cores of a $32$-core machine, our multi-threaded program executes about as fast
as the state of the art parallel GPU-based program using an NVIDIA GTX 580
graphics processing unit.
