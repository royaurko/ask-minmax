The Higgs field is a central point of the Standard Model supplying masses to
other fields through the symmetry breaking mechanism. However, it is associated
with an elementary particle which is not yet discovered experimentally. In this
short note I suggest a way for expressing the Higgs field through other fields
of the Standard Model. If this is the case, being not an independent field, the
Higgs field does not require an elementary particle to be associated with it.
