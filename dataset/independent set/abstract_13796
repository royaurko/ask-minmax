In this article we construct closed, isospectral, non-isometric locally
symmetric manifolds. We have three main results. First, we construct
arbitrarily large sets of closed, isospectral, non-isometric manifolds. Second,
we show the growth of size these sets of isospectral manifolds as a function of
volume is super-polynomial. Finally, we construct pairs of infinite towers of
finite covers of a closed manifold that are isospectral and non-isometric at
each stage.
