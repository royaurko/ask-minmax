In this paper we consider the probability distribution function of a Gibbs
measure supported on a self-conformal set given by an iterated function system
(devil's staircase). We use thermodynamic multifractal formalism to calculate
the Hausdorff dimension of the sets $S^{\alpha}_{0}$, $S^{\alpha}_{\infty}$ and
$S^{\alpha}$, the set of points at which this function has, respectively,
H\"older derivative 0, $\infty$ or no derivative in the general sense. This
extends recent work by Darst, Dekking, Falconer, Kesseb\"ohmer and Stratmann
and Yao, Zhang and Li.
