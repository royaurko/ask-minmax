The class of $(t,m,s)$-nets and $(t,s)$-sequences, introduced in their most
general form by Niederreiter, are important examples of point sets and
sequences that are commonly used in quasi-Monte Carlo algorithms for
integration and approximation. Low-dimensional versions of $(t,m,s)$-nets and
$(t,s)$-sequences, such as Hammersley point sets and van der Corput sequences,
form important sub-classes, as they are interesting mathematical objects from a
theoretical point of view, and simultaneously serve as examples that make it
easier to understand the structural properties of $(t,m,s)$-nets and
$(t,s)$-sequences in arbitrary dimension. For these reasons, a considerable
number of papers have been written on the properties of low-dimensional nets
and sequences.
