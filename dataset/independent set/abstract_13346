Many biological processes involve the action of molecular motors that
interact with the cell cytoskeleton. Some processes, such as the transport of
cargoes is achieved mainly by the action of individual motors. Other, such as
cell motility and division, require the cooperative work of many motors.
Collective motor dynamics can be quite complex and unexpected. One beautiful
example is the bidirectional ("back and forth") motion of filaments which is
induced when the motors within a group exert forces in opposite directions.
This review tackles the puzzle emerging from a recent experimental work in
which it has been shown that the characteristic reversal times of the
bidirectional motion are practically independent of the number of motors. This
result is in a striking contradiction with existing theoretical models that
predict an exponential growth of the reversal times with the size of the
system. We argue that the solution to this puzzle may be the crosstalk between
the motors which is mediated by the elastic tensile stress that develops in the
cytoskeleton track. The crosstalk does not directly correlate the attachment
and detachment of the motors, which work independently of each other. However,
it highly accelerates their detachments by making the detachment rates system
size dependent.
