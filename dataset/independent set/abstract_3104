We observe optical third harmonic generation from graphene and few-layer
graphite flakes produced by exfoliation. The emission scales with the cube of
the intensity of the incident near-infrared femtosecond pulses and has a
wavelength that is one-third of the incident wavelength, both consistent with
third harmonic generation. We extract an effective third-order susceptibility
for graphene that is on the order of 1e-16 square meter per square volt, which
is comparable to that for materials that are resonantly excited, but larger
than for materials that are transparent at the fundamental and third harmonic
wavelengths. By measuring a set of flakes with different numbers of atomic
layers, we find that the emission scales with the square of the number of
atomic layers, which suggests that the susceptibility of graphene is
independent of layer number, at least for a few layers.
