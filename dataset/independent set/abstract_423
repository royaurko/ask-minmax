Supersymmetry with a compressed spectrum could be responsible for the
negative results from supersymmetric searches at LHC. Squarks and gluinos well
below the TeV scale could have escaped detection since all search channels lose
sensitivity when the mass splitting between supersymmetric particles becomes
small. Even in this stealthy situation, production of colored particles is
probed in processes with supersymmetric particles produced in association with
a high-pT photon. We show that searches for missing energy with a monophoton
are a powerful tool, and that the 2011 LHC data already surpasses the limits
set by LEP and TeVatron in the compressed case. We set a model-independent
bound on the mass of any up (down) type squark of 150 (110) GeV, and stronger
model-dependent bounds can be set. We also comment on the expected improvement
on those bounds in the 2012 LHC run.
