Using the theory developed by Olga Kharlampovich, Alexei Miasnikov, and,
independently, by Zlil Sela to describe the set of homomorphisms of a f.g.
group G into a free group F, we describe the solutions to equations with
coefficients from F and unknowns x,y of the form w(x,y) = u, where u lies in F
and w(x,y) is a word in {x,y}^\{pm 1}. We also give an example of a single
equation whose solutions cannot be described with only one "level" of
automorphisms.
