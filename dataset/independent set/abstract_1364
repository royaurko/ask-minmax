Let red and blue points be distributed on $\mathbb{R}$ according to two
independent Poisson processes $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ and let each red
(blue) point independently be equipped with a random number of half-edges
according to a probability distribution $\nu$ ($\mu$). We consider
translation-invariant bipartite random graphs with vertex classes defined by
the point sets of $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, respectively, generated by a
scheme based on the Gale-Shapley stable marriage for perfectly matching the
half-edges. Our main result is that, when all vertices have degree 2 almost
surely, then the resulting graph does not contain an infinite component. The
two-color model is hence qualitatively different from the one-color model,
where Deijfen, Holroyd and Peres have given strong evidence that there is an
infinite component. We also present simulation results for other degree
distributions.
