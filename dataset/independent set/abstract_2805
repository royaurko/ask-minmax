We continue the study of hadronic scattering amplitudes at high energy by
systematically including nonlinear effects of finite partonic density in
hadronic wave function as well as the effects of multiple rescatterings in the
scattering process. In this paper we derive expressions for a single inclusive
gluon production amplitude and multigluon inclusive production amplitudes when
the rapidities of all observed gluons are not very different. We show that at
leading order these observables exhibit a semiclassical structure. Beyond the
semiclassical result, we find that the gluon emission has some characteristic
features different from the JIMWLK and KLWMIJ limits in that the gluons are not
emitted independently in rapidity space, but have a correlated component with
correlation length (in rapidity space) of order one. We demonstrate the
consistency between this feature of the multigluon observables and the
Hamiltonian of the QCD Reggeon Field Theory ($H_{RFT}$) derived in the
companion paper \cite{rft}. We also show that the evolution of these
observables with total rapidity of the process is generated by $H_{RFT}$ of
\cite{rft}. We discuss whether this evolution is equivalent to evolution with
$H_{JIMWLK}$ as far as this set of observables is concerned.
