We describe the implications of cosmic microwave background (CMB)
observations and galaxy and cluster surveys of large scale structure (LSS) for
theories of cosmic structure formation, especially emphasizing the recent
Boomerang and Maxima CMB balloon experiments. The inflation-based cosmic
structure formation paradigm we have been operating with for two decades has
never been in better shape. Here we primarily focus on a simplified inflation
parameter set, {omega_b,omega_{cdm},Omega_{tot}, Omega_\Lambda,n_s,\tau_C,
\sigma_8}. Combining all of the current CMB+LSS data points to the remarkable
conclusion that the local Hubble patch we can access has little mean curvature
(Omega_{tot}=1.08\pm 0.06) and the initial fluctuations were nearly scale
invariant (n_s=1.03\pm 0.08), both predictions of (non-baroque) inflation
theory. The baryon density is found to be slightly larger than that preferred
by independent Big Bang Nucleosynthesis estimates (omega_b=0.030\pm 0.005 cf.
0.019\pm 0.002). The CDM density is in the expected range (omega_{cdm}=0.17 \pm
0.02). Even stranger is the CMB+LSS evidence that the density of the universe
is dominated by unclustered energy akin to the cosmological constant
(Omega_\Lambda=0.66\pm 0.06), at the same level as that inferred from high
redshift supernova observations. We also sketch the CMB+LSS implications for
massive neutrinos.
