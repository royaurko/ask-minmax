We prove a free analogue of Brillinger's formula (sometimes called "law of
total cumulance") which expresses classical cumulants in terms of conditioned
cumulants. As expected, the formula is obtained by replacing the lattice of set
partitions by the lattice of noncrossing set partitions and using and an
appropriate notion of noncommutative nested products. As an application we
reprove a characterization of freeness due to Nica, Shlyakhtenko and Speicher
by M\"obius inversion techniques, without recourse to the Fock space model for
free random variables.
