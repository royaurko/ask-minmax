We investigate the robustness of multiparty nonlocality under local
decoherence, acting independently and equally on each subsystems. To be
specific, we consider an N-qubit GHZ state under depolarization, dephasing, or
dissipation channel, and tested the nonlocality by violation of Mermin-Klyshko
inequality, which is one of Bell's inequalities for multi-qubit systems. The
results show that the robustness of nonlocality increases with the number of
qubits, and that the nonlocality of an N-qubit GHZ state with even N is
extremely persistent against dephasing.
