A finite sum of exponential functions may be expressed by a linear
combination of powers of the independent variable and by successive integrals
of the sum. This is proved for the general case and the connection between the
parameters in the sum and the coefficients in the linear combination is
highlighted. The fitting of exponential functions to a given data- set is
therefore reduced to a multilinear approximation procedure. The results of this
approximation do not only provide the necessary information to compute the
factors in the exponents and the weights of the exponential terms but also they
are used to estimate the errors in the factors.
