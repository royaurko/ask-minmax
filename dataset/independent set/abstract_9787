In this paper, we construct an infinite presentation of the Torelli subgroup
of the mapping class group of a surface whose generators consist of the set of
all "separating twists", all "bounding pair maps", and all "commutators of
simply intersecting pairs" and whose relations all come from a short list of
topological configurations of these generators on the surface. Aside from a few
obvious ones, all of these relations come from a set of embeddings of groups
derived from surface groups into the Torelli group. In the process of analyzing
these embeddings, we derive a novel presentation for the fundamental group of a
closed surface whose generating set is the set of all simple closed curves.
