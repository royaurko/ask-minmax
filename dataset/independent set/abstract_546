Given a directed graph G=(V,E) an independent set A of the vertices V is
called quasi-kernel (quasi-sink) iff for each point v there is a path of length
at most 2 from some point of A to v (from v to some point of A). Every finite
directed graph has a quasi-kernel. The plain generalization for infinite graphs
fails, even for tournaments. We investigate the following conjecture here: for
any digraph G=(V,E) there is a a partition (V_0,V_1) of the vertex set such
that the induced subgraph G[V_0] has a quasi-kernel and the induced subgraph
G[V_1] has a quasi-sink.
