In an attempt to maximize General Gauge Mediated parameter space, I propose
simple models in which gauginos and scalars are generated from disconnected
mechanisms. In my models Dirac gauginos are generated through the supersoft
mechanism, while independent R-symmetric scalar masses are generated through
operators involving non-zero messenger supertrace. I propose several new
methods for generating negative messenger supertraces which result in viable
positive mass squareds for MSSM scalars. The resultant spectra are novel,
compressed and may contain light fermionic SM adjoint fields.
