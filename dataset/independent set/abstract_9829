Church's Higher Order Logic is a basis for influential proof assistants --
HOL and PVS. Church's logic has a simple set-theoretic semantics, making it
trustworthy and extensible. We factor HOL into a constructive core plus axioms
of excluded middle and choice. We similarly factor standard set theory, ZFC,
into a constructive core, IZF, and axioms of excluded middle and choice. Then
we provide the standard set-theoretic semantics in such a way that the
constructive core of HOL is mapped into IZF. We use the disjunction, numerical
existence and term existence properties of IZF to provide a program extraction
capability from proofs in the constructive core.
  We can implement the disjunction and numerical existence properties in two
different ways: one using Rathjen's realizability for IZF and the other using a
new direct weak normalization result for IZF by Moczydlowski. The latter can
also be used for the term existence property.
