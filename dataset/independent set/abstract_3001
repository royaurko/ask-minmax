The topic of this article is weak cosmic shear tomography where the line of
sight-weighting is carried out with a set of specifically constructed
orthogonal polynomials, dubbed TaRDiS (Tomography with orthogonAl Radial
Distance polynomIal Systems). We investigate the properties of these
polynomials and employ weak convergence spectra, which have been obtained by
weighting with these polynomials, for the estimation of cosmological
parameters. We quantify their power in constraining parameters in a
Fisher-matrix technique and demonstrate how each polynomial projects out
statistically independent information, and how the combination of multiple
polynomials lifts degeneracies. The assumption of a reference cosmology is
needed for the construction of the polynomials, and as a last point we
investigate how errors in the construction with a wrong cosmological model
propagate to misestimates in cosmological parameters. TaRDiS performs on a
similar level as traditional tomographic methods and some key features of
tomography are made easier to understand.
