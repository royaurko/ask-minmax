We perform a high-precision calculation of the critical exponents for the
long-range elastic string driven through quenched disorder at the depinning
transition, at zero temperature. Large-scale simulations are used to avoid
finite-size effects and to enable high precision. The roughness, growth, and
velocity exponents are calculated independently, and the dynamic and
correlation length exponents are derived. The critical exponents satisfy known
scaling relations and agree well with analytical predictions.
