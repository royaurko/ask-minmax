The reason why smart home remains not popularized lies in bad product user
experience, purchasing cost, and compatibility, and a lack of industry
standard[1]. Echoing problems above, and having relentless devoted to software
and hardware innovation and practice, we have independently developed a set of
solution which is based on innovation and integration of router technology,
mobile Internet technology,Internet of things technology,communication
technology, digital-to-analog conversion and codec technology, and P2P
technology among others. We have also established relevant protocols (without
the application of protocols abroad). By doing this, we managed to establish a
system with low and moderate price, superior performance, all-inclusive
functions, easy installation, convenient portability, real-time reliability,
security encryption, and the capability to manage home furnitures in an
intelligent way. Only a new smart home system like this can inject new idea and
energy into smart home industry and thus vigorously promote the establishment
of smart home industry standard.
