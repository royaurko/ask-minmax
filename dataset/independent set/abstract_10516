We discuss 3-body processes in ultracold two-component Fermi gases with
short-range intercomponent interaction characterized by a large and positive
scattering length $a$. It is found that in most cases the probability of 3-body
recombination is a universal function of the mass ratio and $a$, and is
independent of short-range physics. We also calculate the scattering length
corresponding to the atom-dimer interaction.
