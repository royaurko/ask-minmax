We introduce a fast algorithm for generating long self-affine profiles. The
algorithm, which is based on the fast wavelet transform, is faster than the
conventional Fourier filtering algorithm. In addition to increased performance
for large systems, the algorithm, named the wavelet filtering algorithm, a
priori gives rise to profiles for which the long-range correlation extends
throughout the entire system independently of the length scale.
