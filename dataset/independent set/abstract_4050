The production of protons, anti-protons, neutrons, deuterons and tritons in
minimum bias p+C interactions is studied using a sample of 385 734 inelastic
events obtained with the NA49 detector at the CERN SPS at 158 GeV/c beam
momentum. The data cover a phase space area ranging from 0 to 1.9 GeV/c in
transverse momentum and in Feynman x from -0.80 to 0.95 for protons, from -0.2
to 0.4 for anti-protons and from 0.2 to 0.95 for neutrons. Existing data in the
far backward hemisphere are used to extend the coverage for protons and light
nuclear fragments into the region of intranuclear cascading. The use of
corresponding data sets obtained in hadron-proton collisions with the same
detector allows for the detailed analysis and model-independent separation of
the three principle components of hadronization in p+C interactions, namely
projectile fragmentation, target fragmentation of participant nucleons and
intranuclear cascading.
