We study Bell's inequality using the Bell states constructed from four
component Dirac spinors. Spin operator is related to the Pauli-Lubanski pseudo
vector which is relativistic invariant operator. By using Lorentz
transformation, in both Bell states and spin operator, we obtain an observer
independent Bell's inequality, so that it is maximally violated as long as it
is violated maximally in the rest frame.
