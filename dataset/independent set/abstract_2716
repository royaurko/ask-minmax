Coercion resistance is an important and one of the most intricate security
requirements of electronic voting protocols. Several definitions of coercion
resistance have been proposed in the literature, including definitions based on
symbolic models. However, existing definitions in such models are rather
restricted in their scope and quite complex.
  In this paper, we therefore propose a new definition of coercion resistance
in a symbolic setting, based on an epistemic approach. Our definition is
relatively simple and intuitive. It allows for a fine-grained formulation of
coercion resistance and can be stated independently of a specific, symbolic
protocol and adversary model. As a proof of concept, we apply our definition to
three voting protocols. In particular, we carry out the first rigorous analysis
of the recently proposed Civitas system. We precisely identify those conditions
under which this system guarantees coercion resistance or fails to be coercion
resistant. We also analyze protocols proposed by Lee et al. and Okamoto.
