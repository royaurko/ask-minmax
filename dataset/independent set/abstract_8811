We extend a few recent results of G\'{o}rnicki (2011) asserting that the set
of fixed points of an asymptotically regular mapping is a retract of its
domain. In particular, we prove that in some cases the resulting retraction is
H\"{o}lder continuous. We also characterise Bynum's coefficients and the Opial
modulus in terms of nets.
