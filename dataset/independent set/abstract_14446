Serial pattern mining consists in extracting the frequent sequential patterns
from a unique sequence of itemsets. This paper explores the ability of a
declarative language, such as Answer Set Programming (ASP), to solve this issue
efficiently. We propose several ASP implementations of the frequent sequential
pattern mining task: a non-incremental and an incremental resolution. The
results show that the incremental resolution is more efficient than the
non-incremental one, but both ASP programs are less efficient than dedicated
algorithms. Nonetheless, this approach can be seen as a first step toward a
generic framework for sequential pattern mining with constraints.
