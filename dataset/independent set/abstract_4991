The gauge dependence of the time-ordered products for Yang-Mills theories is
analysed in perturbation theory by means of the causal method of Epstein and
Glaser together with perturbative gauge invariance. This approach allows a
simple inductive proof of the gauge independence of the physical S-matrix.
