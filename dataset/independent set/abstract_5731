The target-independent suppression mechanism proposed as an explanation of
the EMC-SMC `proton spin' effect is reviewed and compared to current
experimental data. According to this proposal, the anomalous suppression
observed in the first moment of the polarised proton structure function g_1^p
is not a special property of the proton structure, but reflects an anomalously
small value of the first moment of the QCD topological susceptibility. It is
shown how this mechanism can be tested in semi-inclusive DIS processes in which
a pion or D meson carrying a large target energy fraction z is detected in the
target fragmentation region.
