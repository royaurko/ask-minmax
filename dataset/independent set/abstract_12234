We present the results of a fitter code which aims at extracting Compton Form
Factors (CFFs) from DVCS (Deep Virtual Compton Scattering) experimental data,
in a largely model-independent way. CFFs are linked to GPDs (Generalized parton
Distributions) and are the quantities which are directly measurable. The data
that we have analyzed are from JLab and HERMES experiments. We obtain some
first important constraints on the $H$ and $\tilde{H}$ CFFs. The kinematical
dependences ($x_B$, $t$) of these CFFs provide some new insights on nucleon
structure.
