We model the spectral energy distribution of the ultrasoft broad-line AGN RE
J2248-511 with Comptonised accretion disc models. These are able to reproduce
the steep optical and ultrasoft X-ray slopes, and the derived black hole mass
is consistent with independent mass estimates. This AGN displays properties of
both broad and narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies, but we conclude that it is
intrinsically a `normal' Seyfert 1 viewed at high inclination angle.
