As an application of Stein's method for Poisson approximation, we prove rates
of convergence for the tail probabilities of two scan statistics that have been
suggested for detecting local signals in sequences of independent random
variables subject to possible change-points. Our formulation deals
simultaneously with ordinary and with large deviations.
