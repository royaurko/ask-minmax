In "Isotropy of Speed of Light" by Castano and Hawkins, arXiv:1103.1620, it
is claimed, using a flawed theoretical argument, that the speed of light must
necessarily be isotropic, independent even of experiment. The key false
assumption made is that the round trip time must always be invariant wrt change
of direction of the light path. This is shown to be false. More importantly the
anisotropy of the speed of light has been repeatedly detected in experiments,
beginning with Michelson and Morley in 1887, and with the most recent data
being from spacecraft earth-flyby Doppler shift data. Similar misunderstandings
critically affect the designs for LIGO and LISA.
