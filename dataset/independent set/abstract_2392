We analyze the full set of constraints on gluino- and photino-mediated SUSY
contributions to FCNC and CP violating phenomena. We use the mass insertion
method, hence providing a model-independent parameterization which can be
readily applied in testing extensions of the MSSM. In addition to clarifying
controversial points in the literature, we provide a more exhaustive analysis
of the CP constraints, in particular concerning
$\varepsilon^\prime/\varepsilon$. As physically meaningful applications of our
analysis, we study the implications in SUSY-GUT's and effective supergravities
with flavour non-universality. This allows us to detail the domain of
applicability and the correct procedure of implementation of the FC mass
insertion approach.
