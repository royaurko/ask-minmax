The fast escaping set of a transcendental entire function is the set of all
points which tend to infinity under iteration as fast as compatible with the
growth of the function. We study the analogous set for quasiregular mappings in
higher dimensions and show, among other things, that various equivalent
definitions of the fast escaping set for transcendental entire functions in the
plane also coincide for quasiregular mappings. We also exhibit a class of
quasiregular mappings for which the fast escaping set has the structure of a
spider's web.
