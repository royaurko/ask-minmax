We calculate a one loop effective action of SU(2) QCD in the presence of the
monopole background, and find a possible connection between the resulting QCD
effective action and a generalized Skyrme-Faddeev action of the non-linear
sigma model. The result is obtained using the gauge-independent decomposotion
of the gauge potential into the topological degrees which describes the
non-Abelian monopoles and the local dynamical degrees of the potential, and
integrating out all the dynamical degrees of QCD.
