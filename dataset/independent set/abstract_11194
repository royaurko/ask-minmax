The S-matrix is invariant with respect to the variation of any (global)
parameter involved in the gauge fixing conditions, if that variation is
accompanied by a certain redefinition of the basis of polarization vectors.
Renormalizability of the underlying gauge theory is not required. The proof is
nonperturbative and, using the `extended' BRS transformation, quite simple.
