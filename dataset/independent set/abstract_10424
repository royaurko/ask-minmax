A theoretical analysis of the statistical distributions of the reflected
intensities from random media is presented. We use random matrix theory to
analytically deduce the probability densities in the localization regime.
Numerical calculations of the coupling to backward modes in surface corrugated
waveguides are also put forward for comparison. Interestingly, the speckle
distributions are found to be independent of the transport regime. Despite the
scattering being highly non-isotropic, the predicted probability densities
reproduce accurately the numerical results.
