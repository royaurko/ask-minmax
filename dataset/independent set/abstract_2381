We present a systematic analysis of the $B^{(*)}\to\pi\,\ell\,\nu$ weak decay
form factors to order $1/m_b$ in the heavy quark effective theory, including a
discussion of renormalization group effects. These processes are described by a
set of ten universal functions (two at leading order, and eight at order
$1/m_b$), which are defined in terms of matrix elements of operators in the
effective theory. In the soft pion limit, the effective theory yields
normalization conditions for these functions, which generalize the well-known
current algebra relations derived from the combination of heavy quark and
chiral symmetries to next-to-leading order in $1/m_b$. In particular, the
effects of the nearby $B^*$-pole are correctly contained in the form factors of
the effective theory. We discuss the prospects for a model independent
determination of $|V_{ub}|$ and the $B B^*\pi$ coupling constant from these
processes.
