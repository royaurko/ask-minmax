We study the level lines of a Gaussian free field in a planar domain with
general boundary data $F$. We show that the level lines exist as continuous
curves under the assumption that $F$ is regulated (i.e., admits left and right
limits at every point), and satisfies certain inequalities. Moreover, these
level lines are a.s. determined by the field. This allows us to define and
study a generalization of the SLE$_4(\underline{\rho})$ process, now with a
continuum of force points. A crucial ingredient is a monotonicity property in
terms of the boundary data which strengthens a result of Miller and Sheffield
and is also of independent interest.
