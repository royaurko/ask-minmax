A search for neutral Higgs bosons predicted in the minimal supersymmetric
standard model (MSSM) for $\mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ decay channels is presented. The
analysis uses data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton
collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to
integrated luminosities of 5.1 and 19.3 fb$^{-1}$, respectively. The search is
sensitive to Higgs bosons produced through the gluon fusion process and in
association with a bb quark pair. No statistically significant excess is
observed in the $\mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ mass spectrum. Results are interpreted in the
framework of several benchmark scenarios, and the data are used to set an upper
limit on the MSSM parameter $ \tan{ \beta} $ as a function of the mass of the
pseudoscalar A boson in the range from 115 to 300 GeV. Model independent upper
limits are given for the product of the cross section and branching fraction
for gluon fusion and b quark associated production. They are the most stringent
limits obtained to date in this channel.
