Searches for scalar top and scalar bottom quarks, as well as for
mass-degenerate scalar quarks of the first two families are performed at 189
GeV centre-of-mass energy with the L3 detector at LEP. No signals are observed.
Model-independent limits on the scalar top production cross sections are
determined for the decay modes t1~ -> c chi_1^0 and t1~ -> b l nu~. For scalar
quarks of the other flavours q~ -> q chi_1^0 decays are considered. Within the
framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model mass limits are set at
95% C.L. for these particles. Indirect limits on the gluino mass are also
derived.
