The transverse spin of interacting light quarks is described by two
independent non-perturbative inputs, twist-2 transversity and twist-3
quark-gluon correlators, while for free massive quarks they are related by the
equations of motion. Similar relation emerges also in a model, where
quark-hadron transition is treated in a probabilistic way. The single spin
asymmerty in SIDIS appears due to the interplay of transverity with Collins
fragmentation function, which appears to be of twist 3, when defined in a
Lorentz invariant way.
