We investigate in this paper the effect of gas drag on the dynamics of the
dust particles in the edge-on Beta-Pictoris disc in order to derive an upper
limit on the mass of gas in this system. Our study is motivated by the large
uncertainties on the amount of gas in the Beta-Pictoris disc currently found in
the literature. The dust particles are assumed to originate from a colliding
annulus of planetesimals peaked around 100AU from the central star as proposed
by Augereau et al.(2001). We consider the various gas densities that have been
inferred from independent observing techniques and we discuss their impact on
the dust dynamics and on the disc profile in scattered light along the
midplane. We show that the observed scattered light profile of the disc cannot
be properly reproduced if hydrogen gas number density at 117AU exceeds 10**4
cm**-3. This corresponds to an upper limit on the total gas mass of about 0.4
Mearth assuming the gas density profile inferred by Brandeker et al.(2004) and
thus to a gas to dust mass ratio smaller than 1. Our approach therefore
provides an independent diagnostic for a gas depletion in the Beta-Pictoris
system relative to the dust disc. Such an approach could also be used to
constrain the gas content of recently identified systems like the edge-on disc
around AUmic.
