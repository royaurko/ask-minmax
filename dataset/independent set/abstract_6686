We recall the definition of the $\epsilon$-distortion complexity of a set
defined in \cite{bcc} and the results obtained in this paper for Cantor sets of
the interval defined by iterated function systems. We state an analogous
definition for measures which may be more useful when dealing with dynamical
systems. We prove a new lower bound in the case of Cantor sets of the interval
defined by analytic iterated function systems. We also give an upper bound the
$\epsilon$-distortion complexity of invariant sets of uniformly hyperbolic
dynamical systems.
