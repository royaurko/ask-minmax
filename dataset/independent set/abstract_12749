The RngStreams software package provides one viable solution to the problem
of creating independent random number streams for simulations in parallel
processing environments. Techniques are presented for effectively using
RngStreams with C++ programs that are parallelized via OpenMP or MPI. Ways to
access the backbone generator from RngStreams in R through the parallel and
rstream packages are also described. The ideas in the paper are illustrated
with both a simple running example and a Monte Carlo integration application.
