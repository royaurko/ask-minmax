We associate ergodic properties to some subsets of the natural numbers. For
any given family of subsets of the natural numbers one may study the question
of occurrence of certain "algebraic patterns" in every subset in the family. By
"algebraic pattern" we mean a set of solutions of a system of diophantine
equations. In this work we investigate a concrete family of subsets - WM sets.
These sets are characterized by the property that the dynamical systems
associated to such sets are "weakly mixing", and as such they represent a broad
family of randomly constructed subsets of (\mathbb{N}). We find that certain
systems of equations are solvable within every WM set, and our subject is to
learn which systems have this property. We give a complete characterization of
linear diophantine systems which are solvable within every WM set. In addition
we study some non-linear equations and systems of equations with regard to the
question of solvability within every WM set.
