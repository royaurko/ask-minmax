The thermodynamics with medium effects expressed by the temperature- and
density-dependent effective mass of quasiparticle is studied. Series
difficulties and many wrangles in references due to the extraordinary parameter
dependence are addressed. A new independent intrinsic degree of freedom of
quasiparticle $m^*$ in the equation of reversible process is introduced to
clear the ambiguity. We prove all results are self-consistent.
