Uncertainty relations for a pair of arbitrary measurements and for a single
measurement are posed in the form of inequalities using the Renyi entropies.
The formulation deals with discrete observables. Both the relations with
state-dependent and state-independent bounds are presented. The entropic bounds
are illustrated within the distinction between non-orthogonal states.
