We consider constraint-based methods for causal structure learning, such as
the PC-, FCI-, RFCI- and CCD- algorithms (Spirtes et al. (2000, 1993),
Richardson (1996), Colombo et al. (2012), Claassen et al. (2013)). The first
step of all these algorithms consists of the PC-algorithm. This algorithm is
known to be order-dependent, in the sense that the output can depend on the
order in which the variables are given. This order-dependence is a minor issue
in low-dimensional settings. We show, however, that it can be very pronounced
in high-dimensional settings, where it can lead to highly variable results. We
propose several modifications of the PC-algorithm (and hence also of the other
algorithms) that remove part or all of this order-dependence. All proposed
modifications are consistent in high-dimensional settings under the same
conditions as their original counterparts. We compare the PC-, FCI-, and
RFCI-algorithms and their modifications in simulation studies and on a yeast
gene expression data set. We show that our modifications yield similar
performance in low-dimensional settings and improved performance in
high-dimensional settings. All software is implemented in the R-package pcalg.
