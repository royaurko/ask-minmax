Tsiklauri et al. recently published a theoretical model of electron
acceleration by Alfv\'en waves in a nonuniform collisionless plasmas. We
compare their work with a series of results published earlier by an another
team, of which Tsiklauri et al. were probably unaware. We show that these two
series of works, apparently conducted independently, lead to the same
conclusions. This reinforces the theoretical consistency of the model.
