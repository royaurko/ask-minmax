Two goodness-of-fit tests for copulas are being investigated. The first one
deals with the case of elliptical copulas and the second one deals with
independent copulas. These tests result from the expansion of the projection
pursuit methodology we will introduce in the present article. This method
enables us to determine on which axis system these copulas lie as well as the
exact value of these very copulas in the basis formed by the axes previously
determined irrespective of their value in their canonical basis. Simulations
are also presented as well as an application to real datasets.
