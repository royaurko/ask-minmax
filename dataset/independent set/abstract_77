For a given positive integer t we consider graphs having maximal independent
sets of precisely t distinct cardinalities and restrict our attention to those
that have no vertices of degree one. In the situation when t is four or larger
and the length of the shortest cycle is at least 6t-6, we completely
characterize such graphs.
