The finite orbits of the braid group action on Stokes matrices are studied
and are shown to be the orbits on ordered sets of reflections, generating
finite groups. All invariants of a reflection arrangement are determined.
Determination of the orbits of the braid group on non-redundant generaing
reflections in finite groups is done in a new way. The original idea is to
introduce universal sets of generators in each group. These sets are found for
all finite Coxeter groups. The orbits are classified for non-degenerate
arrangement matrices.
