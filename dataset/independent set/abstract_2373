We expand the gauge field in terms of a suitably constructed complete set of
Bloch wave functions, each labeled by a band designation $\,n\,$ and a wave
number $\,\vec K\,$ restricted to the Brillouin zone. A noncompact formulation
of lattice QCD (or QED) can be derived by restricting the expansion only to the
$\,0^{th}$-band ($\,n = 0\,$) functions, which are simple continuum
interpolations of discrete values associated with sites or links on a lattice.
The exact continuum theory can be reached through the inclusion of all $\,n =
0\,$ and $\,n \ne 0\,$ bands, without requiring the lattice size $\,\ell \to
0\,$. This makes it possible, at a nonzero $\,\ell\,$, for the lattice coupling
$\,g_\ell\,$ to act as the renormalized continuum coupling. All physical
results in the continuum are, of course, independent of $\,\ell\,$.
