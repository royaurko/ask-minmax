A set is called semidefinite representable or semidefinite programming (SDP)
representable if it can be represented as the projection of a higher
dimensional set which is represented by some Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI).
This paper discuss the semidefinite representability conditions for convex sets
of the form S_D(f) = {x \in D: f(x) >= 0}. Here D={x\in R^n: g_1(x) >= 0, ...,
g_m(x) >= 0} is a convex domain defined by some "nice" concave polynomials
g_i(x) (they satisfy certain concavity certificates), and f(x) is a polynomial
or rational function. When f(x) is concave over \mc{D}, we prove that S_D(f)
has some explicit semidefinite representations under certain conditions called
preordering concavity or q-module concavity, which are based on the
Positivstellensatz certificates for the first order concavity criteria. When
f(x) is a polynomial or rational function having singularities on the boundary
of S_D(f), a perspective transformation is introduced to find some explicit
semidefinite representations for S_D(f) under certain conditions. In the
particular case n=2, if the Laurent expansion of f(x) around one singular point
has only two consecutive homogeneous parts, we show that S_D(f) always admits
an explicitly constructible semidefinite representation.
