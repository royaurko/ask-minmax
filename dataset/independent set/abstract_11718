A sort of calculus is developed to find the chiral algebras of N=2
superconformal interacting bosonic models. Many examples are discussed. It is
shown that the algebras share a common structure, which we call almost Landau
Ginzburg. For one or two generators, the number of relations is equal to the
number of generators and they are algebraically independent.
