However utilizing rich, interactive solutions can make learning more
effective and attractive, scenario- and game-based educational resources on the
web are not widely used. Creating these applications is a complex, expensive
and challenging process. Development frameworks and contributoring tools hardly
support reusable components, teamwork and learning management
system-independent courseware architecture. In this article we initiate the
concept of a low-level, thick-client solution addressing these problems. With
some example applications we try to demonstrate, how a framework, based on this
concept can be useful for developing scenario- and game-based e-learning
environments.
