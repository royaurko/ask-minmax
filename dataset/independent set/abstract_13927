A simple Bayesian approach to nonparametric regression is described using
fuzzy sets and membership functions. Membership functions are interpreted as
likelihood functions for the unknown regression function, so that with the help
of a reference prior they can be transformed to prior density functions. The
unknown regression function is decomposed into wavelets and a hierarchical
Bayesian approach is employed for making inferences on the resulting wavelet
coefficients.
