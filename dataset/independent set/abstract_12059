Discrete Euclidian Spaces (DESs) are the beginning of a journey without
return towards the discretization of mathematics. Important mathematical
concepts- such as the idea of number or the systems of numeration, whose formal
definition is currently independent of Euclidean spaces -have in the
Isodimensional Discrete Mathematics (IDM) their roots in the DESs. This
mathematics, which arises largely from the discretization of traditional
mathematics, presents its foundations and concepts differently from the
orthodox way, so at first glance it may seem that the IDM could be an exotic
tool, or perhaps just "a simple curiosity." However, the IDM dis-crete
approaches have a great theoretical repercussion on traditional mathematics.
