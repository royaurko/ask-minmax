Direct look at the celebrated "chaotic" Mandelbrot Set in Fig..\ref{Mand2}
immediately reveals that it is a collection of almost ideal circles and
cardioids, unified in a specific {\it forest} structure. In /hep-th/9501235 a
systematic algebro-geometric approach was developed to the study of generic
Mandelbrot sets, but emergency of nearly ideal circles in the special case of
the family $x^2+c$ was not fully explained. In the present paper the shape of
the elementary constituents of Mandelbrot Set is explicitly {\it calculated},
and difference between the shapes of {\it root} and {\it descendant} domains
(cardioids and circles respectively) is explained. Such qualitative difference
persists for all other Mandelbrot sets: descendant domains always have one less
cusp than the root ones. Details of the phase transition between different
Mandelbrot sets are explicitly demonstrated, including overlaps between
elementary domains and dynamics of attraction/repulsion regions. Explicit
examples of 3-dimensional sections of Universal Mandelbrot Set are given. Also
a systematic small-size approximation is developed for evaluation of various
Feigenbaum indices.
