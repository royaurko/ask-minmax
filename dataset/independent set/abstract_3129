We propose a two-step estimating procedure for generalized additive partially
linear models with clustered data using estimating equations. Our proposed
method applies to the case that the number of observations per cluster is
allowed to increase with the number of independent subjects. We establish
oracle properties for the two-step estimator of each function component such
that it performs as well as the univariate function estimator by assuming that
the parametric vector and all other function components are known. Asymptotic
distributions and consistency properties of the estimators are obtained.
Finite-sample experiments with both simulated continuous and binary response
variables confirm the asymptotic results. We illustrate the methods with an
application to a U.S. unemployment data set.
