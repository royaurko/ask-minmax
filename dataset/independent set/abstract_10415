A major extension of the model of condensate growth introduced by us is made
to take account of the evolution of the occupations of lower trap levels
(quasiparticles) by scattering processes, and of the full Bose-Einstein formula
for the occupations of higher trap levels, which are assumed to have a time
independent occupation. The principal effect is a speedup of the growth rate by
somewhat less than an order of magnitude, the precise value depending on the
the assumptions made on scattering and transition rates for the quasiparticle
levels.
