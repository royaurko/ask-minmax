We study the minimum number of constraints needed to formulate random
instances of the maximum stable set problem via linear programs (LPs), in two
distinct models. In the uniform model, the constraints of the LP are not
allowed to depend on the input graph, which should be encoded solely in the
objective function. There we prove a $2^{\Omega(n/ \log n)}$ lower bound with
probability at least $1 - 2^{-2^n}$ for every LP that is exact for a randomly
selected set of instances; each graph on at most n vertices being selected
independently with probability $p \geq 2^{-\binom{n/4}{2}+n}$. In the
non-uniform model, the constraints of the LP may depend on the input graph, but
we allow weights on the vertices. The input graph is sampled according to the
G(n, p) model. There we obtain upper and lower bounds holding with high
probability for various ranges of p. We obtain a super-polynomial lower bound
all the way from $p = \Omega(\log^{6+\varepsilon} / n)$ to $p = o (1 / \log
n)$. Our upper bound is close to this as there is only an essentially quadratic
gap in the exponent, which currently also exists in the worst-case model.
Finally, we state a conjecture that would close this gap, both in the
average-case and worst-case models.
