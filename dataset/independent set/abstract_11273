Based on the multiplicative rule of Schubert classes obtained in [Du3], we
present an algorithm computing the product of two arbitrary Schubert classes.
  As a result, the algorithm gives also a method to compute the integral
cohomology ring of a flag manifold independent of the classical spectral
sequence technique due to Leray and Borel.
