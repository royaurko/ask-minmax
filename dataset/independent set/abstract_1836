The Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) is aimed at providing an independent
measure of change in the the Hubble expansion as a function of redshift, and
setting constraints dark energy contribution to the total energy content of the
universe. Using type Ia supernovae (SNIa), the CSP differs from other projects
to date in its goal of providing an I-band restframe Hubble diagram. The CSP is
focused on testing for and reducing systematic uncertainties, obtaining a
sample of multiwavelength observations of approximately 200 supernovae over the
redshift range 0 < z < 0.6. The UBVRIYJHK data for low-redshift supernova are
intended to provide a database for the determination of the Hubble constant,
accurate K- and S-corrections, comparison with theoretical models of
supernovae, and for comparison with the RIYJ data of high-redshift supernovae.
The goal is to measure the evolution of the expansion rate, to characterize the
acceleration of the Universe, and constrain the equation of state, w, to a
precision and accuracy of 10%. We are also exploring the use of Type II SNae as
independent distance indicators. Following an ongoing, initial test period, the
project has begun during the fall of 2004. Here an overview of the project is
given, and some preliminary results from the pilot program are presented.
