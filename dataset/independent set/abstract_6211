We investigate the set of Pi-1-2 sentences which are Pi-1-1 conservative over
the theories of reverse mathematics RCA0+ISigma_n and ACA0. We exhibit new
elements of these sets and conclude that the sets are Pi_2 complete. Along the
way, we show that, over the theory RCA, induction for Sigma-n formulas has
essentially no consequences for Delta-(n+1) formulas.
