The isodiametric inequality is derived from the isoperimetric inequality
trough a variational principle, establishing that balls maximize the perimeter
among convex sets with fixed diameter. This principle brings also quantitative
improvements to the isodiametric inequality, shown to be sharp by explicit
nearly optimal sets.
