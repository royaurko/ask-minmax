The nonzero level sets of a homogeneous, logarithmically homogeneous, or
translationally homogeneous function are affine spheres if and only if the
Hessian determinant of the function is a multiple of a power or an exponential
of the function. In particular, the nonzero level sets of a homogeneous
polynomial are proper affine spheres if some power of it equals a nonzero
multiple of its Hessian determinant. The relative invariants of real forms of
regular irreducible prehomogeneous vector spaces yield many examples of such
polynomials which are moreover irreducible. For example, the nonzero level sets
of the Cayley hyperdeterminant are affine spheres. Similarly, the nonzero level
sets of the exponential of a polynomial are improper affine spheres if some
power of the exponential equals a nonzero multiple of its Hessian determinant.
The characteristic polynomials of certain left-symmetric algebras yield
examples of such polynomials whose level sets are analogues of the generalized
Cayley hypersurface. The final section poses a number of problems related to
the characterization of entire and polynomial functions whose Hessian
determinant is a multiple of a power of the function.
