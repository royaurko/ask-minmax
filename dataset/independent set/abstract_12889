When solving data analysis problems it is important to integrate prior
knowledge and/or structural invariances. This paper contributes by a novel
framework for incorporating algebraic invariance structure into kernels. In
particular, we show that algebraic properties such as sign symmetries in data,
phase independence, scaling etc. can be included easily by essentially
performing the kernel trick twice. We demonstrate the usefulness of our theory
in simulations on selected applications such as sign-invariant spectral
clustering and underdetermined ICA.
