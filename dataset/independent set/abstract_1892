The very close environments of young stars are the hosts of fundamental
physical processes, such as planet formation, star-disk interactions, mass
accretion, and ejection. The complex morphological structure of these
environments has been confirmed by the now quite rich data sets obtained for a
few objects by near-infrared long-baseline interferometry. We gathered numerous
interferometric measurements for the young star HD163296 with various
interferometers (VLTI, IOTA, KeckI and CHARA), allowing for the first time an
image independent of any a priori model to be reconstructed. Using the
Multi-aperture image Reconstruction Algorithm (MiRA), we reconstruct images of
HD 163296 in the H and K bands. We compare these images with reconstructed
images obtained from simulated data using a physical model of the environment
of HD 163296. We obtain model-independent $H$ and $K$-band images of the
surroundings of HD 163296. The images present several significant features that
we can relate to an inclined asymmetric flared disk around HD 163296 with the
strongest intensity at about 4-5 mas. Because of the incomplete spatial
frequency coverage, we cannot state whether each of them individually is
peculiar in any way. For the first time, milli-arcsecond images of the
environment of a young star are produced. These images confirm that the
morphology of the close environment of young stars is more complex than the
simple models used in the literature so far.
