Let $X$ be a proper, geodesically complete CAT(0) space and $\Gamma$ be a
group acting properly, cocompactly, and by isometries on $X$; further assume
$X$ admits a rank one axis. Patterson's construction gives a family of finite
Borel measures, called Patterson-Sullivan measures, on $\partial X$. We use the
Patterson-Sullivan measures to construct a finite Borel measure (called the
Bowen-Margulis measure) on the space of unit-speed parametrized geodesics of
$X$ modulo the $\Gamma$-action. This measure has full support and is invariant
under the geodesic flow.
  Although the construction of Bowen-Margulis measures for rank one
nonpositively curved manifolds and for CAT(-1) spaces is well-known, the
construction for CAT(0) spaces hinges on establishing a new structural result
of independent interest about geodesically complete, cocompact rank one CAT(0)
spaces: Almost no geodesic, under the Bowen-Margulis measure, bounds a flat
strip of any positive width. We also show that almost every point in $\partial
X$, under the Patterson-Sullivan measure, is isolated in the Tits metric.
  Finally, we identify precisely which geodesically complete, cocompact rank
one CAT(0) spaces are mixing. That is, we prove that the Bowen-Margulis measure
is mixing under the geodesic flow unless $X$ is a tree with all edge lengths in
$c \mathbb Z$ for some $c > 0$. This characterization is new, even in the
setting of CAT(-1) spaces.
