Using full general relativistic calculations, we investigate the possibility
of generation of mass outflow from spherical accretion onto non-rotating black
holes. Introducing a relativistic hadronic-pressure-supported steady, standing,
spherically-symmetric shock surface around a Schwarzschild black hole as the
effective physical barrier that may be responsible for the generation of
spherical wind, we calculate the mass outflow rate $R_{\dot m}$ in terms of
three accretion parameters and one outflow parameter by simultaneously solving
the set of general relativistic hydrodynamic equations describing spherically
symmetric, transonic, polytropic accretion and wind around a Schwarzschild
black hole. Not only do we provide a sufficiently plausible estimation of
$R_{\dot m}$, we also successfully study the dependence and variation of this
rate on various physical parameters governing the flow. Our calculation
indicates that independent of initial boundary conditions, the baryonic matter
content of this shock-generated wind always correlates with post-shock flow
temperature.
