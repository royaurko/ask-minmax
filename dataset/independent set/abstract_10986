We predict a strong enhancement of multijet production in proton-nucleus
collisions at collider energies, as compared to a naive expectation of a cross
section $\propto A$. The study of the process would allow to measure, for the
first time, the double parton distribution functions in a nucleon in a model
independent way and hence to study both the longitudinal and the transverse
correlations of partons.
