We prove that the classical, non-periodic Toda lattice is super-integrable.
In other words, we show that it possesses 2N-1 independent constants of motion,
where N is the number of degrees of freedom. The main ingredient of the proof
is the use of some special action--angle coordinates introduced by Moser to
solve the equations of motion.
