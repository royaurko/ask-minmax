We show that the metric dimension of a finite projective plane of order
$q\geq 23$ is $4q-4$, and describe all resolving sets of that size. Let
$\tau_2$ denote the size of the smallest double blocking set in $\PG(2,q)$, the
Desarguesian projective plane of order $q$. We prove that for a semi-resolving
set $S$ in the incidence graph of $\PG(2,q)$, $|S|\geq \min \{2q+q/4-3,
\tau_2-2\}$ holds. In particular, if $q\geq9$ is a square, then the smallest
semi-resolving set in $\PG(2,q)$ has size $2q+2\sqrt{q}$.
