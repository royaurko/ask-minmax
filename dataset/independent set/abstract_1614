The Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope MAGIC I has recently been
extended to a stereoscopic system by adding a second 17 m telescope, MAGIC-II.
One of the major improvements of the second telescope is an improved camera.
The Camera Control Program is embedded in the telescope control software as an
independent subsystem.
  The Camera Control Program is an effective software to monitor and control
the camera values and their settings and is written in the visual programming
language LabVIEW. The two main parts, the Central Variables File, which stores
all information of the pixel and other camera parameters, and the Comm Control
Routine, which controls changes in possible settings, provide a reliable
operation. A safety routine protects the camera from misuse by accidental
commands, from bad weather conditions and from hardware errors by automatic
reactions.
