The one-loop electroweak radiative correction of the lowest order to lepton
current for deep inelastic scattering of longitudinally polarized leptons by
polarized nucleons is obtained in model independent way. The detailed numerical
analysis within kinematical requirements of future polarization collider
experiments is performed. The possibility to reduce radiative effects by
detection of hard photons is studied.
