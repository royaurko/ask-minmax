Independent component analysis (ICA) has been widely used for blind source
separation in many fields such as brain imaging analysis, signal processing and
telecommunication. Many statistical techniques based on M-estimates have been
proposed for estimating the mixing matrix. Recently, several nonparametric
methods have been developed, but in-depth analysis of asymptotic efficiency has
not been available. We analyze ICA using semiparametric theories and propose a
straightforward estimate based on the efficient score function by using
B-spline approximations. The estimate is asymptotically efficient under
moderate conditions and exhibits better performance than standard ICA methods
in a variety of simulations.
