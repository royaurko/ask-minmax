We show that the pair given by the power set and by the "Grassmannian"(set of
all subgroups) of an arbitrary group behaves very much like the pair given by a
projective space and its dual projective space. More precisely, we generalize
several results from preceding joint work with M. Kinyon (arXiv:0903.5441),
which concerned abelian groups, to the case of general non-abelian groups. Most
notably, pairs of subgroups parametrize torsor and semitorsor structures on the
power set. The r\^ole of associative algebras and -pairs from loc. cit. is now
taken by analogs of near-rings.
