We observe a universal feature in the frequency dependence of intensity
modulated photocurrent Iph based on studies of a variety of efficient
bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJ-PSCs). This feature of Iph appears
in the form of a local maximum in the 5 kHz < frequency < 10 kHz range and is
observed to be largely independent of the external parameters such as modulated
light intensity (Lac), wavelength, temperature (T), and external field (EF)
over a wide range. Simplistic kinetic models involving carrier generation,
recombination and extraction processes are used to interpret the overall
essential features of Iph and correlate it to the device parameters.
