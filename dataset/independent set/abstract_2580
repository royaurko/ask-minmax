It is argued that the CODATA recommended values of the fundamental physical
constants could not be used as the reference data in searching the hypothetical
space-time variations of the fundamental physical constants. It is shown that
the CODATA data permanently suffers a loss of self-consistency of the released
data due to unjustified over-rounding of their estimates. The simple estimates
of the critical numbers of decimal digits that should be saved in the
independently rounded correlation coefficients, the average values and
uncertainties to save the self-consistency is obtained. The set of high level
quality requirements to the computerized presentation of the numerical data on
the jointly measured or estimated physical values are formulated. It is argued
(once again) that the common standard for presentation of the numerical values
of correlated quantities in publications and sites is urgently needed.
