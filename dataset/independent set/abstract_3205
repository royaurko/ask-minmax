Motivated by recent developments on calculus in metric measure spaces
$(X,\mathsf d,\mathfrak m)$, we prove a general duality principle between
Fuglede's notion of $p$-modulus for families of finite Borel measures in
$(X,\mathsf d)$ and probability measures with barycenter in $L^q(X,\mathfrak
m)$, with $q$ dual exponent of $p\in (1,\infty)$. We apply this general duality
principle to study null sets for families of parametric and non-parametric
curves in $X$. In the final part of the paper we provide a new proof,
independent of optimal transportation, of the equivalence of notions of weak
upper gradient based on $p$-Modulus (Koskela-MacManus '98, Shanmugalingam '00)
and suitable probability measures in the space of curves (Ambrosio-Gigli-Savare
'11)
