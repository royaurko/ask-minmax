We define bileptons to be bosons coupling to a pair of leptons and construct
the most general dimension four lagrangian involving scalar and vector
bileptons. We concentrate on fields with lepton number 2, and derive model
independent bounds on their masses and couplings from low-energy data. In
addition, we study their signals in high energy experiments and forecast the
discovery potential of future colliders.
