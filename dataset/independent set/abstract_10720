In $D$-dimentional gravity on arbitrary curved backgrounds using proven
methods conserved currents, divergences of antisymmetrical tensor densities
(superpotentials), are constructed. These superpotentials have two remarkable
properties: they depend in an essential way on second derivatives in the
Lagrangian and are independent on divergences added to it. The conserved
currents are thus particulary well adapted to the case of perturbations in
Gauss-Bonett cosmological brane theories.
