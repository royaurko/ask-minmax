We present the first results from a Bayesian analysis of the WMAP first year
data using a Gibbs sampling technique. Using two independent, parallel
supercomputer codes we analyze the WMAP Q, V and W bands. The analysis results
in a full probabilistic description of the information the WMAP data set
contains about the power spectrum and the all-sky map of the cosmic microwave
background anisotropies. We present the complete probability distributions for
each C_l including any non-Gaussianities of the power spectrum likelihood.
While we find good overall agreement with the previously published WMAP
spectrum, our analysis uncovers discrepancies in the power spectrum estimates
at low l multipoles. For example we claim the best-fit Lambda-CDM model is
consistent with the C_2 inferred from our combined Q+V+W analysis with a 10%
probability of an even larger theoretical C_2. Based on our exact analysis we
can therefore attribute the "low quadrupole issue" to a statistical
fluctuation.
