In this article, we investigate the boundary of the escaping set I(f) for
quasiregular mappings on R^n, both in the uniformly quasiregular case and in
the polynomial type case. The aim is to show that the boundary of I(f) is the
Julia set J(f) when the latter is defined, and shares properties with the Julia
set when J(f) is not defined.
