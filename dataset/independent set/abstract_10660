The article deals with a kind of recursive function templates in C++, where
the recursion is realized corresponding template parameters to achieve better
computational performance. Some specialization of these template functions ends
the recursion and can be implemented using optimized hardware dependent or
independent routines. The method is applied in addition to the known expression
templates technique to solve linear algebra expressions with the help of the
BLAS library. The whole implementation produces a new library, which keeps
object-oriented benefits and has a higher computational speed represented in
the tests.
