We prove upper bounds on the rate, called "mixing rate", at which the von
Neumann entropy of the expected density operator of a given ensemble of states
changes under non-local unitary evolution. For an ensemble consisting of two
states, with probabilities of p and 1-p, we prove that the mixing rate is
bounded above by 4\sqrt{p(1-p)} for any Hamiltonian of norm 1. For a general
ensemble of states with probabilities distributed according to a random
variable X and individually evolving according to any set of bounded
Hamiltonians, we conjecture that the mixing rate is bounded above by a Shannon
entropy of a random variable X. For this general case we prove an upper bound
that is independent of the dimension of the Hilbert space on which states in
the ensemble act.
