In this paper, we give a detailed user's guide to the AMIDAS (A
Model-Independent Data Analysis System) package and website, which is developed
for online simulations and data analyses for direct Dark Matter detection
experiments and phenomenology. Recently, the whole AMIDAS package and website
system has been upgraded to the second phase: AMIDAS-II, for including the new
developed Bayesian analysis technique.
  AMIDAS has the ability to do full Monte Carlo simulations as well as to
analyze real/pseudo data sets either generated by another event generating
programs or recorded in direct DM detection experiments. Moreover, the
AMIDAS-II package can include several "user-defined" functions into the main
code: the (fitting) one-dimensional WIMP velocity distribution function, the
nuclear form factors for spin-independent and spin-dependent cross sections,
artificial/experimental background spectrum for both of simulation and data
analysis procedures, as well as different distribution functions needed in
Bayesian analyses.
