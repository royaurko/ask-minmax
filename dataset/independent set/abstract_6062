Motivated by recent work of Masser and Zannier on simultaneous torsion on the
Legendre elliptic curve $E_\lambda$ of equation $Y^2=X(X-1)(X-\lambda)$, we
prove that, given $n$ linearly independent points $P_1(\lambda),
...,P_n(\lambda)$ on $E_\lambda$ with coordinates in
$\bar{\mathbb{Q}(\lambda)}$, there are at most finitely many complex numbers
$\lambda_0$ such that the points $P_1(\lambda_0), ...,P_n(\lambda_0)$ satisfy
two independent relations on $E_{\lambda_0}$. This is a special case of
conjectures about Unlikely Intersections on families of abelian varieties.
