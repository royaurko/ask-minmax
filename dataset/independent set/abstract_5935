A star of n (n greater than or equal to 2) line segments (needles) of equal
length with common endpoint and constant angular spacing is randomly placed
onto a lattice which is the union of two families of equidistant lines in the
plane with angle alpha between the nonparallel lines. For odd n, we calculate
the probabilities of exactly i intersections between the star and the lattice
(for even n, see [3]). Using a geometrical method, we derive the limit
distribution function of the relative number of intersections as n tends to
infinity. This function is independent of alpha. We show that the relative
numbers for each of the two families are asymptotically independent random
variables.
