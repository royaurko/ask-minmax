We provide a simple physical picture which suggests that the asymptotic
dynamics of inelastic gases in one dimension is independent of the degree of
inelasticity. Statistical characteristics, including velocity fluctuations and
the velocity distribution are identical to those of a perfectly inelastic
sticky gas, which in turn is described by the inviscid Burgers equation.
Asymptotic predictions of this continuum theory, including the t^{-2/3}
temperature decay and the development of discontinuities in the velocity
profile, are verified numerically for inelastic gases.
