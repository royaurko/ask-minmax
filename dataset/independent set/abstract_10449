We describe the multiresolution wavelet analysis of blood pressure waves in
vasovagal syncope-affected patients compared with those in healthy people,
using Haar and Gaussian bases. A comparison between scale-dependent and
scale-independent measures discriminating the two classes of subjects is made.
What emerges is a sort of equivalence between these two methodological
approaches, that is, both methods reach the same statistical significance of
separation between the two classes.
