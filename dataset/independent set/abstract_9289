A fundamental criterion of viability of any gravity theory is existence of a
stable ground-state solution being either Minkowski, dS or AdS space. Stability
of the ground state is independent of which frame is physical. In general, a
given theory has multiple ground states and splits into independent physical
sectors. All metric gravity theories with the Lagrangian being a function of
Ricci tensor are dynamically equivalent to Einstein gravity with a source and
this allows us to study the stability problem using methods developed in GR. We
apply these methods to f(R) theories. As is shown in 13 cases of Lagrangians
the stability criterion works simply and effectively whenever the curvature of
the ground state is determined. An infinite number of gravity theories have a
stable ground state and further viability criteria are necessary.
