Analytical expressions are derived for sums of matrix elements and their
squared moduli over many-body states with given total spin --- the states built
from spin and spatial wavefunctions belonging to multidimensional irreducible
representations of the symmetric group, unless the total spin has the maximal
allowed value. For spin-dependent one-body interactions with external fields
and spin-independent two-body ones between the particles, the sum dependence on
the many-body states is given by universal factors, which are independent of
the interaction details and Hamiltonians of non-interacting particles. The sum
rules are applied to perturbative analysis of energy spectra.
