It is pointed out that the omission of the effects of the transition between
quarkonia or the assumption that the transition between quarkonia is
flavor-independent would result in the inconsistent results for the
pseudoscalar meson nonet. It is emphasized that the mass relation of the
non-ideal mixing meson nonets should incorporate the effects of the
flavor-dependent transition between quarkonia. The new mass relations of a
meson nonet are presented.
