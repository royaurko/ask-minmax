The coloured Tverberg theorem was conjectured by B\'ar\'any, Lov\'{a}sz and
F\"uredi and asks whether for any d+1 sets (considered as colour classes) of k
points each in R^d there is a partition of them into k colourful sets whose
convex hulls intersect. This is known when d=1,2 or k+1 is prime. In this paper
we show that (k-1)d+1 colour classes are necessary and sufficient if the
coefficients in the convex combination in the colourful sets are required to be
the same in each class. We also examine what happens if we want the convex
hulls of the colourful sets to intersect even if we remove any r of the colour
classes. Namely, if we have (r+1)(k-1)d+1 colour classes of k point each, there
is a partition of them into k colourful sets such that they intersect using the
same coefficients regardless of which r colour classes are removed. We also
investigate the relation of the case k=2 and the Gale transform, obtaining a
variation of the coloured Radon theorem.
