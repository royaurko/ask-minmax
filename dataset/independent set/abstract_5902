Iterated hash functions process strings recursively, one character at a time.
At each iteration, they compute a new hash value from the preceding hash value
and the next character. We prove that iterated hashing can be pairwise
independent, but never 3-wise independent. We show that it can be almost
universal over strings much longer than the number of hash values; we bound the
maximal string length given the collision probability.
