Generically, universal extra dimension (UED) extensions of the standard model
predict the stability of the lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) particle and hence
provide a dark matter candidate. For UED scenarios with one extra dimension, we
model-independently determine the size of the induced dimension-five magnetic
dipole moment of the KK-neutrino, $\nu^{(1)}$. We show that current
observational bounds on the interactions of dipole dark matter place
constraints on UED models with KK-neutrino dark matter.
