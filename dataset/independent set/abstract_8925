Let $(S,H)$ be a generalized Fermat curve of the type $(k,n)$ and let
$F\subset S$ be the set of the fixed point by $H$. In this article we will show
that $F$ is exactly the set of hyperosculating points of the standard embedding
of $S$, and we will give an lower bound (non trivial) for the Weierstrass
weight of these points.
