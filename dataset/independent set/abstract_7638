We present a procedure that determines the law of a random walk in an iid
random environment as a function of a single "typical" trajectory. We indicate
when the trajectory characterizes the law of the environment, and we say how
this law can be determined. We then show how independent trajectories having
the distribution of the original walk can be generated as functions of the
single observed trajectory.
