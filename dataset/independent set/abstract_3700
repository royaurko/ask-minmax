The results from weak gravitational lensing analyses are subject to a cosmic
variance error term that has previously been estimated assuming Gaussian
statistics. In this letter we address the issue of estimating cosmic variance
errors for weak lensing surveys in the non-Gaussian regime. Using standard cold
dark matter model ray-tracing simulations characterized by Omega_m=0.3,
Omega_Lambda=0.7, h=0.7, sigma_8=1.0 for different survey redshifts z_s, we
determine the variance of the two-point shear correlation function measured
across 64 independent lines of sight. We compare the measured variance to the
variance expected from a random Gaussian field and derive a redshift-dependent
non-Gaussian calibration relation. We find that the ratio can be as high as ~30
for a survey with source redshift z_s ~ 0.5 and ~10 for z_s ~ 1. The transition
scale theta_c above which the ratio is consistent with unity, is found to be
theta_c ~ 20 arcmin for z_s ~ 0.5 and theta_c ~ 10 arcmin for z_s ~ 1. We
provide fitting formula to our results permitting the estimation of
non-Gaussian cosmic variance errors for any weak lensing analysis, and discuss
the impact on current and future surveys. A more extensive set of simulations
will however be required to investigate the dependence of our results on
cosmology, specifically on the amplitude of clustering.
