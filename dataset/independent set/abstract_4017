To understand the frequency, and thus the formation and evolution, of
planetary systems like our own solar system, it is critical to detect
Jupiter-like planets in Jupiter-like orbits. For long-term radial-velocity
monitoring, it is useful to estimate the observational effort required to
reliably detect such objects, particularly in light of severe competition for
limited telescope time. We perform detailed simulations of observational
campaigns, maximizing the realism of the sampling of a set of simulated
observations. We then compute the detection limits for each campaign to
quantify the effect of increasing the number of observational epochs and
varying their time coverage. We show that once there is sufficient time
baseline to detect a given orbital period, it becomes less effective to add
further time coverage -- rather, the detectability of a planet scales roughly
as the square root of the number of observations, independently of the number
of orbital cycles included in the data string. We also show that no noise floor
is reached, with a continuing improvement in detectability at the maximum
number of observations N=500 tested here.
