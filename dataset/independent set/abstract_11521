In many professons employees are rewarded according to their relative
performance. Corresponding economy can be modeled by taking $N$ independent
agents who gain from the market with a rate which depends on their current
gain. We argue that this simple realistic rate generates a scale free
distribution even though intrinsic ability of agents are marginally different
from each other. As an evidence we provide distribution of scores for two
different systems (a) the global stock game where players invest in real stock
market and (b) the international cricket.
