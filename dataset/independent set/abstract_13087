We begin by giving an example of a smoothly bounded convex domain that has
complex geodesics that do not extend continuously up to $\partial\mathbb{D}$.
This example suggests that continuity at the boundary of the complex geodesics
of a convex domain $\Omega\Subset \mathbb{C}^n$, $n\geq 2$, is affected by the
extent to which $\partial\Omega$ curves or bends at each boundary point. We
provide a sufficient condition to this effect (on $\mathcal{C}^1$-smoothly
bounded convex domains), which admits domains having boundary points at which
the boundary is infinitely flat. Along the way, we establish a
Hardy--Littlewood-type lemma that might be of independent interest.
