We study unstable epitaxy on singular surfaces using continuum equations with
a prescribed slope-dependent surface current. We derive scaling relations for
the late stage of growth, where power law coarsening of the mound morphology is
observed. For the lateral size of mounds we obtain $\xi \sim t^{1/z}$ with $z
\geq 4$. An analytic treatment within a self-consistent mean-field
approximation predicts multiscaling of the height-height correlation function,
while the direct numerical solution of the continuum equation shows
conventional scaling with z=4, independent of the shape of the surface current.
