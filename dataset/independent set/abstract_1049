In this Letter we give a method for constructing sets of simple circuits that
can determine the spectrum of a partially transposed density matrix, without
requiring either a tomographically complete POVM or the addition of noise to
make the spectrum non-negative. These circuits depend only on the dimension of
the Hilbert space and are otherwise independent of the state.
