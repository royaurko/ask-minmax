In a previous paper we reported the discovery of super-leading logarithmic
terms in a non-global QCD observable. In this short update we recalculate the
first super-leading logarithmic contribution to the 'gaps between jets'
cross-section using a colour basis independent notation. This sheds light on
the structure and origin of the super-leading terms and allows them to be
calculated for gluon scattering processes for the first time.
