We study the transverse momentum dependent factorization for single spin
asymmetries in Drell-Yan and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering processes
at one-loop order. The next-to-leading order hard factors are calculated in the
Ji-Ma-Yuan factorization scheme. We further derive the QCD resummation
formalisms for these observables following the Collins-Soper-Sterman method.
The results are expressed in terms of the collinear correlation functions from
initial and/or final state hadrons coupled with the Sudakov form factor
containing all order soft-gluon resummation effects. The scheme independent
coefficients are calculated up to one-loop order.
