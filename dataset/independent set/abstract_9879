In this paper we study various fractal geometric aspects of the Minkowski
question mark function $Q.$ We show that the unit interval can be written as
the union of the three sets $\Lambda_{0}:=\{x:Q'(x)=0\}$,
$\Lambda_{\infty}:=\{x:Q'(x)=\infty\}$, and $\Lambda_{\sim}:=\{x:Q'(x)$ does
not exist and $Q'(x)\not=\infty\}.$ The main result is that the Hausdorff
dimensions of these sets are related in the following way.
$\dim_{H}(\nu_{F})<\dim_{H}(\Lambda_{\sim})= \dim_{H} (\Lambda_{\infty}) =
\dim_{H} (\mathcal{L}(h_{\mathrm{top}}))<\dim_{H}(\Lambda_{0})=1.$
  Here, $\mathcal{L}(h_{\mathrm{top}})$ refers to the level set of the
  Stern-Brocot multifractal decomposition at the topological entropy
  $h_{\mathrm{top}}=\log2$ of the Farey map $F,$ and $\dim_{H}(\nu_{F})$
denotes the Hausdorff dimension of the measure of maximal entropy of the
dynamical system associated with $F.$ The proofs rely partially on the
multifractal formalism for Stern-Brocot intervals and give non-trivial
applications of this formalism.
