In 1962, Dyson introduced dynamics in random matrix models, in particular
into GUE (also for beta=1 and 4), by letting the entries evolve according to
independent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. Dyson shows the spectral points of
the matrix evolve according to non-intersecting Brownian motions. The present
paper shows that the interlacing spectra of two consecutive principal minors
form a Markov process (diffusion) as well. This diffusion consists of two sets
of Dyson non-intersecting Brownian motions, with a specific interaction
respecting the interlacing. This is revealed in the form of the generator, the
transition probability and the invariant measure, which are provided here; this
is done in all cases: beta=1,~2,~4. It is also shown that the spectra of three
consecutive minors ceases to be Markovian for \beta=2,~4.
