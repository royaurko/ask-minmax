Motivated by the study of dependent random variables by coupling with
independent blocks of variables, we obtain first sufficient conditions for the
moderate deviation principle in its functional form for triangular arrays of
independent random variables. Under some regularity assumptions our conditions
are also necessary in the stationary case. The results are then applied to
derive moderate deviation principles for linear processes, kernel estimators of
a density and some classes of dependent random variables.
