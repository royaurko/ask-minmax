We show how to price and replicate a variety of barrier-style claims written
on the $\log$ price $X$ and quadratic variation $\<X\>$ of a risky asset. Our
framework assumes no arbitrage, frictionless markets and zero interest rates.
We model the risky asset as a strictly positive continuous semimartingale with
an independent volatility process. The volatility process may exhibit jumps and
may be non-Markovian. As hedging instruments, we use only the underlying risky
asset, a zero-coupon bond, and European calls and puts with the same maturity
as the barrier-style claim. We consider both single-barrier and double barrier
claims in three varieties: knock-in, knock-out and rebate.
