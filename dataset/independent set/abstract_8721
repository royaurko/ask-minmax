The Birman-Wenzl-Murakami algebra, considered as the quotient of the braid
group algebra, possesses the commutative set of Jucys--Murphy elements. We show
that the set of Jucys--Murphy elements is maximal commutative for the generic
Birman-Wenzl-Murakami algebra and reconstruct the representation theory of the
tower of Birman-Wenzl-Murakami algebras.
