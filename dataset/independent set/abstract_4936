Given any two rational numbers $r_1$ and $r_2$, a necessary and sufficient
condition is established for the three numbers $1$, $\cos (\pi r_1)$, and $\cos
(\pi r_2)$ to be rationally independent. Extending a classical fact sometimes
attributed to I. Niven, the result even yields linear independence over larger
number fields. The tools employed in the proof are applicable also in the case
of more than two trigonometric numbers. As an application, a complete
classification is given of all planar triangles with rational angles and side
lengths each containing at most one square root. Such a classification was
hitherto known only in the special case of right triangles.
