In Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 101802 (2002); erratum, ibid. 89, 229902(E) (2002),
Bernabeu, Papavassiliou, and Vidal claim that they can extract a
gauge-independent neutrino charge radius (NCR) which is, therefore, a physical
observable. We show here that this claim is incorrect by demonstrating that the
NCR is, in general, gauge-dependent.
