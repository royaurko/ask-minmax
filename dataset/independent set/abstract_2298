Recent studies indicate that the weakly coupled spin-1/2 Heisenberg
antiferromagnet with next nearest neighbor frustration supports massive spinons
when suitably tuned. The straightforward SU(N) generalization of the low energy
ladder Hamiltonian yields two independent SU(N) Thirring models with N-1
multiplets of massive ``spinon'' excitations. We study the evolution of the
complete set of low-energy dynamical structure factors using form factors.
Those corresponding to the smooth (staggered) magnetizations are qualitatively
different (the same) in the N=2 and N>2 cases. The absence of single-particle
peaks preserves the notion of spinons stabilized by frustration. In contrast to
the ladder, we note that the N=infinity limit of the four chain magnet is not a
trivial free theory.
