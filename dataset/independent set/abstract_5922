We present two-sided estimates of moments and tails of polynomial chaoses of
order at most three generated by independent symmetric random variables with
log-concave tails as well as for chaoses of arbitrary order generated by
independent symmetric exponential variables. The estimates involve only
deterministic quantities and are optimal up to constants depending only on the
order of the chaos variable.
