The two-body momentum distribution n2(p1,p2) of nuclei is studied. First, a
compact analytical expression is derived for Z=N l-closed nuclei, within the
context of the independent-particle shell model. Application to the light
closed-shell nucleus 16O is included and discussed. Next, the effect of
dynamical, short-range correlations is investigated in the case of 4He, by
including Jastrow-type correlations in the formalism. The effect is significant
for large values of p1 and p2 and for angles between the vectors p1 and p2
close to 180 deg. and 0.
