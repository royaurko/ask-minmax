I study the weak basis CP-violating invariants in supersymmetric models, in
particular those which cannot be expressed in terms of the Jarlskog--type
invariants, and find basis--independent conditions for CP conservation. With an
example of the K-anti-K mixing, I clarify what are the combinations of
supersymmetric parameters which are constrained by experiment.
