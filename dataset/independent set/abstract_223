A set A is a Sidon set in an additive group G if every element of G can be
written at most one way as sum of two elements of A. A particular case of
two-dimensional Sidon sets are the sonar sequences, which are two-dimensional
synchronization patterns. The main known constructions of sonar sequences are
reminiscent of Costas arrays constructions (Welch and Golomb). Other
constructions are Quadratic and Shift. In this work we present new
constructions of sonar sequences, independent of the named above, using
one-dimensional Sidon sets.
