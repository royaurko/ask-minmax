In arXiv:0710.5653v1 M. Znojil claims that he has found and corrected an
error in my paper: [Phys. Lett. B \textbf{650}, 208 (2007), arXiv:0706.1872v2]
and that it is possible to escape its main conclusion, namely that the
unitarity of the time-evolution and observability of the Hamiltonian imply
time-independence of the metric operator. In this note I give a very short
calculation showing that the analysis given by M. Znojil also leads to the same
conclusion as of my above-mentioned paper. This is actually a reconfirmation of
the validity of the results of the latter paper.
