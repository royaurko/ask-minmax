A dyadic tile of order n is any rectangle obtained from the unit square by n
successive bisections by horizontal or vertical cuts. Let each dyadic tile of
order n be available with probability p, independently of the others. We prove
that for p sufficiently close to 1, there exists a set of pairwise disjoint
available tiles whose union is the unit square, with probability tending to 1
as n->infinity, as conjectured by Joel Spencer in 1999. In particular we prove
that if p=7/8, such a tiling exists with probability at least 1-(3/4)^n. The
proof involves a surprisingly delicate counting argument for sets of
unavailable tiles that prevent tiling.
