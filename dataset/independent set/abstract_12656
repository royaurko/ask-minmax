We present a field theoretic model for friction, where the friction
coefficient between two surfaces may be calculated based on elastic properties
of the surfaces. We assume that the geometry of contact surface is not unusual.
We verify Amonton's laws to hold that friction force is proportional to the
normal load.This model gives the opportunity to calculate the static
coefficient of friction for a few cases, and show that it is in agreement with
observed values. Furthermore we show that the coefficient of static friction is
independent of apparent surface area in first approximation.
