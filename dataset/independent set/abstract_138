A graph G is well-covered if all its maximal independent sets are of the same
cardinality. Assume that a weight function w is defined on its vertices. Then G
is w-well-covered if all maximal independent sets are of the same weight. For
every graph G, the set of weight functions w such that G is w-well-covered is a
vector space. Given an input graph G without cycles of length 4, 5, and 6, we
characterize polynomially the vector space of weight functions w for which G is
w-well-covered. Let B be an induced complete bipartite subgraph of G on vertex
sets of bipartition B_{X} and B_{Y}. Assume that there exists an independent
set S such that both the union of S and B_{X} and the union of S and B_{Y} are
maximal independent sets of G. Then B is a generating subgraph of G, and it
produces the restriction w(B_{X})=w(B_{Y}). It is known that for every weight
function w, if G is w-well-covered, then the above restriction is satisfied. In
the special case, where B_{X}={x} and B_{Y}={y}, we say that xy is a relating
edge. Recognizing relating edges and generating subgraphs is an NP-complete
problem. However, we provide a polynomial algorithm for recognizing generating
subgraphs of an input graph without cycles of length 5, 6 and 7. We also
present a polynomial algorithm for recognizing relating edges in an input graph
without cycles of length 5 and 6.
