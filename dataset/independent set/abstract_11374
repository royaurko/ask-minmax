We obtain exact analytical expressions for correlations between real zeros of
the Kac random polynomial. We show that the zeros in the interval $(-1,1)$ are
asymptotically independent of the zeros outside of this interval, and that the
straightened zeros have the same limit translation invariant correlations. Then
we calculate the correlations between the straightened zeros of the SO(2)
random polynomial.
