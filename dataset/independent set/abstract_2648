We present various supergravity black holes of different dimensions with some
U(1) charges set equal in a simple, common form. Black hole solutions of seven
dimensional U(1)^2 gauged supergravity with three independent angular momenta
and two equal U(1) charges are obtained. We investigate the thermodynamics and
the BPS limit of this solution, and find that there are rotating supersymmetric
black holes without naked closed timelike curves. There are also supersymmetric
topological soliton solutions without naked closed timelike curves that have a
smooth geometry.
