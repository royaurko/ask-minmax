Within a general operational framework I show that a-causality at a distance
of "local actions" (the so-called "no-signaling") is a direct consequence of
commutativity of local transformations, i.e. of dynamical independence. On the
other hand, the tensor product of Quantum Mechanics is not just a consequence
of such dynamical independence, but needs in addition the Local Observability
Principle.
