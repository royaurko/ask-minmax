Matrix elements of a two-body interaction between states of the jn
configutation (n identical nucleons in the j-orbit) are functions of two-body
energies. In some cases, diagonal matrix elements are linear combinations of
two-body energies. The coefficients of these linear combinations are rational
and non-negative numbers, independent of the two-body interaction. It is shown
that if in the jn configuration there is only one state with given spin J, its
eigenvalue (the diagonal matrix element) is equal to a linear combination of
two-body energies with rational and non-negative coefficients. These
coefficients have the same values for any two-body interaction (solvable
eigenvalues). If there are several J-states in the jn configuration, they
define a sub-matrix of the interaction which should be diagonalized to yield
eigenvalues and eigenstates. Bases of these states are constructed from which
the sub-matrix characterized by J may be obtained for any two-body interaction.
The diagonal elements are linear combinations of two-body energies whose
coefficients are independent of the two-body interaction and the non-vanishing
ones are rational and positive. Aslo in the non-diagonal elements the
coefficients have a simple form. States in the seniority scheme are shown to
form such bases. If one of them is an eigenstate of any two-body interaciton
its eigenvalue is shown to be solvable.
