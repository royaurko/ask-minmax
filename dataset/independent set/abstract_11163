A novel BRST quantization is described, which is applied in generalizing the
Jackiw-Nair construction of anyon. We have explicitly shown that the matter
states connected to an unconventional ("non-zero") BRST ghost sector are
physical. They are identified to the Jackiw-Nair system in a particular gauge.
Also for the first time an indepth analysis of the present kind for a reducible
constraint system, ( where the constraints are not independent), has been
performed.
