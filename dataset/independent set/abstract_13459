One of the outstanding problems in all of space science is uncovering how the
solar corona is heated to temperatures greater than 1 MK. Though studied for
decades, one of the major difficulties in solving this problem has been
unraveling the line-of-sight (LOS) effects in the observations. The corona is
optically thin, so a single pixel measures counts from an indeterminate number
(perhaps tens of thousands) of independently heated flux tubes, all along that
pixel's LOS. In this paper we model the emission in individual pixels imaging
the active region corona in the Extreme Ultraviolet. If LOS effects are not
properly taken into account, erroneous conclusions regarding both coronal
heating and coronal dynamics may be reached. We model the corona as a LOS
integration of many thousands of completely independently heated flux tubes. We
demonstrate that despite the superposition of randomly heated flux tubes,
nanoflares leave distinct signatures in light curves observed with
multi-wavelength and high time cadence data, such as those data taken with the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. These
signatures are readily detected with the time-lag analysis technique of Viall &
Klimchuk (2012). Steady coronal heating leaves a different and equally distinct
signature that is also revealed by the technique.
