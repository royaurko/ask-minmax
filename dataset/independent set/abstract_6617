We give necessary and sufficient conditions on a non-oscillatory curve in an
o-minimal field such that, for any bounded definable function, the germ of the
function on an initial segment of the curve can be continuously extended to a
closed definable set. This situation is translated into a question about types:
What are the conditions on an $n$-type such that, for any bounded definable
function, there is a definable set containing the type on which the function is
continuous, and can be extended continuously to the set's closure? All such
types are definable, and we give the precise conditions that are equivalent to
existence of a desired definable set.
