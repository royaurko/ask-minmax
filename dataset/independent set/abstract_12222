We study the rigidity of holomorphic mappings from a neighborhood of a
Levi-nondegenerate CR hypersurface $M$ with signature $l$ into a hyperquadric
$Q_{l'}^{N} \subseteq \mathbb{CP}^{N+1}$ of larger dimension and signature. We
show that if the CR complexity of $M$ is not too large then the image of $M$
under any such mapping is contained in a complex plane with dimension
independent of $N$. This result follows from two theorems, the first
demonstrating that for sufficiently degenerate mappings, the image of $M$ is
contained in a plane, and the second relating the degeneracy of mappings into
different quadrics.
