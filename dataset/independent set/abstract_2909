This paper is concerned with the investigation of the controllability and
observability of Caputo fractional differential linear systems of any real
order {\alpha} . Expressions for the expansions of the evolution operators in
powers of the matrix of dynamics are first obtained. Sets of linearly
independent continuous functions or matrix functions, which are also Chebyshev
systems, appear in such expansions in a natural way. Based on the properties of
such functions, the controllability and observability of the Caputo fractional
differential system of real order {\alpha} are discussed as related to their
counterpart properties in the corresponding standard system defined for
{\alpha} = 1. Extensions are given to the fulfilment of those properties under
non- uniform sampling. It is proved that the choice of the appropriate sampling
instants ion not restrictive as a result of the properties of the associate
Chebyshev systems
