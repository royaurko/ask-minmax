This Letter describes a model-independent search for production of new
resonant states in photon-jet events in 2.11 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions
at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV. We compare the photon-jet mass distribution to a
data-driven background estimate and find consistency with the background
hypothesis. Given the lack of evidence for a signal, we set 95% CL limits on
generic Gaussian-shape signals and on a benchmark excited-quark (q*) model,
excluding 2 TeV Gaussian resonances with cross section times branching ratio
times acceptance times efficiency near 5 fb and excluding q* masses below 2.46
TeV, respectively.
