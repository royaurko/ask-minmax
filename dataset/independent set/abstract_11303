In this paper, we present a reduction algorithm which transforms $m$-regular
partitions of $[n]=\{1, 2, ..., n\}$ to $(m-1)$-regular partitions of $[n-1]$.
We show that this algorithm preserves the noncrossing property. This yields a
simple explanation of an identity due to Simion-Ullman and Klazar in connection
with enumeration problems on noncrossing partitions and RNA secondary
structures. For ordinary noncrossing partitions, the reduction algorithm leads
to a representation of noncrossing partitions in terms of independent arcs and
loops, as well as an identity of Simion and Ullman which expresses the Narayana
numbers in terms of the Catalan numbers.
