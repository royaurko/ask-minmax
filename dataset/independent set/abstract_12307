We present a method for the propagation of partially coherent radiation using
coherent mode decomposition and wavefront propagation. The radiation field is
decomposed into a sum of independent coherent modes. Each mode is then
propagated separately using conventional wavefront propagation techniques. The
summation of these modes in the plane of observation gives the coherence
properties of the propagated radiation. As an example, we analyze propagation
of partially coherent radiation transmitted through a single circular aperture.
