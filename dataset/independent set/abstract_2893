We present the Fundamental Plane (FP) of field early-type galaxies at
0.5<z<1.0. Our project is a continuation of our efforts to understand the
formation and evolution of early-type galaxies in different environments. The
target galaxies were selected from the comprehensive and homogeneous data set
of the Gemini/HST Galaxy Cluster Project. The distant field early-type galaxies
follow a steeper FP relation compared to the local FP. The change in the slope
of the FP can be interpreted as a mass-dependent evolution. Similar results
have been found for cluster early-type galaxies in high redshift galaxy
clusters at 0.8<z<1. Therefore, the slope change of the FP appears to be
independent of the environment of the galaxies.
