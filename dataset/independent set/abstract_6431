Li-Vogelius and Li-Nirenberg gave a gradient estimate for solutions of
strongly elliptic equations and systems of divergence forms with piecewise
smooth coefficients, respectively. The discontinuities of the coefficients are
assumed to be given by manifolds of codimension 1, which we called them
manifolds of discontinuities. Their gradient estimate is independent of the
distances between manifolds of discontinuities. In this paper, we gave a
parabolic version of their results. That is, we gave a gradient estimate for
parabolic equations of divergence forms with piecewise smooth coefficients. The
coefficients are assumed to be independent of time and their discontinuities
are likewise the previous elliptic equations. As an application of this
estimate, we also gave a pointwise gradient estimate for the fundamental
solution of a parabolic operator with piecewise smooth coefficients. The both
gradient estimates are independent of the distances between manifolds of
discontinuities.
