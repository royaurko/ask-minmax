We consider the problem of characterisation of burst sources detected with
the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) using the multi-modal nested
sampling algorithm, MultiNest. We use MultiNest as a tool to search for
modelled bursts from cosmic string cusps, and compute the Bayesian evidence
associated with the cosmic string model. As an alternative burst model, we
consider sine-Gaussian burst signals, and show how the evidence ratio can be
used to choose between these two alternatives. We present results from an
application of MultiNest to the last round of the Mock LISA Data Challenge, in
which we were able to successfully detect and characterise all three of the
cosmic string burst sources present in the release data set. We also present
results of independent trials and show that MultiNest can detect cosmic string
signals with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as low as ~7 and sine-Gaussian signals
with SNR as low as ~8. In both cases, we show that the threshold at which the
sources become detectable coincides with the SNR at which the evidence ratio
begins to favour the correct model over the alternative.
