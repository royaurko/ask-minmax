In this article, the contributors prove an upper bound for the wave front set of
an induced Lie group representation under a uniformity condition, which is
verified for several large classes of examples. As a corollary, if $X$ is a
homogeneous space for a real, reductive algebraic group $G$ with a nonzero
invariant density, the contributors give a complete description of the regular,
semisimple asymptotics of the support of the Plancherel measure for $L^2(X)$.
