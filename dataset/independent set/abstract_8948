We consider the Hurwitz action on quasipositive factorizations of a 3-braid.
In a previous paper, for any given 3-braid we described a certain finite set
which contains at least one representative of each orbit. Here we give an
algorithm to decide if two elements of this finite set belong to the same
orbit.
