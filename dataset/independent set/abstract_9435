We explore the relationship between possibility measures (supremum preserving
normed measures) and p-boxes (pairs of cumulative distribution functions) on
totally preordered spaces, extending earlier work in this direction by De
Cooman and Aeyels, among others. We start by demonstrating that only those
p-boxes who have 0-1-valued lower or upper cumulative distribution function can
be possibility measures, and we derive expressions for their natural extension
in this case. Next, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for a
p-box to be a possibility measure. Finally, we show that almost every
possibility measure can be modelled by a p-box. Whence, any techniques for
p-boxes can be readily applied to possibility measures. We demonstrate this by
deriving joint possibility measures from marginals, under varying assumptions
of independence, using a technique known for p-boxes. Doing so, we arrive at a
new rule of combination for possibility measures, for the independent case.
