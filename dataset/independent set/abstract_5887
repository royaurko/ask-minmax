We study the multiplicative convolution for c-monotone independence. This
convolution unifies the monotone, Boolean and orthogonal multiplicative
convolutions. We characterize convolution semigroups for the c-monotone
multiplicative convolution on the unit circle. We also prove that an infinitely
divisible distribution can always be embedded in a convolution semigroup. We
furthermore discuss the (non)-uniqueness of such embeddings including the
monotone case. Finally connections to the multiplicative Boolean convolution
are discussed.
