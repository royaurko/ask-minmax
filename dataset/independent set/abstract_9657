For h=3 or 4, Egyptian decompositions into h unit fractions, like 2/D = 1/D1
+ ... +1/Dh, were given by using (h-1) divisors (di) of D1. This ancient modus
operandi, well recognized today, provides Di=DD1/di for i greater than 1.
Decompositions selected (depending on di) have generally been studied by modern
researchers through the intrinsic features of di itself. An unconventional
method is presented here without considering the di properties but just the
differences d(h-1)-dh. In contrast to widespread ideas about the last
denominator like 'Dh smaller than 1000', it is more appropriate to adopt a
global boundary of the form 'Dh smaller or equal to 10D', where 10 comes from
the Egyptian decimal system. Singular case 2/53 (with 15 instead of 10) is
explained. The number of preliminary alternatives before the final decisions is
found tobe so low (71) for h=3 or 4 that a detailed overview is possible. A
simple additive method of trials, independent of any context, can be carried
out, namely 2n+1= d2+ ... + dh. Clearly the decisions fit with a minimal value
of the differences d(h-1)-dh, independently of any di values.
