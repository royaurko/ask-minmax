In the framework of QCD sum rules one uses a scheme, allowing one to apply
the conditions of both nonrelativistic heavy quark motion inside mesons and
independence of nonsplitting nS-state density on the heavy quark flavours. In
the leading order an analitic expression is derived for leptonic constants of
both heavy quarkonia and heavy mesons with a single heavy quark. The expression
allows one explicitly to determine scaling properties of the constants.
