We show that a set with an action of a locally finite-dimensional free
partially commutative monoid and the corresponding semicubical set have
isomorpic homology groups. We build a complex of finite length for the
computing homology groups of any asynchronous transition system with finite
maximal number of mutually independent events. We give examples of computing
the homology groups.
