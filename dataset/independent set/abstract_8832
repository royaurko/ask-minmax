In this brief note we prove that there is a residual subset $\mathcal{R}$ of
$\textrm{Diff}^1(M)$ such that for any $f\in\mathcal{R}$ and any partially
hyperbolic homoclinic class $H(p,f)$ with one dimensional center direction, the
set of central Lyapunov exponents associated to the ergodic with full support
is an interval. Also, some remarks on the general case presented.
