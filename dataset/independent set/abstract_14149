In this paper, the definition of fuzzy rough relation on a set will be
introduced and then it would be proved that the collection of such relations is
closed under different binary compositions such as, algebraic sum, algebraic
product etc. Also the definitions of reflexive, symmetric and transitive fuzzy
rough relations on a set are given and a few properties of them will be
investigated. Lastly, we define a operation, which is a composition of two
fuzzy rough relations, with the help of maxmin relation and thereafter it is
shown that the collection of such relations is closed under the operation.
