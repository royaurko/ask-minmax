We present an update of the most stringent experimental bounds on the
trilinear R-parity violating couplings. We then analyse bounds on the R-parity
violating couplings at the unification scale by renormalising the weak scale
bounds. We derive unification scale upper bounds upon the couplings which are
broadly independent of the fermion mass texture assumed. The R-parity violating
couplings are factors of two to five more severely bounded at the unification
scale than at the electroweak scale. In the presence of quark mixing, a few of
the bounds are orders of magnitude stronger than their weak scale counterparts
due to new R-parity violating operators being induced in the renormalisation
between high and low scales. These induced bounds are fermion mass texture
dependent. New bounds upon the weak scale couplings are obtained by the
requirement of perturbativity between the weak and unification scales. A
comprehensive set of the latest limits is included.
