Let R be a positive random variable independent of S which is beta
distributed. In this paper we are interested on the relation between the
distribution function of R and that of RS. For this model we derive first some
distributional properties, and then investigate the lower tail asymptotics of
RS when R is regularly varying at 0, and vice-versa. Our first application
concerns the asymptotic behaviour of the componentwise sample minima related to
an elliptical distributions. Further, we derive the lower tails asymptotic of
the aggregated risk for bivariate polar distributions.
