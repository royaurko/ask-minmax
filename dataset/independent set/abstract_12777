This chapter describes the basic design, simulation, and fabrication for
fully Si integrated, waveguide coupled, optomechanical force and displacement
sensors. The approach of full Si integration of all stationary nanophotonic
components with mechanically separated movable components creates the
opportunity to independently engineer these two parts for a variety of MEMS and
NEMS sensing applications that require high precision, high bandwidth, and
small footprint. Further integration of actuators for static and dynamic
actuation is also possible.
