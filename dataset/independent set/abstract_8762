In this paper, we investigate the properties of recurrent planar Markov
random walks. More precisely, we study the set of recurrent points with the use
of local limit theorems. The Nagaev-Guivarc'h spectral method provides several
examples for which these local limit theorems are satisfied as soon as the
(standard or non-standard) central limit theorem holds.
