We investigate the electronic stress tensor of the hydrogen molecular ion for
the ground state using the exact wave function and wave functions approximated
by gaussian function basis set expansion. The spatial distribution of the
largest eigenvalue, corresponding eigenvectors, tension and kinetic energy
density are compared. We find that the cc-pV6Z basis set gives the spindle
structure very close to the one calculated from the exact wave function.
Similarly, energy density at the Lagrange point is very well approximated by
the cc-pV5Z or cc-pV6Z basis sets.
