We generalise the reconstruction theorem of Stern, Sazdjian, and Fuchs based
on the dispersion relations to the case of the (2 -> 2) scattering of all the
pseudoscalar octet mesons (pi, K, eta). We formulate it in a general way and
include also a discussion of the assumptions of the theorem. It is used to
obtain the amplitudes of all such processes in the isospin limit to the
one-loop order (and can be straightforwardly extended to two loops)
independently on the particular power-counting scheme of the chiral
perturbation theory in question. The results in this general form are
presented.
