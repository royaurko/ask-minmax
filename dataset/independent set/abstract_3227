We provide a detailed analysis of the impact of the newly measured optimised
observables in the B -> K* mu+ mu- decay by the LHCb experiment. The analysis
is performed in the MSSM, both in the context of the usual constrained
scenarios, and in the context of a more general set-up where the SUSY partner
masses are independent. We show that the global agreement of the MSSM solutions
with the data is still very good. Nevertheless, especially in the constrained
scenarios, the limits from B -> K* mu+ mu- are now very strong, and are at the
same level as the well-known b -> s gamma constraints. We describe the
implications of the B -> K* mu+ mu- measurements both on the Wilson
coefficients and on the SUSY parameters.
