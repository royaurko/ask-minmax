Predicting historic temperatures based on tree rings, ice cores, and other
natural proxies is a difficult endeavor. The relationship between proxies and
temperature is weak and the number of proxies is far larger than the number of
target data points. Furthermore, the data contain complex spatial and temporal
dependence structures which are not easily captured with simple models. In this
paper, we assess the reliability of such reconstructions and their statistical
significance against various null models. We find that the proxies do not
predict temperature significantly better than random series generated
independently of temperature. Furthermore, various model specifications that
perform similarly at predicting temperature produce extremely different
historical backcasts. Finally, the proxies seem unable to forecast the high
levels of and sharp run-up in temperature in the 1990s either in-sample or from
contiguous holdout blocks, thus casting doubt on their ability to predict such
phenomena if in fact they occurred several hundred years ago. We propose our
own reconstruction of Northern Hemisphere average annual land temperature over
the last millennium, assess its reliability, and compare it to those from the
climate science literature. Our model provides a similar reconstruction but has
much wider standard errors, reflecting the weak signal and large uncertainty
encountered in this setting.
