We report measurements on two superconducting flux qubits coupled to a
readout Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID). Two on-chip flux
bias lines allow independent flux control of any two of the three elements, as
illustrated by a two-dimensional qubit flux map. The application of microwaves
yields a frequency-flux dispersion curve for 1- and 2-photon driving of the
single-qubit excited state, and coherent manipulation of the single-qubit state
results in Rabi oscillations and Ramsey fringes. This architecture should be
scalable to many qubits and SQUIDs on a single chip.
