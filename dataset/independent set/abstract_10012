Three thinkers of the 19th century revolutionized the science of logic,
mathematics, and philosophy. Edmund Husserl (1859-1938), mathematician and a
disciple of Karl Weierstrass, made an immense contribution to the theory of
human thought. The paper offers a complex analysis of Husserl's mathematical
writings covering calculus of variations, differential geometry, and theory of
numbers which laid the ground for his later phenomenological breakthrough.
Georg Cantor (1845-1818), the creator of set theory, was a mathematician who
changed the mathematical thinking per se. By analyzing the philosophy of set
theory this paper shows how was it possible (by introducing into mathematics
what philosophers call 'the subject'). Set theory happened to be the most
radical answer to the crisis of foundations. David Hilbert (1862-1943), facing
the same foundational crisis, came up with his axiomatic method, indeed a
minimalist program whose roots can be traced back to Descartes and Cauchy.
Bringing together these three key contributors, the paper is the first attempt to
analyze how the united efforts of philosophy and mathematics helped to dissolve
the epistemological crisis of the 19th century.
