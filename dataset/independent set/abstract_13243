Measuring the 7Be solar neutrino flux is crucial towards solving the solar
neutrino puzzle. The Borexino experiment, and possibly the KamLAND experiment,
will be capable of studying the 7Be neutrinos in the near future. We discuss
(1) how the seasonal variation of the Borexino and KamLAND data can be used to
measure the 7Be solar neutrino flux in a background independent way and (2) how
anomalous seasonal variations might be used to discover vacuum neutrino
oscillations, independent of the solar model and the measurement of the
background. In particular, we find that, after three years of Borexino or
KamLAND running, vacuum neutrino oscillations can be either established or
excluded for almost all values of (sin^2 2 theta, Delta m^2) preferred by the
Homestake, GALLEX, SAGE, and Super-Kamiokande data. We also discuss how well
seasonal variations of the data can be used to measure (sin^2 2 theta, Delta
m^2) in the case of vacuum oscillations.
