The aim of this manuscript is to present the proof given by Michel M\'erigot
in 1974 for an enlarged convergence domain of the
Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff-Dynkin series in the Lie algebra of a Banach-Lie
group. This proof is based on a theorem, of independent interest, on the
lifetime of the solution of a Cauchy problem. We furnish all the details for
this ODE result in Appendix A.
