We consider commuting operators obtained by quantization of Hamiltonians of
the Hopf (aka dispersionless KdV) hierarchy. Such operators naturally arise in
the setting of Symplectic Field Theory (SFT). A complete set of common
eigenvectors of these operators is given by Schur polynomials. We use this
result for computing the SFT potential of a disk.
