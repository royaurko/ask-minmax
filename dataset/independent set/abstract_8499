The Zariski closure of the boundary of the set of matrices of nonnegative
rank at most 3 is reducible. We give a minimal generating set for the ideal of
each irreducible component. In fact, this generating set is a Grobner basis
with respect to the graded reverse lexicographic order. This solves a
conjecture by Robeva, Sturmfels and the last contributor.
