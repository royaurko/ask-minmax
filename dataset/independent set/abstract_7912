Dyadic shifts of point distributions in the multi-dimensional unit cube are
considered as a randomization. Explicit formulas for the discrepancies of such
randomized distributions are given in the paper in terms of Rademacher
functions. Relaying on the statistical independence of Rademacher functions,
Khinchin's inequalities, and other related results, we obtain very sharp upper
and lower bounds for the mean discrepancies.
