We summarize recent progress in the theory of exclusive rare and semileptonic
B decays, focusing on model-independent results. The heavy-to-light form
factors parameterizing these decays admit a model-independent description in
two distinct kinematical regions. In the large-energy limit of an energetic
light meson, the Soft-Collinear Effective Theory can be used to prove
factorization formulas for the form factors. We present factorization formulas
for all B-> P,V form factors at leading order in Lambda/m_b. Near the
zero-recoil point, Heavy Quark Effective Theory gives useful relations among
the form factors of different currents.
