Based on the analysis of 6.031*10^7 K+- --> pi0 pi0 pi+- decays, the NA48/2
collaboration has recently determined the S-wave pi-pi scattering lengths
a_0-a_2 with high precision. In addition, the scattering length a_2 has been
independently measured, although less precisely so. The present article
discusses in detail one of the theoretical frameworks used in the data
analysis.
