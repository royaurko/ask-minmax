We have measured the differential resistance of mesoscopic gold wires of
different lengths connected to an aluminum superconductor as a function of
temperature and voltage. Our experimental results differ substantially from
theoretical predictions which assume an infinite temperature independent gap in
the superconductor. In addition to taking into account the temperature
dependence of the gap, we must also introduce a temperature dependent inelastic
scattering length in order to fit our data.
