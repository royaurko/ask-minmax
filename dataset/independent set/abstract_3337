We study the instability to necking of an initially cylindrical filament of
soft glassy material subject to extensional stretching. By numerical simulation
of the soft glassy rheology model and a simplified fluidity model, and by
analytical predictions within a highly generic toy description, we show that
the mode of instability is set by the age of the sample relative to the inverse
of the applied extensional strain rate. Young samples neck gradually via a
liquid-like mode, the onset of which is determined by both the elastic loading
and plastic relaxation terms in the stress constitutive equation. Older samples
fail at smaller draw ratios via a more rapid mode, the onset of which is
determined only by the solid-like elastic loading terms (though plastic effects
arise later, once appreciable necking develops). We show this solid-like mode
to be the counterpart, for elastoplastic materials, of the Consid\`ere mode of
necking in strain-rate-independent solids.
