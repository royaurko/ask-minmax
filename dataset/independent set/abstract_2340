We show that estimates of the Lorentz symmetry violation extracted from
ultra-high energy cosmic rays beyond the GZK cut-off set bounds on the
parameters of a Lorentz-violating extension of the Standard Model. Moreover, we
argue that correlated measurements of the difference in the arrival time of
gamma-ray photons and neutrinos emitted from Active Galactic Nuclei or
Gamma-Ray Bursts may provide a signature for a possible violation of the
Lorentz symmetry. We find that this time delay is energy independent, but that
it has a dependence on the chirality of the particles involved.
