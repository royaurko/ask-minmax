Massive lepton-pair production, the Drell-Yan process, should be a good
source of independent constraints on the gluon density, free from the
experimental and theoretical complications of photon isolation that beset
studies of prompt photon production. We provide predictions for the
spin-averaged and spin-dependent differential cross sections as a function of
transverse momentum $Q_T$.
