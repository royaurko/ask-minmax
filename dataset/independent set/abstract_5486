In this paper, we deal with soft MTL-algebras based on fuzzy sets. By means
of $\in$-soft sets and q-soft sets, some characterizations of (Boolean, G- and
MV-) filteristic soft MTL-algebras are investigated. Finally, we prove that a
soft set is a Boolean filteristic soft MTL-algebra if and only if it is both a
G-filteristic soft MTL-algebra and an MV-filteristic soft MTL-algebra.
