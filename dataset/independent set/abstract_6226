We consider the lower bound of nodal sets of Steklov eigenfunctions on smooth
Riemannian manifolds with boundary--the eigenfunctions of the
Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. Let $N_\lambda$ be its nodal set. Assume that zero is
a regular value of Steklov eigenfunctions. We show that
$$H^{n-1}(N_\lambda)\geq C\lambda^{\frac{3-n}{2}}$$ for some positive constant
$C$ depending only on the manifold.
