The usual cyclotron resonance occurs at \omega_c=eB/m*c which is independent
of spin. The new resonances depend on spin. The new resonances occur at
\omega_{c\pm}=(1/2)g_{\pm}eB/m*c where (1/2)g_{\pm}= {\it l}+(1/2)\pm s/(2{\it
l}+1). The energy in the centre of two new frequencies varies as the square
root of the 2-dimensional electrons due to spin excess in the Gaussian model.
The frequencies \omega_{c\pm} are linearly proportional to the magnetic field
except near crossing point where the linear combination of wave functions must
be made.
