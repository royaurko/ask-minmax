Motivic local systems over a curve in finite characteristic form a countable
set endowed with an action of the absolute Galois group of rational numbers
commuting with the Frobenius map. I will discuss three series of conjectures
about such sets, based on an analogy with algebraic dynamics, on a formalism of
commutative algebras of motivic integral operators, and on an analogy with
  2-dimensional lattice models.
