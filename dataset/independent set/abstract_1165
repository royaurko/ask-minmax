We show that the matrix (or more generally tensor) product states in a finite
translation invariant system can be accurately constructed from the same set of
local matrices (or tensors) that are determined from an infinite lattice system
in one or higher dimensions. This provides an efficient approach for studying
translation invariant tensor product states in finite lattice systems. Two
methods are introduced to determine these size-independent local tensors.
