Let $W$ be an integer valued random variable satisfying $E[W] =: \delta \geq
0$ and $P(W<0)>0$, and consider a self-interacting random walk that behaves
like a simple symmetric random walk with the exception that on the first visit
to any integer $x\in \mathbb{Z}$ the size of the next step is an independent
random variable with the same distribution as $W$. We show that this
self-interacting random walk is recurrent if $\delta\leq 1$ and transient if
$\delta>1$. This is a special case of our main result which concerns the
recurrence and transience of excited random walks (or cookie random walks) with
non-nearest neighbor jumps.
