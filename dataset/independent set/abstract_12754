The class of Dirichlet random vectors is central in numerous probabilistic
and statistical applications. The main result of this paper derives the exact
tail asymptotics of the aggregated risk of powers of Dirichlet random vectors
when the radial component has df in the Gumbel or the Weibull max-domain of
attraction. We present further results for the joint asymptotic independence
and the max-sum equivalence.
