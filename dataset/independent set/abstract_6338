We present a calculation of the effective weak Hamiltonian which governs $b
\rightarrow s\, \gamma$ and $b \rightarrow s \, g$ transitions in two different
renormalization schemes (NDR and HV). In the leading logarithmic approximation,
we show that the coefficients of the effective Hamiltonian are scheme
independent only when one takes correctly into account the scheme dependence of
one- and two- loop diagrams. We demonstrate that in NDR there are contributions
which were missed in previous calculations. These contributions are necessary
to obtain scheme independent coefficients in the final results.
