We present a novel treatment for calculating the in-medium quark condensates.
The advantage of this approach is that one does not need to make further
assumptions on the derivatives of model parameters with respect to the quark
current mass. The normally accepted model-independent result in nuclear matter
is naturally reproduced. The change of the quark condensate induced by
interactions depends on the incompressibility of nuclear matter. When it is
greater than 260 MeV, the density at which the condensate vanishes is higher
than that from the linear extrapolation. For the chiral condensate in quark
matter, a similar model-independent linear behavior is found at lower
densities, which means that the decreasing speed of the condensate in quark
matter is merely half of that in nuclear matter if the pion-nucleon sigma
commutator is six times the average current mass of u and d quarks. The
modification due to QCD-like interactions is found to slow the decreasing speed
of the condensate, compared with the linear extrapolation.
