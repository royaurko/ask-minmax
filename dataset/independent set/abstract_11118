Combining the recently available experimental evidence of D-Dbar mixing, we
extract model-independent information on the mixing amplitude and on its
CP-violating phase. Using this information, we present new constraints on the
flavour structure of up-type squark mass matrices in supersymmetric extensions
of the Standard Model.
