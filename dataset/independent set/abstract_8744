We investigate the number of sets of words that can be formed from a finite
alphabet, counted by the total length of the words in the set. An explicit
expression for the counting sequence is derived from the generating function,
and asymptotics for large alphabet respectively large total word length are
discussed. Moreover, we derive a Gaussian limit law for the number of words in
a random finite language.
