For finite sets A and B in the plane, we write A+B to denote the set of sums
of the elements of A and B. In addition, we write tr(A) to denote the common
number of triangles in any triangulation of the convex hull of A using the
points of A as vertices. We consider the conjecture that tr(A+B)^{1/2}\geq
tr(A)^{1/2}+tr(B)^{1/2}. If true, this conjecture would be a discrete,
two-dimensional analogue to the Brunn-Minkowski inequality. We prove the
conjecture in three special cases.
