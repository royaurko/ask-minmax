Current situation in studies of lifetimes of excited rovibronic levels for
the H2, D2, T2, HD, HT, and DT molecules is analyzed. All measured values of
the lifetimes (792 data for 618 different vibro-rotational levels of 33
electronic states), reported in 61 publications before November 2014, are
compiled and listed in the tabular format together with annotated bibliography.
Experimental data are now available for the H2, HD and D2 molecules only. The
data collected in the present work show fragmentariness of experimental data.
For vast majority of the levels the lifetime value was reported in one paper
only, and has no independent experimental verification. Complete bibliography
of publications concerning semi-empirical determination and non-empirical
calculations of the lifetimes is presented. Numerical results obtained by these
two approaches are listed in an explicit form only in the cases when
experimental data are available. For more than half of the levels the
differences between measured and calculated values are 3 times higher than
experimental errors. This direct contradiction shows necessity of more precise
experimental and non-empirical studies. For finite number of rovibronic levels
our analysis made it possible to propose certain set of recommended data.
