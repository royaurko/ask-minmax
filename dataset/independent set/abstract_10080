As the features from the traditional Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Local
Directional Patterns (LDP) are found to be ineffective for face recognition, we
have proposed a new approach derived on the basis of Information sets whereby
the loss of information that occurs during the binarization is eliminated. The
information sets expand the scope of fuzzy sets by connecting the attribute and
the corresponding membership function value as a product. Since face is having
smooth texture in a limited area, the extracted features must be highly
discernible. To limit the number of features, we consider only the non
overlapping windows. By the application of the information set theory we can
reduce the number of feature of an image. The derived features are shown to
work fairly well over eigenface, fisherface and LBP methods.
