We have searched the 1st-year WMAP W-Band CMB anisotropy map for evidence of
cosmic strings. We have set a limit of $\delta = 8 \pi G \mu / c^2 < 8.2 \times
10^{-6}$ at 95% CL for statistical search for a significant number of strings
in the map. We also have set a limit using the uniform distribution of strings
model in the WMAP data with $\delta = 8 \pi G \mu / c^2 < 7.34 \times 10^{-5}$
at 95% CL. And the pattern search technique we developed here set a limit
$\delta = 8 \pi G \mu / c^2 < 1.54 \times 10^{-5}$ at 95% CL.
