We discuss the signature of a peculiar constellation of very massive stars at
a projected distance of 2-3 pc around R136a. We discuss various scenarios for
its possible origin, such as independent clusters, triggered star formation,
supernovae, and ejections via dynamical interactions. If the latter scenario
were the correct one this would have significant implications on the way to
probe the conditions in dense stellar cores, and on the evolution of massive
clusters in general.
