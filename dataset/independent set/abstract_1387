We consider the problem of learning causal directed acyclic graphs from an
observational joint distribution. One can use these graphs to predict the
outcome of interventional experiments, from which data are often not available.
We show that if the observational distribution follows a structural equation
model with an additive noise structure, the directed acyclic graph becomes
identifiable from the distribution under mild conditions. This constitutes an
interesting alternative to traditional methods that assume faithfulness and
identify only the Markov equivalence class of the graph, thus leaving some
edges undirected. We provide practical algorithms for finitely many samples,
RESIT (Regression with Subsequent Independence Test) and two methods based on
an independence score. We prove that RESIT is correct in the population setting
and provide an empirical evaluation.
