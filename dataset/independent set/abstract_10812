We propose a model-independent method to determine the magnitude of the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{ub}|$ from exclusive $B$ and $D$
decays. Combining information obtainable from $B\to \rho\ell\bar\nu_\ell$,
$B\to K^*\nu\bar\nu$, $D\to \rho\bar\ell\nu_\ell$ and $D\to
K^*\bar\ell\nu_\ell$, a determination of $|V_{ub}|$ is possible, with an
uncertainty from theory of around 10\%. Theoretical uncertainties in the $B\to
K^*\ell\bar\ell$ decay rate are discussed.
