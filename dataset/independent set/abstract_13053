This paper gives a rigorous proof of a conjectured statistical
self-similarity property of the eigenvalues random matrices from the Circular
Unitary Ensemble. We consider on the one hand the eigenvalues of an $n \times
n$ CUE matrix, and on the other hand those eigenvalues $e^{i\phi}$ of an $mn
\times mn$ CUE matrix with $|\phi| \le \pi / m$, rescaled to fill the unit
circle. We show that for a large range of mesoscopic scales, these collections
of points are statistically indistinguishable for large $n$. The proof is based
on a comparison theorem for determinantal point processes which may be of
independent interest.
