The augmented GARCH model is a unification of numerous extensions of the
popular and widely used ARCH process. It was introduced by Duan and besides
ordinary (linear) GARCH processes, it contains exponential GARCH, power GARCH,
threshold GARCH, asymmetric GARCH, etc. In this paper, we study the
probabilistic structure of augmented $\mathrm {GARCH}(1,1)$ sequences and the
asymptotic distribution of various functionals of the process occurring in
problems of statistical inference. Instead of using the Markov structure of the
model and implied mixing properties, we utilize independence properties of
perturbed GARCH sequences to directly reduce their asymptotic behavior to the
case of independent random variables. This method applies for a very large
class of functionals and eliminates the fairly restrictive moment and
smoothness conditions assumed in the earlier theory. In particular, we derive
functional CLTs for powers of the augmented GARCH variables, derive the error
rate in the CLT and obtain asymptotic results for their empirical processes
under nearly optimal conditions.
