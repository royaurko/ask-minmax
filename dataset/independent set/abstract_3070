It is argued that the braneworld gravity under the Schwarzschild ansatz
should obey three essential equations on the brane, and they are solved
exactly. We express the general solution of the fundamental equations of the
braneworld in power series of the brane normal coordinate. The power series are
derived by solving three independent components of the bulk Einstein equation,
and the coefficients are recursively determined in terms of five functions on
the brane. The other components of the bulk Einstein equation are automatically
satisfied, as far as the five on-brane functions obey three essential
equations. They are the radial-extra and the extra-extra components of the bulk
Einstein equation on the brane, and the equation of motion of the brane.
Therefore the solution includes two arbitrary functions on the brane. We show
that the essential equations are exactly solved by choosing an appropriate set
of the two arbitrary functions. The arbitrariness may affect the predictive
powers on the Newtonian and the post-Newtonian evidences.
