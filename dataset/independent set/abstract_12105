We report that a general principle of physical independence of mathematical
background manifolds brings a replacement of common derivative operators by
co-derivative ones. Then we obtain a new Lagrangian for the ordinary minimal
standard model with supplementary terms containing the Lorentz invariance
violation information measured by a new matrix, denoted as the Lorentz
invariance violation matrix. We thus provide a new fundamental theory to study
Lorentz invariance violation effects consistently and systematically.
