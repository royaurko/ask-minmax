We study projective stationary sets. The Projective Stationary Reflection
principle is the statement that every projective stationary set contains an
increasing continuous $\in$--chain of length $\omega_1$. We show that if
Martin's Maximum holds, then the Projective Stationary Reflection Principle
holds. Also it is equivalent to the Strong Reflection Principle. We show that
the saturation of the nonstationary ideal on $\omega_1$ is equivalent to a
certain kind of reflection.
