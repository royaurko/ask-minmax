Since scientific investigation is one of the most important providers of
massive amounts of ordered data, there is a renewed interest in array data
processing in the context of Big Data. To the best of our knowledge, a unified
resource that summarizes and analyzes array processing research over its long
existence is currently missing. In this survey, we provide a guide for past,
present, and future research in array processing. The survey is organized along
three main topics. Array storage discusses all the aspects related to array
partitioning into chunks. The identification of a reduced set of array
operators to form the foundation for an array query language is analyzed across
multiple such proposals. Lastly, we survey real systems for array processing.
The result is a thorough survey on array data storage and processing that
should be consulted by anyone interested in this research topic, independent of
experience level. The survey is not complete though. We greatly appreciate
pointers towards any work we might have forgotten to mention.
