We identify the independent dimension 6 twist 4 gluon operators and calculate
their renormalization in the pure gauge theory. By constructing the
renormalization group invariant combinations, we find the scale invariant
condensates that can be estimated in nonperturbative calculations and used in
QCD sum rules for heavy quark systems in medium.
