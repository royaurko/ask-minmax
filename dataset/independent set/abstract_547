We investigate a set of stochastic models of biodiversity, population
genetics, language evolution and opinion dynamics on a network within a common
framework. Each node has a state, 0 < x_i < 1, with interactions specified by
strengths m_{ij}. For any set of m_{ij} we derive an approximate expression for
the mean time to reach fixation or consensus (all x_i=0 or 1). Remarkably in a
case relevant to language change this time is independent of the network
structure.
