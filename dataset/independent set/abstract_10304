It is pointed out that the discrete velocities found by Tifft in galaxies are
harmonically related to the discrete intrinsic redshifts found in quasars. All
are harmonically related to the constant 0.062 +/- 0.001, and this is the
fourth independent analysis in which the redshift increment 0.062 has been
shown to be significant. It is concluded that there is a quantized component in
the redshift of both quasars and galaxies that has a common origin and is
unlikely to be Doppler-related.
