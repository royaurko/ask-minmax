The SIMPLE experiment is reanalyzed within the context of the WIMP model
independent framework of Tovey et. al.. The results are compared with those of
the UK NAIAD and NaF experiments as recently reported by the Tokyo group,
together with those of the latest UK NAIAD results in 2003, and further
constrain the allowed parameter space.
