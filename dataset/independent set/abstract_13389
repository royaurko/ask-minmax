We investigate the constraints on the scalar, vector and spin-3/2 dark matter
interaction with the standard model particles, from the observations of dark
matter relic density, the direct detection experiments of CDMS and XENON, and
the indirect detection of the antiproton-to-proton ratio by PAMELA. A model
independent way is adopted by constructing general 4-particle operators up to
dimension 6 for the effective interaction between dark matter and standard
model particles. We find that the constraints from different experiments are
complementary with each other. Comparison among these constraints may exclude
some effective models of dark matter and limit some parameters of others. The
spin-independent direct detection gives strong constraints for some operators,
while the indirect detection of antiproton-to-proton data can be more sensitive
than direct detection or relic density for light dark matter (whose mass less
than 70 GeV) in some cases. The constraints on some operators for spin-3/2 dark
matter are shown to be similar to those on their analogous operators for Dirac
fermionic dark matter. There are still some operators not sensitive to the
current dark matter direct and indirect search experiments.
