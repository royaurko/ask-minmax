The standard model extended with the pairs of the vector-like families is
studied. The model independent analysis for an arbitrary case and an explicit
realization for the case with one pair of the heavy vector-like families are
considered. The mixing matrices of the light quarks for the left- and
right-handed charged currents, as well as those for the flavour changing
neutral currents, both the Z and Higgs mediated, are found.
