There are two superanalogs of the general linear group: GL(m|n) and GQ(n).
For any supercommutative superalgebra C let G(C) be the set of C-points of the
supermanifold G. Here there are described the GQ(n; C)-invariant functions on
Q(n; C) and GL(n; C)-invariant functions on the odd subspace of Mat (n|n; C),
more exactly, the invariants of the action of Lie supergroups GQ(n) and GL(n|n)
on the supermanifolds corresponding to Q(n; C) and the odd subspace of Mat(n|n;
C). The obtained answer is interpreted in terms of GL(n; C)-invariants on Q(n;
C) and GL(n|n; C)-invariants on the odd subspace of Mat (n|n; C) described
functorially in (i.e., independently of) C.
