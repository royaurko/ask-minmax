We present updated results for the radiative improvement of the \sigma.B term
and the spin-dependent four-fermion terms in the lattice NRQCD action, and
first results for the radiative corrections to the NRQCD Darwin term and
spin-independent four-fermion terms. The spin-dependent terms have significant
impact on getting the correct hyperfine splitting for both bottomonium and
heavy-light mesons, while the spin-independent terms suffer from a conspiracy
between lattice artifacts and severe IR divergences that complicates their
evaluation.
