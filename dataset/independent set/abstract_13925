We consider games played on graphs with the winning conditions for the
players specified as weak-parity conditions. In weak-parity conditions the
winner of a play is decided by looking into the set of states appearing in the
play, rather than the set of states appearing infinitely often in the play. A
naive analysis of the classical algorithm for weak-parity games yields a
quadratic time algorithm. We present a linear time algorithm for solving
weak-parity games.
