Equilibria of binary neutron stars in close circular orbits are computed
numerically in a waveless formulation: The full Einstein-relativistic-Euler
system is solved on an initial hypersurface to obtain an asymptotically flat
form of the 4-metric and an extrinsic curvature whose time derivative vanishes
in a comoving frame. Two independent numerical codes are developed, and
solution sequences that model inspiraling binary neutron stars during the final
several orbits are successfully computed. The binding energy of the system near
its final orbit deviates from earlier results of third post-Newtonian and of
spatially conformally flat calculations. The new solutions may serve as initial
data for merger simulations and as members of quasiequilibrium sequences to
generate gravitational wave templates, and may improve estimates of the
gravitational-wave cutoff frequency set by the last inspiral orbit.
