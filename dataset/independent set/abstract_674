Using LEP1, SLD and LEP2 data, for tau lepton production, and data from CDF,
D0 and LEP2, for W decays into tau leptons, we set model independent limits on
non-standard electromagnetic and weak magnetic moments of the tau lepton. The
most general effective Lagrangian giving rise to tau moments is used without
further assumptions. Precise bounds ($2\sigma$) on the non-standard model
contributions to tau electromagnetic ($-0.007<a_\gamma< 0.005$), tau Z-magnetic
($-0.0024 <a_Z< 0.0025$) and tau W-magnetic ($-0.003 < \kappa^W < 0.004$)
dipole moments are set from the analysis.
