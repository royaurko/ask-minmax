The notion of intuitionistic fuzzy set was introduced by Atanassov as a
generalization of the notion of fuzzy set. In this paper we apply this concept
of Atanassov to ideals, prime ideals and semiprime ideals of gamma semigroups
in order to obtain some characterization theorems. We also introduce the notion
of Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy ideal extension in a gamma semigroup and
investigate some of their important properties. A regular gamma semigroup has
been characterized in terms of Atanasov's intutionistic fuzzy ideal.
Characterization of prime ideal of a gamma semigroup has also been obtained in
terms of Atanassov's intutionistic fuzzy ideal extension.
