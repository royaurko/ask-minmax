This letter describes a scalar curvature invariant for general relativity
with a certain, distinctive feature. While many such invariants exist, this one
vanishes in regions of space-time which can be said unambiguously to contain no
gravitational radiation. In more general regions which incontrovertibly support
non-trivial radiation fields, it can be used to extract local,
coordinate-independent information partially characterizing that radiation.
While a clear, physical interpretation is possible only in such radiation
zones, a simple algorithm can be given to extend the definition smoothly to
generic regions of space-time.
