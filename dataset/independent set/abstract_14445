The MEG collaboration searches for the mu to e gamma decay at the muon beam
line PiE5 of the Paul Scherrer Institut in Switzerland. The world best upper
limit has been set to be BR(mu to e gamma) < 5.7 10^-13 at 90% C.L. analyzing a
data set of 3.6 10^14 stopped muons on target. An upgrade program of the
detector (MEG-II) should lead to a sensitivity at a level of few 10^-14 within
the next five years.
