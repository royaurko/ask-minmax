In this paper we describe two bootstrap methods for massive data sets. Naive
applications of common resampling methodology are often impractical for massive
data sets due to computational burden and due to complex patterns of
inhomogeneity. In contrast, the proposed methods exploit certain structural
properties of a large class of massive data sets to break up the original
problem into a set of simpler subproblems, solve each subproblem separately
where the data exhibit approximate uniformity and where computational
complexity can be reduced to a manageable level, and then combine the results
through certain analytical considerations. The validity of the proposed methods
is proved and their finite sample properties are studied through a moderately
large simulation study. The methodology is illustrated with a real data example
from Transportation Engineering, which motivated the development of the
proposed methods.
