We compare computads with multitopic sets. Both these kinds of structures
have n-dimensional objects (called n-cells and n-pasting diagrams,
respectively). The computads form a subclass of the more familiar class of
omega-categories, while multitopic sets have been devised by Hermida, Makkai
and Power as a vehicle for a definition of the concepts of weak omega-category.
Our main result states that the category of multitopic sets is equivalent to
that of many-to-one computads, a certain full subcategory of the category of
all computads.
