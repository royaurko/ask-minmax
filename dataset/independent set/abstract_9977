Structural identifiability for parameter estimation addresses the question of
whether it is possible to uniquely recover the model parameters assuming
noise-free data, making it a necessary condition for successful parameter
estimation for real, noisy data. One established approach to this question for
nonlinear ordinary differential equation models is via differential algebra,
which uses characteristic sets to generate a set of input-output equations
which contain complete identifiability information for the model. This paper
presents a generalization of this method, proving that identifiability may be
determined using more general solution methods such as ad hoc substitution,
Groebner bases, and differential Groebner bases, rather than via characteristic
sets. This approach is used to examine the structural identifiability of
several biological model systems using different solution methods
(characteristic sets, Groebner bases, differential Groebner bases, and ad hoc
substitution). It is shown that considering a range of approaches can allow for
faster computations, which makes it possible to determine the identifiability
of models which otherwise would be computationally infeasible.
