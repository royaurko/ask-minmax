Regge calculus minisuperspace action in the connection representation has the
form in which each term is linear over some field variable (scale of area-type
variable with sign). We are interested in the result of performing integration
over connections in the path integral (now usual multiple integral) as function
of area tensors even in larger region considered as independent variables. To
find this function (or distribution), we compute its moments, i. e. integrals
with monomials over area tensors. Calculation proceeds through intermediate
appearance of $\delta$-functions and integrating them out. Up to a singular
part with support on some discrete set of physically unattainable points, the
function of interest has finite moments. This function in physical region
should therefore exponentially decay at large areas and it really does being
restored from moments. This gives for gravity a way of defining such
nonabsolutely convergent integral as path integral.
