We present a model independent approach to FFs, which allows to determine
uniquely the non-singlet combination (D_u-D_d)^{K^++K^-} of the kaon FFs,
independently in the three different processes of kaon inclusive production:
e+e- annihilation, pp-collisions and lN semi-inclusive DIS. Only C and SU(2)
invariances are used and no assumptions on FFs and PDFs, the result holds in
any order in QCD. The non-singlets obtained in this way, would allow to test
the commonly used assumptions in global fit analysis and to test universality.
This method is applied to kaon production data in e+e-\to K+X,\,K=K^\pm, K^0_s
and (D_u-D_d)^{K^++K^-} is obtained without any assumptions. This result is
compared to the existing parametrizations, obtained in global fit analysis.
