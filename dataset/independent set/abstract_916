The claim that large-scale structure data independently prefers the Lambda
Cold Dark Matter model is a myth. However, an updated compilation of
large-scale structure observations cannot rule out Lambda CDM at 95%
confidence. We explore the possibility of improving the model by adding Hot
Dark Matter but the fit becomes worse; this allows us to set limits on the
neutrino mass.
