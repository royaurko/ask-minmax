We introduce and study algebraic dynamical systems generated by triangular
systems of rational functions. We obtain several results about the degree
growth and linear independence of iterates as well as about possible lengths of
trajectories generated by such dynamical systems over finite fields. Some of
these results are generalisations of those known in the polynomial case, some
are new even in this case.
