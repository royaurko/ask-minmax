A graph $G$ is {\em well-covered} if every maximal independent set has the
same cardinality $q$. Let $i_k(G)$ denote the number of independent sets of
cardinality $k$ in $G$. Brown, Dilcher, and Nowakowski conjectured that the
independence sequence $(i_0(G), i_1(G), \ldots, i_q(G))$ was unimodal for any
well-ordered graph $G$ with independence number $q$. Michael and Traves
disproved this conjecture. Instead they posited the so-called ``Roller Coaster"
Conjecture: that the terms \[
  i_{\left\lceil\frac{q}2\right\rceil}(G),
i_{\left\lceil\frac{q}2\right\rceil+1}(G), \ldots, i_q(G) \] could be in any
specified order for some well-covered graph $G$ with independence number $q$.
Michael and Traves proved the conjecture for $q<8$ and Matchett extended this
to $q<12$.
  In this paper, we prove the Roller Coaster Conjecture using a construction of
graphs with a property related to that of having a maximal-clique partition. In
particular, we show, for all pairs of integers $1\le k<q$ and positive integers
$m$, that there is a well-covered graph $G$ with independence number $q$ for
which every independent set of size $k+1$ is contained in a unique maximal
independent set, but each independent set of size $k$ is contained in at least
$m$ distinct independent sets.
