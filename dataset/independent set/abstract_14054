For a real valued function, a point is critical if its derivatives are zero,
and a critical point is a saddle point if it is not a local extrema. In this
paper, we study algorithms to find saddle points of general Morse index. Our
approach is motivated by the multidimensional mountain pass theorem, and
extends our earlier work on methods (based on studying the level sets) to find
saddle points of mountain pass type. We prove the convergence of our algorithms
in the nonsmooth case, and the local superlinear convergence of another
algorithm in the smooth finite dimensional case.
