We present the results of a large scale molecular dynamics computer
simulation of a binary, supercooled Lennard-Jones fluid. At low temperatures
and intermediate times the time dependence of the intermediate scattering
function is well described by a von Schweidler law. The von Schweidler exponent
is independent of temperature and depends only weakly on the type of
correlator. For long times the correlation functions show a Kohlrausch behavior
with an exponent $\beta$ that is independent of temperature. This dynamical
behavior is in accordance with the mode-coupling theory of supercooled liquids.
