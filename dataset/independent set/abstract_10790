The top quark mass values from the CDF Collaboration and the precision
electroweak data at LEP combined with the bottom mass value allow to establish
bounds on the parameter tan beta in the minimal supersymmetric standard model
(MSSM) independent of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters. We find: 0.96
< tan beta < 52.2 at the 95 % C.L., which is mostly the region tan beta >1,
where radiative electroweak symmetry breaking is possible. Assuming electroweak
symmetry breaking leads to: tan beta=1.2 +- 0.2, if one neglects the high tan
beta solution, which is unlikely due to proton lifetime limits.
