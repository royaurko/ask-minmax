In this note we consider the point process of eigenvalues of the tensor
product of two independent random unitary matrices of size m by m and n by n.
When n becomes large, the process behaves like the superposition of m
independent sine processes. When m and n go to infinity, we obtain the Poisson
point process in the limit.
