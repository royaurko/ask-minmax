The charge-transfer (CT) together with the polarization energy appears at
second and higher orders in symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT). At
present there is no theoretically compelling way of isolating the
charge-transfer energy that is simultaneously basis-set independent and
applicable for arbitrary intermolecular separation. We argue that the
charge-transfer can be interpreted as a tunneling phenomenon, and can therefore
be defined via regularized SAPT. This leads to a physically convincing,
basis-independent definition of the charge-transfer energy that captures
subtleties of the process, such as the asymmetry in the forward and backward
charge transfer, as well as secondary transfer effects. With this definition of
the charge-transfer the damping needed for polarization models can be
determined with a level of confidence hitherto not possible.
