We use the technique of stabilizing divisors introduced by Cieliebak-Mohnke
to construct finite dimensional, strictly unital Fukaya algebras of compact,
oriented, relatively spin Lagrangians in compact symplectic manifolds with
rational symplectic classes. The homotopy type of the algebra and the moduli
space of solutions to the weak Maurer-Cartan equation are shown to be
independent of the choice of perturbation data. The Floer cohomology is a
vector bundle over the space of solutions to the weak Maurer-Cartan equation
and is shown to be independent of the choice of perturbation data up to gauge
equivalence.
