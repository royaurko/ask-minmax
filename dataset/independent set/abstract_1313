We consider the Einstein-Yang-Mills Lagrangian in a (4+n)-dimensional
space-time. Assuming the matter and metric fields to be independent of the n
extra coordinates, a spherical symmetric Ansatz for the fields leads to a set
of coupled ordinary differential equations. We find that for n > 1 only
solutions with either one non-zero Higgs field or with all Higgs fields
constant exist. We construct the analytic solutions which fulfill this
conditions for arbitrary n, namely the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton solutions. We
also present generic solutions of the effective 4-dimensional
Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs-dilaton model, which possesses n Higgs triplets
coupled in a specific way to n independent dilaton fields. These solutions are
the abelian Einstein-Maxwell- dilaton solutions and analytic non-abelian
solutions, which have diverging Higgs fields. In addition, we construct
numerically asymptotically flat and finite energy solutions for n=2.
