A Lagrangian formulation of the BRST quantization of generic gauge theories
in general irreducible non-Abelian hypergauges is proposed on the basis of the
multilevel Batalin--Tyutin formalism and a special BV--BFV dual description of
a reducible gauge model on the symplectic supermanifold $\mathcal{M}_0$ locally
parameterized by the antifields for Lagrangian multipliers and the fields of
the BV method. The quantization rules are based on a set of nilpotent
anticommuting operators $\Delta^\mathcal{M}, {V}^\mathcal{M}, {U}^\mathcal{M}$
defined through both odd and even symplectic structures on a supersymplectic
manifold $\mathcal{M}$ locally representable as an odd (co)tangent bundle over
$\mathcal{M}_0$ provided by the choice of a flat Fedosov connection and a
non-symplectic metric on $\mathcal{M}_0$ compatible with it. The generating
functional of Green's functions is constructed in general coordinates on
$\mathcal{M}$ with the help of contracting homotopy operators with respect to
${V}^\mathcal{M}$ and ${U}^\mathcal{M}$. We prove the gauge independence of the
S-matrix and derive the Ward identity.
