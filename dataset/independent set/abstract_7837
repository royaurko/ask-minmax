We prove an improvement of flatness result for nonlocal minimal surfaces
which is independent of the fractional parameter $s$ when $s\rightarrow 1^-$.
  As a consequence, we obtain that all the nonlocal minimal cones are flat and
that all the nonlocal minimal surfaces are smooth when the dimension of the
ambient space is less or equal than 7 and $s$ is close to 1.
