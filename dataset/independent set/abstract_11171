Asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes with Poincare invariance along the
boundary can describe, via the AdS/CFT correspondence, either relevant
deformations of a conformal field theory or non-conformal vacuum states. I
consider examples of both types constructed in the framework of
five-dimensional gauged supergravity. I explain the proof and motivation of a
gravitational ``c-theorem'' which is independent of dimension. I show how one
class of examples can be elevated to ten-dimensional geometries involving
distributions of parallel D3-branes. For these cases some peculiar properties
of two-point functions emerge, and I close with speculations on their physical
origin.
