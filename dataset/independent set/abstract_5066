We obtain constraints on cosmological parameters from the spherically
averaged redshift-space correlation function of the CMASS Data Release 9 (DR9)
sample of the Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We combine this
information with additional data from recent CMB, SN and BAO measurements. Our
results show no significant evidence of deviations from the standard
flat-Lambda CDM model, whose basic parameters can be specified by Omega_m =
0.285 +- 0.009, 100 Omega_b = 4.59 +- 0.09, n_s = 0.96 +- 0.009, H_0 = 69.4 +-
0.8 km/s/Mpc and sigma_8 = 0.80 +- 0.02. The CMB+CMASS combination sets tight
constraints on the curvature of the Universe, with Omega_k = -0.0043 +- 0.0049,
and the tensor-to-scalar amplitude ratio, for which we find r < 0.16 at the 95
per cent confidence level (CL). These data show a clear signature of a
deviation from scale-invariance also in the presence of tensor modes, with n_s
<1 at the 99.7 per cent CL. We derive constraints on the fraction of massive
neutrinos of f_nu < 0.049 (95 per cent CL), implying a limit of sum m_nu < 0.51
eV. We find no signature of a deviation from a cosmological constant from the
combination of all datasets, with a constraint of w_DE = -1.033 +- 0.073 when
this parameter is assumed time-independent, and no evidence of a departure from
this value when it is allowed to evolve as w_DE(a) = w_0 + w_a (1 - a). The
achieved accuracy on our cosmological constraints is a clear demonstration of
the constraining power of current cosmological observations.
