Indirect support for the evidence of neutrinoless double beta decay reported
recently, is obtained by analysis of other Ge double beta experiments, which
yield independent information on the background in the region of Q_(beta-beta).
Some statistical features as well as background simulations with GEANT 4 of the
HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW experiment are discussed which disprove recent criticism.
