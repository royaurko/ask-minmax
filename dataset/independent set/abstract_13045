In 1975 James Pickands III showed that the excesses over a high threshold are
approximatly Generalized Pareto distributed. Since then, a variety of
estimators for the parameters of this cdf have been studied, but always
assuming the underlying data to be independent. In this paper we consider the
special case where the underlying data arises from a linear process with
regularly varying (i.e. heavy-tailed) innovations. Using this setup, we then
show that the likelihood moment estimators introduced by Zhang (2007) are
consistent estimators for the parameters of the Generalized Pareto
distribution.
