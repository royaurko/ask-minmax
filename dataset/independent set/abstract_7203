Max cones are max-algebraic analogs of convex cones. In the present paper we
develop a theory of generating sets and extremals of max cones in ${{\mathbb
R}}_+^n$. This theory is based on the observation that extremals are minimal
elements of max cones under suitable scalings of vectors. We give new proofs of
existing results suitably generalizing, restating and refining them. Of these,
it is important that any set of generators may be partitioned into the set of
extremals and the set of redundant elements. We include results on properties
of open and closed cones, on properties of totally dependent sets and on
computational bounds for the problem of finding the (essentially unique) basis
of a finitely generated cone.
