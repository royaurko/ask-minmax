In the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, a bino-like LSP can be
as light as a few GeV and satisfy WMAP constraints on the dark matter relic
density in the presence of a light CP-odd Higgs scalar. We study upper bounds
on the direct detection cross sections for such a light LSP in the mass range
2-20 GeV in the NMSSM, respecting all constraints from B-physics and LEP. The
OPAL constraints on e^+ e^- -> \chi^0_1 \chi^0_i (i > 1) play an important role
and are discussed in some detail. The resulting upper bounds on the
spin-independent and spin-dependent nucleon cross sections are ~ 10^{-42}
cm^{-2} and ~ 4\times 10^{-40} cm^{-2}, respectively. Hence the upper bound on
the spin-independent cross section is below the DAMA and CoGeNT regions, but
could be compatible with the two events observed by CDMS-II.
