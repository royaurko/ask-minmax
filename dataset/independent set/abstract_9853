We study the maximum size of a set system on $n$ elements whose trace on any
$b$ elements has size at most $k$. We show that if for some $b \ge i \ge 0$ the
shatter function $f_R$ of a set system $([n],R)$ satisfies $f_R(b) <
2^i(b-i+1)$ then $|R| = O(n^i)$; this generalizes Sauer's Lemma on the size of
set systems with bounded VC-dimension. We use this bound to delineate the main
growth rates for the same problem on families of permutations, where the trace
corresponds to the inclusion for permutations. This is related to a question of
Raz on families of permutations with bounded VC-dimension that generalizes the
Stanley-Wilf conjecture on permutations with excluded patterns.
