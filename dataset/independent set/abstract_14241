Let $P_E$ be the set of all values of a spectral measure $E$ and $A(P_E)$ be
the smallest von Neumann algebra containing $P_E$. We give a simple description
of all sets of generators of $A(P_E)$ in terms of the integrals with respect to
$E$. The treatment covers not only the case of generators belonging to
$A(P_E)$, but also the case of (possibly unbounded) generators affiliated with
this algebra.
