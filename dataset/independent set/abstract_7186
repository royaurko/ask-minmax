The nonlinear scalar-field realisation of $w_{1+\infty}$ symmetry in $d=2$
dimensions is studied in analogy to the nonlinear realisation of $d=4$
conformal symmetry $SO(4,2)$. The $w_{1+\infty}$ realisation is derived from a
coset-space construction in which the divisor group is generated by the
non-negative modes of the Virasoro algebra, with subsequent application of an
infinite set of covariant constraints. The initial doubly-infinite set of
Goldstone fields arising in this construction is reduced by the covariant
constraints to a singly-infinite set corresponding to the Cartan-subalgebra
generators $v^\ell_{-(\ell+1)}$. We derive the transformation rules of this
surviving set of fields, finding a triangular structure in which fields
transform into themselves or into lower members of the set only. This
triangular structure gives rise to finite-component subrealisations, including
the standard one for a single scalar. We derive the Maurer-Cartan form and
discuss the construction of invariant actions.
