We consider $p$ independent Brownian motions in $\R^d$. We assume that $p\geq
2$ and $p(d-2)<d$. Let $\ell_t$ denote the intersection measure of the $p$
paths by time $t$, i.e., the random measure on $\R^d$ that assigns to any
measurable set $A\subset \R^d$ the amount of intersection local time of the
motions spent in $A$ by time $t$. Earlier results of Chen \cite{Ch09} derived
the logarithmic asymptotics of the upper tails of the total mass $\ell_t(\R^d)$
as $t\to\infty$. In this paper, we derive a large-deviation principle for the
normalised intersection measure $t^{-p}\ell_t$ on the set of positive measures
on some open bounded set $B\subset\R^d$ as $t\to\infty$ before exiting $B$. The
rate function is explicit and gives some rigorous meaning, in this asymptotic
regime, to the understanding that the intersection measure is the pointwise
product of the densities of the normalised occupation times measures of the $p$
motions. Our proof makes the classical Donsker-Varadhan principle for the
latter applicable to the intersection measure.
  A second version of our principle is proved for the motions observed until
the individual exit times from $B$, conditional on a large total mass in some
compact set $U\subset B$. This extends earlier studies on the intersection
measure by K\"onig and M\"orters \cite{KM01,KM05}.
