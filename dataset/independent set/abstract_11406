We suggested a one-fluid model of a turbulent dilute suspension which
accounts for the ``two-way'' fluid-particle interactions by $k$-dependent
effective density of suspension and additional damping term in the
Navier-Stokes equation. We presented analytical description of the particle
modification of turbulence including scale invariant suppression of a small $k$
part of turbulent spectrum (independent of the particle response time) and
possible enhancemenent of large $k$ region [up to the factor $(1+\phi)^{2/3}$].
Our results are in agreement with qualitative picture of isotropic homogeneous
turbulence of dilute suspensions previously observed in laboratory and
numerical experiments.
