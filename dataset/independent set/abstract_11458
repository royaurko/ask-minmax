We use the hyperspherical adiabatic expansion method to discuss the the two
mechanisms of sequential and direct three-body decay. Both short-range and
Coulomb interactions are included. Resonances are assumed initially populated
by a process independent of the subsequent decay. The lowest adiabatic
potentials describe the resonances rather accurately at distances smaller than
the outer turning point of the confining barrier. We illustrate with realistic
examples of nuclei from neutron ($^{6}$He) and proton ($^{17}$Ne) driplines as
well as excited states of beta-stable nuclei ($^{12}$C).
