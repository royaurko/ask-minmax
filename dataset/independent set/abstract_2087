To successfully complete a complex project, be it a construction of an
airport or of a backbone IT system or crowd-sourced projects, agents (companies
or individuals) must form a team (a coalition) having required competences and
resources. A team can be formed either by the project issuer based on
individual agents' offers (centralized formation); or by the agents themselves
(decentralized formation) bidding for a project as a consortium---in that case
many feasible teams compete for the employment contract. In these models, we
investigate rational strategies of the agents (what salary should they ask?
with whom should they team up?) under different organizations of the market. We
propose various concepts allowing to characterize the stability of the winning
teams. We show that there may be no (rigorously) strongly winning coalition,
but the weakly winning and the auction-winning coalitions are guaranteed to
exist. In a general setting, with an oracle that decides whether a coalition is
feasible, we show how to find winning coalitions with a polynomial number of
calls to the oracle. We also determine the complexity of the problem in a
special case in which a project is a set of independent tasks. Each task must
be processed by a single agent, but processing speeds differ between agents and
tasks.
