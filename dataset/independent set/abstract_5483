Cellular automata are discrete dynamical systems and a model of computation.
The limit set of a cellular automaton consists of the configurations having an
infinite sequence of preimages. It is well known that these always contain a
computable point and that any non-trivial property on them is undecidable. We
go one step further in this article by giving a full characterization of the
sets of Turing degrees of cellular automata: they are the same as the sets of
Turing degrees of effectively closed sets containing a computable point.
