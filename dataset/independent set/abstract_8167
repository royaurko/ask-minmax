Head-elementary-set-free programs were proposed in (Gebser et al. 2007) and
shown to generalize over head-cycle-free programs while retaining their nice
properties. It was left as an open problem in (Gebser et al. 2007) to establish
the complexity of identifying head-elementary-set-free programs. This note
solves the open problem, by showing that the problem is complete for co-NP.
