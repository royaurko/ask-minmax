We study the possibility for branching random walks in random environment
(BRWRE) to survive. The particles perform simple symmetric random walks on the
$d$-dimensional integer lattice, while at each time unit, they split into
independent copies according to time-space i.i.d. offspring distributions. As
noted by Comets and Yoshida, the BRWRE is naturally associated with the
directed polymers in random environment (DPRE), for which the quantity $\Psi$
called the free energy is well studied. Comets and Yoshida proved that there is
no survival when $\Psi<0$ and that survival is possible when $\Psi>0$. We
proved here that, except for degenerate cases, the BRWRE always die when
$\Psi=0$. This solves a conjecture of Comets and Yoshida.
