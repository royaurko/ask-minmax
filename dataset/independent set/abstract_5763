We study chiral models with SU(3) group structure such as Skyrmion and chiral
bag to yield theoretical predictions of proton strange form factor comparable
to the recent experimental data of the SAMPLE Collaboration. For these
predictions we formulate model independent sum rules for proton strange form
factor in terms of baryon octet magnetic moments. We also investigate the
Becci-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin symmetries associated with the St\"uckelberg
coordinates, ghosts and anti-ghosts involved in the Skyrmion model.
