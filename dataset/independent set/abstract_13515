We present a preliminary analysis of the cool pulsating white dwarf GD 1212,
enabled by more than 11.5 days of space-based photometry obtained during an
engineering test of the two-reaction-wheel-controlled Kepler spacecraft. We
detect at least 19 independent pulsation modes, ranging from 828.2-1220.8 s,
and at least 17 nonlinear combination frequencies of those independent
pulsations. Our longest uninterrupted light curve, 9.0 days in length,
evidences coherent difference frequencies at periods inaccessible from the
ground, up to 14.5 hr, the longest-period signals ever detected in a pulsating
white dwarf. These results mark some of the first science to come from a
two-wheel-controlled Kepler spacecraft, proving the capability for
unprecedented discoveries afforded by extending Kepler observations to the
ecliptic.
