A new qubit tomography protocol is introduced, based on a continuous positive
operator valued measure, which is supported by the set of pure states, and
equivariant under the symmetry group SO(3,R) of the qubit state space. Thus the
sample data for the tomography protocol is a discrete set of points on the
Bloch sphere obtained by a series of independent measurements on identical
replicas of the qubit. Although the maximum likelihood estimator uniquely
exists, it cannot be explicitly calculated. Instead, we present another
convenient, simple estimator, show that it is unbiased and calculate its
variance. Furthermore, a detailed account is given about known properties of
related discrete qubit state estimation protocols (like ``minimal qubit
tomography''), and the results are compared, discussed.
