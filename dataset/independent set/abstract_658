In this work we present a minimal parametrization of the light-cone
distribution amplitudes of the baryon octet including higher twist
contributions. Simultaneously we obtain the quark mass dependence of the
amplitudes at leading one-loop accuracy by the use of three-flavor baryon
chiral perturbation theory (BChPT), which automatically yields
model-independent results for the leading $SU(3)$ flavor breaking effects. For
that purpose we have constructed the nonlocal light-cone three-quark operators
in terms of baryon octet and meson fields and have carried out a
next-to-leading order BChPT calculation. We were able to find a minimal set of
distribution amplitudes (DAs) that do not mix under chiral extrapolation
towards the physical point and naturally embed the $\Lambda$ baryon.
Additionally they are chosen in such a way that all DAs of a certain symmetry
class have a similar quark mass dependence (independent of the twist of the
corresponding amplitude), which allows for a compact presentation. The results
are well-suited for the extrapolation of lattice data and for model building.
