The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we will present recent results
on the data processing for LISA, including algorithms for elimination of clock
jitter noise and discussion of the generation of the data averages that will
eventually need to be telemetered to the ground. Second, we will argue, based
partly on these results, that a laser interferometer tracking system (LITS)
that employs independent lasers in each spacecraft is preferable for reasons of
simplicity to that in which the lasers in two of the spacecraft are locked to
the incoming beam from the third.
