Irregular repeat-accumulate Root-Check LDPC codes based on Progressive Edge
Growth (PEG) techniques for block-fading channels are proposed. The proposed
Root-Check LDPC codes are {both suitable for channels under $F = 2, 3$
independent fadings per codeword and} for fast fading channels. An IRA(A)
Root-Check structure is devised for $F = 2, 3$ independent fadings. The
performance of the new codes is investigated in terms of the Frame Error Rate
(FER). Numerical results show that the IRAA LDPC codes constructed by the
proposed algorithm {outperform by about 1dB the existing} IRA Root-Check LDPC
codes under fast-fading channels.
