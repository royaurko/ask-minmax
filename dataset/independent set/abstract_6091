We present an experimental system to study the Bose polaron by immersion of
single, well-controllable neutral Cs impurities into a Rb Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC). We show that, by proper optical traps, independent control
over impurity and BEC allows for precision relative positioning of the two
sub-systems as well as for independent read-out. We furthermore estimate that
measuring the polaron binding energy of Fr\"ohlich-type Bose polarons in the
low and intermediate coupling regime is feasible with our experimental
constraints and limitations discussed.
