We show that a class of Affleck--Dine baryogenesis directly relates the
observed mass density of baryons, \Omega_{B}, to that of dark matter,
\Omega_{DM}. In this scenario, the ratio of baryon to dark matter mass density
is solely determined by the low energy parameters, except for an O(0.1)
effective CP-violating phase. We find that \Omega_{B}/\Omega_{DM}=O(0.1) with
reasonable parameters, which lies surprisingly just in the range of
observation. This scenario is totally free from the cosmological gravitino
problem, and independent of the detailed history of the Universe as long as it
satisfies quite weak constraints.
