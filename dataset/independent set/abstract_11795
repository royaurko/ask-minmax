We prove that smooth projective varieties with equivalent derived categories
have isogenous (and sometimes isomorphic) Picard varieties. In particular their
irregularity and number of independent vector fields are the same. This is turn
implies, in combination with the invariance of Hochschild homology, that all
Hodge numbers are the same for arbitrary derived equivalent threefolds.
