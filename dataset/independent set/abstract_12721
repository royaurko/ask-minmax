We investigate metric independent, gauge invariant and closed forms in the
generalized YM theory. These forms are polynomial on the corresponding fields
strength tensors - curvature forms and are analogous to the Pontryagin-Chern
densities in the YM gauge theory. The corresponding secondary characteristic
classes have been expressed in integral form in analogy with the Chern-Simons
form. Because they are not unique, the secondary forms can be dramatically
simplified by the addition of properly chosen differentials of
one-step-lower-order forms. Their gauge variation can also be found yielding
the potential anomalies in the gauge field theory.
