Astrophysical models of primordial star formation require rate constants for
three-body recombination as input. The current status of these rates for H2 due
to collisions with H is far from satisfactory, with published rate constants
showing orders of magnitude disagreement at the temperatures relevant for H2
formation in primordial gas. This letter presents an independent calculation of
this recombination rate constant as a function of temperature. An analytic
expression is provided for the rate constant which should be more reliable than
ones currently being used in astrophysical models.
