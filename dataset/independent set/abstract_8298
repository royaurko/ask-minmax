The 2012 International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) Mock Data Challenge (MDC)
is designed to test current Gravitational Wave (GW) detection algorithms. Here
we will briefly outline two detection algorithms for a stochastic background of
gravitational waves, namely, a first-order likelihood method and an optimal
statistic method and present our results from the closed MDC data sets.
