We show here that the Nielsen core of the bumping set of the domain of
discontinuity of a Kleinian group $\Gamma$ is the boundary of the
characteristic submanifold of the associated 3-manifold with boundary. Some
examples of interesting characteristic submanifolds are given. We also give a
construction of the characteristic submanifold directly from the Nielsen core
of the bumping set. The proofs are from "first principles", using properties of
uniform domains and the fact that quasi-conformal discs are uniform domains.
