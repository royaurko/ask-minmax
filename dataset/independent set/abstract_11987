For constrained system which has several independent first integrals, we give
a new stabilization method which named adjustment-stabilization method. It can
stabilize all known constants of motion for a given dynamical system very well
instead of the stabilization and post-stabilization methods which only
conserves one of all first integrals. Further more, new method can improve
numerical accuracy too. We also point out the post-stabilization is just a
simplest case of the new method.
