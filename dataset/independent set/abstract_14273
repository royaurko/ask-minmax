We report the final CDF measurement of the $B^0_s$ mixing phase, mean
lifetime, and decay-width difference through the fit of the time evolution of
flavor-tagged $B^0_s \rightarrow J/\psi \phi$ decays. The measurement is based
on the full data set of 1.96 TeV $p\bar{p}$ collisions collected between
February 2002 and September 2011 by the CDF experiment. The results are
consistent with the standard model and other experimental determinations and
are amongst the most precise to date.
