Physics at the ILC is reviewed focusing mostly on Higgs physics. It is
emphasized that at the ILC it is possible to measure the $hZZ$ coupling totally
model independently, which in turn allows model-independent normalization of
various branching ratio measurements and consequently the absolute measurements
of corresponding couplings. Combining them with the measurements of the top
Yukawa coupling and the Higgs self-coupling at higher energies, the full ILC
program is shown to allow a precision test of the mass-coupling relation.
