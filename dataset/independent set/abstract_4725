A method of calculations of meson mass spectra in the framework of the model
of quasi-independent quarks is discussed. Meson mass spectra evaluated with the
help of the Dirac equation with the quasi-Coulombic potential and the
confinement potential, as well as with the help of phenomenological mass
formulae, are presented. Parameters of the quasi-independent quarks model,
which are calulated on the basis of mass values of pseudoscalar and vector
mesons, are given. Possible relations between parameters of the
quasi-independent quarks model and constants of the Standard model of strong
and electroweak interactions are considered.
