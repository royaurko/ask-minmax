In this paper we extend the work of Rautenbach and Szwarcfiter by giving a
structural characterization of graphs that can be represented by the
intersection of unit intervals that may or may not contain their endpoints. A
characterization was proved independently by Joos, however our approach
provides an algorithm that produces such a representation, as well as a
forbidden graph characterization.
