We show that the existence of measurable envelopes of all subsets of $\RR^n$
with respect to the $d$-dimensional Hausdorff measure $(0<d<n)$ is independent
of $ZFC$. We also investigate the consistency of the existence of Sierpi\'nski
sets measurable with respect to the $d$-dimensional Hausdorff measure.
