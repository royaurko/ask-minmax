We revisit astrophysical constraints on models with an ultra-light gravitino,
in particular extending the analysis to more general models and the case of
R-parity breaking. These constraints allow to restrict the value of the
gravitino mass depending on the masses of scalar moduli. We perform both a
frequentist and bayesian analysis and we find comparable results, even if the
bayesian analysis is in part affected by volume effects. Only a small window of
gravitino masses can be excluded by the SN constraints in a model-independent
way, while limits obtained with a definite assumption on the scalar masses
result more stringent.
