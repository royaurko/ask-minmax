Lower limits are found for the disorder resistivity of solid neutron-star
matter in the neutron-drip region which is amorphous and heterogeneous in
nuclear charge. This temperature-independent resistivity, large compared with
that produced by phonon scattering, has direct consequences for theories of
neutron-star magnetic field generation and evolution.
