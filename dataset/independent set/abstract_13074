Conceptual framework is laid out of a deterministic program capable of
obtaining optimum solutions with or without constraints for any reasonably
behaved analytical system. Determinism means no inspired initial guesses or
random number trials. The program follows well-defined steps between
well-defined start and end points, to a large extent configuration independent.
This program is also conjectured to lead to global optimum solutions based on
evidence, short of a proof. Application to realistic problems is given as
example.
