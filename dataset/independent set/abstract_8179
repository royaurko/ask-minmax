In this paper we show that BPP is truth-table reducible to the set of
Kolmogorov random strings R_K. It was previously known that PSPACE, and hence
BPP is Turing-reducible to R_K. The earlier proof relied on the adaptivity of
the Turing-reduction to find a Kolmogorov-random string of polynomial length
using the set R_K as oracle. Our new non-adaptive result relies on a new
fundamental fact about the set R_K, namely each initial segment of the
characteristic sequence of R_K is not compressible by recursive means. As a
partial converse to our claim we show that strings of high
Kolmogorov-complexity when used as advice are not much more useful than
randomly chosen strings.
