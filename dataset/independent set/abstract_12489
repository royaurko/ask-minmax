The Galilean transformations of the few-electron atomic wave functions are
considered. We discuss the few-electron wave functions constructed in the model
of independent electrons as well as the truly correlated (or highly accurate)
wave functions. Results of our analysis are applied to determine the
probability of formation of the negatively charged tritium/protium ions during
the nuclear $(n,{}^{3}$He$;t,p)-$reaction of the helium-3 atoms with
thermal/slow neutrons.
