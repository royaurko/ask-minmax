Quadrupole and hexadecapole moments of superdeformed bands in the
$A$$\sim$150 mass region have been analyzed in the cranking Skyrme-Hartree-Fock
model. It is demonstrated that, independently of the intrinsic configuration
and of the proton and neutron numbers, the charge moments calculated with
respect to the doubly-magic superdeformed core of $^{152}$Dy can be expressed
very precisely in terms of independent contributions from the individual hole
and particle orbitals. This result, together with earlier studies of the
moments of inertia distributions, suggests that many features of the
superdeformed bands in the $A$$\sim$150 mass region can be very well understood
in terms of an almost undisturbed single-particle motion.
