The coherence of a random matrix, which is defined to be the largest
magnitude of the Pearson correlation coefficients between the columns of the
random matrix, is an important quantity for a wide range of applications
including high-dimensional statistics and signal processing. Inspired by these
applications, this paper studies the limiting laws of the coherence of $n\times
p$ random matrices for a full range of the dimension $p$ with a special focus
on the ultra high-dimensional setting. Assuming the columns of the random
matrix are independent random vectors with a common spherical distribution, we
give a complete characterization of the behavior of the limiting distributions
of the coherence. More specifically, the limiting distributions of the
coherence are derived separately for three regimes: $\frac{1}{n}\log p \to 0$,
$\frac{1}{n}\log p \to \beta\in (0, \infty)$, and $\frac{1}{n}\log p
\to\infty$. The results show that the limiting behavior of the coherence
differs significantly in different regimes and exhibits interesting phase
transition phenomena as the dimension $p$ grows as a function of $n$.
Applications to statistics and compressed sensing in the ultra high-dimensional
setting are also discussed.
