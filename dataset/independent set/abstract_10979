The possibility to constrain the meson distribution amplitude from the
transitions of virtual photons to pseudoscalar mesons is investigated. It is
shown that for a large range in the two photon virtualities the transition form
factors are essentially independent of the distribution amplitudes. This in
turn entails parameter-free predictions of QCD.
