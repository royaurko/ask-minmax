In this paper, we present the point symmetry group of three-dimensional
homogeneous Helmholtz equation, when we consider the cylindrical coordinate
system. In continuation, we present a complete set of functionally independent
invariants of the equation along with the form of the general solution provided
by these invariants. Finally, we find an optimal system of one-dimensional Lie
subgroups of the full symmetry group.
