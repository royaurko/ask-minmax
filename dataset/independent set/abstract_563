In this paper, we essentially compute the set of $x,y>0$ such that the
mapping $z \longmapsto \Big{(}1-r+r e^z\Big{)}^x
\Big{(}\dis\frac{\lambda}{\lambda-z}\Big{)}^{y}$ is a Laplace transform. If $X$
and $Y$ are two independent random variables which have respectively Bernoulli
and Gamma distributions, we denote by $\mu$ the distribution of $X+Y.$ The
above problem is equivalent to finding the set of $x>0$ such that
$\mu^{{\ast}x}$ exists.
