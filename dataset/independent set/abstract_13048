In this paper, we investigate the precise local large deviation probabilities
for random sums of independent real-valued random variables with a common
distribution $F$, where $F(x+\Delta)=F((x, x+T])$ is an $\mathcal{O}$-regularly
varying function for some fixed constant $T>0$(finite or infinite). We also
obtain some results on precise local large deviation probabilities for the
claim surplus process of generalized risk models in which the premium income
until time $t$ is simply assumed to be a nondecreasing and nonnegative
stochastic process. In particular, the results we obtained are also valid for
the global case, i.e. case $T=\infty$.
