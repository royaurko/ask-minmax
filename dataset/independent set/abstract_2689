A random Heegaard splitting is a 3-manifold obtained by using a random walk
of length n on the mapping class group as the gluing map between two
handlebodies. We show that the joint distribution of random walks of length n
and their inverses is asymptotically independent, and converges to the product
of the harmonic and reflected harmonic measures defined by the random walk. We
use this to show that the translation length on the curve complex of a random
walk grows linearly in the length of the walk, and similarly, that distance in
the curve complex between the disc sets of a random Heegaard splitting grows
linearly in n. In particular, this implies that a random Heegaard splitting is
hyperbolic with asymptotic probability one.
