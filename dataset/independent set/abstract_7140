We analyse properties of galaxy groups and their dependence on the large
scale environment as defined by superstructures. We find that group galaxy
cross correlations depend only on group properties regardless the groups reside
in superstructures. This indicates that the total galaxy density profile around
groups is independent of the global environment. At a given global luminosity,
a proxy to group total mass, groups have a larger stellar mass content by a
factor 1.3, a relative excess independent of the group luminosity. Groups in
superstructures have 40 per cent higher velocity dispersions and systematically
larger minimal enclosing radii. We also find that the stellar population of
galaxies in groups in superstructures is systematically older as infered from
the galaxy spectra Dn4000 parameter. Although the galaxy number density profile
of groups is independent of environment, the star formation rate and stellar
mass profile of the groups residing in superstructures differs from groups
elsewhere. For groups residing in superstructures, the combination of a larger
stellar mass content and star formation rate produces a larger time scale for
star formation regardless the distance to the group center. Our results provide
evidence that groups in superstructures formed earlier than elsewhere, as
expected in the assembly bias scenario.
