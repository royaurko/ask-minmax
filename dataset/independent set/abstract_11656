Hyperfine induced $1s2s ^1S_0 \to 1s^2 ^1S_0$ M1 transition probabilities of
He-like ions have been calculated from relativistic configuration interaction
wavefunctions including the frequency independent Breit interaction and QED
effects. Present results for {$^{151}$}Eu and {$^{155}$}Gd are in good
agreement with previous calculations [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 63}, 054105 (2001)].
Electronic data are given in terms of a general scaling law in $Z$ that, given
isotopic nuclear spin and magnetic moment, allows hyperfine induced decay rates
to be estimated for any isotope. The results should be helpful for future
experimental investigations on QED and parity non-conservation effects.
