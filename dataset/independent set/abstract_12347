We report a dielectric relaxation in ferroelectric thin films of the ABO3
family. We have compared films of different compositions with several growth
modes: sputtering (with and without magnetron) and sol-gel. The relaxation was
observed at cryogenic temperature (T<100K) for frequencies from 100Hz up to
10MHz. This relaxation activation energy is always lower than 200meV. It is
very similar to the polaron relaxation that we reported in the parent bulk
perovskites. Being independent of the materials size, morphology and texture,
this relaxation can be a useful probe of defects in actual integrated
capacitors with no need for specific shaping
