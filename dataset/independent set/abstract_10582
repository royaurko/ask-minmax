We report here how artificial, thus erroneous, scaling laws of the dynamical
magnetic susceptibility can be obtained when data are not treated carefully. We
consider the example of the heavy-fermion system
Ce$_{0.925}$La$_{0.075}$Ru$_{2}$Si$_{2}$ and we explain how different kinds of
artificial scaling laws in $E/T^\beta$ can be plotted in a low temperature
regime where the dynamical susceptibility is nearly temperature independent.
