Working toward a model independent understanding of cosmic microwave
background (CMB) anisotropies and their significance, we undertake a
comprehensive and self-contained study of scalar perturbation theory. Initial
conditions, evolution, thermal history, matter content, background dynamics,
and geometry all play a role in determining the anisotropy. By employing {\it
analytic} techniques to illuminate the numerical results, we are able to
separate and identify each contribution. We thus bring out the nature of the
{\it total} Sachs-Wolfe effect, acoustic oscillations, diffusion damping,
Doppler shifts, and reionization, as well as their particular manifestation in
a critical, curvature, or cosmological constant dominated universe. By studying
the full angular {\it and} spatial content of the resultant anisotropies, we
isolate the signature of these effects from the dependence on initial
conditions. Whereas structure in the Sachs-Wolfe anisotropy depends strongly on
the underlying power spectra, the acoustic oscillations provide features which
are nearly model independent. This may allow for future determination of the
matter content of the universe as well as the adiabatic and/or isocurvature
nature of the initial fluctuations.
