No, it cannot in the following sense if a self-gravitating vacuum brane is
concerned. Once we write down the full set of linear perturbation equations of
the system containing a self-gravitating brane, we will see that such a brane
does not have its own dynamical degrees of freedom independent of those of
gravitational waves which propagate in the surrounding spacetime. This
statement seems to contradict with our intuition that a brane fluctuates freely
on a given background spacetime in the lowest order approximation. Based on
this intuition, we usually think that the dynamics of a brane can be
approximately described by the equations derived from the Nambu-Goto action. In
this paper we fill the gap residing between these two descriptions, showing
that the dynamics of a self-gravitating brane is in fact similar to that
described by a non-gravitating brane on a fixed background spacetime when the
weak backreaction condition we propose in this paper is satisfied.
