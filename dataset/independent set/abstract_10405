We question the validity of the grand canonical ensemble for the description
of Bose-Einstein condensation of small ideal Bose gas samples in isolated
harmonic traps. While the ground state fraction and the specific heat capacity
can be well approximated with the help of the conventional grand canonical
arguments, the calculation of the fluctuation of the number of particles
contained in the condensate requires a microcanonical approach. Resorting to
the theory of restricted partitions of integer numbers, we present analytical
and numerical results for such fluctuations in one- and three-dimensional
traps, and show that their magnitude is essentially independent of the total
particle number.
