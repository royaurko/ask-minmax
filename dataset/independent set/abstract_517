We compare the independent FIRAS and DIRBE observations from the COBE in the
wavelength range 100-300 microns. This cross calibration provides checks of
both data sets. The results show that the data sets are consistent within the
estimated gain and offset uncertainties of the two instruments. They show the
possibility of improving the gain and offset determination of DIRBE at 140 and
240 microns.
