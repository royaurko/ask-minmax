We investigate the dimension theory of inhomogeneous self-affine carpets.
Through the work of Olsen, Snigireva and Fraser, the dimension theory of
inhomogeneous self-similar sets is now relatively well-understood, however,
almost no progress has been made concerning more general non-conformal
inhomogeneous attractors. If a dimension is countably stable, then the results
are immediate and so we focus on the upper and lower box dimensions and compute
these explicitly for large classes of inhomogeneous self-affine carpets.
Interestingly, we find that the `expected formula' for the upper box dimension
can fail in the self-affine setting and we thus reveal new phenomena, not
occurring in the simpler self-similar case.
