Our in silico model was built to investigate the development process of the
adaptive immune system. For simplicity, we concentrated on humoral immunity and
its major components: T cells, B cells, antibodies, interleukins, non-immune
self cells, and foreign antigens. Our model is a microscopic one, similar to
the interacting particle models of statistical physics. Events are considered
random and modelled by a continuous time, finite state Markov process, that is,
they are controlled by independent exponential clocks. Our main purpose was to
compare different theoretical models of the adaptive immune system and
self--nonself discrimination: the ones that are described by well-known
textbooks, and a novel one developed by our research group. Our theoretical
model emphasizes the hypothesis that the immune system of a fetus can primarily
learn what self is but unable to prepare itself for the huge, unknown variety
of nonself.
  The simulation begins after conception, by developing the immune system from
scratch and learning the set of self antigens. The simulation ends several
months after births when a more-or-less stationary state of the immune system
has been established. We investigate how the immune system can recognize and
fight against a primary infection. We also investigate that under what
conditions can an immune memory be created that results in a more effective
immune response to a repeated infection.
