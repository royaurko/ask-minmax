DIS of unpolarized electron by tensor-polarized deuteron with tagged
collinear photon, radiated from initial electron, was considered. The cross
section is derived in the Born approximation. The model-independent QED
corrections to the Born cross section are also calculated using approach based
on the account of all essential Feynman diagrams.
