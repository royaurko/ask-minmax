We present the Flavour Les Houches Accord (FLHA) which specifies a unique set
of conventions for flavour-related parameters and observables. The FLHA uses
the generic SUSY Les Houches Accord (SLHA) file structure. It defines the
relevant Standard Model masses, Wilson coefficients, decay constants, bag
parameters, flavour observables, etc. The accord provides a universal and
model-independent interface between codes evaluating and/or using
flavour-related observables.
