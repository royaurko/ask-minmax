We present a variant of the supereigenvalue model proposed before by
Alvarez-Gaume, Itoyama, Manes, and Zadra. This model derives a set of three
planar loop equations which takes the same form as the set of three anomalous
Ward-Takahashi identities on the gaugino condensates recently derived by
Cachazo, Douglas, Seiberg and Witten. Another model which implements N=2
superVirasoro constraints is constructed for comparison.
