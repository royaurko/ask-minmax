A function $f:X\to Y$ between topological spaces is said to be a {\it weakly
Gibson function} if $f(\overline{U})\subseteq \overline{f(U)}$ for any open
connected set \mbox{$U\subseteq X$}. We prove that if $X$ is a locally
connected hereditarily Baire space and $Y$ is a $T_1$-space then an
$F_\sigma$-measurable mapping $f:X\to Y$ is weakly Gibson if and only if for
any connected set $C\subseteq X$ with the dense connected interior
  the image $f(C)$ is connected. Moreover, we show that each weakly Gibson
$F_\sigma$-measurable mapping $f:\mathbb R^n\to Y$, where $Y$ is a $T_1$-space,
has a connected graph.
