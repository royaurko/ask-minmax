We discuss how to determine and combine upper limits based on observed events
and estimated backgrounds with a Bayesian method, when insignificant signals
are observed in independent measurements. In addition to some general features
deduced from the analytical formulae, systematic numerical results are obtained
by a C$++$ program (CULBA) for low-count experiments, which can be used as a
reference to combine two upper limits.
