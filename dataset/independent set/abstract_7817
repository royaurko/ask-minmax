We report on recent developments in the phenomenology of exclusive b -> s
mu^+ mu^- decays in testing the standard model and explore its borders: the
benefits of the region of large dimuon invariant masses and the exploitation of
the angular distributions. Consequences of model-independent analyses from
current and future data are pointed out.
