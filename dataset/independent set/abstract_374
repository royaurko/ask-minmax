In the present paper we discuss an independent on the Grothendieck-Sato
isomorphism approach to the Riemann-Roch-Hirzebruch formula for an arbitrary
differential operator. Instead of the Grothendieck-Sato isomorphism, we use the
Topological Quantum Mechanics (more or less equivalent to the well-known
constructions with the Massey operations from [KS], [P], [Me]). The statement
that the Massey operations can "produce" the integral in some set-up, has an
independent from the RRH theorem interest.
  We finish the paper by some open questions arising when the main construction
is applied to the cyclic homology (instead of the Hochschild homology).
