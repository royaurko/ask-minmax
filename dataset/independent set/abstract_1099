Let f_1,...,f_N be commuting germs of holomorphic diffeomorphisms in C fixing
the origin with irrational rationally independent rotation numbers
alpha_1,...,alpha_N. We adapt Yoccoz' renormalization of germs to this setting
to show that a Brjuno-type condition on simultaneous Diophantine
approximability of the rotation numbers is sufficient for simultaneous
linearizability of f_1,...,f_N. This generalizes a result of Moser's. In the
absence of periodic orbits we show that a weaker arithmetic condition analogous
to that of Perez-Marco's for the case of a single germ is sufficent for
linearizability. We also obtain lower bounds for the conformal radii of the
Siegel disks in both cases in terms of the arithmetic functions defining the
arithmetic conditions.
