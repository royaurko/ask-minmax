We perform a model-independent analysis of solar neutrino flux rates
including the recent charged-current measurement at the Sudbury Neutrino
Observatory (SNO). We derive a universal sum rule involving SNO and
SuperKamiokande rates, and show that the SNO neutral-current measurement can
not fix the fraction of solar $\nu_e$ oscillating to sterile neutrinos. The
large uncertainty in the SSM $^8$B flux impedes a determination of the sterile
neutrino fraction.
