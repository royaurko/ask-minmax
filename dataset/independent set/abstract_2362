The exclusive gamma-met signal has a small standard model cross-section and
is thus a good channel in which to look for signs of new physics. This
signature is predicted by models with a superlight gravitino or with large
extra spatial dimensions. We search for such signals at the CDF detector at the
Tevatron, using 87 pb^-1 of data at sqrt(s) = 1.8 TeV, and extract 95% C.L.
limits on these processes. A limit of 221 GeV is set on the scale |F|^{1/2} in
supersymmetry models. For 4, 6, and 8 extra dimensions, limits on the
fundamental mass scale M_D of 549, 581, and 602 GeV, respectively, are found.
We also specify a `pseudo-model-independent' method of comparing the results to
theoretical predictions.
