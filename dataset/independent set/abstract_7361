The identification of predefined groups of genes ("gene-sets") which are
differentially expressed between two conditions ("gene-set analysis", or GSA)
is a very popular analysis in bioinformatics. GSA incorporates biological
knowledge by aggregating over genes that are believed to be functionally
related. This can enhance statistical power over analyses that consider only
one gene at a time. However, currently available GSA approaches are all based
on univariate two-sample comparison of single genes. This means that they
cannot test for differences in covariance structure between the two conditions.
Yet interplay between genes is a central aspect of biological investigation and
it is likely that such interplay may differ between conditions. This paper
proposes a novel approach for gene-set analysis that allows for truly
multivariate hypotheses, in particular differences in gene-gene networks
between conditions. Testing hypotheses concerning networks is challenging due
the nature of the underlying estimation problem. Our starting point is a
recent, general approach for high-dimensional two-sample testing. We refine the
approach and show how it can be used to perform multivariate, network-based
gene-set testing. We validate the approach in simulated examples and show
results using high-throughput data from several studies in cancer biology.
