The objectives of the present work are twofold. The first is to address and
resolve some of the differences present in independent,
chiral-effective-field-theory (\chiEFT) derivations up to one loop, recently
appeared in the literature, of the nuclear charge and current operators. The
second objective is to provide a complete set of \chiEFT predictions for the
structure functions and tensor polarization of the deuteron, for the charge and
magnetic form factors of 3He and 3H, and for the charge and magnetic radii of
these few-nucleon systems. The calculations use wave functions derived from
high-order chiral two- and three-nucleon potentials and Monte Carlo methods to
evaluate the relevant matrix elements. Predictions based on conventional
potentials in combination with \chiEFT charge and current operators are also
presented. There is excellent agreement between theory and experiment for all
these observables for momentum transfers up to q< 2.0-2.5 (1/fm); for a subset
of them, this agreement extends to momentum transfers as high as q~5-6 (1/fm).
A complete analysis of the results is provided.
