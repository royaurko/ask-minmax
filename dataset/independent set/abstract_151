This paper demonstrates the existence of a finite set of equilibria in the
case of the indeterminacy of linear rational expectations models. The number of
equilibria corresponds to the number of ways to select n eigenvectors among a
larger set of eigenvectors related to stable eigenvalues. A finite set of
equilibria is a substitute to continuous (uncountable) sets of sunspots
equilibria, when the number of independent eigenvectors for each stable
eigenvalue is equal to one.
