We present a compact FPGA-based pulse sequencer and radio-frequency (RF)
generator suitable for experiments with cold trapped ions and atoms. The unit
is capable of outputting a pulse sequence with at least 32 TTL channels with a
timing resolution of 40 ns and contains a built-in 100 MHz frequency counter
for counting electrical pulses from a photo-multiplier tube (PMT). There are 16
independent direct-digital-synthesizers (DDS) RF sources with fast (rise-time
of ~60 ns) amplitude switching and sub-mHz frequency tuning from 0 to 800 MHz.
