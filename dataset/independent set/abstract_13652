The renormalization of a quadratic-like map is studied. The
three-dimensional Yoccoz puzzle for an infinitely renormalizable
quadratic-like map is discussed. For an unbranched quadratic-like map having
the {\sl a priori} complex bounds, the local connectivity of its Julia set is
proved by using the three-dimensional Yoccoz puzzle. The generalized version
of Sullivan's sector theorem is discussed and is used to prove his result that
the Feigenbaum quadratic polynomial has the {\sl a priori} complex bounds and
is unbranched. A dense subset on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set is
constructed so that for every point of the subset, the corresponding quadratic
polynomial is unbranched and has the {\sl a priori} complex bounds.
