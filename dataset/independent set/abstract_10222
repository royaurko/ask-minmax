Protecting personal information privacy has become a controversial issue
among online social network providers and users. Most social network providers
have developed several techniques to decrease threats and risks to the users
privacy. These risks include the misuse of personal information which may lead
to illegal acts such as identity theft. This study aims to measure the
awareness of users on protecting their personal information privacy, as well as
the suitability of the privacy systems which they use to modify privacy
settings. Survey results show high percentage of the use of smart phones for
web services but the current privacy settings for online social networks need
to be improved to support different type of mobile phones screens. Because most
users use their mobile phones for Internet services, privacy settings that are
compatible with mobile phones need to be developed. The method of selecting
privacy settings should also be simplified to provide users with a clear
picture of the data that will be shared with others. Results of this study can
be used to develop a new privacy system which will help users control their
personal information easily from different devices, including mobile Internet
devices and computers.
