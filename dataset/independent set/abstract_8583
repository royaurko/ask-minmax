We perform a linear stability analysis of the axisymmetric, relativistic,
self-similar isothermal disk against non-axisymmetric perturbations. Two sets
of neutral modes are discovered. The first set corresponds to marginally
unstable perturbations driven by gravitational radiation, and the other signals
the onset of bifurcation to non-axisymmetric equilibrium solutions to the
Einstein equations.
