We investigate the thermal conductivity of four types of deformed carbon
nanotubes by using the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics method. It is reported
that various deformations have different influence on the thermal properties of
carbon nanotubes. For the bending carbon nanotubes, the thermal conductivity is
independent on the bending angle. However, the thermal conductivity increases
lightly with XY-distortion and decreases rapidly with Z-distortion. The thermal
conductivity does not change with the screw ratio before the breaking of carbon
nanotubes but decreases sharply after the critical screw ratio.
