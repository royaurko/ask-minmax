Low lying scalar resonances emerge as a necessary part to adjust chiral
perturbation theory to experimental data once unitarity constraint is taken
into consideration. I review recent progress made in this direction in a model
independent approach. Also I briefly review studies on the odd physical
properties of these low lying scalar resonances, including in the
$\gamma\gamma\to\pi^+\pi^-, \pi^0\pi^0$ processes.
