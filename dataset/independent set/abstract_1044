We present a ``state-independent'' proof of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem
using only 18 four-dimensional vectors, which is a record for this kind of
proof. This set of vectors contains subsets which allow us to develop a
``state-specific'' proof with 10 vectors (also a record) and a
``probabilistic'' proof with 7 vectors which reflects the algebraic structure
of Hardy's nonlocality theorem.
