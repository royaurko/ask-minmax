We report transport measurements on short ballistic suspended
graphene-Niobium Josephson weak links where we observe a strong gate dependence
of the multiple Andreev reflection associated sub-harmonic gap structures at
low carrier densities. As the Fermi energy is tuned closer to the neutrality
point $(n<10^{10} cm^{-2})$, these sub-harmonic gap structures become more
pronounced whereas the normalized excess current decreases sharply. These
observations differ from the density-independent behavior previously reported
in disordered graphene superconductor junctions. Our results are in qualitative
agreement with theoretical predictions for the emergence of pseudo-diffusive
behavior in ballistic graphene due to charge transmission via evanescent modes.
