After more than thirty years, the only known examples of Anosov
diffeomorphisms are hyperbolic automorphisms of infranilmanifolds. It is also
important to note that the existence of an Anosov automorphism is a really
strong condition on an infranilmanifold. Any Anosov automorphism determines an
automorphism of the (rational) Lie algebra of the Mal'cev completion of the
corresponding lattice which is hyperbolic and unimodular. These two conditions
together are strong enough to make of such rational nilpotent Lie algebras
(called Anosov Lie algebras) very distinguished objects. In this paper, we
classify Anosov Lie algebras of dimension less or equal than 8, which also
classify nilmanifolds admitting an Anosov diffeomorphism in those dimensions.
  As a corollary we obtain that if an infranilmanifold of dimension n<9 admits
an Anosov diffeomorphism f and it is not a torus or a compact flat manifold
(i.e. covered by a torus), then n=6 or 8 and the signature of f necessarily
equals {3,3} or {4,4}, respectively.
  We had to study the set of all rational forms up to isomorphism for many real
Lie algebras, which is a subject on its own and it is treated in a section
completely independent of the rest of the paper.
