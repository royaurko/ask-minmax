The thermal relic abundance of Dark Matter motivates the existence of new
electroweak scale particles, independent of naturalness considerations.
However, most unnatural Dark Matter models do not ensure the presence of new
particles charged under SU(3)_C, resulting in challenging LHC phenomenology.
Here, we present a class of models with scalar electroweak doublet Dark Matter
that require a host of colored particles at the TeV scale. In these models, the
Higgs boson is apparently fine-tuned, but the Dark Matter doublet is kept light
without any additional fine-tuning.
