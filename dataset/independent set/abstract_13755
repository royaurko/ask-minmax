A relevant category is a symmetric monoidal closed category with a diagonal
natural transformation that satisfies some coherence conditions. Every
cartesian closed category is a relevant category in this sense. The
denomination 'relevant' comes from the connection with relevant logic. It is
shown that the category of sets with partial functions, which is isomorphic to
the category of pointed sets, is a category that is relevant, but not cartesian
closed.
