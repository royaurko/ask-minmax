We outline the theory of sets with distributive operations: multishelves and
multispindles, with examples provided by semi-lattices, lattices and skew
lattices. For every such a structure we define multi-term distributive homology
and show some of its properties. The main result is a complete formula for the
homology of a finite distributive lattice. We also indicate the answer for
unital spindles and conjecture the general formula for semi-lattices and some
skew lattices. Then we propose a generalization of a lattice as a set with a
number of idempotent operations satisfying the absorption law.
