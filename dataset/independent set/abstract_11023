The recent proposal of theories with compactified large extra dimensions is
reviewed. We pay especial attention to brane world models with low tension
where the only relevant degrees of freedom at low energies are the Standard
Model (SM) particles and the branons, which are transversal brane oscillations.
By using an effective Lagrangian, we study some phenomenological consequences
of these scenarios in a model independent way.
