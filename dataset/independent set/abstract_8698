We decribe the correspondence between normalised $\omega$-operads and certain
lax monoidal structures on the category of globular sets. As with ordinary
monoidal categories, one has a notion of category enriched in a lax monoidal
category. Within the aforementioned correspondence, we provide also an
equivalence between the algebras of a given normalised $\omega$-operad, and
categories enriched in globular sets for the induced lax monoidal structure.
