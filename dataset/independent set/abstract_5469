We believe that discontinuous linear information is never more powerful than
continuous linear information for approximating continuous operators. We prove
such a result in the worst case setting. In the randomized setting we consider
compact linear operators defined between Hilbert spaces. In this case, the use
of discontinuous linear information in the randomized setting cannot be much
more powerful than continuous linear information in the worst case setting.
These results can be applied when function evaluations are used even if
function values are defined only almost everywhere.
