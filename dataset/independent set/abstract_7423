Given a vertex-coloured graph, a dominating set is said to be tropical if
every colour of the graph appears at least once in the set. Here, we study
minimum tropical dominating sets from structural and algorithmic points of
view. First, we prove that the tropical dominating set problem is NP-complete
even when restricted to a simple path. Then, we establish upper bounds related
to various parameters of the graph such as minimum degree and number of edges.
We also give upper bounds for random graphs. Last, we give approximability and
inapproximability results for general and restricted classes of graphs, and
establish a FPT algorithm for interval graphs.
