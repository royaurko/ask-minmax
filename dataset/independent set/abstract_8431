Illuminating the surface of a convex body with parallel beams of light in a
given direction generates a shadow region. We prove sharp regularity results
for the boundary of this shadow in every direction of illumination. Moreover,
techniques are developed for investigating the regularity of the region
generated by orthogonally projecting a convex set onto another. As an
application we study the geometry and Hausdorff dimension of the singular set
corresponding to a Monge-Ampere equation.
