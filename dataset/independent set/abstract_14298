It is known that a Markov basis of the binary graph model of a graph $G$
corresponds to a set of binomial generators of cut ideals $I_{\widehat{G}}$ of
the suspension $\widehat{G}$ of $G$. In this paper, we give another application
of cut ideals to statistics. We show that a set of binomial generators of cut
ideals is a Markov basis of some regular two-level fractional factorial design.
As application, we give a Markov basis of degree 2 for designs defined by at
most two relations.
