We present a method to calculate masses for components of both eclipsing and
non-eclipsing binary systems as long as their apsidal motion rates are
available. The method is based on the fact that the equation that gives the
rate of apsidal motion is a supplementary equation that allows the computation
of the masses of the components, if the radii and the internal structure
constants of them can be obtained from theoretical models. For this reason the
use of this equation makes the method presented here model dependent.
  We apply this method to calculate the mass of the components of the
non-eclipsing massive binary system HD 93205 (O3V+O8V), which is suspected to
be a very young system. To this end, we computed a grid of evolutionary models
covering the mass range of interest, and taking the mass of the primary (M_1)
as the only independent variable, we solve the equation of apsidal motion for
M_1 as a function of the age of the system. The mass of the primary we find
ranges from M_1= 60+-19 msun for ZAMS models, which sets an upper limit for
M_1, down to M_1= 40+-9 msun for an age of 2 Myr. Accordingly, the upper limit
derived for the mass of the secondary (M_2= Q M_1) is M_2= 25 msun is in very
good agreement with the masses derived for other O8V stars occurring in
eclipsing binaries.
