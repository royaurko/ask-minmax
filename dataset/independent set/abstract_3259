Time reversal, that is prefiltering of transmitted signals with time reversed
channel impulse responses, may be used in single user communications in order
to move complexity from the receiver to the transmitter, and in multiuser
communications to also modify statistical properties of multiuser interference.
Imperfect channel estimation may, however, affect pre- vs. post- filtering
schemes in a different way. This issue is the object of this paper; Robustness
of time reversal vs. All-Rake (AR) transceivers, in multiple access
communications, with respect to channel estimation errors, is investigated.
Results of performance analyses in terms of symbol error probability and
spectral efficiency when the receiver is structured either by a bank of matched
filters or by 1Rake, followed by independent decoders, indicate that AR is
slightly more robust than time reversal but requires in practice more complex
channel estimation procedures since all channels must be simultaneously
inferred in the multiuser communication setting.
