We prove the almost sure convergence of a class of sampling-based
decomposition methods to solve risk-averse multistage stochastic convex
programs that satisfy the relatively complete recourse assumption. We also
prove the almost sure convergence of these algorithms when applied to
risk-averse multistage stochastic linear programs that do not satisfy the
relatively complete recourse assumption. The analysis is first done assuming
the underlying stochastic process is interstage independent and discrete, with
a finite set of possible realizations at each stage. Finally, we indicate two
ways of extending the methods and convergence analysis to the case when the
process is interstage dependent.
