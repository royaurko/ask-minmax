We prove that for every two natural numbers M and N, if Tau is a Borel,
finite, absolutely friendly measure on a compact set K of R^MN, then the
intersection of K and BA(M,N) is a winning set in Schmidt's game sense played
on K, where BA(M,N) is the set of badly approximable M\times N matrices. As an
immediate consequence we have the following application. If K is the attractor
of an irreducible finite family of contracting similarity maps of R^(M\times N)
satisfying the open set condition, (the Cantor ternary set, Koch's curve and
Sierpinski's gasket to name a few examples), the dimK=dimK\capBA(M,N).
