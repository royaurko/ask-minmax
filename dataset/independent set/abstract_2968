Peano defined 'differentiability' of functions and 'lower tangent cones' in
1887, and 'upper tangent cones' in 1903, but uses the latter concept already in
1887 without giving a formal definition. Both cones were defined for arbitrary
sets, as certain limits of appropriate homothetic relations. Around 1930 Severi
and Guareschi, in a series of mutually fecundating individual papers,
characterized differentiability in terms of 'lower tangent cones' and strict
differentiability in terms of 'lower paratangent cones', a notion introduced,
independently, by Severi and Bouligand in 1928. Severi and Guareschi graduated
about 1900 from the University of Turin, where Peano taught till his demise in
1932.
