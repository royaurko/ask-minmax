For positive integers $d$ and $n$, let $[n]^d$ be the set of all vectors
$(a_1,a_2,\dots, a_d)$, where $a_i$ is an integer with $0\leq a_i\leq n-1$. A
subset $S$ of $[n]^d$ is called a \emph{Sidon set} if all sums of two (not
necessarily distinct) vectors in $S$ are distinct.
  In this paper, we estimate two numbers related to the maximum size of Sidon
sets in $[n]^d$. First, let $\mathcal{Z}_{n,d}$ be the number of all Sidon sets
in $[n]^d$. We show that $\log (\mathcal{Z}_{n,d})=\Theta(n^{d/2})$, where the
constants of $\Theta$ depend only on $d$. Next, we estimate the maximum size of
Sidon sets contained in a random set $[n]^d_p$, where $[n]^d_p$ denotes a
random set obtained from $[n]^d$ by choosing each element independently with
probability $p$.
