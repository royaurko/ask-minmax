We investigate the transport of baryon number across phase boundaries in a
putative first order QCD-phase transition. Two independent phenomenological
models are employed to estimate the baryon penetrability at the phase boundary:
chromoelectric flux tube models; and an analogy to baryon-baryon coalescence in
nuclear physics. Our analysis indicates that baryon transport across phase
boundaries may be order of magnitude more efficient than other work has
suggested. We discuss the substantial uncertainties involved in estimating
baryon penetrability at phase boundaries.
