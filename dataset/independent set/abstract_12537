Let $U$ be a Haar distributed matrix in $\mathbb U(n)$ or $\mathbb O (n)$. In
a previous paper, we proved that after centering, the two-parameter process
\[T^{(n)} (s,t) = \sum_{i \leq \lfloor ns \rfloor, j \leq \lfloor nt\rfloor}
|U_{ij}|^2\] converges in distribution to the bivariate tied-down Brownian
bridge. In the present paper, we replace the deterministic truncation of $U$ by
a random one, where each row (resp. column) is chosen with probability $s$
(resp. $t$) independently. We prove that the corresponding two-parameter
process, after centering and normalization by $n^{-1/2}$ converges to a
Gaussian process. On the way we meet other interesting convergences.
