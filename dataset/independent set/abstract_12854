We consider the problem of testing whether two finite-dimensional random dot
product graphs have generating latent positions that are independently drawn
from the same distribution, or distributions that are related via scaling or
projection. We propose a test statistic that is a kernel-based function of the
adjacency spectral embedding for each graph. We obtain a limiting distribution
for our test statistic under the null and we show that our test procedure is
consistent across a broad range of alternatives.
