We construct a sequence of compact embedded minimal disks in a ball in
Euclidean 3-space, whose boundaries lie in the boundary of the ball, such that
the curvature blows up only at a prescribed discrete (and hence, finite) set of
points on the x_3-axis. This extends a result of Colding and Minicozzi, who
constructed a sequence for which the curvature blows up only at the center of
the ball, and is a partial affirmative answer to the larger question of the
existence of a sequence for which the curvature blows up precisely on a
prescribed closed set on the x_3-axis.
