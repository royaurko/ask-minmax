The weak version of universality in turbulence refers to the independence of
the scaling exponents of the $n$th order strcuture functions from the
statistics of the forcing. The strong version includes universality of the
coefficients of the structure functions in the isotropic sector, once
normalized by the mean energy flux. We demonstrate that shell models of
turbulence exhibit strong universality for both forced and decaying turbulence.
The exponents {\em and} the normalized coefficients are time independent in
decaying turbulence, forcing independent in forced turbulence, and equal for
decaying and forced turbulence. We conjecture that this is also the case for
Navier-Stokes turbulence.
