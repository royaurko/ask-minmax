The geometry of the symplectic structures and Fubini-Study metric is
discussed. Discussion in the paper addresses geometry of Quantum Mechanics in
the classical phase space. Also, geometry of Quantum Mechanics in the
projective Hilbert space has been discussed for the chosen Quantum states.
Since the theory of classical gravity is basically geometric in nature and
Quantum Mechanics is in no way devoid of geometry, the explorations pertaining
to more and more geometry in Quantum Mechanics could prove to be valuable for
larger objectives such as understanding of gravity.
