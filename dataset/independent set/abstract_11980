Using high statistics samples of charged current interactions, MiniBooNE
reports a model independent measurement of the single charged pion production
to quasi-elastic cross section ratio on mineral oil without corrections for
pion re-interactions in the target nucleus. The result is provided as a
function of neutrino energy in the range 0.4 GeV < E < 2.4 GeV with 11%
precision in the region of highest statistics.
