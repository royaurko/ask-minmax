In this paper we consider the persistence properties of random processes in
Brownian scenery, which are examples of non-Markovian and non-Gaussian
processes. More precisely we study the asymptotic behaviour for large $T$, of
the probability $P[ \sup\_{t\in[0,T]} \Delta\_t \leq 1] $ where $\Delta\_t =
\int\_{\mathbb{R}} L\_t(x) \, dW(x).$ Here $W={W(x); x\in\mathbb{R}}$ is a
two-sided standard real Brownian motion and ${L\_t(x); x\in\mathbb{R},t\geq 0}$
is the local time of some self-similar random process $Y$, independent from the
process $W$. We thus generalize the results of \cite{BFFN} where the increments
of $Y$ were assumed to be independent.
