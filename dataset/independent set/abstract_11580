The curvature on codimension-two and higher branes is not regular for
arbitrary matter sources. Nevertheless, the low-energy theory for an observer
on such a brane should be well-defined and independent to any regularization
procedure. This is achieved via appropriate classical renormalization of the
brane couplings, and leads to a natural hierarchy between standard model
couplings and couplings to gravity.
