A total of 628$\invpb$ of data collected with the ALEPH detector at
centre-of-mass energies from 189 to 209 GeV is analysed in the search for gauge
mediated SUSY breaking (GMSB) topologies. These topologies include two
acoplanar photons, non-pointing single photons, acoplanar leptons, large impact
parameter leptons, detached slepton decay vertices, heavy stable charged
sleptons and multi-leptons plus missing energy final states. No evidence is
found for new phenomena, and lower limits on masses of supersymmetric particles
are derived. A scan of a minimal GMSB parameter space is performed and lower
limits are set for the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) mass at
54$\gevcc$ and for the mass scale parameter $\Lambda$ at 10$\tevcc$,
independently of the NLSP lifetime. Including the results from the neutral
Higgs boson searches, a NLSP mass limit of 77$\gevcc$ is obtained and values of
$\Lambda$ up to 16$\tevcc$ are excluded.
