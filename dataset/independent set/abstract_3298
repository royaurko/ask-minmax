Asteroseismology offers the prospect of constraining differential rotation in
Sun-like stars. Here we have identified six high signal-to-noise main-sequence
Sun-like stars in the Kepler field, which all have visible signs of rotational
splitting of their p-mode frequencies. For each star, we extract the rotational
frequency splitting and inclination angle from separate mode sets (adjacent
modes with l=2, 0, and 1) spanning the p-mode envelope. We use a Markov chain
Monte Carlo method to obtain the best fit and errors associated with each
parameter. We are able to make independent measurements of rotational
splittings of ~8 radial orders for each star. For all six stars, the measured
splittings are consistent with uniform rotation, allowing us to exclude large
radial differential rotation. This work opens the possibility of constraining
internal rotation of Sun-like stars.
