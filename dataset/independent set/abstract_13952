All complex Hadamard matrices in dimensions two to five are known. We use
this fact to derive all inequivalent sets of mutually unbiased (MU) bases in
low dimensions. We find a three-parameter family of triples of MU bases in
dimension four and two inequivalent classes of MU triples in dimension five. We
confirm that the complete sets of (d+1) MU bases are unique (up to equivalence)
in dimensions below six, using only elementary arguments for d less than five.
