In this note we consider compact homomorphisms and endomorphisms between
various Dales-Davie algebras. In particular, we obtain fairly complete results
when the underlying set is the disc or the unit circle. Comparable results when
the underlying set is the unit interval, and some related results for general
perfect, compact plane sets, have been proven in our previous papers.
