Primary and secondary masses of heavy reaction products have been deduced
from kinematics and E-ToF measurements, respectively, for the direct and
reverse collisions of 100Mo with 120Sn at 14.1 A MeV. Direct experimental
evidence of the correlation of energy-sharing with net mass transfer and
model-independent results on the evolution of the average excitation from
equal-energy to equal-temperature partition are presented.
