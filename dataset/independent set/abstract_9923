There are fairly large families of unitarily inequivalent complete sets of
N+1 mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) in C^N for various prime powers N. The
number of such sets is not bounded above by any polynomial as a function of N.
While it is standard that there is a superficial similarity between complete
sets of MUBs and finite affine planes, there is an intimate relationship
between these large families and affine planes. This note briefly summarizes
"old" results that do not appear to be well-known concerning known families of
complete sets of MUBs and their associated planes.
