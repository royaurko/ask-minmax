We study time evolution of entanglement between two qubits, which are part of
a larger system, after starting from a random initial product state. We show
that, due to randomness in the initial product state, entanglement is present
only between directly coupled qubits and only for short times. Time dependence
of the entanglement appears essentially independent of the specific hamiltonian
used for time evolution and is well reproduced by a parameter-free two-body
random matrix model.
