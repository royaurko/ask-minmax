The possibility that the magnetic dipole moment (MDM) of light charged vector
mesons could be measured from radiative processes involving the production
(\tau \to \rho \nu \gamma) and decay(\rho \to \pi \pi \gamma) of vector mesons
is studied in a model independent way, via the soft-photon approximation. The
angular and energy distribution of photons emitted at small angles respect to
the final charged particle is found be sensitive to the effects of the MDM. We
also show that model dependent contributions have a general structure, by gauge
invariance requirements, that allows suppress them in the same kinematical
region where the MDM effect is more important in the model independent
approach.
