We study, in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, the electroweak
symmetry breaking conditions obtained from the one-loop effective potential.
Novel model-independent lower and upper bounds on $\tan \beta$, involving the
other free parameters of the model, are inferred and determined analytically.
We discuss briefly some of the related issues and give an outlook for further
applications.
