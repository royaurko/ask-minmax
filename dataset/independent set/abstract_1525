A new approach to clustering, based on the physical properties of
inhomogeneous coupled chaotic maps, is presented. A chaotic map is assigned to
each data-point and short range couplings are introduced. The stationary regime
of the system corresponds to a macroscopic attractor independent of the initial
conditions. The mutual information between couples of maps serves to partition
the data set in clusters, without prior assumptions about the structure of the
underlying distribution of the data. Experiments on simulated and real data
sets show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
