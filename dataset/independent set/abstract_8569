High-speed, accuracy, meticulousness and quick response are notion of the
vital necessities for modern digital world. An efficient electronic circuit
unswervingly affects the maneuver of the whole system. Different tools are
required to unravel different types of engineering tribulations. Improving the
efficiency, accuracy and low power consumption in an electronic circuit is
always been a bottle neck problem. So the need of circuit miniaturization is
always there. It saves a lot of time and power that is wasted in switching of
gates, the wiring-crises is reduced, cross-sectional area of chip is reduced,
the number of transistors that can implemented in chip is multiplied many
folds. Therefore to trounce with this problem we have proposed an Artificial
intelligence (AI) based approach that make use of Rough Set Theory for its
implementation. Theory of rough set has been proposed by Z Pawlak in the year
1982. Rough set theory is a new mathematical tool which deals with uncertainty
and vagueness. Decisions can be generated using rough set theory by reducing
the unwanted and superfluous data. We have condensed the number of gates
without upsetting the productivity of the given circuit. This paper proposes an
approach with the help of rough set theory which basically lessens the number
of gates in the circuit, based on decision rules.
