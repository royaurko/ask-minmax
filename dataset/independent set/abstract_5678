The finite element method (FEM) is used to study the influence of porosity
and pore shape on the elastic properties of model porous ceramics. The Young's
modulus of each model was found to be practically independent of the solid
Poisson's ratio. At a sufficiently high porosity, the Poisson's ratio of the
porous models converged to a fixed value independent of the solid Poisson's
ratio. The Young's modulus of the models is in good agreement with experimental
data. We provide simple formulae which can be used to predict the elastic
properties of ceramics, and allow the accurate interpretation of empirical
property-porosity relations in terms of pore shape and structure.
