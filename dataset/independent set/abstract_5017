We study the hyperfine mass differences of heavy hadrons in the heavy quark
effect theory (HQET). The effects of one-gluon exchange interaction are
considered for the heavy mesons and baryons. Base on the known experimental
data, we predict the masses of some heavy baryons in a model-independent way.
