The subject of this work is the instability mechanism of simple shear flows,
like Hagen-Poiseuille pipe flow, which is a long-standing problem in fluid
mechanics [1,2]. A possible analogy with phenomenological theory of ideal
plasticity in solids is explored. It allows an extension of the Navier-Stokes
equations making the simple shear flows unstable. Following von Mises [4], the
existence of maximal allowed shear stress or "yield stress" in fluid is
assumed. After the actual stresses have reached this value, a new physical
mechanism will be activated attempting to reduce them. This mechanism results
in a pressure-like force, which has to be added to the Navier-Stokes equations.
The yield stress itself is a material constant, which does not depend on the
Reynolds number of particular flow. It will be shown how to estimate its value
from experimental data. To demonstrate how the character of flow changes if the
additional force is taken into account, an unsteady flow in a 2D nozzle is
presented. The momentum source was introduced in the Navier-Stokes equations
through the user-defined function's interface offered by Fluent [6]. The
initial data and the results of simulation are summarized in appendix.
