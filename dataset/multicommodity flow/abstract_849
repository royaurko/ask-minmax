In this paper we study the global behavior of the Ricci flow equation for two
classes of homogeneous manifolds with two isotropy summands. Using methods of
the qualitative theory of differential equations, we present the global phase
portrait of such systems and derive some geometrical consequences on the
structure of such manifolds under the action of the Ricci flow.
