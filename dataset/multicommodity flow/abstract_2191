We consider faithful projective actions of a cocompact lattice of SL(2,R) on
the projective plane, with the following property: there is a common fixed
point, which is a saddle fixed point for every element of infinite order of the
the group. Typical examples of such an action are linear actions, ie, when the
action arises from a morphism of the group into GL(2,R), viewed as the group of
linear transformations of a copy of the affine plane in RP^{2}. We prove that
in the general situation, such an action is always topologically linearisable,
and that the linearisation is Lipschitz if and only if it is projective. This
result is obtained through the study of a certain family of flag structures on
Seifert manifolds. As a corollary, we deduce some dynamical properties of the
transversely affine flows obtained by deformations of horocyclic flows. In
particular, these flows are not minimal.
