Mean flow effects are discussed for two different pattern-forming systems:
Rayleigh-Benard convection and Faraday instability in viscous fluid. In both
systems spirals are observed in certain parameter regions. In the
Rayleigh-Benard convection, the spiral core instability and subsequent
generation of up- and downflow hexagons are shown to occur due to the mean flow
generated by the curved rolls near the core. In the Faraday instability, the
mean flow which is generated by rapidly decaying surface waves near the wall,
causes wavenumber frustration which leads to a rigid-body spiral rotation. In
both cases we use phenomenological Swift-Hohenberg-type equations for the order
parameter coupled to a large-scale mean flow. Numerical simulations are
compared to recently reported experimental results.
