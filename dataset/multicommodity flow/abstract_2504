The pseudorapidity density and anisotropic flow of charged-particles provide
fundamental information about global variables and correlations in heavy-ion
collisions. The pseudorapidity density is related to the energy available for
particle production while the anisotropic flow is related to collective effects
from interactions between these particles. Extending these measurements to very
forward pseudorapidities yields information about the longitudinal expansion of
the system. The first measurements performed at the LHC over more than 8 units
of pseudorapidity are presented. The longitudinal scaling of the measurements
is analyzed and comparison to models is performed.
