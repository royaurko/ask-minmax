Statistical mechanics of a small system of cars on a single-lane road is
developed. The system is not characterized by a Hamiltonian but by a
conditional probability of a velocity of a car for the given velocity and
distance of the car ahead. Distribution of car velocities for various densities
of a group of cars are derived as well as probabilities of density fluctuations
of the group for different velocities. For high braking abilities of cars
free-flow and congested phases are found. Platoons of cars are formed for
system of cars with inefficient brakes. A first order phase transition between
free-flow and congested phase is suggested.
