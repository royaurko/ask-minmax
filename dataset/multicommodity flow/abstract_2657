Mechanical properties are of central importance to materials sciences, in
particular if they depend on external stimuli. Here we investigate the
rheological response of amorphous solids, namely col- loidal glasses, to
external forces. Using confocal microscopy and computer simulations, we
establish a quantitative link between the macroscopic creep response and the
microscopic single-particle dy- namics. We observe dynamical heterogeneities,
namely regions of enhanced mobility, which remain localized in the creep
regime, but grow for applied stresses leading to steady flow. These different
behaviors are also reflected in the average particle dynamics, quantified by
the mean squared dis- placement of the individual particles, and the fraction
of active regions. Both microscopic quantities are found to be proportional to
the macroscopic strain, despite the non-equilibrium and non-linear conditions
during creep and the transient regime prior to steady flow.
