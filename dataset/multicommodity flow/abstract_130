The psychological state of flow has been linked to optimizing human
performance. A key condition of flow emergence is a match between the human
abilities and complexity of the task. We propose a simple computational model
of flow for Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents. The model factors the standard
agent-environment state into a self-reflective set of the agent's abilities and
a socially learned set of the environmental complexity. Maximizing the flow
serves as a meta control for the agent. We show how to apply the meta-control
policy to a broad class of AI control policies and illustrate our approach with
a specific implementation. Results in a synthetic testbed are promising and
open interesting directions for future work.
