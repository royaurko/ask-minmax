Within the Nagel-Schreckenberg traffic flow model we consider the transition
from the free flow regime to the jammed regime. We introduce a method of
analyzing the data which is based on the local density distribution. This
analyzes allows us to determine the phase diagram and to examine the separation
of the system into a coexisting free flow phase and a jammed phase above the
transition. The investigation of the steady state structure factor yields that
the decomposition in this phase coexistence regime is driven by density
fluctuations, provided they exceed a critical wavelength.
