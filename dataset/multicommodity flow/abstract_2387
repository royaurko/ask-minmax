The specific shear viscosity (eta/s)_QGP of a Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP) at
temperatures T_c < T < 2T_c is extracted from the centrality dependence of the
eccentricity-scaled elliptic flow measured in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion
collisions. Coupling viscous fluid dynamics for the QGP with a microscopic
transport model for hadronic freeze-out we find that the eccentricity-scaled
elliptic flow is a universal function of charged multiplicity per unit overlap
area, (1/S)(dN_ch/dy), that depends only on the viscosity but not on the model
used for computing the initial fireball eccentricity. Comparing with
measurements we find 1 < (4pi)(eta/s)_QGP < 2.5 where the uncertainty range is
dominated by model uncertainties for the eccentricity values used to normalize
the measured elliptic flow.
