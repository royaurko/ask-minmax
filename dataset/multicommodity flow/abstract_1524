We investigate the phononic energy transport properties of mesoscopic,
suspended dielectric wires. The Landauer formula for the thermal conductance is
derived and its universal aspects discussed. We then determine the variance of
the energy current in the presence of a steady state current flow. In the final
part, some initial results are presented concerning the nature of the
temperature fluctuations of a mesoscopic electron gas thermometer due to the
absorption and emission of wire phonons.
