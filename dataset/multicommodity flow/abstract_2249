The mixing effectiveness, i.e., the enhancement of molecular diffusion, of a
flow can be quantified in terms of the suppression of concentration variance of
a passive scalar sustained by steady sources and sinks. The mixing enhancement
defined this way is the ratio of the RMS fluctuations of the scalar mixed by
molecular diffusion alone to the (statistically steady-state) RMS fluctuations
of the scalar density in the presence of stirring. This measure of the
effectiveness of the stirring is naturally related to the enhancement factor of
the equivalent eddy diffusivity over molecular diffusion, and depends on the
Peclet number. It was recently noted that the maximum possible mixing
enhancement at a given Peclet number depends as well on the structure of the
sources and sinks. That is, the mixing efficiency, the effective diffusivity,
or the eddy diffusion of a flow generally depends on the sources and sinks of
whatever is being stirred. Here we present the results of particle-based
simulations quantitatively confirming the source-sink dependence of the mixing
enhancement as a function of Peclet number for a model flow.
