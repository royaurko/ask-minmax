Two-dimensional Molecular Dynamics simulations are used to model the free
surface flow of spheres falling down an inclined chute. The interaction between
the particles in our model is assumed to be subjected to the Hertzian contact
force and normal as well as shear friction. The stream of particles shows a
characteristic height profile, consisting of layers of different types of
fluidization. The numerically observed flow properties agree qualitatively with
experimental results.
