A minimal kinetic model is used to study analytically and numerically flows
at a micrometer scale. Using the lid-driven microcavity as an illustrative
example, the interplay between kinetics and hydrodynamics is quantitatively
visualized. The validity of various theories of non-equilibrium thermodynamics
of flowing systems is tested in this nontrivial microflow.
