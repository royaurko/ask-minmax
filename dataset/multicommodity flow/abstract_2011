In this paper we study the problem of recovering an low-rank positive
semidefinite matrix from linear measurements. Our algorithm, which we call
Procrustes Flow, starts from an initial estimate obtained by a thresholding
scheme followed by gradient descent on a non-convex objective. We show that as
long as the measurements obey a standard restricted isometry property, our
algorithm converges to the unknown matrix at a geometric rate. In the case of
Gaussian measurements, such convergence occurs for a $n \times n$ matrix of
rank $r$ when the number of measurements exceeds a constant times $nr$.
