Let $\varphi$ be any flow on $T^n$ obtained as the suspension of a
diffeomorphism of $T^{n-1}$ and let $\mathcal A$ be any compact invariant set
of $\varphi$. We realize $(\mathcal A, \varphi|_{\mathcal A})$ up to
reparametrization as an invariant set of the Reeb flow of a contact form on
$\mathbb R^{2n+1}$ equal to the standard contact form outside a compact set and
defining the standard contact structure on all of $\mathbb R^{2n+1}$. This
generalizes the construction of Geiges, R\"ottgen and Zehmisch.
