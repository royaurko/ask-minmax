Understanding miscible flow of CO$_2$ and oil in a porous media is an
important topic in the field of petroleum engineering. In this article, we
present an upscaling methodology for displacing oil by CO$_2$, and study the
statistical mechanical theory to develop a subgrid scale model for the effect
of CO$_2$-oil dissolution on the overall skin friction and pressure drag
experienced by the porous media. We present a multiscale computational
methodology for a near optimal calcuation of the velocity and pressure. We
study the field scale sweep efficiency using a streamline based Lagrangian
scheme. The simulation results show a good agreement with asymptotic analysis
results.
