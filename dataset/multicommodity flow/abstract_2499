We introduce a new perspective into the field of quantitative information
flow (QIF) analysis that invites the community to bound the leakage, reported
by QIF quantifiers, by a range consistent with the size of a program's secret
input instead of by a mathematically sound (but counter-intuitive) upper bound
of that leakage. To substantiate our position, we present a refinement of a
recent QIF metric that appears in the literature. Our refinement is based on
slight changes we bring into the design of that metric. These changes do not
affect the theoretical premises onto which the original metric is laid.
However, they enable the natural association between flow results and the
exhaustive search effort needed to uncover a program's secret information (or
the residual secret part of that information) to be clearly established. The
refinement we discuss in this paper validates our perspective and demonstrates
its importance in the future design of QIF quantifiers.
