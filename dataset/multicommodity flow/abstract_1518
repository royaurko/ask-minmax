Using two different pseudo-Schwarzschild potentials proposed by Artemova et.
al,$^{1}$ we formulate and solve the equations governing spherically symmetric
transonic inflow and outflow in presence of a relativistic hadronic pressure
mediated steady, standing, spherical shock around the central compact object
and then we self-consistently connect the accretion-wind solutions to calculate
the mass outflow rate $R_{\dot m}$ in terms of minimum number of flow
parameters. Also we study the dependence of this rate on various boundary
conditions governing the flow.
