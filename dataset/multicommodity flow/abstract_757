The global structure of the current flows in pulsar magnetospheres is
investigated, with rough calculations of the elements in the magnetospheric
circuit. It is emphasized that the potential of critical field lines is the
same as that of interstellar medium, and that the pulsars whose rotation axes
and magnetic dipole axes are parallel should be positively charged, in order to
close the pulsar's current flows. The statistical relation between the radio
luminosity and pulsar's electric charge (or the spindown power) may hint that
the millisecond pulsars could be low-mass bare strange stars.
