In this paper we construct multiparametric families of two dimensional
metrics with polynomial first integral. Such integrable geodesic flows are
described by solutions of some semi-Hamiltonian hydrodynamic type system. We
find infinitely many conservation laws and commuting flows for this system.
This procedure allows us to present infinitely many particular metrics by the
generalized hodograph method.
