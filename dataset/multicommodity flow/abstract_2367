We present an improved lattice Boltzmann model for high-speed compressible
flows. The model is composed of a discrete-velocity model by Kataoka and
Tsutahara [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{69}, 056702 (2004)] and an appropriate
finite-difference scheme combined with an additional dissipation term. With the
dissipation term parameters in the model can be flexibly chosen so that the von
Neumann stability condition is satisfied. The influence of the various model
parameters on the numerical stability is analyzed and some reference values of
parameter are suggested. The new scheme works for both subsonic and supersonic
flows with a Mach number up to 30 (or higher), which is validated by well-known
benchmark tests. Simulations on Riemann problems with very high ratios
($1000:1$) of pressure and density also show good accuracy and stability.
Successful recovering of regular and double Mach shock reflections shows the
potential application of the lattice Boltzmann model to fluid systems where
non-equilibrium processes are intrinsic. The new scheme for stability can be
easily extended to other lattice Boltzmann models.
