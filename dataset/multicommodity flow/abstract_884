We describe how a convectively unstable active field in an open flow
configuration becomes absolutely unstable due to local mixing. A representation
of the mixing region as those with locally enhanced effective diffusion allows
us to find the linear transition point to unstable global mode analytically. We
derive the critical exponent characterizing weakly nonlinear regimes beyond
instability and compare it with numerical simulations of a full two-dimensional
flow problem.
