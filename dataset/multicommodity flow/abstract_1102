Critical processes of ideal integrable models of Hele-Shaw flows are
considered. A regularization method based on multiscaling expansions of
solutions of the KdV and Toda hierarchies characterized by string equations is
proposed. Examples are exhibited in which the tritronq'ee solution of the
Painleve-I equation turns out to provide the leading term of the regularization
