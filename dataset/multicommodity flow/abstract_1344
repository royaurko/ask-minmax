The steady, asymmetric and two-dimensional flow of viscous, incompressible,
and Newtonian fluid through a rectangular channel with splitter plate parallel
to walls is investigated numerically. In the past, the position of the splitter
plate was taken as a centerline of channel but here we consider its different
positions which cause the asymmetric behaviour of the flow field. The geometric
parameter that controls the position of splitter is defined as splitter
position parameter {\alpha}. The plane Poiseuille flow is considered far from
upstream and downstream of the splitter. The fourth order method Mancera [11],
followed by special finite-method Dennis [5] is used to solve in our purpose.
This numerical scheme transforms the governing equations to system of
finite-difference equations which are solved by point S.O.R. iterative method.
Moreover, the results obtained are further refined and upgraded by Richardson
Extrapolation method Jain [18]. This scheme yields the sixth order accurate
solution. The results are compared with those of Badr et al [1] for symmetric
case (when {\alpha}=0) for velocity, vorticity and skin friction distributions.
The comparison is very favourable.
