Polymer dynamics in a turbulent flow is a problem spanning several orders of
magnitude of length and time scales. A microscopic simulation covering all
those scales from the polymer segment to the inertial scale of turbulence seems
impossible within the foreseeable future. We propose a multiscale simulation
strategy to enhance the spatio-temporal resolution of local Lagrangian
turbulent flow by matching two different simulation techniques, i. e. direct
numerical simulation for the flow as a whole, and the lattice Boltzmann method
coupled to polymer dynamics at the Kolmogorov dissipation scale. Local
turbulent flows sampled by Lagrangian tracer particles in the direct numerical
simulation are reproduced in the lattice Boltzmann model with a finer
resolution, by supplying the latter with both the correct initial condition as
well as the correct time-dependent boundary condition, sampled from the former.
When combined with a Molecular Dynamics simulation of a polymer chain in the
lattice Boltzmann model, it provides a strategy to simulate the \emph{passive}
dynamics of a polymer chain in a turbulent flow covering all those scales.
While this approach allows for a fairly realistic model of the macromolecule,
the back-coupling to the flow on the large scales is missing.
