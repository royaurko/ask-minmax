A dynamical system description of the transition process in shear flows with
no linear instability starts with a knowledge of exact coherent solutions,
among them travelling waves (TWs) and relative periodic orbits (RPOs). We
describe a numerical method to find such solutions in pipe flow and apply it in
the vicinity of a Hopf bifurcation from a TW which looks to be especially
relevant for transition. The dominant structural feature of the RPO solution is
the presence of weakly modulated streaks. This RPO, like the TW from which it
bifurcates, sits on the laminar-turbulent boundary separating initial
conditions which lead to turbulence from those which immediately relaminarise.
