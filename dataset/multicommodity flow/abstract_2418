In the last decades, significant progress has been made in understanding the
multiphase displacement through porous media with homogeneous wettability and
its relation to the pore geometry. However, the role of wettability at the
scale of the pore remains still little understood. In the present study the
displacement of immiscible fluids through a two-dimensional porous medium is
simulated by means of a mesoscopic particle approach. The substrate is
described as an assembly of non-overlapping circular disks whose preferential
wettability is distributed according to prescribed spatial correlations, from
pore scale up to domains at system size. We analyze how this well-defined
heterogeneous wettability affects the flow and try to establish a relationship
among wettability-correlations and large-scale properties of the multiphase
flow.
