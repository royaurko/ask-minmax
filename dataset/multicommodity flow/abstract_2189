In a turbulent boundary layer over a smooth flat plate with zero pressure
gradient, the intermediate structure between the viscous sublayer and the free
stream consists of two layers: one adjacent to the viscous sublayer and one
adjacent to the free stream. When the level of turbulence in the free stream is
low, the boundary between the two layers is sharp and both have a self-similar
structure described by Reynolds-number-dependent scaling (power) laws. This
structure introduces two length scales: one --- the wall region thickness ---
determined by the sharp boundary between the two intermediate layers, the
second determined by the condition that the velocity distribution in the first
intermediate layer be the one common to all wall-bounded flows, and in
particular coincide with the scaling law previously determined for pipe flows.
Using recent experimental data we determine both these length scales and show
that they are close. Our results disagree with the classical model of the "wake
region".
