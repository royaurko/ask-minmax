Elastic scattering of charm (c) and bottom (b) quarks via D- and B-meson
resonance states in an expanding, strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma is
investigated. Drag and diffusion coefficients are calculated from an effective
model based on chiral symmetry and heavy-quark effective theory, and utilized
in a relativistic Langevin simulation to obtain transverse-momentum spectra and
elliptic flow (v_2) of c- and b-quarks. The hadronization to D- and B-mesons is
described by coalescence and fragmentation, and the resulting decay-electron
spectra are compared to recent RHIC data.
