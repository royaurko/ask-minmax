Axisymmetric equilibria with incompressible flows of arbitrary direction are
studied in the framework of magnetohydrodynamics under a variety of physically
relevant side conditions. To this end a set of pertinent non-linear ODEs are
transformed to quasilinear ones and the respective initial value problem is
solved numerically with appropriately determined initial values near the
magnetic axis. Several equilibria are then constructed surface by surface. The
non field aligned flow results in novel configurations with a single magnetic
axis, toroidal shell configurations in which the plasma is confined within a
couple of magnetic surfaces and double shell-like configurations. In addition,
the flow affects the elongation and triangularity of the magnetic surfaces.
