To address a question of whether the chiral magnetic current is a static
polarization or a genuine flow of charged particles, we elucidate the numerical
formulation to simulate the net production of right-handed particles and
anomalous currents with CP-breaking background fields which cause an imbalance
between particles and anti-particles. For a concrete demonstration we
numerically impose pulsed electric and magnetic fields to confirm our answer to
the question that the produced net particles flow in the dynamical chiral
magnetic effect. The rate for the particle production and the chiral magnetic
current generation is quantitatively consistent with the axial anomaly, while
they appear with a finite response time. We emphasize the importance to
quantify the response time that would suppress observable effects of the
anomalous current.
