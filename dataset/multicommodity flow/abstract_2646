We introduce the notion of flows of branching processes with competition to
describe the evolution of a continuous state branching population in which
interactions between individuals give rise to a negative density dependence
term. A classical example is the logistic branching processes studied by
Lambert. Following the approach developed by Dawson and Li for populations
without interactions, such processes are first constructed as the solutions of
certain system of stochastic differential equations. We then propose a novel
construction of a flow of branching processes with competition based on the
interactive pruning of L\'evy-trees, establishing in particular a Ray-Knight
representation result for it in terms of the local times of the pruned forest.
