The symmetric dynamics of two kinks and one antikink in classical
(1+1)-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory is investigated. Gradient flow is used to
construct a collective coordinate model of the system. The relationship between
the discrete vibrational mode of a single kink, and the process of
kink-antikink pair production is explored.
