Motivated by recent attempts to find nontrivial infrared fixed points in
4-dimensional lattice gauge theories, we discuss the extension of the
renormalization group (RG) transformations to complex coupling spaces for O(N)
models on LxL lattices, in the large-N limit. We explain the Riemann sheet
structure and singular points of the finite L mappings between the mass gap and
the 't Hooft coupling. We argue that the Fisher's zeros appear on "strings"
ending approximately near these singular points. We show that for the spherical
model at finite N and L, the density of states is stripwise polynomial in the
complex energy plane. We compare finite volume complex flows obtained from the
rescaling of the ultraviolet cutoff in the gap equation and from the
two-lattice matching. In both cases, the flows are channelled through the
singular points and end at the strong coupling fixed points, however strong
scheme dependence appear when the Compton wavelength of the mass gap is larger
than the linear size of the system. We argue that the Fisher's zeros control
the global properties of the complex flows. We briefly discuss the implications
for perturbation theory, proofs of confinement and searches for nontrivial
infrared fixed points in models beyond the standard model.
