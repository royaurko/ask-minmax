Radiatively inefficient accretion flows onto black holes are unstable due to
both an outwardly decreasing entropy (`convection') and an outwardly decreasing
rotation rate (the `magnetorotational instability'; MRI). Using a linear
magnetohydrodynamic stability analysis, we show that long-wavelength modes are
primarily destabilized by the entropy gradient and that such `convective' modes
transport angular momentum inwards. Moreover, the stability criteria for the
convective modes are the standard Hoiland criteria of hydrodynamics. By
contrast, shorter wavelength modes are primarily destabilized by magnetic
tension and differential rotation. These `MRI' modes transport angular momentum
outwards. The convection-dominated accretion flow (CDAF) model, which has been
proposed for radiatively inefficient accretion onto a black hole, posits that
inward angular momentum transport and outward energy transport by
long-wavelength convective fluctuations are crucial for determining the
structure of the accretion flow. Our analysis suggests that the CDAF model is
applicable to a magnetohydrodynamic accretion flow provided the magnetic field
saturates at a sufficiently sub-equipartition value (plasma beta >> 1), so that
long-wavelength convective fluctuations can fit inside the accretion disk.
Numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations are required to determine whether
such a sub-equipartition field is in fact obtained.
