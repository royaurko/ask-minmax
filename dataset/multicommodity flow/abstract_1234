The effects of elasticity on filament thinning and breakup are investigated
in microchannel cross flow. When a viscous solution is stretched by an external
immiscible fluid, a low 100 ppm polymer concentration strongly affects the
breakup process, compared to the Newtonian case. Qualitatively, polymeric
filaments show much slower evolution, and their morphology features multiple
connected drops. Measurements of filament thickness show two main temporal
regimes: flow- and capillary-driven. At early times both polymeric and
Newtonian fluids are flow-driven, and filament thinning is exponential. At
later times, Newtonian filament thinning crosses over to a capillary-driven
regime, in which the decay is algebraic. By contrast, the polymeric fluid first
crosses over to a second type of flow-driven behavior, in which viscoelastic
stresses inside the filament become important and the decay is again
exponential. Finally, the polymeric filament becomes capillary-driven at late
times with algebraic decay. We show that the exponential flow thinning behavior
allows a novel measurement of the extensional viscosities of both Newtonian and
polymeric fluids.
