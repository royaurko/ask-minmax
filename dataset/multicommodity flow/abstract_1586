A new family of simple, analytic solutions of self-similarly expanding
fireballs is found for systems with ellipsoidal symmetry and a direction
dependent, generalized Hubble flow. Gaussian, shell like or oscillating density
profiles emerge for simple choices of an arbitrary scaling function. New,
cylindrically or spherically symmetric as well as approximately one dimensional
hydrodynamical solutions are obtained for various special choices of the
initial conditions.
