We report on new patterns in high-speed flows of granular materials obtained
by means of extensive numerical simulations. These patterns emerge from the
destabilization of unidirectional flows upon increase of mass holdup and
inclination angle, and are characterized by complex internal structures
including secondary flows, heterogeneous particle volume fraction, symmetry
breaking and dynamically maintained order. In particular, we evidenced steady
and fully developed "supported" flows, which consist of a dense core surrounded
by a highly energetic granular gas. Interestingly, despite their overall
diversity, these regimes are shown to obey a scaling law for the mass flow rate
as a function of the mass holdup. This unique set of 3D flow regimes raises new
challenges for extending the scope of current granular rheological models.
