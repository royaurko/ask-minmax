The supermassive black hole in the center of our Galaxy, Sgr A*, is unique
because the angular size of the black hole is the largest in the sky thus
providing detailed boundary conditions on, and much less freedom for, accretion
flow models. In this paper I review advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF;
another name is radiatively inefficient accretion flow) models for Sgr A*. This
includes the developments and dynamics of ADAFs, and how to explain
observational results including the multi-waveband spectrum, radio
polarization, IR and X-ray flares, and the size measurements at radio
wavebands.
