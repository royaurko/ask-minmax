I review the recent progress in measuring elliptic flow in heavy ion
collisions. These measurements show clearly how hydrodynamics starts to develop
as the system size is increased from peripheral to central collisions. During
this transition, the momentum range described by hydrodynamics increases as the
system progresses from a kinetic to a hydrodynamic regime. Many of the
systematic deviations from ideal hydrodynamics are reproduced effortlessly once
the shear viscosity is included. In order to extract the shear viscosity from
the data, kinetic theory can be used to determine which aspects of the elliptic
flow reflect the details of the microscopic interactions, and which aspects
reflect the underlying transport coefficients. I also review the identified
hadron elliptic flow and the predictions of hydrodynamics for the LHC.
