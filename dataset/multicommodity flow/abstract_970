The two spectrometers on board the Infrared Space Observatory were used to
observe the Herbig-Haro objects HH 80, 81 and 80N, as well as their candidate
exciting source IRAS 18162-2048. The fine structure lines of [OI]63um,
[OI]145um and [CII]158um are detected everywhere, while [NII]122um and
[OIII]88um are only detected toward the HH objects; line ratios confirm for the
first time the collisionally excited HH nature of HH 80N. No molecular line is
detected in any of the observed positions. We use a full shock code to diagnose
shock velocities vs~100 km/s toward the HH objects, as expected from the
optical spectroscopy. Since proper motions suggest velocities in excess of 600
km/s, the HH objects probably represent the interface between two flow
components with velocity differing by ~vs. Aside from the flow exciting source,
the [CII]158um line is everywhere brighter than the [OI]63um line, indicating
the presence of a Photo-Dissociation Region (PDR) all along the flow. Continuum
emission from the HH objects and from other positions along the flow is only
detected longword of ~50 micron, and its proportionality to the [CII]158um line
flux suggests it is PDR in origin. We propose that the FUV continuum irradiated
by the HH objects and the jet is responsible for the generation of a PDR at the
walls of the flow cavity. We develop a very simple model which strengthens the
plausibility of this hypothesis.
