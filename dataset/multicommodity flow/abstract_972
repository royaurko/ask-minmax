Cooling flow models for the hot gas in elliptical galaxies predict that gas
is cooling at a rate of ~ 1 solar mass/yr, yet there is little evidence for
this phenomenon beyond the X-ray waveband. If hot gas is cooling, it will pass
through the 3x10^5 K regime and radiate in the OVI 1032,1038 ultraviolet lines,
which can be detected with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE)
and here we report on FUSE observations of the X-ray bright early-type galaxies
NGC 1404 and NGC 4636. In NGC 1404, the OVI doublet is not detected, implying a
cooling rate < 0.3 solar masses/yr, which is below the predicted values from
the cooling flow model of 0.4-0.9 solar masses/yr. In NGC 4636, both OVI lines
are clearly detected, indicating a cooling rate of 0.43 +/- 0.06 solar
masses/yr, which falls within the range of values from the cooling flow
prediction, 0.36-2.3 solar masses/yr and is closest to the model where the
production of the cooled gas is distributed through the galaxy. The emission
line widths, 44 +/- 15 km/s, are close to the Doppler broadening value (30
km/s), indicating that the flow is quiescent rather than turbulent, and that
the flow velocity is < 30 km/s.
