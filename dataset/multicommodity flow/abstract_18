We estimate here a flux-transport dynamo model's response time to changes in
meridional flow speed. Time-variation in meridional flow primarily determines
the shape of a cycle in this class of dynamo models. In order to simultaneously
predict the shape, amplitude and timing of a solar cycle by implementing an
Ensemble Kalman Filter in the framework of Data Assimilation Research Testbed
(DART), it is important to know the model's sensitivity to flow variation.
Guided by observations we consider a smooth increase or decrease in meridional
flow speed for a specified time (a few months to a few years), after which the
flow speed comes back to the steady speed, and implement that time-varying
meridional flow at different phases of solar cycle. We find that the model's
response time to change in flow speed peaks at four to six months if the flow
change lasts for one year. The longer the changed flow lasts, the longer the
model takes to respond. Magnetic diffusivity has no influence in model's
response to flow variation as long as the dynamo operates in the
advection-dominated regime. Experiments with more complex flow variations
indicate that the shape and amplitude of flow-perturbation have no influence in
the estimate of model's response time.
