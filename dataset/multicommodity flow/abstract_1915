We generalize some of the results of Harvey, Lawson and Latschev about
transgression formulas. The focus here is on flowing forms via vertical vector
fields, especially Morse-Bott-Smale vector fields. We prove a very general
transgression formula including also a version covering non-compact situations.
Among applications, we completely answer a question of Quillen, construct the
Maslov spark, give a very short proof of a refined Chern- Gauss-Bonnet theorem,
and reprove some theorems of Nicolaescu and Getzler. A discussion about odd
Chern-Weil theory is also included.
