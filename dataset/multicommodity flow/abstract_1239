We introduce a flow condition on open graph states (graph states with inputs
and outputs) which guarantees globally deterministic behavior of a class of
measurement patterns defined over them. Dependent Pauli corrections are derived
for all such patterns, which equalize all computation branches, and only depend
on the underlying entanglement graph and its choice of inputs and outputs.
  The class of patterns having flow is stable under composition and
tensorization, and has unitary embeddings as realizations. The restricted class
of patterns having both flow and reverse flow, supports an operation of
adjunction, and has all and only unitaries as realizations.
