The correlation between radio and X-ray luminosity in the hard state of black
hole X-ray binaries is important for unveiling the relation between the
accretion flow and the jets. In this paper, we have modeled the
quasi-simultaneous multi-band observations of a recently discovered transient
X-ray source, IGR J17177-3656. It is found that the source is probably an
outlier following the steep radio/X-ray correlation rather than an outlier in
the transition region as suggested by Paizis et al. (2011). It is also found
that the multi-band spectrum can be successfully modeled by the luminous hot
accretion flow (LHAF) but less likely by the advection dominated accretion flow
(ADAF). Our results support the point that LHAF can explain the steep
radio/X-ray correlation.
