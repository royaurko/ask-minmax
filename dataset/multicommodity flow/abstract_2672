With the recent, rapid development of computer technology, the resolution of
atmospheric numerical models has increased substantially. As a result, steep
gradients in mountainous terrain are now being resolved in high-resolution
models. This results in large truncation errors in those models using
terrain-following coordinates. In this study, a new 3D Cartesian coordinate
non-hydrostatic atmospheric model is developed. A cut-cell representation of
topography based on finite-volume discretization is combined with a
cell-merging approach, in which small cut-cells are merged with neighboring
cells either vertically or horizontally. In addition, a block-structured
mesh-refinement technique achieves a variable resolution on the model grid with
the finest resolution occurring close to the terrain surface. The model
successfully reproduces a flow over a 3D bell-shaped hill that shows a good
agreement with the flow predicted by the linear theory. The ability of the
model to simulate flows over steep terrain is demonstrated using a
hemisphere-shaped hill. The advantage of a locally refined grid around a 3D
hill, with cut-cells at the terrain surface, is also demonstrated.
