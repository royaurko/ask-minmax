We derive an action-flux formula to compute the volumes of lobes quantifying
transport between past- and future-invariant Lagrangian coherent structures of
n-dimensional, transitory, globally Liouville flows. A transitory system is one
that is nonautonomous only on a compact time interval. This method requires
relatively little Lagrangian information about the codimension-one surfaces
bounding the lobes, relying only on the generalized actions of loops on the
lobe boundaries. These are easily computed since the vector fields are
autonomous before and after the time-dependent transition. Two examples in
three-dimensions are studied: a transitory ABC flow and a model of a
microdroplet moving through a microfluidic channel mixer. In both cases the
action-flux computations of transport are compared to those obtained using
Monte Carlo methods.
