We present experiments on the behavior of reaction fronts in ordered and
disordered cellular flows with imposed winds. Fronts in a chain of alternating
vortices are found to freeze (pin to the separatrix) for a wide range of
imposed winds that grows nonlinearly with the characteristic strength of the
underlying vorticity. Experiments in spatially-disordered flows demonstrate
that freezing of fronts is common to cellular flows; furthermore, it is not
dependent on boundary conditions. We therefore anticipate similar pinning in a
wide range of cellular flows and front-producing systems.
