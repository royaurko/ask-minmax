In 1998 Smoczyk [Smo98] showed that, among others, the blowup limits at
singularities are convex for the mean curvature flow starting from a closed
star-shaped surface in $\mathbf{R}^3$. We prove in this paper that this is true
for the mean curvature flow of star-shaped hypersurfaces in $\mathbf{R}^{n+1}$
in arbitrary dimension $n\geq 2$. In fact, this holds for a much more general
class of initial hypersurfaces. In particular, this implies that the mean
curvature flow of star-shaped hypersurfaces is generic in the sense of
Colding-Minicozzi [CM12].
