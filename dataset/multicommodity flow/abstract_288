We report on the first measurements of elliptic and triangular flow for
charged pions, kaons and anti-protons in lead-lead collisions at 2.76 TeV
measured with the ALICE detector at the LHC. We compare the observed mass
splitting of differential elliptic flow at LHC energies to RHIC measurements at
lower energies and theory predictions. We test the quark coalescence picture
with the quark number scaling of elliptic and triangular flow.
