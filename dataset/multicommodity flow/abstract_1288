We report on a systematic center-to-limb variation in measured helioseismic
travel times, which must be taken into account for an accurate determination of
solar interior meridional flows. The systematic variation, found in
time-distance helioseismology analysis using SDO/HMI and SDO/AIA observations,
is different in both travel-time magnitude and variation trend for different
observables. It is not clear what causes this systematic effect. Subtracting
the longitude-dependent east-west travel times, obtained along the equatorial
area, from the latitude-dependent north-south travel times, obtained along the
central meridian area, gives remarkably similar results for different
observables. We suggest this as an effective procedure for removing the
systematic center-to-limb variation. The subsurface meridional flows obtained
from inversion of the corrected travel times are approximately 10 m/s slower
than those obtained without removing the systematic effect. The detected
center-to-limb variation may have important implications in the derivation of
meridional flows in the deep interior, and needs a better understanding.
