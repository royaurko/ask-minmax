Strange particles such as the kaon and lambda are useful in probing the
properties of dense matter formed in heavy ion collisions. We review in this
talk the theoretical understandings of their properties in nuclear medium based
on both the effective chiral Lagrangian and the phenomenological hadronic
model. We further review the effects due to changes in their in-medium
properties on their collective flow in heavy ion collisions.
