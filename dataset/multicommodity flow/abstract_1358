The calculation of the full (renormalized) holographic action is undertaken
in general Einstein-scalar theories. The appropriate formalism is developed and
the renormalized effective action is calculated up to two derivatives in the
metric and scalar operators. The holographic RG equations involve Ricci flow
for the space-time metric as well as the standard $\beta$-function flow for
scalar operators. Several examples are analyzed and the effective action is
calculated. A set of conserved quantities of the holographic flow is found,
whose interpretation is not yet understood.
