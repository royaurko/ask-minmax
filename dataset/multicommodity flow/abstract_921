It has been recently shown that transonic electron positron fluid is the
least relativistic, compared to the fluid containing finite proportion of
baryons. We compute spectra from these flows in general relativity (GR)
including the effect of light bending. We consider the bremsstrahlung process
to supply the seed photons. We choose accretion in the advective domain, and
for simplicity the radial accretion or Bondi type accretion. We show that
electron positron accreting flow produces the softest spectra and the lowest
luminosity.
