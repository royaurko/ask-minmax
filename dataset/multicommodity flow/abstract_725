We present a taxonomy and an algebra for attack patterns on component-based
operating systems. In a multilevel security scenario, where isolation of
partitions containing data at different security classifications is the primary
security goal and security breaches are mainly defined as undesired disclosure
or modification of classified data, strict control of information flows is the
ultimate goal. In order to prevent undesired information flows, we provide a
classification of information flow types in a component-based operating system
and, by this, possible patterns to attack the system. The systematic
consideration of informations flows reveals a specific type of operating system
covert channel, the covert physical channel, which connects two former isolated
partitions by emitting physical signals into the computer's environment and
receiving them at another interface.
