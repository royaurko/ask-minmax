We consider flows, called $W^{\rm u}$ flows, whose orbits are the unstable
manifolds of a codimension one Anosov flow. Under some regularity asumptions,
we give a short proof of the strong mixing property of $W^{\rm u}$ flows and we
show that $W^{\rm u}$ flows have purely absolutely continuous spectrum in the
orthocomplement of the constant functions. As a particular case, we obtain that
a class of horocycle flows for compact surfaces of (possibly variable) negative
curvature have purely absolutely continuous spectrum in the orthocomplement of
the constant functions. This generalises recent results on time changes of the
classical horocycle flows for compact surfaces of constant negative curvature.
