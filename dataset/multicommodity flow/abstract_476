Recent experiments imaging fluid flow around swimming microorganisms have
revealed complex time-dependent velocity fields that differ qualitatively from
the stresslet flow commonly employed in theoretical descriptions of active
matter. Here we obtain the most general flow around a finite sized active
particle by expanding the surface stress in irreducible Cartesian tensors. This
expansion, whose first term is the stresslet, must include, respectively,
third-rank polar and axial tensors to minimally capture crucial features of the
active oscillatory flow around translating Chlamydomonas and the active
swirling flow around rotating Volvox. The representation provides explicit
expressions for the irreducible symmetric, antisymmetric and isotropic parts of
the continuum active stress. Antisymmetric active stresses do not conserve
orbital angular momentum and our work thus shows that spin angular momentum is
necessary to restore angular momentum conservation in continuum hydrodynamic
descriptions of active soft matter.
