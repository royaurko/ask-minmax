An attractive, energy-dependent mean-field potential for baryons is
introduced in order to generate a soft region in the nuclear equation-of-state,
as suggested by recent lattice QCD calculations of baryon free matter at finite
temperature. Based on a hadronic transport model, we find that although this
equation-of-state has negligible effects on the inclusive hadronic spectra, it
leads to a minimum in the energy dependence of the transverse collective flow
and a delayed expansion of the compressed matter. In particular, the transverse
flow changes its direction as the colliding system passes through the softest
region in the equation-of-state.
