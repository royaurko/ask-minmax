We describe the physical hypotheses underlying the derivation of an
approximate model of water waves. For unidirectional surface shallow water
waves moving over an irrotational flow as well as over a non-zero vorticity
flow, we derive the Camassa-Holm equation by an interplay of variational
methods and small-parameter expansions.
