The effects of global flow rotation and curvature on the subcritical
transition to turbulence in shear flows are examined. The relevant time-scales
of the problem are identified by a decomposition of the flow into a laminar and
a deviation from laminar parts, which is performed for rotating plane Couette
and Taylor-Couette flows. The usefulness and relevance of this procedure are
discussed at the same time. By comparing the self-sustaining process time-scale
to the time-scales previously identified, an interpretation is brought to light
for the behavior of the transition Reynolds number with the rotation number and
relative gap width in the whole neighborhood (in parameter space) of the
non-rotating plane Couette flow covered by the available data.
