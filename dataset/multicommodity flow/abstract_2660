A pair of curved shocks in a collisionless plasma is examined with a
two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. The shocks are created by
the collision of two electron-ion clouds at a speed that exceeds everywhere the
threshold speed for shock formation. A variation of the collision speed along
the initially planar collision boundary, which is comparable to the ion
acoustic speed, yields a curvature of the shock that increases with time. The
spatially varying Mach number of the shocks results in a variation of the
downstream density in the direction along the shock boundary. This variation is
eventually equilibrated by the thermal diffusion of ions. The pair of shocks is
stable for tens of inverse ion plasma frequencies. The angle between the mean
flow velocity vector of the inflowing upstream plasma and the shock's
electrostatic field increases steadily during this time. The disalignment of
both vectors gives rise to a rotational electron flow, which yields the growth
of magnetic field patches that are coherent over tens of electron skin depths.
