The transition of a counter chemotactic particle flow from a free-flow state
to a jammed state in a quasi-one-dimensional path is investigated. One of the
characteristic features of such a flow is that the constituent particles
spontaneously form a cluster that blocks the path, called a path-blocking
cluster (PBC), and causes a jammed state when the particle density is greater
than a threshold value. Near the threshold value, the PBC occasionally desolve
itself to recover the free flow. In other words, the time evolution of the size
of the PBC governs the flux of a counter chemotactic flow. In this paper, on
the basis of numerical results of a stochastic cellular automata (SCA) model,
we introduce a Langevin equation model for the size evolution of the PBC that
reproduces the qualitative characteristics of the SCA model. The results
suggest that the emergence of the jammed state in a quasi-one-dimensional
counter flow is caused by a saddle-node bifurcation.
