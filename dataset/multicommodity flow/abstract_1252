Motivated by the interface model for the solar dynamo, this paper explores
the complex magnetohydrodynamic interactions between convective flows and
shear-driven instabilities. Initially, we consider the dynamics of a forced
shear flow across a convectively-stable polytropic layer, in the presence of a
vertical magnetic field. When the imposed magnetic field is weak, the dynamics
are dominated by a shear flow (Kelvin-Helmholtz type) instability. For stronger
fields, a magnetic buoyancy instability is preferred. If this stably stratified
shear layer lies below a convectively unstable region, these two regions can
interact. Once again, when the imposed field is very weak, the dynamical
effects of the magnetic field are negligible and the interactions between the
shear layer and the convective layer are relatively minor. However, if the
magnetic field is strong enough to favour magnetic buoyancy instabilities in
the shear layer, extended magnetic flux concentrations form and rise into the
convective layer. These magnetic structures have a highly disruptive effect
upon the convective motions in the upper layer.
