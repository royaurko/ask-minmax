The flow field generated by a transom-stern hullform is a complex,
broad-banded, three-dimensional phenomenon marked by a large breaking wave.
This unsteady multiphase turbulent flow feature is difficult to study
experimentally and simulate numerically. The results of a set of numerical
simulations, which use the Numerical Flow Analysis (NFA) code, of the flow
around the Model 5673 transom stern at speeds covering both wet- and
dry-transom operating conditions are shown in the accompanying fluid dynamics
video. The numerical predictions for wet-transom and dry-transom conditions are
presented to demonstrate the current state of the art in the simulation of ship
generated breaking waves. The interested reader is referred to Drazen et al.
(2010) for a detailed and comprehensive comparison with experiments conducted
at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD).
