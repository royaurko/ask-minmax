In this article we discuss an implementation of renormalization group ideas
to spin foam models, where there is no a priori length scale with which to
define the flow. In the context of the continuum limit of these models, we show
how the notion of cylindrical consistency of path integral measures gives a
natural analogue of Wilson's RG flow equations for background-independent
systems. We discuss the conditions for the continuum measures to be
diffeomorphism-invariant, and consider both exact and approximate examples.
