The possible mechanisms contributing to anisotropic flow fluctuations in
relativistic heavy ion collisions are discussed. The LHC data on event-by-event
harmonic flow coefficients measured in PbPb collisions at center-of-mass energy
2.76 TeV per nucleon pair are analyzed and interpreted within the HYDJET++
model. To compare the model results with the experimental data the unfolding
procedure is employed. It is shown that HYDJET++ correctly reproduces dynamical
fluctuations of elliptic and triangular flows and related to it eccentricity
fluctuations of the initial state.
