We discuss the effect of the Poynting flow on the magnetically dominated thin
accretion disk, which is simplified to a two-dimensional disk on the equatorial
plane. It is shown in the relativistic formulation that the Poynting flux by
the rotating magnetic field with Keplerian angular velocity can balance the
energy and angular momentum conservation of a steady accretion flow.
