Different ways to achieve the stabilization of a linear z-pinch by a
superimposed shear flow are analyzed. They are: 1) Axial shear flow proposed by
Arber and Howell with the pinch discharge in its center, and experimentally
tested by Shumlak et al. 2) Spiral flow of a dense low temperature plasma
surrounding a dense pinch discharge. 3) A thin metallic projectile shot at a
high velocity through the center of the pinch discharge. 4) The replacement of
the high velocity projectile by the shape charge effect jet in a conical
implosion. 5) The replacement of the jet by a stationary wire inside the
conical implosion.
