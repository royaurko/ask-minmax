We analyze gradient flows with jumps generated by a finite set of complete
vector fields in involution using some Radon measures $u\in \mathcal{U}_a$ as
admissible perturbations. Both the evolution of a bounded gradient flow
$\{x^u(t,\l)\in B(x^*,3\g)\subseteq \mbn: \,t\in[0,T],\,\l\in B(x^*,2\g)\}$ and
the unique solution $\l=\psi^u(t,x)\in B(x^*,2\g)\subseteq \mbn$ of integral
equation $x^u(t,\l)=x\in B(x^*,\g), \,t\in[0,T]$, are described using the
corresponding gradient representation associated with flow and Hamilton-jacobi
equations.
