We calculate the contribution to the elliptic flow observable v2 from
two-particle correlations in minijet production in ultrarelativistic heavy ion
collisions. We use a minijet production cross section derived in a model
inspired by saturation approach to high energy scattering. Resulting
differential elliptic flow v2(pT) is an increasing function of pT for
transverse momenta below the saturation scale Qs. At higher transverse momenta
(pT > Qs) differential flow stops growing and becomes approximately constant,
reproducing the elliptic flow saturation data reported by STAR. The centrality
dependence of the minijet contribution to v2 is also in good agreement with the
data.
