The cellular automaton model for traffic flow exhibits a jamming transition
from a free-flow phase to a congested phase. In the deterministic case this
transition corresponds to a critical point with diverging correlation length.
In the presence of noise, however, no consistent picture has emerged up to now.
We present data from numerical simulations which suggest the absence of
critical behavior. The transition of the deterministic case is smeared out and
one only observes the remnants of the critical point.
