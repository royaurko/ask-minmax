The local persistent current in two dimensional strongly interacting systems
is investigated. As the interaction strength is enhanced the current in the
sample undergoes a transition from diffusive to ordered flow. The strong
interacting flow has the characteristics of a plastic flow through dislocations
in the pinned charge density wave which develops in the system at low
densities.
