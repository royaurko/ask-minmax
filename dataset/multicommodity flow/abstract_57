We investigate the motion of a spherical drop in a general quadratic flow
acted upon by an arbitrarily oriented externally applied uniform electric
field. The drop and media are considered to be leaky dielectrics. The flow
field affects the distribution of charges on the drop surface, which leads to
alteration in the electric field, thereby affecting the velocity field through
the Maxwell stress on the fluid-fluid interface. The two-way coupled
electrohydrodynamics is central towards dictating the motion of the drop in the
flow field. We analytically address the electric potential distribution and
Stokesian flow field in and around the drop in a general quadratic flow for
small electric Reynolds number (which is the ratio of the charge relaxation
time scale to the convective time scale). As a special case, we consider a drop
in an unbounded cylindrical Poiseuille flow and show that, an otherwise absent,
cross-stream drop migration may be obtained in the presence of a uniform
electric field. Depending on the direction of the applied electric field and
the relative electrical properties of the drop and media, the drop may migrate
towards or away from the centreline of the imposed Poiseuille flow.
