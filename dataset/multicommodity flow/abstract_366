Spherical (nonrotating) accretion flows with small-scale magnetic fields have
been investigated using three-dimensional, time-dependent MHD simulations.
These simulations have been designed to model high-resolution (quasi) steady
accretion flows in a wedge computational domain that represents a small
fraction of the full spherical domain. Subsonic and supersonic
(super-fast-magnetosonic) accretion flows have been considered. Two accretion
regimes have been studied: conservative, or radiatively inefficient, and
nonconservative, in which the heat released in magnetic reconnections is
completely lost. The flows in both regimes are turbulent. They show the
flattened radial density profiles and reduction of the accretion velocities and
mass accretion rates in comparison with hydrodynamic Bondi flows. In the
conservative regime, the turbulence is more intensive and supported mostly by
thermal convection. In the nonconservative regime, the turbulence is less
intensive and supported by magnetic buoyancy and various magnetic interactions.
We have concluded that steady, supersonic spherical accretion cannot be
developed in the presence of small-scale magnetic fields.
