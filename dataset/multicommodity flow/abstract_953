In this paper we investigate effects of boundary conditions on one
dimensional pedestrian flow which involves purely longitudinal interactions.
Qualitatively, stop-and-go waves are observed under closed boundary condition
and dissolve when the boundary is open. To get more detailed information the
fundamental diagrams of the open and closed systems are compared using
Voronoi-based measurement method. Higher maximal specific flow is observed from
the pedestrian movement at open boundary condition.
