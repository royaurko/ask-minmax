Using models ranging from schematic one with a simple quark distribution to
more realistic blast wave, we study the elliptic flow of hadrons produced from
coalescence of quarks and antiquarks in the quark-gluon plasma that is formed
in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. In particular, we study effects due
to azimuthal anisotropy in the local transverse momentum distribution of
quarks, as generated by their position-momentum correlations as a result of
radial flow and/or jet quenching. We find that even if quarks have large local
non-elliptic anisotropic flow, the elliptic flow of produced hadrons can still
scale with their constituent quark numbers. This scaling is, however, broken if
the radial flow of coalescing quarks is anisotropic and/or if the momentum
dispersion of quarks inside hadrons is included.
