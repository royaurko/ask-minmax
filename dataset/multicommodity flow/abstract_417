We present analytical and numerical results of modeling of flows represented
as the correlated non-Poissonian point process and as the Poissonian sequence
of pulses of the different size. Both models may generate signals with the
power-law distributions of the intensity of the flow and the power-law spectral
density. Furthermore, different distributions of the interevent time of the
point process and different statistics of the size of pulses may result in
$1/f^{\beta}$ noise (one-over-f noise, 1-f noise) with
$0.5\lesssim\beta\lesssim2$. Combination of the models is applied for modeling
of the Internet traffic.
