We use the asymmetric simple exclusion process for describing vehicular
traffic flow at the intersection of two streets. No traffic lights control the
traffic flow. The approaching cars to the intersection point yield to each
other to avoid collision. This yielding dynamics is model by implementing
exclusion process to the intersection point of the two streets. Closed boundary
condition is applied to the streets. We utilize both mean-field approach and
extensive simulations to find the model characteristics. In particular, we
obtain the fundamental diagrams and show that the effect of interaction between
chains can be regarded as a dynamic impurity at the intersection point.
