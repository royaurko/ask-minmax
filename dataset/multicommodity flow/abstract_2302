A strong azimuthal flow signature at RHIC suggests rapid system equilibration
leading to an almost perfect fluid state. The longitudinal extent of the flow
behavior depends on how this state is formed and can be studied by measuring
the pseudorapidity and transverse momentum dependence of the second Fourier
component ($v_{2}(p_{T})$) of the azimuthal angular distribution. We report on
a measurement of identified-particle $v_{2}$ as a function of $p_{T}$ (0.5-2.0
GeV/c), centrality (0-25%, 25-50%), and pseudorapidity ($0\leq\eta<3.2$) for
$\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200 \rm GeV$ Au+Au collisions. The BRAHMS spectrometers are
used for particle identification ($\pi$, K, p) and momentum determination and
the BRAHMS global detectors are used to determine the corresponding
reaction-plane angles. The results are discussed in terms of the rapidity
dependence of constituent quark scaling and in terms of models that develop the
complete (azimuthal and radial) hydrodynamic aspects of the forward dynamics at
RHIC.
