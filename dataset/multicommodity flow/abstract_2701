When the mass accretion rate onto a black hole (BH) falls below a critical
rate, ${\dot M}_{crit}\sim \alpha^2 {\dot M}_{Edd}$, accretion can occur via a
hot optically thin flow where most of the dissipated energy is advected inward.
We present such an advection-dominated model for the soft X-ray transient (SXT)
A0620-00. This source has a puzzlingly low X-ray luminosity in quiescence,
$\sim 6\times 10^{30} ~{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$, despite a relatively high mass
accretion rate $\sim10^{-10} ~M_{\odot}{\rm yr^{-1}}$ deduced from its optical
flux. The accreting gas makes a transition from a standard thin disc at large
radii to an advection-dominated flow at small radii. The transition occurs when
the effective temperature of the thin disc is $\sim 10^4$ K. Because of the
very low accretion efficiency, $\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-4}$, in the inner flow, the
model fits both the optical and X-ray data. We also present models for V404 Cyg
and Nova Mus 1991 in quiescence. Quiescent neutron star (NS) transients are
expected to appear very different from BH systems because the advected energy
is re-radiated from the NS surface whereas a BH swallows the advected energy.
We discuss models for NS SXTs.
