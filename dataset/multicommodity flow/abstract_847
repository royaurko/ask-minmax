Collective flow reflects the dynamical evolution in high-energy heavy ion
collisions. In particular, the elliptic flow reflects early collision
dynamics.We present a systematic analysis of elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) for
identified particles measured in Au + Au and Cu + Cu collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Number of quark scaling is tested in the
intermediate $p_{T}$ region and in the smaller system (Cu + Cu). The Cu + Cu
collisions results are compared with those from ideal hydrodynamic model
calculations.
