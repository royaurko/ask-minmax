We consider inertial particles suspended in an incompressible turbulent flow.
Due to inertia of particles, their velocity field acquires small compressible
component. Its presence leads to a new qualitative effect --- possibility of
clustering. We show that this effect is significant for heavy particles,
leading to strong fluctuations of the concentration.
