We use the Wetterich equation for foliated spacetimes to study the RG flow of
projectable Horava-Lifshitz gravity coupled to n Lifshitz scalars. Using novel
results for anisotropic heat kernels, the matter-induced beta functions for the
gravitational couplings are computed explicitly. The RG flow exhibits an UV
attractive anisotropic Gaussian fixed point where Newton's constant vanishes
and the extra scalar mode decouples. This fixed point ensures that the theory
is asymptotically free in the large-n expansion, indicating that projectable
Horava-Lifshitz gravity is perturbatively renormalizable. Notably, the
fundamental fixed point action does not obey detailed balance.
