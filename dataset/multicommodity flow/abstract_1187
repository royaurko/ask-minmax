A subgrid turbulence model for the lattice Boltzmann method is proposed for
high Reynolds number fluid flow applications. The method, based on the standard
Smagorinsky subgrid model and a single-time relaxation lattice Boltzmann
method, incorporates the advantages of the lattice Boltzmann method for
handling arbitrary boundaries and is easily implemented on parallel machines.
The method is applied to a two-dimensional driven cavity flow for studying
dynamics and the Reynolds number dependence of the flow structures. The
substitution of other subgrid models, such as the dynamic subgrid model, in the
framework of the LB method is discussed.
