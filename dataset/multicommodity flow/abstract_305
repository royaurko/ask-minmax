We revisit BPS solutions to classical N=2 low energy effective gauge
theories. It is shown that the BPS equations can be solved in full generality
by the introduction of a Hesse potential, a symplectic analog of the
holomorphic prepotential. We explain how for non-spherically symmetric,
non-mutually local solutions, the notion of attractor flow generalizes to
gradient flow with respect to the Hesse potential. Furthermore we show that in
general there is a non-trivial magnetic complement to this flow equation that
is sourced by the momentum current in the solution.
