We propose a finite volume scheme for computing two-fluid flows in variable
cross-section ducts. Our scheme satisfies a well-balanced property. It is based
on the VFRoe approach. The VFRoe variables are the Riemann invariants of the
stationnary wave and the cross-section. In order to avoid spurious pressure
oscillations, the well-balanced approach is coupled with an ALE (Arbitrary
Lagrangian Eulerian) technique at the interface and a random sampling remap.
