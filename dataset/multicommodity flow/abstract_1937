Anisotropic azimuthal correlations are used to probe the properties and the
evolution of the system created in heavy-ion collisions. Two-particle azimuthal
correlations were used in the searches of $p_{\rm T}$ dependent fluctuations of
flow angle and magnitude, measured with the ALICE detector. The comparison of
hydrodynamic calculations with measurements will also be presented in this
proceedings.
