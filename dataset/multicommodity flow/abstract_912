The paper examines the issue of stability of Poiseuille type flows in regime
of compressible Navier-Stokes equations in a three dimensional finite pipe-like
domain. We prove the existence of stationary solutions with inhomogeneous
Navier slip boundary conditions admitting nontrivial inflow condition in the
vicinity of constructed generic flows. Our techniques are based on an
application of a modification of the Lagrangian coordinates. Thanks to such
approach we are able to overcome difficulties coming from hyperbolicity of the
continuity equation, constructing a maximal regularity estimate for a
linearized system and applying the Banach fixed point theorem.
