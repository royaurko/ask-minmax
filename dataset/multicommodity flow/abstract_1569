We prove the existence of a generalization of Kelvin's circulation theorem in
general relativity which is applicable to perfect isentropic
magnetohydrodynamic flow. The argument is based on a new version of the
Lagrangian for perfect magnetohydrodynamics. We illustrate the new conserved
circulation with the example of a relativistic magnetohydrodynamic flow
possessing three symmetries.
