The Navier--Stokes equations arise naturally as a result of Ehrenfests'
coarse-graining in phase space after a period of free-flight dynamics. This
point of view allows for a very flexible approach to the simulation of fluid
flow for high-Reynolds number. We construct regularisers for lattice Boltzmann
computational models. These regularisers are based on Ehrenfests'
coarse-graining idea and could be applied to schemes with either entropic or
non-entropic quasiequilibria. We give a numerical scheme which gives good
results for the standard test cases of the shock tube and the flow past a
square cylinder.
