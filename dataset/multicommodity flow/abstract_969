The inhomogeneous cooling flow scenario predicts the existence of large
quantities of gas in massive elliptical galaxies, groups, and clusters that
have cooled and dropped out of the flow. Using spatially resolved, deprojected
X-ray spectra from the ROSAT PSPC we have detected strong absorption over
energies ~0.4-0.8 keV intrinsic to the central ~1 arcmin of the galaxy, NGC
1399, the group, NGC 5044, and the cluster, A1795. These systems have amongst
the largest nearby cooling flows in their respective classes and low Galactic
columns. Since no excess absorption is indicated for energies below ~0.4 keV
the most reasonable model for the absorber is warm, collisionally ionized gas
with T=10^{5-6} K where ionized states of oxygen provide most of the
absorption. Attributing the absorption only to ionized gas reconciles the large
columns of cold H and He inferred from Einstein and ASCA with the lack of such
columns inferred from ROSAT, and also is consistent with the negligible atomic
and molecular H inferred from HI, and CO observations of cooling flows. The
prediction of warm ionized gas as the product of mass drop-out in these and
other cooling flows can be verified by Chandra, XMM, and ASTRO-E.
