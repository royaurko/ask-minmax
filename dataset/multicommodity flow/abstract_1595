We find that a simple extension of the coalescence model is sufficient to
incorporate the perfect quark number scaling behavior of the elliptic flow in
transverse kinetic energy, recently discovered by the PHENIX Collaboration. The
flavor dependence of the elliptic flow can be consistently described in the low
and intermediate $p_T$ if the transverse kinetic energy is conserved in the
$2\to1$ or $3\to1$ parton coalescence process at the hadronization. Thus
suggesting the quark coalescence as a possible hadronization mechanism at low
$p_T$ as well.
