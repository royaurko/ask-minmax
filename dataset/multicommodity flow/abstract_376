Hypotheses and some results of the three-phase traffic theory by the contributor
are compared with results of the fundamental diagram approach to traffic flow
theory. A critical discussion of model results about congested pattern features
which have been derived within the fundamental diagram approach to traffic flow
theory and modelling is made. The empirical basis of the three-phase traffic
theory is discussed and some new spatial-temporal features of the traffic phase
"synchronized flow" are considered. A probabilistic theory of highway capacity
is presented which is based on the three-phase traffic theory. In the frame of
this theory, the probabilistic nature of highway capacity in free flow is
linked to an occurrence of the first order local phase transition from the
traffic phase "free flow" to the traffic phase "synchronized flow". A numerical
study of congested pattern highway capacity based on simulations of a KKW
cellular automata model within the three-phase traffic theory is presented. A
congested pattern highway capacity which depends on features of congested
spatial-temporal patterns upstream of a bottleneck is studied.
