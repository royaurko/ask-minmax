We develop an event-by-event ideal hydrodynamical framework where initial
state density fluctuations are present and where we use a similar flow-analysis
method as in the experiments to make a one-to-one $v_2$ comparison with the
measured data. Our studies also show that the participant plane is quite a good
approximation for the event plane.
