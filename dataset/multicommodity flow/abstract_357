The method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to study the canonical
problem of steady laminar flow through a narrow two-dimensional channel blocked
by a tight-fitting finite-length highly permeable porous obstacle. We
investigate the behaviour of the local flow close to the interface between the
single-phase and porous regions (governed by the incompressible Navier--Stokes
and Darcy flow equations, respectively). We solve for the local flow in the
limits of low and high Reynolds number, facilitating an understanding of the
nature of the transition from Poiseuille to plug to Poiseuille flow in each of
these limits. Significant analytic progress is made in the high-Reynolds-number
limit, as we are able to explore in detail the rich boundary layer structure
that occurs. We derive general results for the interfacial stress and for the
conditions that couple the flow in the regions away from the interface. We
consider the three-dimensional generalization to unsteady laminar flow through
and around a tight-fitting highly permeable cylindrical porous obstacle within
a Hele-Shaw cell. Finally, we illustrate the utility of our analysis by
considering a specific example, namely the flow through a porous cylinder with
a circular cross-section. Notably, in the high-Reynolds-number limit, the fluid
inertia can cause a net force to be generated on the cylinder, even when the
far-field forcing is periodic with zero mean.
