The anisotropic flow of charged hadrons in asymmetric Cu+Au collisions at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider is studied in a multi-phase transport model.
Compared with previous results for symmetric Au+Au collisions, charged hadrons
produced around midrapidity in asymmetric collisions are found to have a
stronger directed flow $v_{1}$ and their elliptic flow $% v_{2} $ is also more
sensitive to the parton scattering cross section. While higher-order flows
$v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ are small at all rapidities, both $% v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ in
these collisions are appreciable and show an asymmetry in forward and backward
rapidities.
