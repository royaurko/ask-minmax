We study here the curious particle dynamics resulting from electro-osmotic
flow around a microchannel junction corner whose dielectric walls are weakly
polarizable. The hydrodynamic velocity field is obtained via superposition of a
linear irrotational term associated with the equilibrium zeta potentials of
both the microchannel and particle surfaces and the non-linear induced-charge
electro-osmotic flow which originates from the interaction of the externally
applied electric field on the charge cloud it induces at the solid-liquid
interface. The particle dynamics are analyzed by considering dielectrophoretic
forces via the addition of a mobility term to the flow field in the limit of
Stokes drag law. The former, non-divergence free term is responsible for
migration of particles towards the sharp microchannel junction corner, where
they can potentially accumulate. Experimental observations of particle trapping
for various applied electric fields and microparticle size are rationalized in
terms of the growing relative importance of the dielectrophoretic force and
induced-charge contributions to the global velocity field with increasing
intensity of the externally applied electric field.
