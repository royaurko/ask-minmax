The distribution of equivalent plastic strain through the thickness of
several AISI 1020 steel plates formed under different conditions over a smooth
cylindrical mandrel using a single-roller forward flow forming operation was
studied by measuring the local micro-indentation hardness of the deformed
material. The equivalent plastic strain was higher at the inner and outer
surfaces and lowest at the center of the workpiece. Empirical expressions are
presented which describe the contribution of the roller and mandrel to the
total local equivalent plastic strain within the flow formed part. The
dependence of these expressions upon the thickness reduction during flow
forming is discussed.
