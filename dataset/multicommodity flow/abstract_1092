An elementary analytical fluid flow is composed by a geometric domain, a list
of analytical constraints and by the function which depends on the physical
properties, as Reynolds number, of the considered fluid. For this object,
notions of laminar or weakly turbulent behavior are described using a simple
mathematical model.
