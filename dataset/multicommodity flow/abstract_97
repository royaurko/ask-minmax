We consider stochastic flow on n-dimensional Euclidean space driven by
fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H greater than half, and study
tangent flow and the growth of the Hausdorff measure of sub-manifolds of the
ambient n-dimensional Euclidean space, as they evolve under the flow. The main
result is a bound on the rate of (global) growth in terms of the (local) Holder
norm of the flow.
