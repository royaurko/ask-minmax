We discuss a resummed perturbation theory based on the Wilson renormalization
group. In this formulation the Wilsonian flowing couplings, which generalize
the running coupling, enter directly into the loop expansion. In the case of an
asymptotically free theory the flowing coupling is well defined since the
infrared Landau pole is absent. We show this property in the case of the
$\phi^3_6$ theory. We also extend this formulation to the QED theory and we
prove that it is consistent with gauge invariance.
