We prove a comparison theorem for the isoperimetric profiles of solutions of
the normalized Ricci flow on the two-sphere: If the isoperimetric profile of
the initial metric is greater than that of some positively curved axisymmetric
metric, then the inequality remains true for the isoperimetric profiles of the
evolved metrics. We apply this using the Rosenau solution as the model metric
to deduce sharp time-dependent curvature bounds for arbitrary solutions of the
normalized Ricci flow on the two-sphere. This gives a simple and direct proof
of convergence to a constant curvature metric without use of any blowup or
compactness arguments, Harnack estimates, or any classification of behaviour
near singularities.
