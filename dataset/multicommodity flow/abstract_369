Consider the 3D flow of a viscous Newtonian fluid upon a curved 2D substrate
when the fluid film is thin as occurs in many draining, coating and biological
flows. We derive a comprehensive model of the dynamics of the film, the model
being expressed in terms of the film thickness and the average lateral
velocity. Based upon centre manifold theory, we are assured that the model
accurately includes the effects of the curvature of substrate, gravitational
body force, fluid inertia and dissipation. The model may be used to resolve
wave-like phenomena in the dynamics of viscous fluid flows over arbitrarily
curved substrates such as cylinders, tubes and spheres. We briefly illustrate
its use in simulating drop formation on cylindrical fibres, wave transitions,
Faraday waves, viscous hydraulic jumps, and flow vortices in a compound
channel. These models are the most complete models for thin film flow of a
Newtonian fluid; many other thin film models can be obtained by different
truncations of the dynamical equations given herein.
