In this paper we prove uniform regularity estimates for the normalized Gauss
curvature flow in higher dimensions. The convergence of solutions in
$C^\infty$-topology to a smooth strictly convex soliton as $t$ approaches to
infinity is obtained as a consequence of these estimates together with an
earlier result of Andrews. The estimates are established via the study of a new
entropy functional for the flow.
