We study to what extent the measured elliptic flow at RHIC constrains viscous
deviations from ideal hydrodynamics. We solve a toy model where only transverse
momenta are thermalized while the system undergoes longitudinal free-streaming.
We show that RHIC data exclude such a model and thus require fast 3-dimensional
thermalization.
