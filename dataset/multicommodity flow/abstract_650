In a recent letter, Govaert et al. examined the relationship between strain
hardening modulus $G_r$ and flow stress $\sigma_{flow}$ for five different
glassy polymers. In each case, results for $G_r$ at different strain rates or
different temperatures were linearly related to the flow stress. They suggested
that this linear relation was inconsistent with simulations. Data from previous
publications and new results are presented to show that simulations also yield
a linear relation between modulus and flow stress. Possible explanations for
the change in the ratio of modulus to flow stress with temperature and strain
rate are discussed.
