From single vehicle data a number of new empirical results concerning the
density-dependence of the velocity distribution and its moments as well as the
characteristics of their temporal fluctuations have been determined. These are
utilized for the specification of some fundamental relations of traffic flow
and compared with existing traffic theories.
