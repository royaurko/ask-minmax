We study the implications of a recent estimate of the bulk flow of a sample
of galaxies containing supernovae type Ia by Riess, Press, and Kirshner. We
find that their results are quite consistent with power spectra from several
currently popular models of structure formation, but that the sample is as yet
too sparse to put significant constraints on the power spectrum. We compare
this new result with that of Lauer and Postman, with which there is apparent
disagreement. We find that for the power spectra we consider, the difference in
window functions between the two samples used for the measurements results in a
low level of expected correlation between the estimated bulk flows. We
calculate a $\chi^2$ for the two measurements taken together and find that
their lack of agreement tends to disfavor spectra with excessive power on large
scales, but not at a level sufficient to rule them out. A sample consisting of
other SN type Ia's found in the Asiago catalog is used to study how the
sensitivity of the method used by RPK will improve with increasing sample size.
We conclude that the local group motion should be able to be determined with a
sample of $\sim 100$ SN Ia light curve shapes.
