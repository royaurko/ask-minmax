We suggest to perform systematic measurements of the elliptic flow
fluctuations which are sensitive to the early stage dynamics of heavy-ion
collisions at high-energies. Significant flow fluctuations are shown to be
generated due to the formation of topological clusters and development of the
filamentation instability. The statistical noise and hydrodynamic fluctuations
are also estimated.
