The relationship between the compressible magnetohydrodynamic flows with low
Mach number and the incompressible magnetohydrodynamic flows is investigated.
More precisely, the convergence of weak solutions of the compressible
isentropic viscous magnetohydrodynamic equations to the weak solutions of the
incompressible viscous magnetohydrodynamic equations is proved as the density
becomes constant and the Mach number goes to zero, that is, the corresponding
incompressible limits are justified when the spatial domain is a periodic
domain, the whole space, or a bounded domain.
