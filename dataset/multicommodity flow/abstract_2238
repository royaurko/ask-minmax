Comment on Similarity analysis in magnetohydrodynamics:effects of Hall and
ion-slip currents on free convection flow and mass transfer of a gas past a
semi-infinite vertical plate, A.A. Megahed, S.R. Komy, A.A. Afify [Acta
Mechanica 151, 185-194 (2001)]
  In the above paper is investigated the boundary layer flow of an electrically
conducting fluid over a vertical, stationary plate placed in a calm fluid. The
effects of Hall and ion-slip currents are taken into account. The boundary
layer equations are transformed into ordinary ones using a scaling group of
transformations and subsequently are solved numerically. However, there are two
fundamental errors in the above paper which are presented below.
