The production of baryon and mesons in the RHIC heavy-ion experiments has
received a lot of attention lately. Although not widely known, the pp data
measured concurrently with heavy ion collisions do not find a convincing
explanation in terms of simple models. We present the results of an afterburner
to Pythia and Hijing event generators, simulating radial flow which seems to
qualitatively explain the experimental results when applied to the pp collision
data from RHIC at 200 GeV center-of-mass energy.
