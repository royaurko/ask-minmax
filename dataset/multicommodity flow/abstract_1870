It is well known that nonlinear diffusion equations can be interpreted as a
gradient flow in the space of probability measures equipped with the Euclidean
Wasserstein distance. Under suitable convexity conditions on the nonlinearity,
due to R. J. McCann, the associated entropy is geodesically convex, which
implies a contraction type property between all solutions with respect to this
distance. In this note, we give a simple straightforward proof of the
equivalence between this contraction type property and this convexity
condition, without even resorting to the entropy and the gradient flow
structure.
