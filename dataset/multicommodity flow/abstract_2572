Observations of the black hole in the center of the Milky Way with the Event
Horizon Telescope at 1.3 mm have revealed a size of the emitting region that is
smaller than the size of the black-hole shadow. This can be reconciled with the
spectral properties of the source, if the accretion flow is seen at a
relatively high inclination (50-60 degrees). Such an inclination makes the
angular momentum of the flow, and perhaps of the black hole, nearly aligned
with the angular momenta of the orbits of stars that lie within 3 arcsec from
the black hole. We discuss the implications of such an alignment for the
properties of the black hole and of its accretion flow. We argue that future
Event-Horizon-Telescope observations will not only refine the inclination of
Sgr A* but also measure precisely its orientation on the plane of the sky.
