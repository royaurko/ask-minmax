The potential of the hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method has been
recognized for the computation of stationary flows. Extending the method to
time-dependent problems can, e.g., be done by backward difference formulae
(BDF) or diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) methods. In this work, we
investigate the use of embedded DIRK methods in an HDG solver, including the
use of adaptive time-step control. Numerical results demonstrate the
performance of the method for both linear and nonlinear (systems of)
time-dependent convection-diffusion equations.
