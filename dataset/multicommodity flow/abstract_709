In this paper, we study the regularized mean curvature flow starting from
invariant hypersurfaces in a Hilbert space equipped with an isometric almost
free Hilbert Lie group action whose orbits are minimal regularizable
submanifolds, where "almost free" means that the stabilizers of the group
action are finite. First we obtain the evolution equations for some geometric
quantities along the regularized mean curvature flow. Next, by using the
evolution equations, we prove a horizontally strongly convexity preservability
theorem for the regularized mean curvature flow. From this theorem, we derive
the strongly convexity preservability theorem for the mean curvature flow
starting from compact Riemannian suborbifolds in the orbit space (which is a
Riemannian orbifold) of the Hilbert Lie group action.
