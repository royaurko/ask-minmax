We consider the evolution of open planar curves by the steepest descent flow
of a geometric functional, under different boundary conditions. We prove that,
if any set of stationary solutions with fixed energy is finite, then a solution
of the flow converges to a stationary solution as time goes to infinity. We
also present a few applications of this result.
