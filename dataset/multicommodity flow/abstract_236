The post-shock flow in the accretion region of MCVs is considered to be a
magnetically confined cooling flow. The X-ray spectrum from this hot plasma is
emitted from a range of temperatures and densities. Extracting information from
such spectra obtained with the next generation of X-ray satellites will rely on
models for the structure of this flow which include appropriate treatment of
the cooling mechanisms, boundary conditions and of absorptions and reflection
components. This paper summarises the current situation and explores some of
the difficulties arising in the exploitation of the line emission from these
systems. It concludes by looking at improvements to the models now in the
pipeline.
