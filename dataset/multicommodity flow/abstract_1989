In this paper, we investigate the density-dependent incompressible nematic
liquid crystal flows in $n(n=2$ or $3)$ dimensional bounded domain. More
precisely, we obtain the local existence and uniqueness of the solutions when
the viscosity coefficient of fluid depends on density. Moreover, we establish
blowup criterions for the regularity of the strong solutions in dimension two
and three respectively. In particular, we build a blowup criterion just in
terms of the gradient of density if the initial direction field satisfies some
geometric configuration. For these results, the initial density needs not be
strictly positive.
