In a finite temperature Thomas-Fermi framework, we calculate density
distributions of hot nuclei enclosed in a freeze-out volume of few times the
normal nuclear volume and then construct the caloric curve, with and without
inclusion of radial collective flow. In both cases, the calculated specific
heats $C_v$ show a peaked structure signalling a liquid-gas phase transition.
Without flow, the caloric curve indicates a continuous phase transition whereas
with inclusion of flow, the transition is very sharp. In the latter case, the
nucleus undergoes a shape change to a bubble from a diffuse sphere at the
transition temperature.
