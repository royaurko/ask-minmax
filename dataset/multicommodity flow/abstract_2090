The theory of differential forms began with a discovery of Poincare who found
conservation laws of a new type for Hamiltonian systems - The Integral
Invariants. Even in the absence of non-trivial integrals of motion, there exist
invariant differential forms: a symplectic two-form, or a contact one-form for
geodesic flows. Some invariant forms can be naturally considered as "forms on
the quotient." As a space, this quotient may be very bad in the conventional
topological sense. These considerations lead to an analog of the de Rham
cohomology theory for manifolds carrying smooth dynamical system. The
cohomology theory for quotients, called "basic cohomology" in the literature,
appears naturally in our approach. We define also new exotic cohomology groups
associated with the so-called cohomological equation in dynamical systems and
find exact sequences connecting them with the cohomology of quotients. Explicit
computations are performed for geodesic and horocycle flows of compact surfaces
of constant negative curvature. Are these famous systems Hamiltonian for a 3D
manifold with a Poisson structure? Below, we discuss exotic Poisson structures
on 3-manifolds having complicated Anosov-type Casimir foliations. We prove that
horocycle flows are Hamiltonian for such exotic structures. The geodesic flow
is non-Hamiltonian in the 3D sense.
