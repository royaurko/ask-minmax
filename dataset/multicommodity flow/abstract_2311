We present numerical simulations of fully nonlinear drift wave-zonal flow
(DW-ZF) turbulence systems in a nonuniform magnetoplasma. In our model, the
drift wave (DW) dynamics is pseudo-three-dimensional (pseudo-3D) and accounts
for self-interactions among finite amplitude DWs and their coupling to the
two-dimensional (2D) large amplitude zonal flows (ZFs). The dynamics of the 2D
ZFs in the presence of the Reynolds stress of the pseudo-3D DWs is governed by
the driven Euler equation. Numerical simulations of the fully nonlinear coupled
DW-ZF equations reveal that shortscale DW turbulence leads to nonlinear
saturated dipolar vortices, whereas the ZF sets in spontaneously and is
dominated by a monopolar vortex structure. The ZFs are found to suppress the
cross-field turbulent particle transport. The present results provide a better
model for understanding the coexistence of short- and large-scale coherent
structures, as well as associated subdued cross-field particle transport in
magnetically confined fusion plasmas.
