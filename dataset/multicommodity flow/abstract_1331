The non-linear interplay between the resistive wall mode (RWM) and the
toroidal plasma flow is numerically investigated in a full toroidal geometry,
by simultaneously solving the initial value problems for the n=1 RWM and the
n=0 toroidal force balance equation. Here n is the toroidal mode number. The
neoclassical toroidal viscous torque is identified as the major momentum sink
that brakes the toroidal plasma flow during the non-linear evolution of the
RWM. This holds for a mode that is initially either unstable or stable. For an
initially stable RWM, the braking of the flow, and hence the eventual growth of
the mode, depends critically on the initial perturbation amplitude.
