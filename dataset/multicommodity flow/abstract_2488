The dust-acoustic waves and their stability driven by a flowing dusty plasma
when it cross through a static (target) dusty plasma (the so-called permeating
dusty plasma) are investigated when the components of the dusty plasma obey the
power-law q-distributions in nonextensive statistics. The frequency, the growth
rate and the stability condition of the dust-acoustic waves are derived under
this physical situation, which express the effects of the nonextensivity as
well as the flowing dusty plasma velocity on the dust-acoustic waves in this
dusty plasma. The numerical results illustrate some new characteristics of the
dust-acoustic waves, which are different from those in the permeating dusty
plasma when the plasma components are the Maxwellian distribution. In addition,
we show that the flowing dusty plasma velocity has a significant effect on the
dust-acoustic waves in the permeating dusty plasma with the power-law
q-distribution.
