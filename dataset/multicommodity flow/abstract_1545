We have studied the hydrodynamic flow in a Bose-Einstein condensate stirred
by a macroscopic object, a blue detuned laser beam, using nondestructive {\em
in situ} phase contrast imaging. A critical velocity for the onset of a
pressure gradient has been observed, and shown to be density dependent. The
technique has been compared to a calorimetric method used previously to measure
the heating induced by the motion of the laser beam.
