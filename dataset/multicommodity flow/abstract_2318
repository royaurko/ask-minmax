We study the effects of the shear and bulk viscosities in the hadronic phase
on the expansion of the fireball and on the particle production in relativistic
heavy ion collisions. Comparing simulation with or without viscosity in the
hadronic matter we find that elliptic flow observables strongly dependent on
dissipative effects in the late stage. On the other hand, interferometry radii
are sensitive, through the early transverse flow, on the value of the viscosity
at high temperatures. We present first calculations including the effects of
bulk viscosity in the hadronic phase and in the hadron emission. We find them
important in obtaining a small freeze-out temperature consistent with the
measured transverse momentum spectra and elliptic flow of identified particles.
