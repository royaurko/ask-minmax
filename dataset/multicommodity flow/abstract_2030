The helical absolute equilibrium of a compressible adiabatic flow presents
not only the polarization between the two purely helical modes of opposite
chiralities but also that between the vortical and acoustic modes, deviating
from the equipartition predicted by {\sc Kraichnan, R. H.} [1955 The Journal of
the Acoustical Society of America {\bf 27}, 438--441.] Due to the existence of
the acoustic mode, even if all Fourier modes of one chiral sector in the
sharpened Helmholtz decomposition [{\sc Moses, H. E.} 1971 SIAM ~(Soc. Ind.
Appl. Math.) J. Appl. Math. {\bf 21}, 114--130] are thoroughly truncated,
negative temperature and the corresponding large-scale concentration of
vortical modes are not allowed, unlike the incompressible case.
