We present a study of the elliptic (v2) and triangular (v3) flow and their
corresponding eccentricity fluctuations for asymmetric (Au+Ag, Au+Cu and Au+Si)
collisions at \sqrt_NN = 200 GeV. These are compared to the corresponding
results from symmetric (Au+Au and Cu+Cu) collisions at the same energy. The
study which is carried out using a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model shows
that triangularity (\epsilon_3), fluctuations in triangularity and v3 do not
show much variation for the different colliding ion sizes studied. However the
eccentricity (\epsilon_2), fluctuations in eccentricity and v2 shows a strong
dependence on colliding ion size for a given number of participating nucleons.
Our study thus indicates that asymmetric heavy-ion collisions could be used to
constrain models dealing with flow fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions.
