The second law of thermodynamics dictates the fundamental limits to the
amount of energy and information that can be exchanged between physical
systems. In this work, we extend a thermodynamic formalism describing this flow
of energy and information developed for a pair of bipartite systems to many
multipartite systems. We identify a natural thermodynamic quantity that
describes the information exchanged among these systems. We then introduce and
discuss a refined version. Our results are illustrated with a model of two,
competing Maxwell demons.
