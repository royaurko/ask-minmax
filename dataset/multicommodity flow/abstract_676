We present event-by-event viscous hydrodynamic calculations of the
anisotropic flow coefficients v_2 to v_5 for heavy-ion collisions at the
Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC). We study the dependence of different
flow harmonics on shear viscosity and the morphology of the initial state. v_3
and higher flow harmonics exhibit a particularly strong dependence on both the
initial granularity and shear viscosity. We argue that a combined analysis of
all available flow harmonics will allow to determine eta/s of the quark gluon
plasma precisely. Presented results strongly hint at a value (eta/s)_QGP <
2/4pi at RHIC. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effect of shear viscosity on
pseudo-rapidity spectra and the mean transverse momentum as a function of
rapidity.
