We investigate the competition between barrier slowing down and proliferation
induced superdiffusion in a model of population dynamics in a random force
field. Numerical results in $d=1$ suggest that a new intermediate diffusion
behaviour appears. We introduce the idea of proliferation assisted barrier
crossing and give a Flory like argument to understand qualitatively this non
trivial diffusive behaviour. A one loop RG analysis close to the critical
dimension d_c=2 confirms that the random force fixed point is unstable and
flows towards an uncontrolled strong coupling regime.
