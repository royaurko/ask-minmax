The form of the solar meridional circulation is a very important ingredient
for mean field flux transport dynamo models. Yet a shroud of mystery still
surrounds this large-scale flow, given that its measurement using current
helioseismic techniques is challenging. In this work we use results from 3D
global simulations of solar convection to infer the dynamical behavior of the
established meridional circulation. We make a direct comparison between the
meridional circulation that arises in these simulations and the latest
observations. Based on our results we argue that there should be an equatorward
flow at the base of the convection zone at mid latitudes, below the current
maximum depth helioseismic measures can probe (0.75 R). We also provide
physical arguments to justify this behaviour. The simulations indicate that the
meridional circulation undergoes substantial changes in morphology as the
magnetic cycle unfolds. We close by discussing the importance of these
dynamical changes for current methods of observation that involve long
averaging periods of helioseismic data. Also noteworthy is the fact that these
topological changes indicate a rich interaction between magnetic fields and
plasma flows, which challenges the ubiquitous kinematic approach used in the
vast majority of mean field dynamo simulations.
