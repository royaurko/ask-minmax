Considering the action for the theory $\lambda\phi^{4}$ for a massive scalar
bosonic field as an entropy functional on the space of coupling constants and
on the space of fields, we determine the gradient flows for the scalar field,
the mass, and the self-interaction parameter. When the flow parameter is
identified with the energy scale, we show that there exist phase transitions
between unbroken exact symmetry scenarios and spontaneous symmetry breaking
scenarios at increasingly high energies. Since a non-linear heat equation
drives the scalar field through a {\it reaction-diffusion} process, in general
the flows are not reversible, mimicking the renormalization group flows of the
$c$-theorem; the deformation of the field at increasingly high energies can be
described as non-linear traveling waves, or solitons associated to self-similar
solutions
