We map out and explore the zoo of possible 4d N=1 superconformal theories
which are obtained as RG fixed points of N=1 SQCD with N_f fundamental and N_a
adjoint matter representations. Using "a-maximization," we obtain exact
operator dimensions at all RG fixed points and classify all relevant,
Landau-Ginzburg type, adjoint superpotential deformations. Such deformations
can be used to RG flow to new SCFTs, which are then similarly analyzed.
Remarkably, the resulting 4d SCFT classification coincides with Arnold's ADE
singularity classification. The exact superconformal R-charge and the central
charge a are computed for all of these theories. RG flows between the different
fixed points are analyzed, and all flows are verified to be compatible with the
conjectured a-theorem.
