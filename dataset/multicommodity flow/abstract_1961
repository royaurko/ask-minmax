In this paper we investigate phase flows over $\mathbb{C}^n$ and
$\mathbb{R}^n$ generated by vector fields $V=\sum P^{i}\partial_i$ where
$P^{i}$ are finite degree polynomials. With the convenient diagrammatic
technique we get expressions for evolution operators $ev\{V|t\}: x(0)\mapsto
x(t)$ through the series in powers of $x(0)$ and $t$, represented as sum over
all trees of particular type. Estimates are made for the radius of convergence
in some particular cases. The phase flows behavior in the neighborhood of
vector field fixed points are examined. Resonance cases are considered
separately.
