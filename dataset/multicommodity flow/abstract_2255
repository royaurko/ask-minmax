This paper presents a microfluidic device for magnetophoretic separation red
blood cells from blood under contionous flow. The separation method consist of
continous flow of a blood sample (diluted in PBS) through a microfluidic
channel which presents on the bottom "dots" of feromagnetic layer. By appling a
magnetic field perpendicular on the flowing direction, the feromagnetic "dots"
generates a gradient of magnetic field which amplifies the magnetic force. As a
result, the red blood cells are captured on the bottom of the microfluidic
channel while the rest of the blood is collected at the outlet. Experimental
results show that an average of 95 % of red blood cells are trapped in the
device
