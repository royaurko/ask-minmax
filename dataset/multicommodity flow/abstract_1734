The clebsch potential approach to fluid lagrangians is developed in order to
establish contact with other approaches to fluids. Three variants of the
perfect fluid approach are looked at. The first is an explicit linear
lagrangian constructed directly from the clebsch potentials, this has fixed
equation of state and explicit expression for the pressure but is less general
than a perfect fluid. The second is lagrangians more general than that of a
perfect fluid which are constructed from higher powers of the comoving vector.
The third is lagrangians depending on two vector fields which can represent
both density flow and entropy flow.
