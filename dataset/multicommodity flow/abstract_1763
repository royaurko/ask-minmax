We show that when an N=2 SCFT flows to an N=1 SCFT via giving a mass to the
adjoint chiral superfield in a vector multiplet with marginal coupling, the
central charges a and c of the N=2 theory are related to those of the N=1
theory by a universal linear transformation. In the large N limit, this
relationship implies that the central charges obey a_IR/a_UV=c_IR/c_UV=27/32.
This gives a physical explanation to many examples of this number found in the
literature, and also suggests the existence of a flow between some theories not
previously thought to be connected.
