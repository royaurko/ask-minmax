The influence of disc radiation capture upon black hole rotational evolution
is negligible for radiatively inefficient discs. For the standard thin disc
model it is a slight but potentially important effect leading to the
equilibrium spin parameter value of about 0.998. For optically thin discs, the
fraction of disc radiation captured by the black hole is however about two
times larger. In some disc radiation models, inner parts of the accretion flow
are optically thin, advection-dominated flows, and the thin disc ends at some
transition radius R_{tr}. The thermal energy of the disc stored in trapped
radiation is released at this radius. Angular distribution of the radiation
released at this radial photosphere facilitates its capture by the black hole.
For accretion rates close to critical and disc truncation radius of (2..4)
GM/c^2, radiation capture is most efficient in spinning the black hole down
that may lead to a_{eq} ~ 0.996..0.997 or less depending on the mass accretion
rate. For an accretion flow radiating some constant fraction \epsilon of
dissipated energy, the equilibrium Kerr parameter is shown to obey the relation
1-a_{eq} \propto \epsilon^{3/2} as long as 1-a_{eq} << 1. Deviations from
Keplerian law near the last stable orbit dominate over the radiation capture
effect if they exceed 1..2%.
