We study the limiting behavior of viscous incompressible flows when the fluid
domain is allowed to expand as the viscosity vanishes. We describe precise
conditions under which the limiting flow satisfies the full space Euler
equations. The argument is based on truncation and on energy estimates,
following the structure of the proof of Kato's criterion for the vanishing
viscosity limit. This work complements previous work by the contributors, see
[Kelliher, Comm. Math. Phys. 278 (2008), 753-773] and [arXiv:0801.4935v1].
