The vortex dynamics of uniaxial anisotropic superconductors in magnetic
fields applied with arbitrary orientation is theoretically studied. Focus is on
the model for electrical transport experiments in the linear regime. Relevant
vortex parameters, like the viscous drag, the vortex mobility and pinning
constant (with point pins), together with the flux flow and Campbell
resistivities, are derived in tensor form, in the very different free flux flow
and pinned Campbell regimes. The applicability to the various tensor quantities
of the well-known scaling laws for the angular dependence on the field
orientation is commented. Moreover, it is shown that the experiments do not
generally yield the intrinsic values of the anisotropic viscosity and pinning
constant. Explicit expressions relating measured and intrinsic quantities are
given.
