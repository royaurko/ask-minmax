In turbulent flows kinetic energy is spread by nonlinear interactions over a
broad range of scales. Energy transfer may proceed either toward small scales
or in the reverse direction. The latter case is peculiar of two-dimensional
(2D) flows. Interestingly, a reversal of the energy flux is observed also in
three-dimensional (3D) geophysical flows under rotation and/or confined in thin
layers. The question is whether this phenomenon is enforced solely by external
anisotropic mechanisms or it is intimately embedded in the Navier-Stokes (NS)
equations. Here we show that an inverse energy cascade occurs also in 3D
isotropic flow. The flow is obtained from a suitable surgery of the NS
equations, keeping only triadic interactions between sign-defined helical
modes, preserving homogeneity and isotropy and breaking reflection invariance.
Our findings highlight the role played by helicity in the energy transfer
process and show that both 2D and 3D properties naturally coexist in all flows
in nature.
