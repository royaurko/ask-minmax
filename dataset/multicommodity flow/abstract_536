Ancient solutions arise in the study of Ricci flow singularities. Motivated
by the work of Fateev on 3-dimensional ancient solutions we construct high
dimensional ancient solutions to Ricci flow on spheres and complex projective
spaces as well as the twistor spaces over a compact quaternion-Kahler manifold.
Differing from Fateev's examples most of our examples are non-collapsed. The
construction of this paper, different from the ad hoc anastz of Fateev, is
systematic, generalizing (as well as unifying) the previous constructions of
Einstein metrics by Bourguignon-Karcher, Jensen, and Ziller in the sense that
the existence problem to a backward nonlinear parabolic PDE is reduced to the
study of nonlinear ODE systems. The key step of solving the reduced nonlinear
ODE system is to find suitable monotonic and conserved quantities under Ricci
flow with symmetry. Besides supplying new possible singularity models for Ricci
flow on spheres and projective spaces, our solutions are counter-examples to
some folklore conjectures on ancient solutions of Ricci flow on compact
manifolds. As a by-product, we infer that some nonstandard Einstein metrics on
spheres and complex projective spaces are unstable fixed points of the Ricci
flow.
