In this paper, we obtain analytical results for shear stress distributions
inside an elastic body placed in a low Reynolds number transport. The problem
definition is inspired by a recent experimental study (Valiei et al., Lab Chip,
2012, 12, 5133-5137) that reports the flow-triggered deformation of bacterial
biofilms, formed on cylindrical rigid microposts, into long filamentous
structures known as streamers. In our analysis, we consider an elastic body of
finite thickness (forming a rim) placed over a rigid cylinder, i.e., we mimic
the biofilm structure in the experiment. We consider Oseen flow solution to
describe the low Reynolds transport past this cylindrical elastic structure.
The stress and strain distributions inside the elastic structure are found to
be functions of position, Poisson ratio, initial thickness of the elastic rim
and the ratio of the flow-driven shear stress to the shear modulus of the
elastic body. More importantly, these analyses, which can be deemed as one of
the first formal analyses to understand the fluid-structure-interaction issues
associated with the biofilm streamer formation, help us interpret several
qualitative aspects associated with the streamer formation reported in
different experiments.
