Recent fits of cosmological parameters by the first year Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) measurement seem to favor a primordial scalar spectrum
with a large varying index from blue to red. We use the inflationary flow
equations to reconstruct large running-index inflaton potentials and comment on
current status on the inflationary flow. We find previous negligence of higher
order slow rolling contributions when using the flow equations would lead to
unprecise results.
