Transition from steady to oscillatory buoyancy convection of air in a
laterally heated cubic box is studied numerically by straight-forward time
integration of Boussinesq equations using a series of gradually refined finite
volume grids. Horizontal and spanwise cube boundaries are assumed to be either
perfectly thermally conducting or perfectly thermally insulated, which results
in four different sets of thermal boundary conditions. Critical Grashof numbers
are obtained by interpolation of numerically extracted growth/decay rates of
oscillations amplitude to zero. Slightly supercritical flow regimes are
described by time-averaged flows, snapshots, and spatial distribution of
oscillations amplitude. Possible similarities and dissimilarities with
two-dimensional instabilities in laterally heated square cavities are
discussed. Arguments for grid and time step independence of the results are
given.
