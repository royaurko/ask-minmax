In this work we construct and analyze exact solutions describing Ricci flows
and nonholonomic deformations of four dimensional (4D) Taub-NUT spacetimes. It
is outlined a new geometric techniques of constructing Ricci flow solutions.
Some conceptual issues on spacetimes provided with generic off-diagonal metrics
and associated nonlinear connection structures are analyzed. The limit from
gravity/Ricci flow models with nontrivial torsion to configurations with the
Levi-Civita connection is allowed in some specific physical circumstances by
constraining the class of integral varieties for the Einstein and Ricci flow
equations.
