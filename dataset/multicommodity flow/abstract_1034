Beta-functions are derived for the flow of N=2 SUSY SU(2) Yang-Mills in
4-dimensions with massless matter multiplets in the fundamental representation
of the gauge group. The beta-functions represent the flow of the couplings as
the VEV of the Higgs field is lowered and are modular forms of weight -2. They
have the correct asymptotic behaviour at both the strong and weak coupling
fixed points. Corrections to the massless beta-functions when masses are turned
on are discussed.
