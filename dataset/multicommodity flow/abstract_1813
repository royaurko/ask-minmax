A certain synchronizing property for subshifts called
$\lambda$-synchronization yields $\lambda$-graph systems called the
$\lambda$-synchronizing $\lambda$-graph systems for the subshifts. The
$\lambda$-synchronizing $\lambda$-graph system is a left Fischer cover analogue
for a $\lambda$-synchronizing subshift. We will study algebraic structure of
the $C^*$-algebra associated with the $\lambda$-synchronizing $\lambda$-graph
system and prove that the stable isomorphism class of the $C^*$-algebra with
its Cartan subalgebra is invariant under flow equivalence of
$\lambda$-synchronizing subshifts.
