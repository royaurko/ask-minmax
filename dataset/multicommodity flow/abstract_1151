A self-similar solution for time evolution of quasi-spherical,
self-gravitating accretion flows is obtained under the assumption that the
generated heat by viscosity is retained in the flow. The solutions are
parameterized by the ratio of the mass of the accreting gas to the central
object mass and the viscosity coefficient. While the density and the pressure
are obtained simply by solving a set of ordinary differential equations, the
radial and the rotational velocities are presented analytically. Profiles of
the density and the rotational velocities show two distinct features. Low
density outer accreting flow with relatively flat rotation velocity, surrounds
an inner high density region. In the inner part, the rotational velocity
increases from the center to a transition radius where separates the inner and
outer portions. We show that the behaviour of the solutions in the inner region
depends on the ratio of the heat capacities, $\gamma$, and the viscosity
coefficient, $\alpha$.
