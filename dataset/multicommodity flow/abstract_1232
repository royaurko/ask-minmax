The magnetic field measured in the Madison Dynamo Experiment shows
intermittent periods of growth when an axial magnetic field is applied. The
geometry of the intermittent field is consistent with the fastest growing
magnetic eigenmode predicted by kinematic dynamo theory using a laminar model
of the mean flow. Though the eigenmodes of the mean flow are decaying, it is
postulated that turbulent fluctuations of the velocity field change the flow
geometry such that the eigenmode growth rate is temporarily positive.
Therefore, it is expected that a characteristic of the onset of a turbulent
dynamo is magnetic intermittency.
