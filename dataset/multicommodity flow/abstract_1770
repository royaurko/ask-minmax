Numerous are the questionings raised by medicine interventionnelle,
concerning the hold in charge of the pathologies of the arterial partition
(aneurysm, dissection, coarctation, atherosclerosis).for it we made the
modeling and the numeric simulation of the blood flow in the renal artery taken
by the Medical imagery. Geometry has been rebuilt from the medical pictures of
angiography, angioscanner and IRM. While considering that blood like a fluid
Newtonian and stationary flow. The results gotten in terms of the physical
parameters as the velocity, the dynamic pressure is shown that the simplest
case was enough to collect relevant data for the development of stenos or
thrombosis in the arteries.
