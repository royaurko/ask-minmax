The transverse momentum spectra of identified particles at midrapidity in Pb
+ Pb collisions at Root(sNN) = 2.76 TeV have been studied as a function of
collision centrality by using a unified statistical thermal freeze-out model.
The calculated results are found to be in good agreement with the experimental
data measured by the ALICE experiment at LHC. The model calculations provide
the thermal freeze-out conditions in terms of the temperature and collective
flow parameters for different particle species. We observe a rise in the
thermal freeze-out temperature but a mild decrease in the collective flow
velocity parameter from central to peripheral collisions. The model used
incorporates the simultaneous effect of the longitudinal as well as transverse
hydrodynamic flows. The baryon chemical potential is assumed to be zero ({\mu}B
~ 0), a situation expected in the heavy ion collisions at LHC energies due to a
high degree of nuclear transparency.
