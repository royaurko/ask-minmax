We develop our existing two-dimensional lattice-gas model to simulate the
flow of single-phase, binary-immiscible and ternary-amphiphilic fluids. This
involves the inclusion of fixed obstacles on the lattice, together with the
inclusion of ``no-slip'' boundary conditions. Here we report on preliminary
applications of this model to the flow of such fluids within model porous
media. We also construct fluid invasion boundary conditions, and the effects of
invading aqueous solutions of surfactant on oil-saturated rock during
imbibition and drainage are described.
