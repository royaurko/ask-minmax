The incorporation of region regularization into max-flow segmentation has
traditionally focused on ordering and part-whole relationships. A side effect
of the development of such models is that it constrained regularization only to
those cases, rather than allowing for arbitrary region regularization. Directed
Acyclic Graphical Max-Flow (DAGMF) segmentation overcomes these limitations by
allowing for the algorithm designer to specify an arbitrary directed acyclic
graph to structure a max-flow segmentation. This allows for individual 'parts'
to be a member of multiple distinct 'wholes.'
