An experimental study on the design of counter-rotating axial-flow fans was
carried out. The fans were designed using an inverse method. In particular, the
system is designed to have a pure axial discharge flow. The counter-rotating
fans operate in a ducted-flow configuration and the overall performances are
measured in a normalized test bench. The rotation rate of each fan is
independently controlled. The relative axial spacing between fans can vary from
17% to 310%. The results show that the efficiency is strongly increased
compared to a conventional rotor or to a rotor-stator stage. The effects of
varying the rotation rates ratio on the overall performances are studied and
show that the system has a very flexible use, with a large patch of high
efficient operating points in the parameter space. The increase of axial
spacing causes only a small decrease of the efficiency
