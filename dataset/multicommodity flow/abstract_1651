We discuss the interplay between collective flow and density profiles,
describing light cluster production in heavy ion collisions at very high
energies. Calculations are performed within the coalescence model. We show how
collective flow can explain some qualitative features of the measured deuteron
spectra, provided a proper parametrization of the spatial dependence of the
single particle phase space distribution is chosen.
