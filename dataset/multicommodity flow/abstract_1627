In hep-th/0312098 it was argued that by extending the ``$a$-maximization'' of
hep-th/0304128 away from fixed points of the renormalization group, one can
compute the anomalous dimensions of chiral superfields along the flow, and
obtain a better understanding of the irreversibility of RG flow in four
dimensional supersymmetric field theory. According to this proposal, the role
of the running couplings is played by certain Lagrange multipliers that are
introduced in the construction. We show that one can choose a parametrization
of the space of couplings in which the Lagrange multipliers can indeed be
identified with the couplings, and discuss the consequences of this for weakly
coupled gauge theory.
