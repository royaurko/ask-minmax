In this paper, we investigate the motion of a neutrally buoyant cylinder of
circular or elliptic shape in two dimensional shear flow of a Newtonian fluid
by direct numerical simulation. The numerical results are validated by
comparisons with existing theoretical, experimental and numerical results,
including a power law of the normalized angular speed versus the particle
Reynolds number. The centerline between two walls is an expected equilibrium
position of the cylinder mass center in shear flow. When placing the particle
away from the centerline initially, it migrates toward another equilibrium
position for higher Reynolds numbers due to the interplay between the slip
velocity, the Magnus force, and the wall repulsion force.
