Measurements of transverse energy flow are presented for neutral current
deep-inelastic scattering events produced in positron-proton collisions at
HERA. The kinematic range covers squared momentum transfers Q^2 from 3.2 to
2,200 GeV^2, the Bjorken scaling variable x from 8.10^{-5} to 0.11 and the
hadronic mass W from 66 to 233 GeV. The transverse energy flow is measured in
the hadronic centre of mass frame and is studied as a function of Q^2, x, W and
pseudorapidity. A comparison is made with QCD based models. The behaviour of
the mean transverse energy in the central pseudorapidity region and an interval
corresponding to the photon fragmentation region are analysed as a function of
Q^2 and W.
