We present a new derivation of the momentum exchange method to compute the
flow force and torque on a submerged body in lattice Boltzmann methods. Our
derivation does not depend on a particular implementation of the boundary
conditions at the body surface and relies on general principles. We recover
some well known expressions, in some cases with slight corrections, to treat
the cases of static and moving bodies. We also present some numerical tests
that support the correctness of the formulas derived.
