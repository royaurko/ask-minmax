Using Wilsonian methods, we study the renormalization group flow of the
Nonlinear Sigma Model in any dimension $d$, restricting our attention to terms
with two derivatives. At one loop we always find a Ricci flow. When symmetries
completely fix the internal metric, we compute the beta function of the single
remaining coupling, without any further approximation. For $d>2$ and positive
curvature, there is a nontrivial fixed point, which could be used to define an
ultraviolet limit, in spite of the perturbative nonrenormalizability of the
theory. Potential applications are briefly mentioned.
