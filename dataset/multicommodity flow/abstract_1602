We compute the exact partition function of the 2D Ising Model at critical
temperature but with nonzero magnetic field at the boundary. The model
describes a renormalization group flow between the free and fixed conformal
boundary conditions in the space of boundary interactions. For this flow the
universal ground state degeneracy $g$ and the full boundary state is computed
exactly.
