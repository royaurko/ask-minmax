Issues of resonance that appear in non-standard random walk models are
discussed. The first walk is called repulsive delayed random walk, which is
described in the context of a stick balancing experiment. It will be shown that
a type of "resonant" effect takes place to keep the stability of the fixed
point better with tuned bias and delay. We also briefly discuss the second
model called sticky random walk, which is introduced to model string
entanglement. Peculiar resonant effects with respect to these random walks are
presented.
