The Eulerian system of dynamic equations for the ideal fluid is closed but
incomplete. The complete system of dynamic equations arises after appending Lin
constraints which describe motion of fluid particles in a given velocity field.
The complete system of dynamic equations for the ideal fluid can be integrated.
Description in terms of hydrodynamic potentials (DTHP) arises as a result of
this integration. The integrated system contains indefinite functions of three
arguments, which can be expressed via initial and boundary conditions. The
remaining initial and boundary conditions for the integrated system can be made
universal (i.e. the same for all fluid flows), and the resulting system of
equations contains full information about the fluid flow including initial and
boundary conditions for the fluid flow. Some hydrodynamic potentials appear to
be frozen into the fluid, and the Kelvin's theorem on the velocity circulation
can be formulated in a contour-free form. Description in terms of the wave
function (DTWF) appears to be a kind of DTHP. Calculation of slightly
rotational flows can be carried out on the basis of DTHP, or DTWF. Such a
description of a rotational flow appears to be effective.
