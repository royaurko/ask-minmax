We provide the explicit gauging of all the SU(2,1) isometries of one N=2
supergravity hypermultiplet, which spans SU(2,1)/U(2) coset space parameterized
in terms of two complex projective coordinate fields z_1 and z_2. We derive the
full, explicit Killing prepotential that specifies the most general
superpotential. As an application we consider the supersymmetric flow
(renormalization group) equations for: (i) the flow from a null singularity to
the flat, supersymmetric space-time and (ii) the flow that violates c-theorem
with the superpotential crossing zero.
