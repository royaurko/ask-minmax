We study liquid-liquid dispersions in a turbulent Taylor-Couette flow,
produced between two counterrotating coaxial cylinders. In pure Water and in
counterrotation, Reynolds numbers up to 1.4 10^5 are reached. The liquids we
use are a low-viscous Oil and pure Water or a Sodium Iodide solution with a
refractive index matched to that of Oil, in order to get transparent
dispersions. We first characterize the single-phase flow, in terms of threshold
for transition to turbulence, scaling of the torque and measurements of the
mean flow and of the Reynolds stress by stereoscopic PIV. We then study the
increase of the dissipation in the two-phase flows and find that the torque per
unit mass can be twice the torque for a single-phase flow. Long-time behaviours
are also reported.
