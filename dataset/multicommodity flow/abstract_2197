We present rigorous estimates for some physical quantities related to
turbulent and non-turbulent channel flows driven by a uniform pressure
gradient. Such results are based on the concept of stationary statistical
solution, which is related to the notion of ensemble average for flows in
statistical equilibrium. We provide a lower bound estimate for the mean skin
friction coefficient and improve on a previous upper bound estimate for the
same quantity; both estimates in terms of the Reynolds number. We also present
lower and upper bound estimates for the mean rate of energy dissipation, the
mean longitudinal velocity (in the direction of the pressure gradient), and the
mean kinetic energy. In particular, we obtain an upper bound related to the
energy dissipation law, namely that the mean rate of energy dissipation is
essentially bounded by a non-dimensional universal constant times the cube of
the mean longitudinal velocity over a characteristic macro-scale length.
Finally, we investigate the scale-by-scale energy injection due to the pressure
gradient, proving an upper bound estimate for the decrease of this energy
injection as the scale length decreases.
