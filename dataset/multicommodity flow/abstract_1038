The information-based asset-pricing framework of Brody, Hughston and Macrina
(BHM) is extended to include a wider class of models for market information. In
the BHM framework, each asset is associated with a collection of random cash
flows. The price of the asset is the sum of the discounted conditional
expectations of the cash flows. The conditional expectations are taken with
respect to a filtration generated by a set of "information processes". The
information processes carry imperfect information about the cash flows. To
model the flow of information, we introduce in this paper a class of processes
which we term Levy random bridges (LRBs). This class generalises the Brownian
bridge and gamma bridge information processes considered by BHM. An LRB is
defined over a finite time horizon. Conditioned on its terminal value, an LRB
is identical in law to a Levy bridge. We consider in detail the case where the
asset generates a single cash flow $X_T$ occurring at a fixed date $T$. The
flow of market information about $X_T$ is modelled by an LRB terminating at the
date $T$ with the property that the (random) terminal value of the LRB is equal
to $X_T$. An explicit expression for the price process of such an asset is
found by working out the discounted conditional expectation of $X_T$ with
respect to the natural filtration of the LRB. The prices of European options on
such an asset are calculated.
