We present a hierarchical approach for enhancing the robustness of numerical
solvers for modelling radiative MHD flows in multi-dimensions. This approach is
based on clustering the entries of the global Jacobian in a hierarchical manner
that enables employing a variety of solution procedures ranging from a purely
explicit time-stepping up to fully implicit schemes. A gradual coupling of the
radiative MHD equation with the radiative transfer equation in higher
dimensions is possible. Using this approach, it is possible to follow the
evolution of strongly time-dependent flows with low/high accuracies and with
efficiency comparable to explicit methods, as well as searching
quasi-stationary solutions for highly viscous flows. In particular, it is shown
that the hierarchical approach is capable of modelling the formation of jets in
active galactic nuclei and reproduce the corresponding spectral energy
distribution with a reasonable accuracy.
