I compare the first viscous hydrodynamic prediction for integrated elliptic
flow in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC with the first data released by the ALICE
collaboration. These new data are found to be consistent with hydrodynamic
extrapolations of RHIC data with no change in medium parameters (e.g., average
viscosity). I also discuss how, in general, a precise comparison of data to
theoretical calculations requires an understanding of some subtleties of the
measurement -- most notably the cut on transverse momentum of the particles
used and the differing sensitivities to flow fluctuations and non-flow effects
of the various measurement methods.
