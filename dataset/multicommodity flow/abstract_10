In this research paper, analytical equations for the calculation of radial
flow due to the braking on the flat surface plane of revolving flow were
obtained. The calculation method is based on the use of pressure force balance
equation, viscid friction and inertia. Three motion equations for
incompressible, polytropic and isothermal flow were obtained, the type of a
cumulative curve for the incompressible flow has been shown. Possibility of the
use of radial flow for the compression of water steam cloud has been shown.
  Keywords: radial flow, revolving flow, cloud compression.
