Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider experiments exhibit correlations peaked in
relative azimuthal angle and extended in rapidity. Called the ridge, this peak
occurs both with and without a jet trigger. We argue that the untriggered ridge
arises when particles formed by flux tubes in an early glasma stage later
manifest transverse flow. Combining a blast wave model of flow fixed by
single-particle spectra with a simple description of the glasma, we find
excellent agreement with current data.
