This chapter present a fats boundary integral equation method for numerical
computing of uniform potential flow past multiple aerofoils. The presented fast
multipole-based iterative solution procedure requires only $O(nm\ln n)$
operations where $m$ is the number of aerofoils and $n$ is the number of nodes
in the discretization of each aerofoil's boundary. We demonstrate the
performance of our methods on several numerical examples.
