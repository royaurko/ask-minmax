In nucleon-nucleon collisions, charged particle's multiplicity fluctuates. We
have studied the effect of multiplicity fluctuation on flow harmonics in
nucleus-nucleus collision in event-by-event hydrodynamics. Assuming that the
charged particle's multiplicity fluctuations are governed by the negative
binomial distribution, the Monte-Carlo Glauber model of initial condition is
generalised to include the fluctuations. Explicit simulations with the
generalised Monte-Carlo Glauber model initial conditions indicate that the
multiplicity fluctuations do not have large effect on the flow harmonics.
