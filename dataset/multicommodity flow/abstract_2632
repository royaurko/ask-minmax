The spin Hall effect in heavy metals generates spin current that enables
control of magnetization of an nearby magnetic layer. Conversely, such flow of
spin current can influence the transport properties of the system itself. For
example, the resistance of a Pt layer attached to a magnetic insulator changes
as the direction of the magnetization is changed. Such effect, now commonly
referred to as the spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR), has been reported to be,
however, order of magnitude smaller than the conventional anisotropic
magnetoresistance in magnetic materials. Here we report giant spin Hall
magnetoresistance in a metallic bilayer system. We find nearly a ten-fold
increase of SMR in W/CoFeB compared to the previously studied heavy
metal/magnetic insulator systems. The large SMR accounts for the
unconventionally large transverse magnetoresistance found in this system,
manifesting the profound effect of spin current generated via the spin Hall
effect on the electrical transport properties. We show that the SMR is defined
at the heavy metal/magnetic layer interface even for metallic heterostructures
in which current flows into the magnetic layer. These results demonstrate that
SMR can be used as a powerful tool to evaluate the flow and accumulation of
spin current in metallic heterostructures.
