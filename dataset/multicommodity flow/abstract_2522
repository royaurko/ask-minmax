A new idea for turbulent skin-friction reduction is proposed, wherein the
shape of the solid wall is designed to create the spanwise pressure gradient
acting similarly to the well-known method of drag reduction by in-plane
spanwise wall motion. Estimates based on the assumption of similarity with drag
reduction effect of in-plane wall motion suggest that drag reduction of about
2.4% can be achieved in the flow past a wavy wall, with the crests forming an
angle of about 38 degrees with the main flow direction, and the wave period in
the main flow direction equal to about 1500 wall units. The required height of
the wall waves have to be adjusted to achieve the same intensity of the
spanwise motion as that created by an in-plane moving wall of the same
wavelength and with peak wall velocity equal to 2 wall units. Further research
is being conducted in order to determine this height. Suggestions are made for
further research on confirming the feasibility of the proposed method and on
optimising the wall shape.
