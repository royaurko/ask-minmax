We compare the statistical properties of J=1-0 13CO spectra observed in the
Perseus Molecular Cloud with synthetic J=1-0 13CO spectra from a 5 pc model
cloud. The synthetic spectra are computed solving the non-LTE radiative
transfer problem for a model cloud obtained as solutions of the 3-D
magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) equations in both the highly supersonic and
super-Alfvenic regimes of random flows. We present several statistical results
that demonstrate remarkable similarity between real data and the synthetic
cloud. The three-dimensional structure and dynamics of molecular clouds like
Perseus are appropriately described by random supersonic and super-Alfvenic MHD
flows. Although the description of gravity and stellar radiation are essential
to understand the formation of single protostars and the effects of star
formation in the cloud dynamics, the overall description of the cloud and of
the initial conditions for star formation can apparently be described on
intermediate scales without accounting for gravity and stellar radiation.
