In this paper we study the local regularity of closed surfaces immersed in a
Riemannian 3-manifold flowing by Willmore flow. We establish a pair of
concentration-compactness alternatives for the flow, giving a lower bound on
the maximal time of existence of the flow proportional to the concentration of
the curvature and area at initial time. The estimate from the first theorem is
purely in terms of the concentration of curvature at initial time but applies
only to ambient spaces with non-positive sectional curvature. The second
requires additional information on the concentration of area at initial time
but applies in more general background spaces. Applications of these results
shall appear in forthcoming work.
