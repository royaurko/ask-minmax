We present a new method for analyzing directed and elliptic flow in heavy ion
collisions. Unlike standard methods, it separates the contribution of flow to
azimuthal correlations from contributions due to other effects. The separation
relies on a cumulant expansion of multiparticle azimuthal correlations, and
includes corrections for detector inefficiencies. This new method allows the
measurement of the flow of identified particles in narrow phase-space regions,
and can be used in every regime, from intermediate to ultrarelativistic
energies.
