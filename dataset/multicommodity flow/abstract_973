We present far-ultraviolet spectroscopy of the cores of the massive cooling
flow clusters Abell 1795 and 2597 obtained with FUSE. As the intracluster gas
cools through 3x10^5 K, it should emit strongly in the OVI 1032,1038 resonance
lines. We report the detection of OVI 1032 emission in A2597, with a line flux
of 1.35 +/- 0.35x10^-15 erg/cm2/s, as well as detection of emission from CIII
977. A marginal detection of CIII 977 emission is also reported for A1795.
These observations provide evidence for a direct link between the hot (10^7 K)
cooling flow gas and the cool (10^4 K) gas in the optical emission line fients.
Assuming simple cooling flow models, the OVI line flux in A2597 corresponds to
a mass deposition rate of ~40 Msun/yr within the central 36 kpc. Emission from
OVI 1032 was not detected in A1795, with an upper limit of 1.5x10^-15
erg/cm2/s, corresponding to a limit on the mass cooling flow rate of Mdot(28
kpc) < 28 Msun/yr. We have considered several explanations for the lack of
detection of OVI emission in A1795 and the weaker than expected flux in A2597,
including extinction by dust in the outer cluster, and quenching of thermal
conduction by magnetic fields. We conclude that a turbulent mixing model, with
some dust extinction, could explain our OVI results while also accounting for
the puzzling lack of emission by FeXVII in cluster cooling flows.
