We investigate experimentally the mixing dynamics in a channel flow with a
finite stirring region undergoing chaotic advection. We study the
homogenization of dye in two variants of an eggbeater stirring protocol that
differ in the extent of their mixing region. In the first case, the mixing
region is separated from the side walls of the channel, while in the second it
extends to the walls. For the first case, we observe the onset of a permanent
concentration pattern that repeats over time with decaying intensity. A
quantitative analysis of the concentration field of dye confirms the
convergence to a self-similar pattern, akin to the strange eigenmodes
previously observed in closed flows. We model this phenomenon using an
idealized map, where an analysis of the mixing dynamics explains the
convergence to an eigenmode. In contrast, for the second case the presence of
no-slip walls and separation points on the frontier of the mixing region leads
to non-self-similar mixing dynamics.
