We show that thermal creep is at the origin of the recently discovered
Leidenfrost ratchet, where liquid droplets float on a vapor layer along a
heated sawtooth surface and accelerate to velocities of up to 40 cm=s. As the
active element, the asymmetric temperature profile at each ratchet summit
rectifies the vapor flow in the boundary layer. This mechanism works at low
Reynolds number and provides a novel tool for controlling gas flow at
nanostructured surfaces.
