The effect of final state interactions on the elliptic flow coefficient
measured in relativistic heavy ion collisions is investigated within the DWEF
formalism established by Miller and Cramer [Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 102302 (2005),
J. Phys. G34, 703 (2007), Phys. Rev. C78, 054905 (2008)]. It is found that the
optical potential previously found to give the best fit of particle
multiplicity and Hanbury Brown and Twiss radii in RHIC events has a moderate
effect on the resulting elliptic flow coefficient v_2. This indicates that
final state interactions should be taken into account to confidently predict
v_2 to better than ~20% accuracy.
