A theoretical interpretation is given for the observed long-distance
correlations in potential fluctuations in TJ-II. The value of the correlation
increases above the critical point of the transition for the emergence of the
plasma edge shear flow layer. Mean (i.e. surface averaged, zero-frequency)
sheared flows cannot account for the experimental results. A model consisting
of four envelope equations for the fluctuation level, the mean flow shear, the
zonal flow amplitude shear, and the averaged pressure gradient is proposed. It
is shown that the presence of zonal flows is essential to reproduce the main
features of the experimental observations.
