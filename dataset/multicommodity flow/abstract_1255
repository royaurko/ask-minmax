Observations of the hot gas, which is surrounding Sgr A* and a few other
nearby galactic nuclei, imply that mean free paths of electron and proton are
comparable to gas capture radius. So, hot accretion flows likely proceed under
week collision conditions. As a result thermal conduction by ions has a
considerable contribution in transfer of the realized heat in accretion
mechanisms. We study a 2D advective accretion disk bathed in a poloidal
magnetic field of a central accretor in the presence of thermal conduction. We
find self-similar solutions for an axisymmetric, rotating, steady,
viscose-resistive, magnetized accretion flow. The dominant mechanism of energy
dissipation is assumed to be turbulence viscosity and magnetic diffusivity due
to magnetic field of the central accretor. We show that the global structure of
ADAFs are sensitive to viscosity, advection and thermal conduction parameters.
We discuss how radial flow, angular velocity and density of accretion flows may
vary with the advection, thermal conduction and viscous parameters.
