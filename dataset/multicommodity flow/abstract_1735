Nuclear collisions exhibit long-range rapidity correlations not present in
proton-proton collisions. Because the correlation structure is wide in relative
pseudorapidity and narrow in relative azimuthal angle, it is known as the
ridge. Similar ridge structures are observed in correlations of particles
associated with a jet trigger (the hard ridge) as well as correlations without
a trigger (the soft ridge). Earlier we argued that the soft ridge arises when
particles formed in an early Glasma stage later manifest transverse flow. We
extend this study to address new soft ridge measurements. We then determine the
contribution of flow to the hard ridge.
