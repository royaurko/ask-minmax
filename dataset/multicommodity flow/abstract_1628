Studied are the moduli spaces of Yang-Mills connections on finitely generated
projective modules associated with noncommutative flows. It is actually shown
that they are homeomorphic to those on the dual modules associated with the
dual noncommutative flows. Moreover the result is also affirmative in the case
of multiflows. As an important application, computed are the moduli spaces of
the instanton bundles over the noncommutative Euclidean 4-space with respect to
the canonical action of space translations without using the ADHM-construction.
