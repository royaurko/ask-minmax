Using the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics ({\tt UrQMD}) model,
we investigate the azimuthal correlations in p--Pb collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}}=5.02$ TeV. It is shown that the simulated hadronic p--Pb
system can not generate the collective flow signatures, but mainly behaves as a
non-flow dominant system. However, the characteristic $v_{2}(p_{\rm T})$
mass-ordering of pions, kaons and protons is observed in {\tt UrQMD}
simulations, which is the consequence of hadronic interactions and not
necessarily associated with strong fluid-like expansions.
