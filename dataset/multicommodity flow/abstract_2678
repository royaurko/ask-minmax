Directed flow measurements for $\Lambda$-hyperons are presented and compared
to those for protons produced in the same Au+Au collisions (2, 4, and 6 AGeV;
$b < 5 - 6$ fm). The measurements indicate that $\Lambda$-hyperons flow
consistently in the same direction and with smaller magnitudes than those of
protons. Such a strong positive flow [for $\Lambda$s] has been predicted in
calculations which include the influence of the $\Lambda$-nucleon potential.
The experimental flow ratio $\Lambda$/p is in qualitative agreement with
expectations ($\sim 2/3$) from the quark counting rule at 2 AGeV but is found
to decrease with increasing beam energy.
