We show that a flowing dielectric medium with a linear response to an
external electric field can be used to generate an analog geometry that has
many of the formal properties of a Schwarzschild black hole for light rays, in
spite of birefringence. We also discuss the possibility of generating these
analog black holes in the laboratory.
