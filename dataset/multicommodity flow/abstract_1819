We present a fairly general construction of unbounded representatives for the
interior Kasparov product. As a main tool we develop a theory of
C^1-connections on operator * modules; we do not require any smoothness
assumptions; our sigma-unitality assumptions are minimal. Furthermore, we use
work of Kucerovsky and our recent Local Global Principle for regular operators
in Hilbert C*-modules.
  As an application we show that the Spectral Flow Theorem and more generally
the index theory of Dirac-Schr\"odinger operators can be nicely explained in
terms of the interior Kasparov product.
