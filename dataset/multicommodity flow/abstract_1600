We examine the conditions for superconformal invariance and the specific form
of the K\"ahler potential for a two-dimensional lagrangian model with $N=2$
supersymmetry and superpotential $gX^k$. Away from the superconformal point we
study the renormalization group flow induced by a particular class of K\"ahler
potentials. We find trajectories which, in the infrared, reach the fixed point
with a central charge whose value is that of the $N=2$, $A_{k-1}$ minimal
model.
