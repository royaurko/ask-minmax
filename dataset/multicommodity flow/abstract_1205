The Calogero-Moser (or CM) particle system and its generalizations appear, in
a variety of ways, in integrable systems, nonlinear PDE, representation theory,
and string theory. Moreover, the partially completed CM systems--in which
dynamics of particles are continued through collisions--have been identified as
meromorphic Hitchin systems, giving natural ``geometric action-angle
variables'' for the CM system. Motivated by relations of the CM system to
nonlinear PDE, we introduce a new class of generalizations of the spin CM
particle systems, the framed (rational, trigonometric and elliptic) CM systems.
We give two algebro-geometric descriptions of these systems, via meromorphic
Hitchin systems with decorations (framing data) on (cuspidal, nodal and smooth)
cubic curves and via one-dimensional sheaves on corresponding ``twisted'' ruled
surfaces. We also present a simple geometric formulation of the flows of all
meromorphic GL_n Hitchin systems (with no regularity assumptions) as tweaking
flows on spectral sheaves. Using this formulation, we show that all spin and
framed CM systems are identified with hierarchies of tweaking flows on the
corresponding spectral sheaves. This generalizes the well-known description of
spinless CM systems in terms of tangential covers.
