We investigate the particle trajectories in an irrotational shallow water
flow over a flat bed as periodic waves propagate on the water's free surface.
Within the linear water wave theory, we show that there are no closed orbits
for the water particles beneath the irrotational shallow water waves. Depending
on the strength of underlying uniform current, we obtain that some particle
trajectories are undulating path to the right or to the left, some are looping
curves with a drift to the right and others are parabolic curves or curves
which have only one loop.
