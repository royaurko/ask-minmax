The paper aims to study the connection between symmetries and conservation
laws for the 2D Ricci flow model. The procedure starts by obtaining a set of
multipliers which generates conservation laws. Then, using a general relation
which connects symmetries and conservation laws for whatever dynamical system,
one determines symmetries related to a chosen multiplier. On this basis, new
similarity solutions of the model, not yet discussed in literature, are
highlighted.
