We develop a method that works in general product Riemannian manifold to
decompose the three-dimensional steady full compressible Euler system, which is
of elliptic-hyperbolic composite-mixed type for subsonic flows. The method is
applied to show stability of spherically symmetric subsonic flows and transonic
shocks in space $\mathbb{R}^3$ under multidimensional perturbations of boundary
conditions.
