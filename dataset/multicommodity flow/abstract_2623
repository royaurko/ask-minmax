Self-propulsion of liquid marbles filled with aqueous alcohol solutions and
placed on a water surface is reported. The characteristic of velocity of the
marbles is about 0.1 m/s. The phenomenon of self-propulsion is related to the
Marangoni solutocapillary flow caused by the condensation of alcohol,
evaporated from the liquid marble, on a water surface. The Marangoni flow in
turn enhances the evaporation of alcohol from marbles. Addition of alcohol to
the water supporting the marbles suppresses the self-propulsion. The propulsion
of liquid marbles is mainly stopped by water drag. The velocity of the center
of mass of marbles grows with the increase of the concentration of alcohol in a
marble. The velocity of marbles self-propulsion is independent on their volume.
