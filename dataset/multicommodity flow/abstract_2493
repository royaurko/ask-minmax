Microdrop impact and spreading phenomena are explored as an interface
formation process using a recently developed computational framework. The
accuracy of the results obtained from this framework for the simulation of high
deformation free-surface flows is confirmed by a comparison with previous
numerical studies for the large amplitude oscillations of free liquid drops.
Our code's ability to produce high resolution benchmark calculations for
dynamic wetting flows is then demonstrated by simulating microdrop impact and
spreading on surfaces of greatly differing wettability. The simulations allow
one to see features of the process which go beyond the resolution available to
experimental analysis. Strong interfacial effects which are observed at the
microfluidic scale are then harnessed by designing surfaces of varying
wettability that allow new methods of flow control to be developed.
