The Multiscale Finite Element Method (MsFEM) is developed in the vein of
Crouzeix-Raviart element for solving viscous incompressible flows in genuine
heterogeneous media. Such flows are relevant in many branches of engineering,
often at multiple scales and at regions where analytical representations of the
microscopic features of the flows are often unavailable. Full accounts to these
problems heavily depend on the geometry of the system under consideration and
are computationally expensive. Therefore, a method capable of solving
multiscale features of the flow without confining itself to fine scale
calculations is sought after.
  The approximation of boundary condition on coarse element edges when
computing the multiscale basis functions critically influences the eventual
accuracy of any MsFEM approaches. The weakly enforced continuity of Crouzeix -
Raviart function space across element edges leads to a natural boundary
condition for the multiscale basis functions which relaxes the sensitivity of
our method to complex patterns of obstacles exempt from the needs of
implementing any oversampling techniques. Additionally, the application of
penalization method makes it possible to avoid complex unstructured domain and
allows extensive use of simpler Cartesian meshes.
