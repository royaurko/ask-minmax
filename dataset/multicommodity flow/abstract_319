We prove the existence of Kahler-Einstein metric on a K-stable Fano manifold
using the recent compactness result on Kahler-Ricci flows. The key ingredient
is an algebro-geometric description of the asymptotic behavior of Kahler-Ricci
flow on Fano manifolds. This is in turn based on a general finite dimensional
discussion, which is interesting in its own and could potentially apply to
other problems. As one application, we relate the asymptotics of the Calabi
flow on a polarized Kahler manifold to K-stability assuming bounds on geometry.
