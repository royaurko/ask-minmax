We discuss the problems involved in extracting the nuclear equation-of-state
from heavy-ion collisions. We demonstrate that the equation of state becomes
effectively softer in non-equilibrium and this effect is observable in terms of
collective flow effects. Thus, non-equilibrium effects must be included in
transport descriptions on the level of the effective mean fields. A comparison
with transverse momentum, rapidity, and centrality selected flow data show the
reliability and limitations of the underlying interaction which was derived
from microscopic Dirac-Brueckner (DB) results.
