We briefly review our work on the cascading renormalization group flows for
gauge theories on D-branes probing Calabi-Yau singularities. Such RG flows are
sometimes chaotic and exhibit duality walls. We construct supergravity
solutions dual to logarithmic flows for these theories. We make new
observations about a surface of conformal theories and more complicated
supergravity solutions.
