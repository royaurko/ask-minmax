The phenomenon of collective flow in relativistic heavy ion collisions is
studied using the hadronic cascade model ARC. Direct comparison is made to data
gathered at the Bevalac, for Au+Au at $p=1-2$ GeV/c. In contrast to the
standard lore about the cascade model, collective flow is well described
quantitatively without the need for explicit mean field terms to simulate the
nuclear equation of state. Pion collective flow is in the opposite direction to
nucleon flow as is that of anti-nucleons and other produced particles. Pion and
nucleon flow are predicted at AGS energies also, where, in light of the higher
baryon densities achieved, we speculate that equation of state effects may be
observable.
