We use a two-temperature hydrodynamical formulation to determine the
temperature and density structures of the post-shock accretion flows in
magnetic cataclysmic variables (mCVs) and calculate the corresponding X-ray
spectra. The effects of two-temperature flows are significant for systems with
a massive white dwarf and a strong white-dwarf magnetic field. Our calculations
show that two-temperature flows predict harder keV spectra than one-temperature
flows for the same white-dwarf mass and magnetic field. This result is
insensitive to whether the electrons and ions have equal temperature at the
shock but depends on the electron-ion exchange rate, relative to the rate of
radiative loss along the flow. White-dwarf masses obtained by fitting the X-ray
spectra of mCVs using hydrodynamic models including the two-temperature effects
will be lower than those obtained using single-temperature models. The bias is
more severe for systems with a massive white dwarf.
