Radiatively inefficient, hot accretion flows are widely considered as a
relevant accretion mode in low-luminosity AGNs. We study spectral formation in
such flows using a refined model with a fully general relativistic description
of both the radiative (leptonic and hadronic) and hydrodynamic processes, as
well as with an exact treatment of global Comptonization. We find that the
X-ray spectral index--Eddington ratio anticorrelation as well as the cut-off
energy measured in the best-studied objects favor accretion flows with rather
strong magnetic field and with a weak direct heating of electrons. Furthermore,
they require a much stronger source of seed photons than considered in previous
studies. The nonthermal synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons seems
to be the most likely process capable of providing a sufficient flux of seed
photons. Hadronic processes, which should occur due to basic properties of hot
flows, provide an attractive explanation for the origin of such electrons.
