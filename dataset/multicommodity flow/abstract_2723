We present the results for the predicted density and peculiar velocity fields
and the dipole from the PSCz survey of 15,000 IRAS galaxies over 84% of the
sky. We find a significant component to the dipole arising between 6000 and
15,000 km/s, but no significant component from greater distances. The
misalignment with the CMB is 20 degrees. The most remarkable feature of the
PSCz model velocity field is a coherent large-scale flow along the baseline
connecting Perseus-Pisces, the Local Supercluster, Great Attractor and the
Shapley Concentration. We have measured the parameter beta using the amplitude
of the dipole, bulk flow and point by point comparisons between the individual
velocities of galaxies in the MarkIII and SFI datasets, and the large-scale
clustering distortion in redshift space.All our results are consistent with
beta = 0.6 +- 0.1.
