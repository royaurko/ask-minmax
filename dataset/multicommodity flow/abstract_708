The direct numerical simulation of compressible fully developed turbulent
Couette flow between two parallel plates with equal temperatures moving in
opposite directions with some velocity was performed. The algorithm was tested
on well known numerical solution for incompressible Poiseuille channel flow and
found to provide its well description. The slip effects in studied flow are
found to be negligibly small at the values of accommodation coefficients for
velocity and temperature of the order of unity. The considerable increase of
mean temperature with decreasing the accommodation coefficient for temperature
was discovered. The effect may be important in the problems of heat exchange in
compressible turbulent boundary layer for some combinations of flowing gas,
surface and adsorbing gas.
