I compute the first viscous correction to the thermal distribution function.
With this correction, I calculate the effect of viscosity on spectra, elliptic
flow, and HBT radii. Indicating the breakdown of hydrodynamics, viscous
corrections become of order one for $p_{T}\sim 1.5$ GeV. Viscous corrections to
HBT radii are particularly large and reduce the outward and longitudinal radii.
This reduction is a direct consequence of the reduction in longitudinal
pressure.
