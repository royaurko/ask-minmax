This contribution presents experimental study of two-dimensional pedestrian
flow with the aim to capture the pedestrian behaviour within the cluster formed
in front of the bottleneck. Two experiments of passing through a room with one
entrance and one exit were arranged according to phase transition study in
Ezaki et al. (2012), the inflow rate was regulated to obtain different walking
modes. By means of automatic image processing, pedestrians' paths are extracted
from camera records to get actual velocity and local density. Macroscopic
information is extracted by means of virtual detector and leaving times of
pedestrians. The pedestrian's behaviour is evaluated by means of density and
velocity. Different approaches of measurement are compared using several
fundamental diagrams. Two phases of crowd behaviour have been recognized and
the phase transition was described.
