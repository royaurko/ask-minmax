We give a global picture of the Ricci flow on the space of three-dimensional,
unimodular, nonabelian metric Lie algebras considered up to isometry and
scaling. The Ricci flow is viewed as a two-dimensional dynamical system for the
evolution of structure constants of the metric Lie algebra with respect to an
evolving orthonormal frame. This system is amenable to direct phase plane
analysis, and we find that the fixed points and special trajectories in the
phase plane correspond to special metric Lie algebras, including Ricci solitons
and special Riemannian submersions. These results are one way to unify the
study of Ricci flow on left invariant metrics on three-dimensional,
simply-connected, unimodular Lie groups, which had previously been studied by a
case-by-case analysis of the different Bianchi classes. In an appendix, we
prove a characterization of the space of three-dimensional, unimodular,
nonabelian metric Lie algebras modulo isometry and scaling.
