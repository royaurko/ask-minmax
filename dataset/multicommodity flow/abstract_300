We give a new proof of Brakke's partial regularity theorem up to
C^{1,\varsigma} for weak varifold solutions of mean curvature flow by utilizing
parabolic monotonicity formula, parabolic Lipschitz approximation and blow-up
technique. The new proof extends to a general flow whose velocity is the sum of
the mean curvature and any given background flow field in a dimensionally sharp
integrability class. It is a natural parabolic generalization of Allard's
regularity theorem in the sense that the special time-independent case reduces
to Allard's theorem.
