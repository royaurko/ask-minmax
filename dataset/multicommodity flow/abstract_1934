We study the fluctuations of the total internal energy of a granular gas
under stationary uniform shear flow by means of kinetic theory methods. We find
that these fluctuations are coupled to the fluctuations of the different
components of the total pressure tensor. Explicit expressions for all the
possible cross and auto correlations of the fluctuations at one and two times
are obtained in the two dimensional case. The theoretical predictions are
compared with Molecular Dynamics simulation and a good agreement is found for
the range of inelasticity considered.
