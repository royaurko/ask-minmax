Recent results on identified hadrons from the PHENIX experiment in Au+Au
collisions at mid-rapidity at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV are presented. The
centrality dependence of transverse momentum distributions and particle ratios
for identified charged hadrons are studied. The transverse flow velocity and
freeze-out temperature are extracted from $p_{T}$ spectra within the framework
of a hydrodynamic collective flow model. Two-particle HBT correlations for
charged pions are measured in different centrality selections for a broad range
of transverse momentum of the pair. Results on elliptic flow measurements with
respect to the reaction plane for identified particles are also presented.
