We obtain the general forms of the axisymmetric stability criteria in a
magnetized compressible Couette flow using an energy variational principle, the
so--called interchange or Chandrasekhar's method, which we applied successfully
in the incompressible case. This formulation accounts for the simultaneous
presence of gravity, rotation, a toroidal magnetic field, a weak axial magnetic
field, entropy gradients, and density gradients in the initial equilibrium
state. The power of the method lies in its simplicity which allows us to derive
extremely compact and physically clear expressions for the relevant stability
criteria despite the inclusion of so many physical effects. In the
implementation of the method, all the applicable conservation laws are
explicitly taken into account during the variations of a quantity with
dimensions of energy which we call the "free--energy function." In the limits
of plane--parallel atmospheres and homoentropic flows, our formulation easily
recovers the stability criteria for suppression of convective and Parker
instabilities, as well as some related special cases studied over 40 years ago
by Newcomb and Tserkovnikov via laborious variational techniques.
