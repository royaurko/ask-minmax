We study the Poiseuille flow of a soft-glassy material above the jamming
point, where the material flows like a complex fluid with Herschel- Bulkley
rheology. Microscopic plastic rearrangements and the emergence of their spatial
correlations induce cooperativity flow behavior whose effect is pronounced in
presence of confinement. With the help of lattice Boltzmann numerical
simulations of confined dense emulsions, we explore the role of geometrical
roughness in providing activation of plastic events close to the boundaries. We
probe also the spatial configuration of the fluidity field, a continuum
quantity which can be related to the rate of plastic events, thereby allowing
us to establish a link between the mesoscopic plastic dynamics of the jammed
material and the macroscopic flow behaviour.
