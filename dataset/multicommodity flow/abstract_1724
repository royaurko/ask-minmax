We present a renormalizability proof for spontaneously broken SU(2) gauge
theory based on Flow Equations. It is a conceptually and technically simplified
version of the earlier paper [KM] including some extensions. The proof of [KM]
also was incomplete since an important assumption made implicitly in the proof
of Lemma 2 there is not verified. So the present paper is also a corrected
version of [KM].
