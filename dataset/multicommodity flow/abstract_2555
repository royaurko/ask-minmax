We use a 3D computational model to study the fluid transport and mixing due
to the beating of an infinite array of cilia. In accord with recent
experiments, we observe two distinct regions: a fluid transport region above
the cilia and a fluid mixing region below the cilia tip. The metachronal wave
due to phase differences between neighboring cilia is known to enhance the
fluid transport above the ciliary tip. In this work, we show that the
metachronal wave also enhances the mixing rates in the sub-ciliary region,
often simultaneously with the flow rate enhancement. Our results suggest that
this simultaneous enhancement in transport and mixing is due to an enhancement
in shear flow. As the flow above the cilia increases, shear rate in the fluid
increases and such shear enhances stretching, which is an essential ingredient
for mixing. Estimates of the mixing time scale indicate that, compared to
diffusion, the mixing due to the cilia beat may be significant and sometimes
dominates chemical diffusion.
