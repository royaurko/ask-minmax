In this note we investigate the proposal of Ellwood and one of the contributors et
al. to construct a string field theory solution describing the endpoint of an
RG flow from a reference BCFT to a target BCFT*. We show that the proposed
class of solutions suffers from an anomaly in the equations of motion.
Nevertheless, the gauge invariant action exactly reproduces the expected shift
in energy.
