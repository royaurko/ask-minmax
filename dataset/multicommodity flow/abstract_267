We experimentally study the fluid flow induced by a broad, penetrable barrier
moving through an elongated dilute gaseous Bose-Einstein condensate. The
barrier is created by a laser beam swept through the condensate, and the
resulting dipole potential can be either attractive or repulsive. We examine
both cases and find regimes of stable and unstable fluid flow: At slow speeds
of the barrier, the fluid flow is stationary due to the superfluidity of the
condensate. At intermediate speeds, we observe a non-stationary regime in which
the condensate gets filled with dark solitons. At faster speeds, soliton
formation completely ceases and a remarkable absence of excitation in the
condensate is seen again.
