Perfusion analysis computes blood flow parameters (blood volume, blood flow,
mean transit time) from the observed flow of contrast agent, passing through
the patient's vascular system. Perfusion deconvolution has been widely accepted
as the principal numerical tool for perfusion analysis, and is used routinely
in clinical applications. This extensive use of perfusion in clinical
decision-making makes numerical stability and robustness of perfusion
computations vital for accurate diagnostics and patient safety. The main goal
of this paper is to propose a novel approach for validating numerical
properties of perfusion algorithms. The approach is based on Perfusion
Linearity Property (PLP), which we find in perfusion deconvolution, as well as
in many other perfusion techniques. PLP allows one to study perfusion values as
weighted averages of the original imaging data. This, in turn, uncovers hidden
problems with the existing deconvolution techniques, and may be used to suggest
more reliable computational approaches and methodology.
