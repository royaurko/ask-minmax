The equations governing general relativistic, spherically symmetric,
hydrodynamic accretion of polytropic fluid onto black holes are solved in
Schwarzschild metric to investigate some of the transonic properties of the
flow. Only stationary solutions are discussed. For such accretion, it has been
shown that real physical sonic points may form {\it even for flow with $\gamma
< {4/3}$ or $\gamma > {5/3}$}. Behaviour of some flow variables in the close
vicinity of the event horizon are studied as a function of specific energy and
polytropic index of the flow.
