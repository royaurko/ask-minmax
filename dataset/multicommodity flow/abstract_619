We study the elliptic flow systematically from SIS to RHIC energies in a
realistic dynamical cascade model. We compile our results with the recent data
from STAR and PHOBOS experiments on elliptic flow of charged particles in Au +
Au collisions at RHIC energy. From the analysis of elliptic flow as a function
of different dynamical variables such as transverse momenta, pseudorapidity and
centrality at RHIC energy, we found a good fitting with data at 1.5 times a
scaling factor to our simulation model, which characterizes that the model is
required to have extra pressure generated from the subsequent parton
scatterings. In energy dependence of elliptic flow, we observe a re-hardening
nature at RHIC energies, which may probably signal the possible formation of
quark-gluon plasma.
