In this paper, we announce the following results: Let M be a Kaehler-Einstein
manifold with positive scalar curvature. If the initial metric has nonnegative
bisectional curvature and positive at least at one point, then the
K\"ahler-Ricci flow converges exponentially fast to a Kaehler-Einstein metric
with constant bisectional curvature.
