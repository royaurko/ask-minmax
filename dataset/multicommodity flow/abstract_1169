Heat conduction in ionized plasmas in the presence of magnetic fields is
today a fashionable problem. The kinetic theory of plasmas, in the context of
non-equilibrium thermodynamics, predicts a Hall-effect-like heat flow due to
the presence of a magnetic field in ionized gases. This cross effect, the
Righi-Leduc effect together with a heat flow perpendicular to the magnetic
field are shown to yield significant contributions, under certain conditions to
the ordinary Fourier component of the heat flow. The thermal conductivities
associated with these effects change with the strength of the magnetic field
for a given temperature and density and are shown to be significant compared
with the parallel conductivity for a whole range of values of \vec{B}.
