The global structure of optically thin advection dominated accretion flows
which are composed of two-temperature plasma around black holes is calculated.
We adopt the full set of basic equations including the advective energy
transport in the energy equation for the electrons. The spectra emitted by the
optically thin accretion flows are also investigated. The radiation mechanisms
which are taken into accout are bremsstrahlung, synchrotron emission, and
Comptonization. The calculation of the spectra and that of the structure of the
accretion flows are made to be completely consistent by calculating the
radiative cooling rate at each radius. As a result of the advection domination
for the ions, the heat transport from the ions to the electrons becomes
practically zero and the radiative cooling balances with the advective heating
in the energy equation of the electrons. Following up on the successful work of
Narayan et al. (1995), we applied our model to the spectrum of Sgr A*. We find
that the spectrum of Sgr A* is explained by the optically thin advection
dominated accretion flow around a black hole of the mass M_bh=10^6 M_sun. The
parameter dependence of the spectrum and the structure of the accretion flows
is also discussed.
