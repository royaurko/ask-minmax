In this paper we demonstrate that radiation patterns could cause flow-like
behaviour without any reference to hydrodynamic description. For that purpose
we use a statistical ensemble of radiating dipoles, motivated by the
investigation of the equivalent photon yield produced by decelerating charges.
For the elliptic asymmetry factor we find a reasonable agreement with
experimental data.
