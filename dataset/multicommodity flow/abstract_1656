We investigate elliptic flow in heavy ion collisions at intermediate
energies. In doing this, we implement and use a lattice-Hamiltonian model of
the nuclear interaction and we also study the effect of in-medium
nucleon-nucleon cross sections that follow consistently from the
momentum-dependence of the nuclear mean field.
