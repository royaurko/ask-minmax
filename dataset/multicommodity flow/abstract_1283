Given the difficulty in directly determining prominence physical parameters
from observations, prominence seismology stands as an alternative method to
probe the nature of these structures. We show recent examples of the
application of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) seismology techniques to infer
physical parameters in prominence plasmas. They are based on the application of
inversion techniques using observed periods, damping times, and plasma flow
speeds of prominence thread oscillations. The contribution of Hinode to the
subject has been of central importance. We show an example based on data
obtained with Hinode's Solar Optical Telescope. Observations show an active
region limb prominence, composed by a myriad of thin horizontal threads that
flow following a path parallel to the photosphere and display synchronous
vertical oscillations. The coexistence of waves and flows can be firmly
established. By making use of an interpretation based on transverse MHD kink
oscillations, a seismological analysis of this event is performed. It is shown
that the combination of high quality Hinode observations and proper theoretical
models allows flows and waves to become two useful characteristics for our
understanding of the nature of solar prominences.
