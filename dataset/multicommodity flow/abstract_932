The discretized equilibrium distributions of the lattice Boltzmann method are
presented by us- ing the coefficients of the Lagrange interpolating polynomials
that pass through the points related to discrete velocities and using moments
of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The ranges of flow velocity and
temperature providing positive valued distributions vary with regulating dis-
crete velocities as parameters. New isothermal and thermal compressible models
are proposed for flows of the level of the isothermal and thermal compressible
Navier-Stokes equations. Thermal compressible shock tube flows are simulated by
only five on-lattice discrete velocities.
