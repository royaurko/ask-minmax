Mean curvature flows of hypersurfaces have been extensively studied and there
are various different approaches and many beautiful results. However,
relatively little is known about mean curvature flows of submanifolds of higher
codimensions. This notes starts with some basic materials on submanifold
geometry, and then introduces mean curvature flows in general dimensions and
co-dimensions. The related techniques in the so called "blow-up" analysis are
also discussed. At the end, we present some global existence and convergence
results for mean curvature flows of two-dimensional surfaces in
four-dimensional ambient spaces.
