Inspired by previous work on the constraints that duality imposes on beta
functions of spin models, we propose a consistency condition between those
functions and RG flows at different points in coupling constant space. We show
that this consistency holds for a non self-dual model which admits an exact RG
flow, but that it is violated when the RG flow is only approximate. We discuss
the use of this deviation as a test for the ``goodness'' of proposed RG flows
in complicated models, and the use of the proposed consistency in suggesting RG
equations.
