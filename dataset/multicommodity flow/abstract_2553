We propose an explanation for the onset of oscillations seen in numerical
simulations of dense, inclined flows of inelastic, frictional spheres. It is
based on a phase transition between disordered and ordered collisional states
that may be interrupted by the formation of force chains. Low frequency
oscillations between ordered and disordered states take place over weakly bumpy
bases; higher-frequency oscillations over strongly bumpy bases involve the
formation of particle chains that extend to the base and interrupt the phase
change. The predicted frequency and amplitude of the oscillations induced by
the unstable part of the equation of state are similar to those seen in the
simulations and they depend upon the contact stiffness in the same way. Such
oscillations could be the source of sound produced by flowing sand.
