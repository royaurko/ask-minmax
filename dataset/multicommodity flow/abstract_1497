The transport of photons in steady, spherical, scattering flows is
investigated. The moment equations are solved analytically for accretion onto a
Schwarzschild black hole, taking into full account relativistic effects. We
show that the emergent radiation spectrum is a power law at high frequencies
with a spectral index smaller (harder spectrum) than in the non--relativistic
case. Radiative transfer in an expanding envelope is also analyzed. We find
that adiabatic expansion produces a drift of injected monochromatic photons
towards lower frequencies and the formation of a power--law, low--energy tail
with spectral index $-3$.
