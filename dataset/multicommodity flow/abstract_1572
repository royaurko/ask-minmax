An explicit fluid flow simulation of electromagnetic wave propagation in the
gravitational field of a Schwarzschild black hole is given. The fluid has a
constant refractive index and a spherically symmetric inward directed flow. The
resulting form of the metric leads to a new coordinate system in which the
Schwarzschild vacuum is written in Gordon's form. It is shown that a closely
related coordinate system interpolates between the Kerr-Schild and
Painleve-Gullstrand coordinates.
