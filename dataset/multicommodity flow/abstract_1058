We analyze particle velocity fluctuations in a simulated granular system
subjected to homogeneous quasistatic shearing. We show that these fluctuations
share the following scaling characteristics of fluid turbulence in spite of
their different physical origins: 1) Scale-dependent probability distribution
with non-Guassian broadening at small time scales; 2) Power-law spectrum,
reflecting long-range correlations and the self-affine nature of the
fluctuations; 3) Superdiffusion with respect to the mean background flow.
