Nucleon flow in Au+Au collisions at 1 GeV/nucleon region and dilepton spectra
in S+Au collisions at SPS energies are analysed in the relativistic transport
model. They are shown to be sensitive to the nucleon vector and scalar
potentials, respectively, and are thus useful probes of these potentials in
dense matter. A recently developed effective Lagrangian with self-interactions
of vector as well as scalar fields is found to describe both data reasonably
well.
