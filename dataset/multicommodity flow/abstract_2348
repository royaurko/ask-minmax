I propose a simple model, based on an analogy to von Neumann artificial
viscosity, of turbulent diffusion, heat diffusion and viscosity coefficients
for use in modeling subgrid turbulent diffusivity in multi-phase numerical
hydrodynamics and, more generally, in subgrid turbulent viscosity and thermal
transport. In analogy to the von Neumann artificial viscosity, these
coefficients explicitly contain the grid size and do not attempt a quantitative
model of the unresolved turbulence. In order to address the problem that it is
often not known a priori when and where a flow will become turbulent, the
coefficients are set to zero when the flow is not expected to be turbulent on
the basis of a Richardson/Rayleigh-Taylor stability criterion, in analogy to
von Neumann's setting of artificial viscosity to zero in expanding flows.
