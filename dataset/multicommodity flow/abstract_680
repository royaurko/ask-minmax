This paper presents a stable numerical algorithm for the Brinkman equations
by using weak Galerkin (WG) finite element methods. The Brinkman equations can
be viewed mathematically as a combination of the Stokes and Darcy equations
which model fluid flow in a multi-physics environment, such as flow in complex
porous media with a permeability coefficient highly varying in the simulation
domain. In such applications, the flow is dominated by Darcy in some regions
and by Stokes in others. It is well known that the usual Stokes stable elements
do not work well for Darcy flow and vise versa. The challenge of this study is
on the design of numerical schemes which are stable for both the Stokes and the
Darcy equations. This paper shows that the WG finite element method is capable
of meeting this challenge by providing a numerical scheme that is stable and
accurate for both Darcy and the Stokes dominated flows. Error estimates of
optimal order are established for the corresponding WG finite element
solutions. The paper also presents some numerical experiments that demonstrate
the robustness, reliability, flexibility and accuracy of the WG method for the
Brinkman equations.
