We attempt to model Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) evolution from the initial Heavy
Ion collision to the final hadronic gas state by combining the Glauber model
initial state conditions with eccentricity fluctuations, pre-equilibrium flow,
UVH2+1 viscous hydrodynamics with lattice QCD Equation of State (EoS), a
modified Cooper-Frye freeze-out and the UrQMD hadronic cascade. We then
evaluate the model parameters using a comprehensive analytical framework which
together with the described model we call CHIMERA. Within our framework, the
initial state parameters, such as the initial temperature
(T$_{\mathrm{init}}$), presence or absence of initial flow, viscosity over
entropy density ($\eta$/s) and different Equations of State (EoS), are varied
and then compared simultaneously to several experimental data observables: HBT
radii, particle spectra and particle flow. $\chi^2$/nds values from comparison
to the experimental data for each set of initial parameters will then used to
find the optimal description of the QGP with parameters that are difficult to
obtain experimentally, but are crucial to understanding of the matter produced.
