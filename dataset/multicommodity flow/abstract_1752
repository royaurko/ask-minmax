We study an initial boundary value problem for the Navier-Stokes equations of
compressible viscous heat-conductive fluids in a 2-D periodic domain or the
unit square domain. We establish a blow-up criterion for the local strong
solutions in terms of the gradient of the velocity only, which coincides with
the famous Beale-Kato-Majda criterion for ideal incompressible flows.
