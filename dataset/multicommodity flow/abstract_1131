In this paper, the Hamiltonian formulations along with the Poisson brackets
for two-dimensional (2D) electron magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD) flows are
developed. These formulations are used to deduce the Beltrami states for 2D
EMHD flows. In the massless electron limit, the EMHD Beltrami states reduce to
the force-free states, though there is no force-free Beltrami state in the
general EMHD case.
