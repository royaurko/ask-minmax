A simple, fast, oscillation-free, high-resolution algorithm for
convection-dominated flows is proposed. The stability, accuracy and time
complexity of this method called the position-state separation method (POSS)
are discussed. Several classical numerical experiments in different dimensions
and coordinate systems are conducted to demonstrate the excellent performance
of the POSS regarding computational cost, robustness, and high-resolution. It
is shown that the step time of POSS is not restricted by the CFL condition and
that the time complexity of the method when dealing with the
convection-dominated flows increases linearly with the number of unknowns.
