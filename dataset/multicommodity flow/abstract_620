Based on the quark coalescence model for the parton-to-hadron phase
transition in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions, we relate the elliptic
flow ($v_2$) of high $\pt$ hadrons to that of high $\pt$ quarks. For high $\pt$
hadrons produced from an isospin symmetric and quark-antiquark symmetric
partonic matter, magnitudes of their elliptic flows follow a flavor ordering as
$(v_{2,\pi}=v_{2,N}) > (v_{2,\Lambda}=v_{2,\Sigma})
 > v_{2,K} > v_{2,\Xi} > (v_{2,\phi}=v_{2,\Omega})$ if strange quarks have a
smaller elliptic flow than light quarks. The elliptic flows of high $\pt$
hadrons further follow a simple quark counting rule if strange quarks and light
quarks have same high $\pt$ spectrum and coalescence probability.
