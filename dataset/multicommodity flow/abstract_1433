We present results from axisymmetric, time-dependent hydrodynamical (HD) and
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of a gaseous envelope collapsing onto a
black hole (BH). We consider gas with so small angular momentum that after an
initial transient, the flow in the HD case, accretes directly onto a BH without
forming a rotationally support torus. However, in the MHD case even with a very
weak initial magnetic field, the flow settles into a configuration with four
components: (i) an equatorial inflow, (ii) a bipolar outflow, (iii) polar
funnel outflow, and (iv) polar funnel inflow. We focus our analysis on the
second flow component of the MHD flow which represents a simple yet robust
example of a well-organized inflow/outflow solution to the problem of MHD jet
formation. The jet is heavy, highly magnetized, and driven by magnetic and
centrifugal forces. A significant fraction of the total energy in the jet is
carried out by a large scale magnetic field. We review previous simulations,
where specific angular momentum was higher than that assumed here, and conclude
that our bipolar outflow develops for a wide range of the properties of the
flow near the equator and near the poles. Future work on such a simple
inflow/outflow solution will help to pinpoint the key elements of real
jets/outflows as well as help to interpret much more complex simulations aimed
at studying jet formation and collapse of magnetized envelopes.
