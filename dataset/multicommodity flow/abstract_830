We study the van der Waals frictional drag force induced by liquid flow in
low-dimensional systems (2D and 1D electron systems, and 2D and 1D channels
with liquid). We find that for both 1D and 2D systems, the frictional drag
force induced by liquid flow may be several orders of magnitude larger than the
frictional drag induced by electronic current.
