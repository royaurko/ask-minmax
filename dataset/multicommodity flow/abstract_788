A qualitative model is presented, suggesting gravitational information is
transduced into biological systems primarily by its effect on spatially
organised membrane and cytoplasmic flows. Continuous low affinity interactions
between membrane bound cytoskeletal proteins and phospholipid flows that are
undergoing forced convective and shear driven flows are shown to convert this
information into spatial protein patterns, and hence cell shape. As applied
here to plant cells, the feedback mechanism is shown capable not only of
establishing the strict nanometer scale parallelism that exists between
proteins running on the inside and outside of the cell membrane, but also to
predict its maintainance and the angle of fibre realignment observed during
tropic responses.
