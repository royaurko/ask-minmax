In prior work the contributors introduced a parabolic flow of pluriclosed metrics.
Here we give improved regularity results for solutions to this equation.
Furthermore, we exhibit this equation as the gradient flow of the lowest
eigenvalue of a certain Schr\"odinger operator, and show the existence of an
expanding entropy functional for this flow. Finally, we motivate a conjectural
picture of the optimal regularity results for this flow, and discuss some of
the consequences.
