We suggest a scalar model for deformation and flow of an amorphous material
such as a foam or an emulsion. To describe elastic, plastic and viscous
behaviours, we use three scalar variables: elastic deformation, plastic
deformation rate and total deformation rate; and three material specific
parameters: shear modulus, yield deformation and viscosity. We obtain equations
valid for different types of deformations and flows slower than the relaxation
rate towards mechanical equilibrium. In particular, they are valid both in
transient or steady flow regimes, even at large elastic deformation. We discuss
why viscosity can be relevant even in this slow shear (often called
"quasi-static") limit. Predictions of the storage and loss moduli agree with
the experimental literature, and explain with simple arguments the non-linear
large amplitude trends.
