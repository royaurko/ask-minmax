Traffic Congestions and accidents are major concerns in today's
transportation systems. This thesis investigates how to optimize traffic flow
on highways, in particular for merging situations such as intersections where a
ramp leads onto the highway. In our work, cars are equipped with sensors that
can detect distance to neighboring cars, and communicate their velocity and
acceleration readings with one another. Sensor-enabled cars can locally
exchange sensed information about the traffic and adapt their behavior much
earlier than regular cars.
  We propose proactive algorithms for merging different streams of
sensor-enabled cars into a single stream. A proactive merging algorithm
decouples the decision point from the actual merging point. Sensor-enabled cars
allow us to decide where and when a car merges before it arrives at the actual
merging point. This leads to a significant improvement in traffic flow as
velocities can be adjusted appropriately. We compare proactive merging
algorithms against the conventional priority-based merging algorithm in a
controlled simulation environment. Experiment results show that proactive
merging algorithms outperform the priority-based merging algorithm in terms of
flow and delay.
