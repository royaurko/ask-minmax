This article submitted to the APS-DFD 2008 conference, accompanies the fluid
dynamics video depicting the various orientational dynamics of a hinged
cylinder suspended in a flow tank. The different behaviors displayed by the
cylinder range from steady orientation to periodic oscillation and even
autorotation. We illustrate these features using a phase diagram which captures
the observed phenomena as a function of Reynolds number and reduced inertia. A
hydrogen bubble flow visualization technique is also used to show vortex
shedding structure in the cylinder's wake which results in these oscillations.
