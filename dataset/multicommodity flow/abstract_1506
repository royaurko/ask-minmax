Using simple arguments we show that the canonical thin keplerian accretion
disks cannot smoothly match any plain advection dominated flow (ADAF) model. By
'plain' ADAF model we mean the ones with zero cooling. The existence of sonic
points in exact solutions is critical and imposes constraints that cannot be
surpassed adopting 'reasonable' physical conditions at the hypothetical match
point. Only the occurrence of new critical physical phenomena may produce a
transition. We propose that exact advection models are a class of solutions
which don't necessarily involve the standard thin cool disks and suggest a
different scenario in which good ADAF solutions could eventually occur.
