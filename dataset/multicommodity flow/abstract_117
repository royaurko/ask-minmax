We introduce two new functionals on Sasaki manifolds, inspired by the work of
Perelman, which are monotonic along the Sasaki-Ricci flow. We relate their
gradient flow, via diffeomorphisms preserving the foliated structure of the
manifold, to the transverse Ricci flow. Finally, when the basic first Chern
class is positive, we employ these new functionals to prove a uniform $C^{0}$
bound for the transverse scalar curvature, and a uniform $C^{1}$ bound for the
transverse Ricci potential along the Sasaki-Ricci flow.
