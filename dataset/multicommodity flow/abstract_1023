We use the Ricci flow with surgery to study four-dimensional SU(2) x
U(1)-symmetric metrics on a manifold with fixed boundary given by a squashed
3-sphere. Depending on the initial metric we show that the flow converges to
either the Taub-Bolt or the Taub-NUT metric, the latter case potentially
requiring surgery at some point in the evolution. The Ricci flow allows us to
explore the Euclidean action landscape within this symmetry class. This work
extends the recent work of Headrick and Wiseman to more interesting topologies.
