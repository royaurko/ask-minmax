The transverse momentum spectra, elliptic flow and interferometry radii for
Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC are calculated in relativistic viscous
hydrodynamics. For Glauber model initial conditions, we find that the data can
be described using a small value of shear viscosity eta/s=0.08. The viscosities
and the equation of state are the same as used for RHIC energies.
