In this paper, we continue to study the generalized Ricci flow. We give a
criterion on steady gradient Ricci soliton on complete and noncompact
Riemannian manifolds that is Ricci-flat, and then introduce a natural flow
whose stable points are Ricci-flat metrics. Modifying the argument used by Shi
and List, we prove the short time existence and higher order derivatives
estimates.
