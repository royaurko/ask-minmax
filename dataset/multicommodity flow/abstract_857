The observation of fluctuations of parity-odd angular observables at RHIC has
been interpreted as a signal of a local parity violation. We show how the
observed signal can be explained by local charge conservation at freeze-out
combined with elliptic flow. Calculations from a blast wave model, which
overlays thermal emission onto a collective flow profile, are shown to account
for the experimentally observed signal.
