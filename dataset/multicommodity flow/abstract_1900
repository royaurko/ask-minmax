A two-fluid model for canonical helicity transport between merging flux-ropes
is developed. Relative canonical helicity is defined here as the gauge
invariant helicity of the canonical momentum of a given species, and represents
the generalization of helicity to magnetized plasmas with non- negligible
momentum. The model provides the conditions for when the transport of canonical
helicity during merging manifests itself as magnetic helicity transfer or as
generation of strong helical plasma flows. The model is applied to compact
torus merging but is also relevant to situations where magnetic flux-ropes and
flow vorticity flux-ropes interact. Geometrical interpretations are given.
