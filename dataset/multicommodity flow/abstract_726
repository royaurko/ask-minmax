Previously unexplored accretion regimes associated with the rotation of
accreting matter, namely the perturbations of a quasi-spherical subsonic
settling flow and Bondi-Hoyle accretion in the presence of axial rotation, are
considered within the framework of ideal hydrodynamics. For subsonic settling
accretion, the perturbations are shown to grow rapidly as the gravitating
center is approached, so that the flow in the inner regions can no longer be
considered as quasi-spherical. For Bondi-Hoyle accretion, a vacuum cylindrical
cavity is shown to be formed at large distances from the gravitating center
near the flow axis, with the flow velocity outside this cavity being virtually
independent of the distance to the rotation axis.
