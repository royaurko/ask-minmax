The ALICE detector at the LHC recorded first Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV in
November and December of 2010. We report on the measurements of anisotropic
flow for charged and identified particles. From the comparison with
measurements at lower energies and with model predictions we find that the
system created at these collision energies is described well by hydrodynamical
model calculations and behaves like an almost perfect fluid.
