Tank-treading, tumbling and trembling are different types of the vesicle
behavior in an external flow. We derive a dynamical equation for nearly
spherical vesicles enabling to establish a phase diagram of the system
predicting the regimes. The diagram is drawn in terms of two dimensionless
parameters depending on the vesicle excess area, fluid viscosities, membrane
viscosity and bending modulus, strength of the flow, and ratio of the
elongational and rotational components of the flow. The tank-treading to
tumbling transition occurs via a saddle-node bifurcation whereas the
tank-treading to trembling transition occurs via a Hopf bifurcation. We
establish a critical slowing near the merging point of the transition lines.
