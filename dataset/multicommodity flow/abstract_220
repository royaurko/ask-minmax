Pollicott-Ruelle resonances for chaotic flows are the characteristic
frequencies of correlations. They are typically defined as eigenvalues of the
generator of the flow acting on specially designed functional spaces. We show
that these resonances can be computed as viscosity limits of eigenvalues of
second order elliptic operators. These eigenvalues are the characteristic
frequencies of correlations for a stochastically perturbed flow.
