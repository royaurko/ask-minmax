We have shown analytically that shapes of incompressible stars could be
prolate if appropriate meridional flows exist. Although this result is strictly
valid only if either the meridional flow or the rotation is absent and the
vorticity is associated uniformly with meridional flow, this implies that
perpendicular forces against centrifugal and/or magnetic forces might play
important roles within stars. A consequence of the presence of meridional flows
might be to decrease stellar oblateness due to centrifugal and/or magnetic
fields.
