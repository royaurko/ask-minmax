We compare microscopic transport model calculations to recent data on the
directed and elliptic flow of various hadrons in 2 - 10 A GeV Au+Au and Pb (158
A GeV) Pb collisions. For the Au+Au excitation function a transition from the
squeeze-out to an in-plane enhanced emission is consistently described with
mean field potentials corresponding to one incompressibility. For the Pb (158 A
GeV) Pb system the elliptic flow prefers in-plane emission both for protons and
pions, the directed flow of protons is opposite to that of the pions, which
exhibit anti-flow. Strong directed transverse flow is present for protons and
Lambdas in Au (6 A GeV) Au collisions as well. Both for the SPS and the AGS
energies the agreement between data and calculations is remarkable.
