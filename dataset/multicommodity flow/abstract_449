We consider the gradient flow of a one-homogeneous functional, whose dual
involves the derivative of a constrained scalar function. We show in this case
that the gradient flow is related to a weak, generalized formulation of the
Hele-Shaw flow. The equivalence follows from a variational representation,
which is a variant of well-known variational representations for the Hele-Shaw
problem. As a consequence we get existence and uniqueness of a weak solution to
the Hele-Shaw flow. We also obtain an explicit representation for the Total
Variation flow in one dimension and easily deduce basic qualitative properties,
concerning in particular the "staircasing effect".
