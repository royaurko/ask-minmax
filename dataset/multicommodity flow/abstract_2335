Particle impaction in the super heater geometry found in the municipal solid
waste incinerator (MSWI) of GKS in Schweinfurt, Germany, has been investigated.
By using direct numerical simulations for the fluid flow, inertial particles
coupled to the fluid through the classical Stokes' drag law have been tracked.
Focus has been on the effect of flow velocity, and it is shown that decreasing
the flow velocity will drastically decrease the impaction efficiency for some
particle radii. Finally particle size distribution measurements are presented
and used to find quantitative mass fluxes both on the front and the back side
of the tubes in the super heater tube bundle.
