Infiltration of anomalously diffusing particles from one material to another
through a biased interface is studied using continuous time random walk and
Levy walk approaches. Subdiffusion in both systems may lead to a net drift from
one material to another (e.g. <x(t)> > 0) even if particles eventually flow in
the opposite direction (e.g. number of particles in x>0 approaches zero). A
weaker paradox is found for a symmetric interface: a flow of particles is
observed while the net drift is zero. For a subdiffusive sample coupled to a
superdiffusive system we calculate the average occupation fractions and the
scaling of the particles distribution. We find a net drift in this system,
which is always directed to the superdiffusive material, while the particles
flow to the material with smaller sub or superdiffusion exponent. We report the
exponents of the first passage times distribution of Levy walks, which are
needed for the calculation of anomalous infiltration
