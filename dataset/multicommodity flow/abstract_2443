We present a reformulation of unsteady turbulent flow simulations. The
initial condition is relaxed and information is allowed to propagate both
forward and backward in time. Simulations of chaotic dynamical systems with
this reformulation can be proven to be well-conditioned time domain boundary
value problems. The reformulation can enable scalable parallel-in-time
simulation of turbulent flows.
