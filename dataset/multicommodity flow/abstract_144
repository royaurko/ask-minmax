We present a dynamic density functional theory (dDFT) which takes into accou
nt the advection of the particles by a flowing solvent. For potential flows we
can use the same closure as in the absence of solvent flow. The structure of
the resulting advected dDFT suggests that it could be used for non-potential
flows as well. We apply this dDFT to Brownian particles (e.g., polymer coils)
in a solvent flowing around a spherical obstacle (e.g., a colloid) and compare
the results with direct simulations of the underlying Brownian dynamics.
  Although numerical limitations do not allow for an accurate quantitative
check of the advected dDFT both show the same qualitative features. In contrast
to previous works which neglected the deformation of the flow by the obstacle,
we find that the bow-wave in the density distribution of particles in front of
the obstacle as well as the wake behind it are reduced dramatically. As a
consequence the friction force exerted by the (polymer) particles on the
colloid can be reduced drastically.
