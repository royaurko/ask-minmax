This is the second paper in a series of works devoted to nonholonomic Ricci
flows. By imposing non-integrable (nonholonomic) constraints on the Ricci flows
of Riemannian metrics we can model mutual transforms of generalized
Finsler-Lagrange and Riemann geometries. We verify some assertions made in the
first partner paper and develop a formal scheme in which the geometric
constructions with Ricci flow evolution are elaborated for canonical nonlinear
and linear connection structures. This scheme is applied to a study of
Hamilton's Ricci flows on nonholonomic manifolds and related Einstein spaces
and Ricci solitons. The nonholonomic evolution equations are derived from
Perelman's functionals which are redefined in such a form that can be adapted
to the nonlinear connection structure. Next, the statistical analogy for
nonholonomic Ricci flows is formulated and the corresponding thermodynamical
expressions are found for compact configurations. Finally, we analyze two
physical applications: the nonholonomic Ricci flows associated to evolution
models for solitonic pp-wave solutions of Einstein equations, and compute the
Perelman's entropy for regular Lagrange and analogous gravitational systems.
