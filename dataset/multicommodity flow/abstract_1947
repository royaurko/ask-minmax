Electromagnetic aspects of a QCD matter have been a hot topic in recent
years. High-energy heavy-ion experiments revealed that flow harmonics of direct
photons are not explained by most hydrodynamic models. In this work I discuss
possible effects of refraction by the hot medium since it can work as a lens
which converts its geometrical anisotropy into momentum anisotropy of photons.
Then elliptic flow and higher-order harmonics of prompt photons are estimated
numerically. The results indicate that they could be small but have
phenomenologically non-trivial consequences.
