The paper considers the Ricci flow, coupled with the harmonic map flow
between two manifolds. We derive estimates for the fundamental solution of the
corresponding conjugate heat equation and we prove an analog of Perelman's
differential Harnack inequality. As an application, we find a connection
between the entropy functional and the best constant in the Sobolev imbedding
theorem in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
