Flow analysis of big basins is given. Internal structure of flows is
considered. Correlations between flows are calculated. For example, Mare
Orientale is a moving basin. Orientale and Imbrium continental basins are
introduced and are considered. Olbers ray crater is a result of precise
interaction of the two basins. Flows of the Tycho type are studied. Two
Antarctidae, an Indian Ocean, and an America are demonstrated.
