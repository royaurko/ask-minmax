The magnetic field of planets or stars is generated by the motion of a
conducting fluid through a dynamo instability. The saturation of the magnetic
field occurs through the reaction of the Lorentz force on the flow. In relation
to this phenomenon, we study the effect of a magnetic field on a turbulent flow
of liquid Gallium. The measurement of electric potential differences provides a
signal related to the local velocity fluctuations. We observe a reduction of
velocity fluctuations at all frequencies in the spectrum when the magnetic
field is increased.
