We consider a reaction-diffusion equation in a cellular flow. We prove that
in the strong flow regime there are two possible scenario for the initial data
that is compactly supported and the size of the support is large enough. If the
flow cells are large compared to the reaction length scale, propagating fronts
will always form. For the small cell size, any finitely supported initial data
will be quenched by a sufficiently strong flow. We estimate that the flow
amplitude required to quench the initial data of support $L_0$ is
$A>CL_0^4\ln(L_0)$. The essence of the problem is the question about the decay
of the $L^\infty$ norm of a solution to the advection-diffusion equation, and
the relation between this rate of decay and the properties of the Hamiltonian
system generated by the two-dimensional incompressible fluid flow.
