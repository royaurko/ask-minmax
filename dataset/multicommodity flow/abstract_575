Context. Recent observations of solar prominences show the presence of
turbulent flows that may be caused by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilites (KHI).
However, the observed flow velocities are below the classical threshold for the
onset of KHI in fully ionized plasmas.
  Aims. We investigate the effect of partial ionization on the onset of KHI in
dense and cool cylindrical magnetic flux tubes surrounded by a hotter and
lighter environment.
  Methods. The linearized governing equations of a partially ionized two-fluid
plasma are used to describe the behavior of small-amplitude perturbations
superimposed on a magnetic tube with longitudinal mass flow. A normal mode
analysis is performed to obtain the dispersion relation for linear
incompressible waves. We focus on the appearance of unstable solutions and
study the dependence of their growth rates on various physical parameters. An
analytical approximation of the KHI linear growth rate for slow flows and
strong ion-neutral coupling is obtained. An application to solar prominence
threads is given.
  Results. The presence of a neutral component in a plasma may contribute to
the onset of the KHI even for sub-Alfv\'enic longitudinal shear flows.
Collisions between ions and neutrals reduce the growth rates of the unstable
perturbations but cannot completely suppress the instability.
  Conclusions. Turbulent flows in solar prominences with sub-Alfv\'enic flow
velocities may be interpreted as consequences of KHI in partially ionized
plasmas.
