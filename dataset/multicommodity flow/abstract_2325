We compute the continuum thermo-hydrodynamical limit of a new formulation of
lattice kinetic equations for thermal compressible flows, recently proposed in
[Sbragaglia et al., J. Fluid Mech. 628 299 (2009)]. We show that the
hydrodynamical manifold is given by the correct compressible Fourier-
Navier-Stokes equations for a perfect fluid. We validate the numerical
algorithm by means of exact results for transition to convection in
Rayleigh-B\'enard compressible systems and against direct comparison with
finite-difference schemes. The method is stable and reliable up to temperature
jumps between top and bottom walls of the order of 50% the averaged bulk
temperature. We use this method to study Rayleigh-Taylor instability for
compressible stratified flows and we determine the growth of the mixing layer
at changing Atwood numbers up to At ~ 0.4. We highlight the role played by the
adiabatic gradient in stopping the mixing layer growth in presence of high
stratification and we quantify the asymmetric growth rate for spikes and
bubbles for two dimensional Rayleigh- Taylor systems with resolution up to Lx
\times Lz = 1664 \times 4400 and with Rayleigh numbers up to Ra ~ 2 \times
10^10.
