Using the AMPT model for relativistic heavy ion collisions, we have studied
the di-hadron azimuthal angular correlations triggered by emitted jets in Au+Au
collisions at center of mass energy $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV and impact
parameter $b=8$ fm. A double-peak structure for the associated particles at the
away side of trigger particles is obtained after subtracting background
correlations due to the elliptic flow. Both the near-side peak and the
away-side double peaks in the azimuthal angular correlations are, however,
significantly suppressed (enhanced) in events of small (large) triangular flow,
which are present as a result of fluctuations in the initial collision
geometry. After subtraction of background correlations due to the triangular
flow, the away-side double peaks change into a single peak with broad shoulders
on both sides. The away side of the di-hadron correlations becomes essentially
a single peak after further subtraction of higher-order flows.
