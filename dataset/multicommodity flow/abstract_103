We investigate the statistical properties of an over-damped Brownian particle
that is trapped by a harmonic potential and simultaneously exposed to a linear
shear flow or to a plane Poiseuille flow. Its probability distribution is
determined via the corresponding Smoluchowski equation, which is solved
analytically for a linear shear flow. In the case of a plane Poiseuille flow,
analytical approximations for the distribution are obtained by a perturbation
analysis and they are substantiated by numerical results. There is a good
agreement between the two approaches for a wide range of parameters.
