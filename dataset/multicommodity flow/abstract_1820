Gaussian measures $\mu^{\beta,\nu}$ are associated to some stochastic 2D
hydrodynamical systems. They are of Gibbsian type and are constructed by means
of some invariant quantities of the system depending on some parameter $\beta$
(related to the 2D nature of the fluid) and the viscosity $\nu$. We prove the
existence and the uniqueness of the global flow for the stochastic viscous
system; moreover the measure $\mu^{\beta,\nu}$ is invariant for this flow and
is unique. Finally, we prove that the deterministic inviscid equation has a
$\mu^{\beta,\nu}$-stationary solution (for any $\nu>0$).
