Flow-induced configuration dynamics and scission of rodlike micelles are
studied for the first time using molecular dynamics simulations in presence of
explicit solvent and salt. Predicted dependence of tumbling frequency and
orientation distribution on shear rate S agrees with mesoscopic theories.
However, micelle stretching increases the distance between the cationic head
groups and adsorbed counter ions, which reduces electrostatic screening and
increases the overall energy Phi linearly with micelle length. Micelle scission
occurs when Phi exceeds a threshold value, independent of S.
