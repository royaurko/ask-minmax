We show, for mean curvature flows in Euclidean space, that if one of the
tangent flows at a given space-time point consists of a closed,
multiplicity-one, smoothly embedded self-similar shrinker, then it is the
unique tangent flow at that point. That is the limit of the parabolic
rescalings does not depend on the chosen sequence of rescalings. Furthermore,
given such a closed, multiplicity-one, smoothly embedded self-similarly
shrinker $\Sigma$, we show that any solution of the rescaled flow, which is
sufficiently close to $\Sigma$, with Gaussian density ratios greater or equal
to that of $\Sigma$, stays for all time close to $\Sigma$ and converges to a
possibly different self-similarly shrinking solution $\Sigma'$. The central
point in the argument is a direct application of the Simon-{\L}ojasiewicz
inequality to Huisken's monotone Gaussian integral for Mean Curvature Flow.
