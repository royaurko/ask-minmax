We investigate the preferential concentration of particles which are
neutrally buoyant but with a diameter significantly larger than the dissipation
scale of the carrier flow. Such particles are known not to behave as flow
tracers (Qureshi et al., Phys. Re. Lett. 2007) but whether they do cluster or
not remains an open question. For this purpose, we take advantage of a new
turbulence generating apparatus, the Lagrangian Exploration Module which
produces homogeneous and isotropic turbulence in a closed water flow. The flow
is seeded with neutrally buoyant particles with diameter 700\mum, corresponding
to 4.4 to 17 times the turbulent dissipation scale when the rotation frequency
of the impellers driving the flow goes from 2 Hz to 12 Hz, and spanning a range
of Stokes numbers from 1.6 to 24.2. The spatial structuration of these
inclusions is then investigated by a Voronoi tesselation analysis, as recently
proposed by Monchaux et al. (Phys. Fluids 2010), from images of particle
concentration field taken in a laser sheet at the center of the flow. No matter
the rotating frequency and subsequently the Reynolds and Stokes numbers, the
particles are found not to cluster. The Stokes number by itself is therefore
shown to be an insufficient indicator of the clustering trend in particles
laden flows.
