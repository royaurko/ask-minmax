We present new results from a direct numerical simulation of a three
dimensional homogeneous Rayleigh-Benard system (HRB), i.e. a convective cell
with an imposed linear mean temperature profile along the vertical direction.
We measure the SO(3)-decomposition of both velocity structure functions and
buoyancy terms. We give a dimensional prediction for the values of the
anisotropic scaling exponents in this Rayleigh-Benard systems. Measured scaling
does not follow dimensional estimate, while a better agreement can be found
with the anisotropic scaling of a different system, the random-Kolmogorov-flow
(RKF). Our findings support the conclusion that scaling properties of
anisotropic fluctuations are universal, i.e. independent of the forcing
mechanism sustaining the turbulent flow.
