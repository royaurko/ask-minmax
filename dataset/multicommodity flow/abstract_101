We aim to study the participant-spectator matter over a wide range of
energies of vanishing flow and masses. For this, we employed different model
parameters at central and semi-central colliding geometries. Remarkably, a
nearly mass independent nature of the participant matter was obtained at the
energy of vanishing flow. This makes it a very strong alternative candidate to
study the energy of vanishing flow. We also show that the participant matter
can also act as an indicator to study the degree of thermalization. The degree
of thermalization reached in central collisions is nearly the same for
different colliding nuclei at the energy of vanishing flow.
