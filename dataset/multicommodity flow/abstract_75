We consider viscous two-dimensional steady flows of incompressible fluids
past doubly periodic arrays of solid obstacles. In a class of such flows, the
autocorrelations for the Lagrangian observables decay in accordance with the
power law, and the Fourier spectrum is neither discrete nor absolutely
continuous. We demonstrate that spreading of the droplet of tracers in such
flows is anomalously fast. Since the flow is equivalent to the integrable
Hamiltonian system with 1 degree of freedom, this provides an example of
integrable dynamics with long-range correlations, fractal power spectrum, and
anomalous transport properties.
