Magnetic-dipolar-mode (MDM) oscillations in a quasi-2D ferrite disk show
unique dynamical symmetry properties resulting in appearance of topologically
distinct structures. Based on the magnetostatic (MS) spectral problem
solutions, in this paper we give an evidence for eigen MS power-flow-density
vortices in a ferrite disk. Due to these circular eigen power flows, the MDMs
are characterized by MS energy eigen states. It becomes evident that the reason
of stability of the vortex configurations in saturated ferrite samples is
completely different from the nature of stability in magnetically soft
cylindrical dots. We found a clear correspondence between analytically derived
MDM vortex states and numerically modeled electromagnetic vortices in quasi-2D
ferrite disks.
