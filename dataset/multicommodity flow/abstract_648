This short article describes flow parameters, numerical method, and
animations of the fluid dynamics video LES of an Inclined Jet into a Supersonic
Cross-Flow (http://hdl.handle.net/1813/11480). Helium is injected through an
inclined round jet into a supersonic air flow at Mach 3.6. The video shows 2D
contours of Mach number and magnitude of density gradient, and 3D iso-surfaces
of Helium mass-fraction and vortical structures. Large eddy simulation with the
sub-grid scale (LES-SGS) stretched vortex model of turbulent and scalar
transport captures the main flow features: bow shock, Mach disk, shear layers,
counter-rotating vortices, and large-scale structures.
