Anisotropic flow is recognized as one of the main observables providing
information on the early dynamics in heavy-ion collisions. The large elliptic
flow observed at RHIC is considered to be evidence for almost perfect liquid
behavior of the strongly coupled Quark Gluon Plasma produced in the collisions.
In this report we review our current understanding of this new state of matter
and investigate the predictions for anisotropic flow at the LHC.
