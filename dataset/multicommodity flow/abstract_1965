A principled approach to the design of program verification and con-
struction tools is applied to separation logic. The control flow is modelled by
power series with convolution as separating conjunction. A generic construction
lifts resource monoids to assertion and predicate transformer quantales. The
data flow is captured by concrete store/heap models. These are linked to the
separation algebra by soundness proofs. Verification conditions and
transformation laws are derived by equational reasoning within the predicate
transformer quantale. This separation of concerns makes an implementation in
the Isabelle/HOL proof as- sistant simple and highly automatic. The resulting
tool is correct by construction; it is explained on the classical linked list
reversal example.
