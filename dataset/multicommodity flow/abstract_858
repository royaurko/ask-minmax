We consider shock reflection which has a well-known local non-uniqueness: the
reflected shock can be either of two choices, called weak and strong. We
consider cases where existence of a global solution with weak reflected shock
has been proven, for compressible potential flow. If there was a global
strong-shock solution as well, then potential flow would be ill-posed. However,
we prove non-existence of strong-shock analogues in a natural class of
candidates.
