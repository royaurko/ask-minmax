In this paper, the dispersionless D type Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchy, i.e. a
reduction of the dispersionless two-component BKP hierarchy, is studied. The
additional symmetry flows of this herarchy are presented. These flows form an
infinite dimensional Lie algebra of Block type as well as a Lie algebra of
Hamiltonian type.
