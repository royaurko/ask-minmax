We construct the 11-dimensional lift of the known N=2 supersymmetric RG flow
solution in 4-dimensional N=8 gauged supergravity. The squashed and stretched
7-dimensional internal metric preserving SU(2) x U(1) x U(1)_R symmetry
contains an Einstein-Kahler 2-fold which is a base manifold of 5-dimensional
Sasaki-Einstein Y^{p, q} space found in 2004. The nontrivial r(transverse to
the domain wall)-dependence of the AdS_4 supergravity fields makes the
Einstein-Maxwell equations consistent not only at the critical points but also
along the supersymmetric whole RG flow connecting two critical points. With an
appropriate 3-form gauge field, we find an exact solution to the 11-dimensional
Einstein-Maxwell equations corresponding to the above lift of the SU(2) x U(1)
x U(1)_R-invariant RG flow. The particular limits of this solution give rise to
the previous solutions with SU(3) x U(1)_R or SU(2) x SU(2) x U(1)_R.
