We present a new optical Tully-Fisher (TF) investigation for a complete,
full-sky sample of 297 Sb-Sc spirals with redshifts between 4500 and 7000 km/s.
The survey was specifically designed to provide uniform, well- calibrated data
over both hemispheres. All previous TF surveys within the Supergalactic shell
(cz < 6000 km/s) have relied on matching separate data sets in the Northern and
Southern hemispheres and thus cannot attain full- sky homogeneity. Analyses of
the cosmological dipole and peculiar velocities based on these studies have
produced contradictory claims for the amplitude of the bulk flow and whether it
is generated by internal or external mass fluctuations. With Shellflow, and
further zero-point calibration of existing TF data sets, we expect a
high-accuracy detection of the bulk flow amplitude and an unambiguous
characterization of the tidal field at 6000 km/s. One of the key features of
this study is not only its careful, all-sky sample selection but the
independent duplication, by at least 2 of us, of all the data reductions. These
reductions and a first flow analysis based on the Shellflow sample alone will
be published in the Fall.
