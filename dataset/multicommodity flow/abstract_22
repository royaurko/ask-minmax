This paper presents numerical and analytical investigation of gas flow in
gas-dynamic filter - a device for cleaning gas from solid particles with
counter flow of large water particles in order to prevent their release to the
atmosphere.
  Ideal and viscous gas flows are considered. It is assumed, that gas flow is
stationary, incompressible and plane, thus in the case of ideal gas stream
function is considered, and in its terms boundary conditions are formulated. To
determine stream function Dirichlet problem for Laplace equation is solved.
Numerical solution is obtained using five-point scheme, and analytical - by
conformal mapping. It is demonstrated that numerical solution fits very
accurately with the analytical one. Then in the already known gas flow field
trajectories of particles of different size are calculated in Lagrange
formulation, taking into account dust particles as well as filtering water
drops.
  Trajectories of particles of several different sizes under different modes of
filter operation were analysed. The adequacy of real and computed flow is
demonstrated.
  Computation of the flow is done using full Navier-Stokes equations. The
possibility of formation of rotation and separation zones in the flow is
demonstrated.
