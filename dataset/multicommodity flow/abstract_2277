We present exact and analytically accurate results for the problem of a
flexible polymer chain in shear flow. Under such a flow the polymer tumbles,
and the probability distribution of the tumbling times $\tau$ of the polymer
decays exponentially as $\sim \exp(-\alpha \tau/\tau_0)$ (where $\tau_0$ is the
longest relaxation time). We show that for a Rouse chain, this nontrivial
constant $\alpha$ can be calculated in the limit of large Weissenberg number
(high shear rate) and is in excellent agreement with our simulation result of
$\alpha \simeq 0.324$. We also derive exactly the distribution functions for
the length and the orientational angles of the end-to-end vector of the
polymer.
