The features of net baryon productions and collective flow in relativistic
heavy-ion collisions at energies reached at the CERN Large Hadron Collider
(LHC), BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), CERN Super Proton
Synchrotron (SPS) and BNL Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) with the model
of Non-Uniform Flow Model(NUFM) are systematically studied in this paper.
Especially we predict the feature of net baryon productions and collective flow
at LHC $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=5500 GeV basing on the detailed study of that at RHIC
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=62.4 and 200GeV. The dependencies of the features of baryon
stopping and collective flow on the collision energies and centralities are
investigated.
