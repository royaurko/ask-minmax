Motivated by cell adhesion in hydrodynamic flow, here we study bond formation
between a spherical Brownian particle in linear shear flow carrying receptors
for ligands covering the boundary wall. We derive the appropriate Langevin
equation which includes multiplicative noise due to position-dependent mobility
functions resulting from the Stokes equation. We present a numerical scheme
which allows to simulate it with high accuracy for all model parameters,
including shear rate and three parameters describing receptor geometry
(distance, size and height of the receptor patches). In the case of homogeneous
coating, the mean first passage time problem can be solved exactly. In the case
of position-resolved receptor-ligand binding, we identify different scaling
regimes and discuss their biological relevance.
