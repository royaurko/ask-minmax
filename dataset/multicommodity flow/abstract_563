Recent observations suggested that star formation quenching in galaxies is
related to galaxy structure. Here we propose a new mechanism to explain the
physical origin of this correlation. We assume that while quiescent galaxies
are maintained quenched by a feedback mechanism, cooling flows in the hot halo
gas can still develop intermittently. We study cooling flows in a large suite
of around 90 hydrodynamic simulations of an isolated galaxy group, and find
that the flow development depends significantly on the gravitational potential
well in the central galaxy. If the galaxy's gravity is not strong enough,
cooling flows result in a central cooling catastrophe, supplying cold gas and
feeding star formation to galactic bulges. When the bulge grows prominent
enough, compressional heating starts to offset radiative cooling and maintains
cooling flows in a long-term hot mode without producing cooling catastrophe.
Our model thus describes a self-limited growth channel for galaxy bulges, and
naturally explains the connection between quenching and bulge prominence. In
particular, we explicitly demonstrate that $M_{*}/R_{\rm eff}^{1.5}$ is a good
structural predictor of quenching. We further find that the gravity from the
central supermassive black hole also affects the bimodal fate of cooling flows,
and predict a more general quenching predictor to be $M_{\rm
bh}^{1.6}M_{*}/R_{\rm eff}^{1.5}$, which may be tested in future observational
studies.
