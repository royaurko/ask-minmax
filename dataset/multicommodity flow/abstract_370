We calculate the flux-flow resistivity of the Josephson vortex lattice in a
layered superconductor taking into account both the inter-plane and in-plane
dissipation channels. We consider the limiting cases of small fields (isolated
vortices) and high fields (overlapping vortices). In the case of the dominating
in-plane dissipation, typical for high-temperature superconductors, the field
dependence of flux-flow resistivity is characterized by {\it three} distinct
regions. As usual, at low fields the flux-flow resistivity grows linearly with
field. When the Josephson vortices start to overlap the flux-flow resistivity
crosses over to the regime of {\it quadratic} field dependence. Finally, at
very high fields the flux-flow resistivity saturates at the c-axis
quasiparticle resistivity. The intermediate quadratic regime indicates dominant
role of the in-plane dissipation mechanism. Shape of the field dependence of
the flux-flow resistivity can be used to extract both components of the
quasiparticle
