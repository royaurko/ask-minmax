The dynamics of partons and hadrons in relativistic nucleus-nucleus
collisions is analyzed within the novel Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD)
transport approach, which is based on a dynamical quasiparticle model for the
partonic phase (DQPM) including a dynamical hadronization scheme. The PHSD
model reproduces a large variety of observables from SPS to LHC energies, e.g.
the quark-number scaling of elliptic flow, transverse mass and rapidity spectra
of charged hadrons, dilepton spectra, open and hidden charm production,
collective flow coefficients etc., which are associated with the observation of
a sQGP. The highlights of the latest results on collective flow are presented
and open questions/perspectives are discussed.
