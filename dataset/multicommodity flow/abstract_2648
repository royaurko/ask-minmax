How to macroscopically control the flow of heat at will is up to now a
challenge, which, however, is very important for human life since heat flow is
a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature. Inspired by intelligent electronic
components or intelligent materials, here we demonstrate, analytically and
numerically, a unique class of intelligent bifunctional thermal metamaterials
called thermal cloak-concentrators, which can automatically change from a cloak
(concentrator) to a concentrator (cloak) when the applied temperature field
decreases (increases). For future experimental realization, the behavior is
also confirmed by assembling homogeneous isotropic materials according to the
effective medium theory. The underlying mechanism originates from the effect of
nonlinearity in thermal conduction. This work not only makes it possible to
achieve a switchable Seebeck effect, but also offers guidance both for
macroscopic manipulation of heat flow at will and for the design of similar
intelligent multifunctional metamaterials in optics, electromagnetics,
acoustics, or elastodynamics.
