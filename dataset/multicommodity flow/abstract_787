The article describes various aspects of mathematical modeling of fluid
flows, both in general and with reference to hydraulic machinery. The article
reviews historical development of corresponding methods of mathematical
modeling. Implementation of these aspects in modern commercial CFD software
tools is described together with advantages and disadvantages of implemented
methods. The conclusion is drawn concerning possibilities of computation of
fluid flows nowadays.
