The constraint imposed by magnetic helicity conservation on the alpha effect
is considered for both magnetically and flow dominated self-organizing plasmas.
Direct numerical simulations are presented for a dominant contribution to the
alpha effect, which can be cast in the functional form of a total divergence of
an averaged helicity flux, called the helicity-flux-driven alpha ( H$\alpha$)
effect. Direct numerical simulations of the H$\alpha$ effect are prese nted for
two examples---the magnetically dominated toroidal plasma unstable to tearing
modes, and the flow-dominated accretion disk.
