We analyze a possible extension of Gioia and Chakraborty's momentum transfer
model of friction in steady turbulent pipe flows (Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 044502
(2006)) to the case of time and/or space dependent turbulent flows. The end
result is an expression for the stress at the wall as the sum of an steady and
a dynamic component. The steady part is obtained by using the instantaneous
velocity in the expression for the stress at the wall of a stationary flow. The
unsteady part is a weighted average over the history of the flow acceleration,
with a weighting function similar to that proposed by Vardy and Brown (Journal
of Sound and Vibration 259, 1011 (2003); ibid. 270, 233 (2004)), but naturally
including the effect of spatial derivatives of the mean flow, as in the Brunone
model (B. Brunone et al., J. of Water Resources Planning and Management 236
(2000)).
