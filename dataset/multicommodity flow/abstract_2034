We extend the convergence analysis for methods solving PDE-constrained
optimal control problems containing both discrete and continuous control
decisions based on relaxation and rounding strategies to the class of first
order semilinear hyperbolic systems in one space dimension. The results are
obtained by novel a-priori estimates for the size of the relaxation gap based
on the characteristic flow, fixed-point arguments and particular regularity
theory for such mixed-integer control problems. As an application we consider a
relaxation model for optimal flux switching control in conservation laws
motivated by traffic flow problems.
