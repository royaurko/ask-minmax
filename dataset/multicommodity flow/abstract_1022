We prove that, in a two-dimensional strip, a steady flow of an ideal
incompressible fluid with no stationary point and tangential boundary
conditions is a shear flow. The same conclusion holds for a bounded steady flow
in a half-plane. The proofs are based on the study of the geometric properties
of the streamlines of the flow and on one-dimensional symmetry results for
solutions of some semilinear elliptic equations. Some related rigidity results
of independent interest are also shown in n-dimensional slabs in any dimension
n.
