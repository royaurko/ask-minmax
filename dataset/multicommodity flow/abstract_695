Making use of recently released data on dihadron correlations by the STAR
collaboration, I analyze the long-range ("ridge-like") part of these data and
show that the dependence on both transverse momentum as well as orientation
with respect to the event plane are consistent with correlations expected from
only collective flow. In combination with previously analyzed
centrality-dependent data, they provide strong evidence that only collective
flow effects are present at large relative pseudorapidy. In contrast, by
analyzing a "background subtracted" signal, the contributors presenting the new data
concluded that the ridge-like part of the measured correlation could not in
fact be entirely generated from collective flow of the medium. I explain the
discrepancy and illustrate some pitfalls of using the ZYAM prescription to
remove flow background.
