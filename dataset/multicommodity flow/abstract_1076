De Giorgi conjectured in 1979 that if a sequence of functionals converges in
the sense of Gamma-convergence to a limiting functional, then the corresponding
gradient flows will converge as well after changing timescale appropriately. It
is shown that this conjecture holds true for a rather wide kind of functionals.
