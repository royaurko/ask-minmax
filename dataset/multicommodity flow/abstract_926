We study the temperature field and the resulting flow pattern in the vicinity
of a heated metal-capped Janus particle. If its thickness exceeds about 10 nm,
the cap forms an isotherm and the flow pattern comprises a quadrupolar term
that decays with the square of the inverse distance 1/r^2. For much thinner
caps the velocity varies as 1/r^3. These findings could be relevant for
collective effects in dense suspensions and for the circular tracer motion
observed recently in the vicinity of a tethered Janus particle.
