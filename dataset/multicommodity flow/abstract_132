The impact of anisotropic dynamic models for applications to LES of
compressible flows is assessed in the framework of a numerical model based on
high order discontinuous finite elements. The projections onto lower
dimensional subspaces associated to lower degree basis function are used as LES
filter, along the lines proposed in Variational Multiscale templates.
Comparisons with DNS results available in the literature for channel flows at
Mach numbers 0.2, 0.7 and 1.5 show clearly that the anisotropic model is able
to reproduce well some key features of the flow, especially close to the wall,
where the flow anisotropy plays a major role.
