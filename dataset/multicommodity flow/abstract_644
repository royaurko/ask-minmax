The nanoscale fluctuation dynamics of semi dilute high molecular weight
polymer solutions of Polyethylenoxide (PEO) in D2O under non-equilibrium flow
conditions were studied by the neutron spin-echo technique. The sample cell was
in contraction flow geometry and provided a pressure driven flow with a high
elongational component that stretched the polymers most efficiently. The
experiments suggest that the mobility on the scale of a few monomers,
comparable to the Kuhn segment length, becomes highly anisotropic and is
enhanced perpendicular to the flow direction. Diffraction data show a weak
structural correlation along the chains on a length scale of about 17
Angstroems, which might be related to the Kuhn length in this system.
