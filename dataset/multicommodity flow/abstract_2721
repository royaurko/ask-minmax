The completeness and reliability of the DENIS IJK survey and the EDSGC
(derived from the COSMOS scans of USKT plates) are obtained by detailed
cross-identifications and systematic visual inspections of conflictual
classifications. The DENIS galaxy extraction turns out to be over 95% complete
and reliable out to I < 16, while the COSMOS/EDSGC galaxy catalogue is less
than 80% complete and reliable at B_J = 17.5, and even less than 10% complete
at B_J < 14.5.
  Spectroscopic followups of DENIS and the similar Near-IR 2MASS survey are
described: 1) a redshift survey of 120,000 galaxies using the 6dF robotic
multi-fiber spectrograph, currently under construction at the UKST, and for
which a total of 300 nights are guaranteed for 2001-2003, 2) a peculiar
velocity survey of 12,000 early-type galaxies with the 6dF, and 3) the DENIS-HI
peculiar velocity survey of 5000 inclined spirals visible from Nancay (delta >
-38 deg), which has just begun. The DENIS-HI and 6dF peculiar velocity samples
will have the strong advantage of covering entire regions of the southern sky,
and combined, will multiply by 10 and 4 respectively the projected and space
number densities of objects in the Southern sky. These two surveys should thus
provide considerably more accurate estimates of the bulk flow,
Omega_matter^{0.6}/bias, Omega_matter itself, and the primordial density
fluctuation spectrum.
