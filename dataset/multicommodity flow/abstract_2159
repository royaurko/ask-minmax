Hysteresis has been observed in a study of the transition between laminar
flow and vortex shedding in a quasi-two dimensional system. The system is a
vertical, rapidly flowing soap film which is penetrated by a rod oriented
perpendicular to the film plane. Our experiments show that the transition from
laminar flow to a periodic K\'arm\'an vortex street can be hysteretic, i.e.
vortices can survive at velocities lower than the velocity needed to generate
them.
