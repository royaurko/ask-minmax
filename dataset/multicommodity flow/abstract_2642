We present a hybrid lattice Boltzmann algorithm for the simulation of flow
glass-forming fluids, characterized by slow structural relaxation, at the level
of the Navier-Stokes equation. The fluid is described in terms of a nonlinear
integral constitutive equation, relating the stress tensor locally to the
history of flow. As an application, we present results for an integral
nonlinear Maxwell model that combines the effects of (linear) viscoelasticity
and (nonlinear) shear thinning. We discuss the transient dynamics of
velocities, shear stresses, and normal stress differences in planar
pressure-driven channel flow, after switching on (startup) and off (cessation)
of the driving pressure. This transient dynamics depends nontrivially on the
channel width due to an interplay between hydrodynamic momentum diffusion and
slow structural relaxation.
