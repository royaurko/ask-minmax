In the framework of the variational principle there are introduced canonical
variables describing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows of general type without
any restrictions for invariants of the motion. It is shown that the velocity
representation of the Clebsch type introduced by means of the variational
principle with constraints is equivalent to the representation following from
the generalization of the Weber transformation for the case of arbitrary MHD
flows. The integrals of motion and local invariants for MHD are under
examination. It is proved that there exists generalization of the Ertel
invariant. It is expressed in terms of generalized vorticity field (discussed
earlier by Vladimirov and Moffatt (V. A. Vladimirov, H. K. Moffatt, J. Fl.
Mech., vol. 283, pp.~125--139, 1995) for the incompressible case). The
generalized vorticity presents the frozen-in field for the barotropic and
isentropic flows and therefore for these flows there exists generalized
helicity invariant. This result generalizes one obtained by Vladimirov and
Moffatt in the cited work for the incompressible fluid. It is shown that to
each invariant of the conventional hydrodynamics corresponds MHD invariant and
therefore our approach allows correct limit transition to the conventional
hydrodynamic case. The additional advantage of the approach proposed enables
one to deal with discontinuous flows, including all types of possible breaks.
