We propose a simple diatomic system trapped inside an optical cavity to
control the energy flow between two thermal baths. Through the action of the
baths the system is driven to a non-equilibrium steady state. Using the Large
Deviation theory and full counting statistics we show that the energy current
flowing between the two baths is dramatically different depending on the
symmetry of the atomic states. Here we present a deterministic scheme to
prepare symmetric and antisymmetric atomic states with the use of external
driving fields, thus implementing an atomic control switch for the energy flow.
