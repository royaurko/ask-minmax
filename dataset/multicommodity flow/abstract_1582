A search for colour reconnection effects in hadronic decays of W pairs is
performed with the L3 detector at centre-of-mass energies between 189 and 209
GeV. The analysis is based on the study of the particle flow between jets
associated to the same W boson and between two different W bosons in qqqq
events. The ratio of particle yields in the different interjet regions is found
to be sensitive to colour reconnection effects implemented in some
hadronisation models. The data are compared to different models with and
without such effects. An extreme scenario of colour reconnection is ruled out.
