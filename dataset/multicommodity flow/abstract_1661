We discuss characteristic experimental signatures related to the mechanism of
DCC formation triggered by the chiral U(1) anomaly in relativistic heavy ion
collisions. We predict an enhancement of the fraction of neutral pions compared
with all pions in the direction perpendicular to the scattering plane. To
quantify the effect on the angular distribution of neutral pions, we compute
the elliptic flow parameter $v_2$ as a function of the transverse momentum. We
find values of order -0.05 at small momenta for neutral pions. We also compute
the $v_2$ parameter for inclusive photons, which is easier to measure, and
confirmed that the negative a few percent effect prevails in this observable.
