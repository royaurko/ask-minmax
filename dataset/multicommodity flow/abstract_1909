In our companion paper [1], an information identity decomposition has been
derived, which can be interpreted as a law of conservation of information flows
in feedback systems. In this paper, we further investigate this decomposition
result when specified to linear time-invariant(LTI) systems connected with
additive white Gaussian noise(AWGN) channels. It is shown that the quantities
in the decomposition are characterized in sensitivity function and the law of
conservation is verified.
