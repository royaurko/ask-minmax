We construct a solution to inverse mean curvature flow on an asymptotically
hyperbolic 3-manifold which does not have the convergence properties needed in
order to prove a Penrose--type inequality. This contrasts sharply with the
asymptotically flat case. The main idea consists in combining inverse mean
curvature flow with work done by Shi--Tam regarding boundary behavior of
compact manifolds. Assuming the Penrose inequality holds, we also derive a
nontrivial inequality for functions on $S^2$.
