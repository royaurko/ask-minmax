The leading-order far-field scattered flow produced by a particle in a
parallel-wall channel under creeping flow conditions has a form of the
parabolic velocity field driven by a 2D dipolar pressure distribution. We show
that in a system of hydrodynamically interacting particles, the pressure
dipoles contribute to the macroscopic suspension flow in a similar way as the
induced electric dipoles contribute to the electrostatic displacement field.
Using this result we derive macroscopic equations governing suspension
transport under the action of a lateral force, a lateral torque or a
macroscopic pressure gradient in the channel. The matrix of linear transport
coefficients in the constitutive relations linking the external forcing to the
particle and fluid fluxes satisfies the Onsager reciprocal relation. The
transport coefficients are evaluated for square and hexagonal periodic arrays
of fixed and freely suspended particles, and a simple approximation in a
Clausius-Mossotti form is proposed for the channel permeability coefficient. We
also find explicit expressions for evaluating the periodic Green's functions
for Stokes flow between two parallel walls.
