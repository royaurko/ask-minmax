In this article we challenge the claim that the previously proposed
variational method to obtain flow solutions for generalized Newtonian fluids in
circular tubes and plane slits is exact only for power law fluids. We also
defend the theoretical foundation and formalism of the method which is based on
minimizing the total stress through the application of the Euler-Lagrange
principle.
