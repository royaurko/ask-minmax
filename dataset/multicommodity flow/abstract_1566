We show that an invariant surface allows to construct the Jacobi vector field
along a geodesic and construct the formula for the normal component of the
Jacobi field. If a geodesic is the transversal intersection of two invariant
surfaces (such situation we have, for example, if the geodesic is hyperbolic),
then we can construct a fundamental solution of the the Jacobi-Hill equation.
This is done for quadratically integrable geodesic flows.
