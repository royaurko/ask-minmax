Sgr A* is probably the supermassive black hole being investigated most
extensively due to its proximity. Several theoretical models for its steady
state emission have been proposed in the past two decades. Both the
radiative-inefficient accretion flow and the jet model have been shown to well
explain the observed spectral energy distribution. Faraday rotation measure
(RM) has been unambiguously measured at submillimeter wavelength, but has only
been tested against the accretion flow model. Here we first calculate the RM
based on the jet model and find that the predicted value is two orders of
magnitude lower than the measured value. We then include an additional
contribution from the accretion flow in front of the jet and show that the
measured RM may be reconciled with the model under some tight constraints. The
main constraint is that the inclination angle should be greater than $\sim
73^{\circ}$. But this requirement is not consistent with an existing
observational estimate of the inclination angle.
