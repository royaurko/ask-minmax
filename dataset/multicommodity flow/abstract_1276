We show that a stochastic flow which is generated by a stochastic
differential equation on $\R^d$ with bounded volatility has a random attractor
provided that the drift component in the direction towards the origin is larger
than a certain strictly positive constant $\beta$ outside a large ball. Using a
similar approach, we provide a lower bound for the linear growth rate of the
inner radius of the image of a large ball under a stochastic flow in case the
drift component in the direction away from the origin is larger than a certain
strictly positive constant $\beta$ outside a large ball. To prove the main
result we use chaining techniques in order to control the growth of the
diameter of subsets of the state space under the flow.
