We study the holographic flow of anomalous conductivities induced by gauge
and gravitational Chern-Simons terms. We find that the contribution from the
gauge Chern-Simons term gives rise to a flow that can be interpreted in terms
of an effective, cutoff dependent chemical potential. In contrast the
contribution of the gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons term is just the
temperature squared and does not flow.
