We analyse second order (in Riemann curvature) geometric flows
(un-normalised) on locally homogeneous three manifolds and look for specific
features through the solutions (analytic whereever possible, otherwise
numerical) of the evolution equations. Several novelties appear in the context
of scale factor evolution, fixed curves, phase portraits, approaches to
singular metrics, isotropisation and curvature scalar evolution. The
distinguishing features linked to the presence of the second order term in the
flow equation are pointed out. Throughout the article, we compare the results
obtained, with the corresponding results for un-normalized Ricci flows.
