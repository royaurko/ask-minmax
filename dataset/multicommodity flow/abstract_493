Integrable systems are derived from inelastic flows of timelike, spacelike,
and null curves in 2- and 3- dimensional Minkowski space. The derivation uses a
Lorentzian version of a geometrical moving frame method which is known to yield
the modified Korteveg-de Vries (mKdV) equation and the nonlinear Schrodinger
(NLS) equation in 2- and 3- dimensional Euclidean space, respectively. In
2-dimensional Minkowski space, timelike/spacelike inelastic curve flows are
shown to yield the defocusing mKdV equation and its bi-Hamiltonian
integrability structure, while inelastic null curve flows are shown to give
rise to Burgers' equation and its symmetry integrability structure. In
3-dimensional Minkowski space, the complex defocusing mKdV equation and the NLS
equation along with their bi-Hamiltonian integrability structures are obtained
from timelike inelastic curve flows, whereas spacelike inelastic curve flows
yield an interesting variant of these two integrable equations in which complex
numbers are replaced by hyperbolic (split-complex) numbers.
