Elliptic flow of charm hadrons is investigated based on the quark coalescence
model. Due to the large difference between the charm quark and light quark
masses, hadrons containing both light and charm quarks show a qualitatively
different $v_2(p_\perp)$ from hadrons containing only light quarks. Simple
relations are proposed to infer quark elliptic flow from those of hadrons. The
effects of the finite momentum spread of hadron wavefunctions are also studied,
and are found to be small for charm hadrons.
