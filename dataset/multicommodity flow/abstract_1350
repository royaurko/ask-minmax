Flexible broad leaves are thought to reconfigure in the wind and water to
reduce the drag forces that act upon them. Simple mathematical models of a
flexible beam immersed in a two-dimensional flow will also exhibit this
behavior. What is less understood is how the mechanical properties of a leaf in
a three-dimensional flow will passively allow roll up into a cone shape and
reduce both drag and vortex induced oscillations. In this fluid dynamics video,
the flows around the leaves are compared with those of simplified sheets using
3D numerical simulations and physical models. For some reconfiguration shapes,
large forces and oscillations due to strong vortex shedding are produced. In
the actual leaf, a stable recirculation zone is formed within the wake of the
reconfigured cone. In physical and numerical models that reconfigure into
cones, a similar recirculation zone is observed with both rigid and flexible
tethers. These results suggest that the three-dimensional cone structure in
addition to flexibility is significant to both the reduction of vortex-induced
vibrations and the forces experienced by the leaf.
