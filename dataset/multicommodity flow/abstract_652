We investigate the organization of traffic flow on preexisting uni- and
bidirectional ant trails. Our investigations comprise a theoretical as well as
an empirical part. We propose minimal models of uni- and bi-directional traffic
flow implemented as cellular automata. Using these models, the spatio-temporal
organization of ants on the trail is studied. Based on this, some unusual flow
characteristics which differ from those known from other traffic systems, like
vehicular traffic or pedestrians dynamics, are found. The theoretical
investigations are supplemented by an empirical study of bidirectional traffic
on a trail of Leptogenys processionalis. Finally, we discuss some plausible
implications of our observations from the perspective of flow optimization.
