Collective flow of Lambda hyperons in heavy ion reactions at SIS energies is
investigated. It is found that a $\Lambda$ mean field constructed on the basis
of the quark model leads to a good description of the experimental data of the
in-plane transverse flow of $\Lambda$'s. The attractive mean field can also
give rise to an additional "virtual" $\Lambda$ radial flow directed inwards,
which is reflected by a "concave" structure of the transverse mass spectrum of
the $\Lambda$ hyperons emitted at midrapidity. The $\Lambda$ radial flow is
found to exhibit a strong mass dependence: The flow is visible in the Ni+Ni
system, but is strongly reduced in the system of Au on Au.
