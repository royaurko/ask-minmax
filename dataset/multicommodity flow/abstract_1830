The effect of some possible non standard WIMP velocity distributions, like
the Debris Flows recently proposed, on the direct dark matter detection rates
is investigated. We find that such distributions may be deciphered from the
data, especially if the time variation of the event rates due to the annual
motion of the Earth is observed
