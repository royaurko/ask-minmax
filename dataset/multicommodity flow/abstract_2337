The sensitivity of the black hole spectrum when introducing short distance
dispersion is studied in the context of atomic Bose condensates. By considering
flows characterized by several length scales, we show that, while the spectrum
remains remarkably Planckian, the temperature is no longer fixed by the surface
gravity. Rather it is determined by the average of the flow gradient across the
horizon over an interval fixed by the healing length and the surface gravity,
as if the horizon were broadened. This remains valid as long as the flow does
not induce nonadiabatic effects that produce oscillations or some parametric
amplification of the flux.
