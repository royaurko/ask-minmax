We have determined the response time of dilute electrorheological fluids (ER)
in drag flow, and in the quiescent state from the dynamic dielectric response.
The dependence of the response times on the electric field strength, and the
shear rate were investigated. In the case of ER fluids in drag flow, the
response times were also determined from the stress response of the fluid
measured simultaneously with the dielectric properties. A comparison was made
between the dielectric and rheological response times measured at the same
conditions. The dielectric permittivity of the quiescent ER fluid was estimated
on the basis of formulas derived from the Clausius-Mossotti equation. This
simple theoretical model was extended and applied to ER fluids under shear to
evaluate the experimental dielectric results.
