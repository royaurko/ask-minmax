In this paper we systematically apply the mathematical structures by
time-evolving measures developed in a previous work to the macroscopic modeling
of pedestrian flows. We propose a discrete-time Eulerian model, in which the
space occupancy by pedestrians is described via a sequence of Radon positive
measures generated by a push-forward recursive relation. We assume that two
fundamental aspects of pedestrian behavior rule the dynamics of the system: On
the one hand, the will to reach specific targets, which determines the main
direction of motion of the walkers; on the other hand, the tendency to avoid
crowding, which introduces interactions among the individuals. The resulting
model is able to reproduce several experimental evidences of pedestrian flows
pointed out in the specialized literature, being at the same time much easier
to handle, from both the analytical and the numerical point of view, than other
models relying on nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. This makes it
suitable to address two-dimensional applications of practical interest, chiefly
the motion of pedestrians in complex domains scattered with obstacles.
