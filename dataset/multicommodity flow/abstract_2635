Using a new implementation of ring-diagram helioseismology, we ascertain the
strength and spatial scale of convective flows throughout the near-surface
shear layer. Our ring-diagram technique employs highly overlapped analysis
regions and an efficient method of 3D inversion to measure convective motions
with a resolution that ranges from $3 \ \mathrm{Mm}$ at the surface to $80 \
\mathrm{Mm}$ at the base of the layer. We find the rms horizontal flow speed to
peak at $427 \ \mathrm{m \ s^{-1}}$ at the photosphere and fall to a minimum of
$124 \ \mathrm{m \ s^{-1}}$ between $20 \ \mathrm{Mm}$ and $30 \ \mathrm{Mm}$.
From the velocity amplitude and the dominant horizontal scales seen at each
depth, we infer the level of rotational influence on convection to be low near
the surface, but transition to a significant level at the base of the
near-surface shear layer with a Rossby number varying between 2.2 to as low as
0.1.
