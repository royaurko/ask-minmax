In this work, we propose an alternative stochastic model for the fundamental
diagram of traffic flow with minimal number of parameters. Our approach is
based on a mesoscopic viewpoint of the traffic system in terms of the dynamics
of vehicle speed transitions. A key feature of the present approach lies in its
stochastic nature which makes it possible to describe not only the
flow-concentration relation, the so-called fundamental diagram in traffic
engineering, but also its variance -- an important ingredient in the observed
data of traffic flow. As the model can be seen as a derivative of the Boltzmann
equation with a discrete speed spectrum, its mathematics is significantly
simplifies and therefore, facilitates the study of its physical content through
the analytic solutions. The model parameters are then adjusted to reproduce the
observed traffic flow on the "23 de maio" highway in the Brazilian city of Sao
Paulo, where both the fundamental diagram and its variance are reasonably
reproduced. Despite its simplicity, we argue that the current model provides an
alternative description for the fundamental diagram in the study of traffic
flow.
