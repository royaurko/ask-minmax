We report on the pseudo-rapidity dependence of the charged particle
anisotropic flow in Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV. The measurement is done over
a wide range of pseudo-rapidity, |\eta|<5 using the forward detectors of ALICE
at the LHC. Results are obtained from two- and multi-particle correlation
techniques with the latter being less sensitive to non-flow effects. Elliptic
flow longitudinal scaling, comparison with RHIC data and AMPT model
calculations for the LHC are discussed.
