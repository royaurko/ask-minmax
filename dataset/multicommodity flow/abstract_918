Steady-state advective accretion flows in the presence of thermal conduction
are studied. All three components of velocity in a spherical coordinates are
considered and the flow displays both inflowing and outflowing regions
according to our similarity solutions. Thermal conductivity provides
latitudinal energy transport and so, the flow rotates more slowly and becomes
hotter with increasing thermal conductivity coefficient. We also show that
opening angle of the outflow region decreases as thermal conduction becomes
stronger.
