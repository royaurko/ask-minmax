If the specific angular momentum of accretion gas at large radius is small
compared to the local Keplerian value, one usually believes that there exists a
"circularization radius" beyond which the angular momentum of accretion flow is
almost a constant while within which a disk is formed and the angular momentum
roughly follows the Keplerian distribution. In this paper, we perform numerical
simulations to study whether the picture above is correct in the context of hot
accretion flow. We find that for a steady accretion flow, the "circularization
radius" does not exist and the angular momentum profile will be smooth
throughout the flow. However, for transient accretion systems, such as the
tidal disruption of a star by a black hole, a "turning point" should exist in
the radial profile of the angular momentum, which is conceptually similar to
the "circularization radius". At this radius, the viscous timescale equals the
life time of the accretion event. The specific angular momentum is close to
Keplerian within this radius, while beyond this radius the angular momentum is
roughly constant.
