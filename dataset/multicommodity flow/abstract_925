Strong existence and pathwise uniqueness of solutions with
$L^{\infty}$-vorticity of 2D stochastic Euler equations is proved. The noise is
multiplicative and involves first derivatives. A Lagrangian approach is
implemented, where a stochastic flow solving a nonlinear flow equation is
constructed. Stability under regularization is also proved.
