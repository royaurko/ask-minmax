This paper concerns the validity of the Prandtl boundary layer theory for
steady, incompressible Navier-Stokes flows over a rotating disk. We prove that
the Navier Stokes flows can be decomposed into Euler and Prandtl flows in the
inviscid limit. In so doing, we develop a new set of function spaces and prove
several embedding theorems which capture the interaction between the Prandtl
scaling and the geometry of our domain.
