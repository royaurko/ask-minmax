We have obtained a new set of parameters in a multiphase transport (AMPT)
model that are able to describe both the charged particle multiplicity density
and elliptic flow measured in Au+Au collisions at center of mass energy
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), although
they still give somewhat softer transverse momentum spectra. We then use the
model to predict the triangular flow due to fluctuations in the initial
collision geometry and study its effect relative to those from other harmonic
components of anisotropic flows on the di-hadron azimuthal correlations in both
central and mid-central collisions.
