We propose a quantitative model of ion temperature gradient driven turbulence
in toroidal magnetized plasmas. In this model, the turbulence is regulated by
zonal flows, i.e. mode saturation occurs by a zonal-flow-mediated energy
cascade ("shearing"), and zonal flow amplitude is controlled by nonlinear
decay. Our model is tested in detail against numerical simulations to confirm
that both its assumptions and predictions are satisfied. Key results include
(1) a sensitivity of the nonlinear zonal flow response to the energy content of
the linear instability, (2) a persistence of zonal-flow-regulated saturation at
high temperature gradients, (3) a physical explanation of the nonlinear
saturation process in terms of secondary and tertiary instabilities, and (4)
dependence of heat flux in terms of dimensionless parameters.
