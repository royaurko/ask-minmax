We investigate three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics turbulence in the
presence of both a large-scale velocity and non-uniform magnetic field. By
assuming a turbulence driven by an external forcing with both helical and
non-helical spectra, we investigate the combined effect of these two shears on
turbulence intensity and turbulent transport represented by turbulent
diffusivities (turbulent viscosity, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ effect) in analogy
with Reynolds. We show that turbulence viscosity and diffusivity are quenched
for strong flow shear and magnetic field in the limits of weak and strong
magnetic field, respectively. For a weak flow shear, we further show that the
magnetic shear increases the turbulence intensity while decreasing the
turbulent transport. In the presence of a strong flow shear, the effect of the
magnetic shear is found to oppose the effect of flow shear (which reduces
turbulence due to shear stabilization) by enhancing turbulence and transport,
thereby weakening the strong quenching by flow shear stabilization. In the case
of a strong magnetic field (compared to flow shear), magnetic shear increases
turbulence intensity and quenches turbulent transport.
