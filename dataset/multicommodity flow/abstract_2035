In this technical report we study the convergence of Parareal for 2D
incompressible flow around a cylinder for different viscosities. Two methods
are used as fine integrator: backward Euler and a fractional step method. It is
found that Parareal converges better for the implicit Euler, likely because it
under-resolves the fine-scale dynamics as a result of numerical diffusion.
