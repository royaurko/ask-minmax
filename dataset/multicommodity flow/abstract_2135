We investigate the observed correlation between the 2--10 keV X-ray
luminosity (in unit of the Eddington luminosity; $l_X \equiv L_X/L_{Edd}$) and
the photon index ($\Gamma$) of the X-ray spectrum for both black hole X-ray
binaries (BHBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We construct a large sample,
with $10^{-9} < l_X < 10^{-1}$. We find that $\Gamma$ is positively and
negatively correlated with $l_X$ when $l_X > 10^{-3}$ and $10^{-6.5} < l_X <
10^{-3}$ respectively, while $\Gamma$ is nearly a constant when $l_X <
10^{-6.5}$. We explain the above correlation in the framework of a coupled hot
accretion flow -- jet model. The radio emission always come from the jet while
the X-ray emission comes from the accretion flow and jet when $l_X$ is above
and below $10^{-6.5}$, respectively. More specifically, we assume that with the
increase of mass accretion rate, the hot accretion flow develops into a clumpy
and further a disc -- corona two-phase structure because of thermal
instability. We argue that such kind of two-phase accretion flow can explain
the observed positive correlation.
