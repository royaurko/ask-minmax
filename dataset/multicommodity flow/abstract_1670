Nonlinear relations among frequencies and phases in modulational instability
of circularly polarized Alfven waves are discussed, within the context of one
dimensional, dissipation-less, unforced fluid system. We show that generation
of phase coherence is a natural consequence of the modulational instability of
Alfven waves. Furthermore, we quantitatively evaluate intensity of wave-wave
interaction by using bi-coherence, and also by computing energy flow among wave
modes, and demonstrate that the energy flow is directly related to the phase
coherence generation.
