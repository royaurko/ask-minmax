Motivated by the renormalization group (RG) approach to $c=0$ matrix model of
Bre\'zin and Zinn-Justin, we develop a RG scheme for $c=1$ matrix model on a
circle and analyze how the two coupling constants in double scaling limit with
critical exponent flow with the change in length scale. The RG flow equations
produce a non-trivial fixed point with the correct string susceptibility
exponent and the expected logarithmic scaling violation of the $c=1$ theory.
The change of world-sheet free energy with length scale indicates a sign change
as we increase the temperature, indicating a phase transition due to liberation
of the non-singlet states. At low temperature, the RG analysis also lead to
T-duality of the singlet sector free energy. The RG flow to the $c=1$ fixed
point can be understood as the decay of unstable $D0$-branes with open string
rolling tachyon to the 2D closed string theory described by the end point of
the flow. The amplitude of the decay is extracted from the change of the
world-sheet free energy described by the RG process and is in accordance with
the prediction from boundary Liouville theory.
