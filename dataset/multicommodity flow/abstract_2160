We analyze the behavior of a suspension of rigid rod-like particles in shear
flow using a modified version of the Doi model, and construct diagrams for
phase coexistence under conditions of constant imposed stress and constant
imposed strain rate, among paranematic, flow-aligning nematic, and log-rolling
nematic states. We calculate the effective constitutive relations that would be
measured through the regime of phase separation into shear bands. We calculate
phase coexistence by examining the stability of interfacial steady states and
find a wide range of possible ``phase'' behaviors.
