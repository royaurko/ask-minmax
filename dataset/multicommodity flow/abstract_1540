Although traffic simulations with cellular-automata models give meaningful
results compared with empirical data, highway traffic requires a more detailed
description of the elementary dynamics. Based on recent empirical results we
present a modified Nagel-Schreckenberg cellular automaton model which
incorporates both a slow-to-start and an anticipation rule, which takes into
account especially brake lights. The focus in this article lies on the
comparison with empirical single-vehicle data.
