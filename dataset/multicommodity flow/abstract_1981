In this paper we consider the Allen-Cahn equation perturbed by a stochastic
flux term and prove a large deviation principle. Using an associated stochastic
flow of diffeomorphisms the equation can be transformed to a parabolic partial
differential equation with random coefficients. We use this structure and first
provide a large deviation principle for stochastic flows in function spaces
with H\"older-continuity in time. Second, we use a continuity argument and
deduce a large deviation principle for the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation.
