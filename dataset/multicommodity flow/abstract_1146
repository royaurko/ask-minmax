We present the critical conditions for hot trans-fast magnetohydrodynamical
(MHD) flows in a stationary and axisymmetric black-hole magnetosphere. To
accrete onto the black hole, the MHD flow injected from a plasma source with
low velocity must pass through the fast magnetosonic point after passing
through the ``inner'' or ``outer'' Alfven point. We find that a trans-fast MHD
accretion solution related to the inner Alfven point is invalid when the
hydrodynamical effects on the MHD flow dominate at the magnetosonic point,
while the other accretion solution related to the outer Alfven point is invalid
when the total angular momentum of the MHD flow is seriously large. When both
regimes of the accretion solutions are valid in the black hole magnetosphere,
we can expect the transition between the two regimes. The variety of these
solutions would be important in many highly energetic astrophysical situations.
