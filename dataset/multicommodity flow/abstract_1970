We consider a gauge invariant one parameter family of families of fiberwise
twisted Dirac type operators on a fiberation with the typical fiber an even
dimensional compact manifold with boundary, i.e., a family $\{D_u\}, u\in
[0,1]$ with $D_1=gD_0g^{-1}$ for a suitable unitary automorphism $g$ of the
twisted bundle. Suppose all the operators $D_u$ are imposed with a certain
\emph{local elliptic} boundary condition $F$ and $D_{u,F}$ is the self-adjoint
extension of $D_u$. We establish a formula for the higher spectral flow of
$\{D_{u,F}\}$, $u\in[0,1]$. Our result generalizes a recent result of
Gorokhovsky and Lesch to the families case.
