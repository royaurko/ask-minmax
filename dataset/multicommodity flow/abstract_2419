We study the effects of collective flow on charge dependent azimuthal
correlations at LHC energies. We propose a series of correlations as a
signature of the combined effects of azimuthal collective flow and local charge
conservation and perform an analysis within a statistical freeze-out model. We
find that present LHC measurements of charge dependent azimuthal correlations
are consistent with local charge conservation on the kinetic freeze-out
surface. In view of experimental searches for signatures of the chiral-magnetic
effect, we provide an alternative explanation of the charge dependence of the
observed signal and propose additional measurements to disentangle the effects.
