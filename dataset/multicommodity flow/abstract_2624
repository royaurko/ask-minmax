Relativistic collisions of light on heavy ions (p+Au at sqrt(s)=7.7 GeV,
p+Au, d+Au,3He+Au at sqrt(s)=62.4 GeV and 200 GeV and p+Pb, 3He+Pb at
sqrt(s)=5.02 TeV) are simulated using "superSONIC", a model that includes
pre-equilibrium flow, viscous hydrodynamics and a hadronic cascade afterburner.
Even though these systems have strong gradients and only consist of at most a
few tens of charged particles per unit rapidity, one finds evidence that a
hydrodynamic description applies to these systems. Based on these simulations,
the presence of a triangular flow component in d+Au collisions at sqrt(s)=200
GeV is predicted to be similar in magnitude to that found in 3He+Au collisions.
Furthermore, the v3(p_T) ratio of 3He+Au to d+Au is found to be sensitive to
the presence of pre-equilibrium flow. This would imply an experimentally
accessible window into pre-equilibrium QCD dynamics using light-heavy ion
collisions.
