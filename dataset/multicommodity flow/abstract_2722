To explain the puzzling situation in the observed bulk flows on scales $\sim
150 h^{-1}$ Mpc ($H_0 = 100 h^{-1}$ km sec$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), we consider the
observational behavior of spherically symmetric inhomogeneous cosmological
models, which consist of inner and outer homogeneous regions connected by a
shell or an intermediate self-similar region. It is assumed that the present
matter density parameter in the inner region is smaller than that in the outer
region, and the present Hubble parameter in the inner region is larger than
that in the outer region. Then galaxies in the inner void-like region can be
seen to have a bulk motion relative to matter in the outer region, when we
observe them at a point O deviated from the center C of the inner region. Their
velocity $v_p$ in the CD direction is equal to the difference of two Hubble
parameters multiplied by the distance between C and O. It is found also that
the velocity $v_d$ corresponding to CMB dipole anisotropy observed at O is by a
factor $\approx 10$ small compared with $v_p$. This behavior of $v_d$ and $v_p$
is consistent with the observed cosmic flow of cluster galaxies, when the
radius of the inner region and the distance CD are about 200 $h^{-1}$ Mpc and
40 $h^{-1}$ Mpc, respectively, and when the gaps of density and Hubble
parameters are $\approx 0.5$ and 18%, respectively. Moreover, the [m, z]
relation in these models is discussed in connection with SNIa data.
