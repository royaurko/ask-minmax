The aspect ratio (\Gamma) dependence of the heat transfer (Nusselt number Nu
in dimensionless form) in turbulent (two-dimensional) Rayleigh-B\'enard
convection is numerically studied in the regime $0.4 \le \Gamma \le 1.25$ for
Rayleigh numbers $10^7 \le Ra \le Ra^{9}$ and Prandtl numbers Pr =0.7 (gas) and
4.3 (water). Nu (\Gamma) shows a very rich structure with sudden jumps and
sharp transitions. We connect these structures to the way the flow organizes
itself in the sample and explain why the aspect ratio dependence of Nu is more
pronounced for small Pr. Even for fixed \Gamma different turbulent states (with
different resulting Nu) can exist, between which the flow can or cannot switch.
In the latter case the heat transfer thus depends on the initial conditions.
