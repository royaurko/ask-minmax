We perform direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a turbulent channel flow
over porous walls. In the fluid region the flow is governed by the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, while in the porous layers the
Volume-Averaged Navier-Stokes (VANS) equations are used, which are obtained by
volume-averaging the microscopic flow field over a small volume that is larger
than the typical dimensions of the pores. In this way the porous medium has a
continuum description, and can be specified via global properties like
permeability and porosity, without the need of a detailed knowledge of the pore
microstructure. At the interface between the porous material and the fluid
region, following literature momentum-transfer conditions are applied, in which
an available coefficient related to the unknown structure of the interface can
be used as an error estimate.
  To formulate the numerical problem, the velocity-vorticity formulation of the
coupled Navier--Stokes and VANS equations is derived and implement into a
pseudo-spectral DNS solver. We perform simulations at $Re_\tau=180$, and carry
out a parametric study, by varying thickness of the porous layers, properties
of the porous material, as well as the coefficient of the momentum-transfer
interface conditions. The analysis of turbulence statistics and instantaneous
flow fields, in comparative form to the flow over a smooth impermeable wall,
allows us to address the effects of permeability and to highlight their
importance even in this low-permeability regime.
