In this paper, we present a fully analytical description of the early-stage
formation of elliptic flow in relativistic viscous hydrodynamics. We first
construct an elliptic deformation of Gubser flow which is a boost invariant
solution of the Navier-Stokes equation with a nontrivial transverse profile. We
then analytically calculate the momentum anisotropy of the flow as a function
of time and discuss the connection with the empirical formula by Bhalerao {\it
et al.} regarding the viscosity dependence of elliptic flow.
