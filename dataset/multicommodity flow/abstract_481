Interactions between flows and magnetic fields in the Sun's plasma can change
surface waves and flows near active regions, are evident in cyclic changes of
large-scale phenomena such as the meridional circulation, and contribute to
dynamics in the long-term solar magnetic cycle, e.g. during the recent
prolonged solar minimum. We investigate possible relationships between these
phenomena.
  We have observed changes in solar surface flow patterns in active regions,
dependent on magnetic field strength and orientation, consistent with the
theoretically predicted Proctor Effect. Other researchers have observed
relationships between changes in solar magnetic fields and meridional
circulation flows. We explore similarities between the Proctor Effect and the
observed interdependence of larger-scale magnetic fields and flows. This may
contribute to understanding of fundamental solar convection and dynamo
processes, e.g. the prolonged magnetic minimum of the most recent cycle.
