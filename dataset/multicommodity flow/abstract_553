Partial contributions of elliptic v_2 and triangular v_3 flows to the
hexagonal v_6 flow are studied within the HYDJET++ model for Pb+Pb collisions
at sqrt{s}=2.76 TeV. Scaling of the ratio v_6^{1/6}{Psi_2} / v_2^{1/2}{Psi_2}
in the elliptic flow plane, Psi_2, is predicted in the range 1 < p_T < 4 GeV/c
for semicentral and semiperipheral collisions. Jets increase this ratio by
about 10% and also cause its rise at p_T > 3.5 GeV/c. The part of v_6 coming
from v_2 is instantly increasing as the reaction becomes more peripheral,
whereas the contribution of v_3 to v_6 drops. This behavior explains the
experimentally observed increase of correlations between second and sixth
harmonics and decrease of correlations between third and sixth harmonics with
rising impact parameter $b$. Our study favors the idea that basic features of
the hexagonal flow can be understood in terms of the interplay of elliptic and
triangular flows.
