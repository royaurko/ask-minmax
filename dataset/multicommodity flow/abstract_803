Given a compact four dimensional smooth Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with
smooth boundary, we consider the evolution equation by $Q$-curvature in the
interior keeping the $T$-curvature and the mean curvature to be zero and the
evolution equation by $T$-curvature at the boundary with the condition that the
$Q$-curvature and the mean curvature vanish. Using integral method, we prove
global existence and convergence for the $Q$-curvature flow (resp $T$-curvature
flow) to smooth metric of prescribed $Q$-curvature (resp
  $T$-curvature) under conformally invariant assumptions.
