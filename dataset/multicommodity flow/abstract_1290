We calculate flow observables with the NeXSPheRIO ideal hydrodynamic model
and make the first comparison to the complete set of mid-rapidity flow
measurements made by the PHENIX collaboration in top energy Au+Au collisions. A
simultaneous calculation of v_2, v_3, v_4, and the first event-by-event
calculation of quadrangular flow defined with respect to the v_2 event plane
(v_4{Psi_2}) gives good agreement with measured values, including the
dependence on both transverse momentum and centrality. This provides
confirmation that the collision system is indeed well described as a
quark-gluon plasma with an extremely small viscosity, and that correlations are
dominantly generated from collective effects. In addition we present a
prediction for v_5.
