We study spectral flow preserving four-point correlation functions in the
AdS3-WZNW model using the Coulomb gas method on the sphere. We present a
multiple integral realization of the conformal blocks and explicitly compute
amplitudes involving operators with quantized values of the sum of their spins,
i.e., requiring an integer number of screening charges of the first kind. The
result is given as a sum over the independent configurations of screening
contours yielding a monodromy invariant expansion in powers of the worldsheet
moduli. We then examine the factorization limit and show that the leading terms
in the sum can be identified, in the semiclassical limit, with products of
spectral flow conserving three-point functions. These terms can be rewritten as
the m-basis version of the integral expression obtained by J. Teschner from a
postulate for the operator product expansion of normalizable states in the
H3+-WZNW model. Finally, we determine the equivalence between the
factorizations of a particular set of four-point functions into products of two
three-point functions either preserving or violating spectral flow number
conservation. Based on this analysis we argue that the expression for the
amplitude as an integral over the spin of the intermediate operators holds
beyond the semiclassical regime, thus corroborating that spectral flow
conserving correlators in the AdS3-WZNW model are related by analytic
continuation to correlation functions in the H3+-WZNW model.
