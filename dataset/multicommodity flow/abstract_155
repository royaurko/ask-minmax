In light beams with circular or elliptic polarization, the transverse energy
flow consists of the "spin" and "orbital" parts. Both of them can induce the
orbital motion of microparticles suspended within the field of a light beam,
and this should be taken into account in experiments on the spin-to-orbital
angular momentum conversion. The character of the spin, orbital and total
transverse energy flows in circular Laguerre-Gaussian beams is studied
analytically; graphical representations of the flows in the beam cross section
(flow maps) are calculated and analyzed. The spin circulatory flow can be
directed oppositely to the orbital one and/or to the polarization handedness.
As a result, the total transverse energy circulation of a beam with homogeneous
circular polarization can be of different handedness in different regions of
the beam cross section, which are separated by the contours of zero transverse
energy flow. Regarding the particle position within the beam cross section, it
can perform orbital, spinning or combined spinning-orbital motion with variable
parameters. Possible applications to optical driving of microparticles are
discussed.
