We theoretically prove that electromagnetic beams propagating through a
nonlinear cubic metamaterial can exhibit a power flow whose direction reverses
its sign along the transverse profile. This effect is peculiar of the hitherto
unexplored extreme nonlinear regime where the nonlinear response is comparable
or even greater than the linear contribution, a condition achievable even at
relatively small intensities. We propose a possible metamaterial structure able
to support the extreme conditions where the polarization cubic nonlinear
contribution does not act as a mere perturbation of the linear part.
