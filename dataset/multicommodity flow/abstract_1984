We report on wide-field imaging of pulsatile motion induced by blood flow
using heterodyne holographic interferometry on the thumb of a healthy
volunteer, in real-time. Optical Doppler images were measured with green laser
light by a frequency-shifted Mach-Zehnder interferometer in off-axis
configuration. The recorded optical signal was linked to local instantaneous
out-of-plane motion of the skin at velocities of a few hundreds of microns per
second, and compared to blood pulse monitored by plethysmoraphy during an
occlusion-reperfusion experiment.
