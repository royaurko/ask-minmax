We study the sensitivity of transverse flow towards symmetry energy in the
Fermi energy region as well as at high energies. We find that transverse flow
is sensitive to symmetry energy as well as its density dependence in the Fermi
energy region. We also show that the transverse flow can address the symmetry
energy at densities about twice the saturation density, however it shows the
insensitivity towards the symmetry energy at densities $\rho/\rho_{0}$ $>$ 2.
The mechanism for the sensitivity of transverse flow towards symmetry energy as
well as its density dependence is also discussed.
