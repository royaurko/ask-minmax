The Cauchy problem of a multi-dimensional ($d\geqslant 2$) compressible
viscous liquid-gas two-phase flow model is concerned in this paper. We
investigate the global existence and uniqueness of the strong solution for the
initial data close to a stable equilibrium and the local in time existence and
uniqueness of the solution with general initial data in the framework of Besov
spaces. A continuation criterion is also obtained for the local solution.
