We propose a new rule for boundary renormalization group flows in fixed-point
free coset models. Our proposal generalizes the 'absorption of boundary
spin'-principle formulated by Affleck and Ludwig to a large class of
perturbations in boundary conformal field theories. We illustrate the rule in
the case of unitary minimal models.
