A simple model based on relativistic geometry and final-state hadronic
rescattering is used to predict pion source parameters extracted in two-pion
femtoscopy studies of proton-proton collisions at s**(1/2) = 200 GeV. From
studying the momentum and particle multiplicity dependences of these parameters
in the context of this model and assuming a very short hadronization time,
flow-like behavior is seen which resembles the flow behavior commonly observed
in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
