Collective flow reflects dynamical evolution in high-energy heavy ion
collisions. In particular, the strange hadron elliptic flow reflects early
collision dynamics. We present results from a systematic analysis of the
centrality dependence of strange hadron elliptic flow ($v_2$) measurement of
$K_{S}^{0}$, $\Lambda$ and $\Xi$ for Cu + Cu collisions at 200 GeV. Results for
Cu + Cu collisions are compared with results previously reported for Au + Au
collisions. We will also compare our data with results from ideal hydrodynamic
calculations.
