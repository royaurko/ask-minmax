We compare nonlinear stresses and temperatures for adiabatic shear flows,
using up to 262,144 particles, with those from corresponding homogeneous and
inhomogeneous flows. Two varieties of kinetic temperature tensors are compared
to the configurational temperatures. This comparison leads to an improved form
for the local and instantaneous smooth-particle averaged stream velocity and to
a recognition of rotational contributions to the configurational temperature.
