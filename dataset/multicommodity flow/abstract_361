Quasi-hydrostatic cooling of the intracluster gas is studied. In the
quasi-hydrostatic model, work done by gravity on the inflow gas with dP \neq 0,
where P is the gas pressure, is taken into account in the thermal balance. The
gas flows in from the outer part so as to compensate the pressure loss of the
gas undergoing radiative cooling, but the mass flow is so moderate and smooth
that the gas is considered to be quasi-hydrostatic. The temperature of the
cooling gas decreases toward the cluster center, but, unlike cooling flows with
dP = 0, approaches a constant temperature of \sim 1/3 the temperature of the
non-cooling ambient gas. This does not mean that gravitational work cancels out
radiative cooling, but means that the temperature of the cooling gas appears to
approach a constant value toward the cluster center if the gas maintains the
quasi-hydrostatic balance. We discuss the mass flow in quasi-hydrostatic
cooling, and compare it with the standard isobaric cooling flow model. We also
discuss the implication of \dot{M} for the standard cooling flow model.
