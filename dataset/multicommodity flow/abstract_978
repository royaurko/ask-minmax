We have performed 3D hydrodynamical simulations of FR-II radio sources in
beta-profile cooling-flow clusters. The effects of cooling of the cluster gas
were incorporated into a modified version of the ZEUS-MP code. The simulations
followed not only the active phase of the radio source, but also the long term
behaviour for up to 2 Gyr after the jets of the radio source were switched off.
We find as expected that the radio source has a significant effect on the
cooling flow while it is active, however we also find that the effects of the
radio source on the cluster are long-lived. A buoyancy driven convective flow
is established as the remnants of the radio source rise through the cluster
dragging material from the cluster core. Although the central Mpc of the
cluster reverts to having a cooling flow, this asymmetric convective flow is
able to remove the cool gas accumulating at the cluster core and indeed there
is a net outflow persisting for timescales of about an order of magnitude
longer than the time for which the source is active or longer. The convective
flow may also provide a mechanism to enhance the metallicity of the cluster gas
at large cluster radii.
