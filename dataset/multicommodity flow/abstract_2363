We introduce a theoretical and numerical method to investigate the properties
of electro-osmotic flows under conditions of extreme confinement. The present
approach, aiming to provide a simple modeling of electrolyte solutions
described as ternary mixtures, which comprises two ionic species and a third
uncharged component, is an extension of our recent work on binary neutral
mixtures. The approach, which combines elements of kinetic theory, density
functional theory with Lattice-Boltzmann algorithms, is microscopic and
self-consistent and does not require the us e of constitutive equations to
determine the fluxes. Numerical solutions are obtained by solving the resulting
coupled equations for the one-particle phase-space distributions of the species
by means of a Lattice Boltzmann discretization procedure. Results are given for
the microscopic density and velocity profiles and for the volumetric and charge
flow.
