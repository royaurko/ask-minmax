We analyze in details the atomistic response of a model amorphous material
submitted to plastic shear in the athermal, quasistatic limit. After a linear
stress-strain behavior, the system undergoes a noisy plastic flow. We show that
the plastic flow is spatially heterogeneous. Two kinds of plastic events occur
in the system: quadrupolar localized rearrangements, and shear bands. The
analysis of the individual motion of a particle shows also two regimes: a
hyper-diffusive regime followed by a diffusive regime, even at zero
temperature.
