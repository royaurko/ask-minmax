While magnetic field has only second order effects on global sound waves, it
can affect the mode frequencies and flow fields inferred using local
helioseismology. A strong localized field can bias our results when one try to
infer global scale flows such as the meridional circulation. On the other hand,
one important object of research in this area is to determine whether one can
detect changes in frequencies or sub-surface flow fields that could be a
precursor of surface magnetic events. In this paper we review recent
development in this area focusing on results obtained with the ring-diagram
analysis technique.
