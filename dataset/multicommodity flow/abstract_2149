We study the influence of intracluster large scale magnetic fields on the
thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. In a macroscopic approach we complete
the hydrostatic equilibrium equation with the magnetic field pressure
component. Comparing the resulting mass distribution with a standard one, we
derive a new electron density profile. For a spherically symmetric cluster
model, this new profile can be written as the product of a standard ($\beta$-)
profile and a radius dependent function, close to unity, which takes into
account the magnetic field strength. For non-cooling flow clusters we find that
the observed magnetic field values can reduce the SZ signal by $\sim 10%$ with
respect to the value estimated from X-ray observations and the $\beta$-model.
If a cluster harbours a cooling flow, magnetic fields tend to weaken the
cooling flow influence on the SZ-effect.
