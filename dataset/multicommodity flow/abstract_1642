Dressing technique is used to construct commuting Lax operators which provide
an integrable (canonical) structure behind
Witten--Dijkgraaf--Verlinde--Verlinde equations. The commuting flows are
related to the isomonodromic flows. Examples of the canonical integrable
structure are given in two- and three-dimensional cases. The three-dimensional
example is associated with the rational Landau-Ginzburg potentials.
