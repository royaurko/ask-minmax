We consider the impact of thermal conduction in clusters of galaxies on the
(unmagnetized) interface between a cold gaseous cloud and a hotter gas flowing
over the cloud (the so-called cold front). We argue that near the stagnation
point of the flow conduction creates a spatially extended layer of constant
thickness $\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is of order $\sim\sqrt{kR/U}$, and $R$ is
the curvature radius of the cloud, $U$ is the velocity of the flow at infinity,
and $k$ is the conductivity of the gas. For typical parameters of the observed
fronts, one finds $\Delta \ll R$. The formation time of such a layer is $\sim
R/U$. Once the layer is formed, its thickness only slowly varies with time and
the quasi-steady layer may persist for many characteristic time scales. Based
on these simple arguments one can use the observed width of the cold fronts in
galaxy clusters to constrain the effective thermal conductivity of the
intra-cluster medium.
