The skew mean curvature flow or binormal flow, which origins from the vortex
fila- ment equation, describes the evolution of a codimension two submanifold
along binormal direction. We show that by a generalized Hasimoto
transformation, the SMCF is equivalent to a non-linear Schr\"odinger system.
Moreover, we prove the existence of a local solution to the initial value prob-
lem of the SMCF of surfaces in Euclidean space R4. The key ingredient is a
uniform Sobolev-type embedding theorem for the second fundamental forms of two
dimensional surfaces, which might be of independent interest.
