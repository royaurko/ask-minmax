We study the sensitivity of the gradient flow coupling to sectors of
different topological charge and its implications in practical situations.
Furthermore, we investigate an alternative definition of the running coupling
that is expected to be less sensitive to the problems of the HMC algorithm to
efficiently sample all topological sectors.
