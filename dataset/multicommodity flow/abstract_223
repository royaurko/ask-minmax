We introduce a level-set formulation for the mean curvature flow with
obstacles and show existence and uniqueness of a viscosity solution. These
results generalize a well known viscosity approach for the mean curvature flow
without obstacle by Evans and Spruck and Chen, Giga and Goto in 1991. In
addition, we show that this evolution is consistent with the variational scheme
introduced by Almeida, Chambolle and Novaga (2012) and we study the long time
behavior of our viscosity solutions.
