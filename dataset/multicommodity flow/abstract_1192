We use AdS/CFT duality to study the large N_c limit of the meson spectrum on
the Higgs branch of a strongly coupled, N=2 supersymmetric SU(N_c) gauge theory
with N_f =2 fundamental hypermultiplets. In the dual supergravity description,
the Higgs branch is described by SU(2) instanton configurations on D7-branes in
an AdS background. We compute the spectral flow parameterized by the size of a
single instanton. In the large N_c limit, there is a sense in which the flow
from zero to infinite instanton size, or Higgs VEV, can be viewed as a closed
loop. We show that this flow leads to a non-trivial rearrangement of the
spectrum.
