The collision consistency between the BGK collision model equation and
lattice-BGK (LBGK) model is proposed by researching the physical significance
of the relaxation factor tau in LBGK model. For microscalar flow in which the
continuum hypothesis is not still satisfied, the collision consistency tau=1.0
should be ensured when using the LBGK model for simulating microflows. The
results of simulating microchannel Poiseuille flow with constant pressure
gradient under collision consistency by using LBGK model are well consistent
with the analytical solutions, and the accuracy of these results is three or
four orders of magnitude higher than those that don't satisfy the collision
consistency.
