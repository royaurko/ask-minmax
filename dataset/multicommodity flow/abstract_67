I review the recent developments in the analysis of cosmic flow data, in
particular, latest results of bulk flow measurements, comparison between
redshift and peculiar velocity catalogs with emphasis on the measured value of
the $\beta (=\Omega_m^{0.6}/b)$ parameter, and matter power spectrum estimates
from galaxy peculiar velocity catalogs. Based on these developments, one can
argue that most of the previous discrepancies in the interpretation of cosmic
flow data, {\it maybe} with the exception of bulk flow measurements on scales
$\gsim 100 h{^{-1}}{\rm Mpc}$, have either been resolved or fairly understood.
