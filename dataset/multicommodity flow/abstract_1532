It is shown by perturbation techniques and numerical simulations that the
inverse cascade of kink-antikink annihilations, characteristic of the
Kolmogorov flow in the slightly supercritical Reynolds number regime, is halted
by the dispersive action of Rossby waves in the beta-plane approximation. For
beta tending to zero, the largest excited scale is proportional to the
logarithm of one over beta and differs strongly from what is predicted by
standard dimensional phenomenology which ignores depletion of nonlinearity.
