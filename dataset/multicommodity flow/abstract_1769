The classic 2pi-Theorem of Gromov and Thurston constructs a negatively curved
metric on certain 3-manifolds obtained by Dehn filling. By Geometrization, any
such manifold admits a hyperbolic metric. We outline a program using cross
curvature flow to construct a smooth one-parameter family of metrics between
the "2pi-metric" and the hyperbolic metric. We make partial progress in the
program, proving long-time existence, preservation of negative sectional
curvature, curvature bounds, and integral convergence to hyperbolic for the
metrics under consideration.
