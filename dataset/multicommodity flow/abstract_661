This paper deals with flow-induced shape transitions of elastic capsules. The
state of the art concerning both theory and experiments is briefly reviewed
starting with dynamically induced small deformation of initially spherical
capsules and the formation of wrinkles on polymerized membranes. Initially
non-spherical capsules show tumbling and tank-treading motion in shear flow.
Theoretical descriptions of the transition between these two types of motion
assuming a fixed shape are at variance with the full capsule dynamics obtained
numerically. To resolve the discrepancy, we expand the exact equations of
motion for small deformations and find that shape changes play a dominant role.
We classify the dynamical phase transitions and obtain numerical and analytical
results for the phase boundaries as a function of viscosity contrast, shear and
elongational flow rate. We conclude with perspectives on timedependent flow, on
shear-induced unbinding from surfaces, on the role of thermal fluctuations, and
on applying the concepts of stochastic thermodynamics to these systems.
