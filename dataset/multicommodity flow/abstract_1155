There is currently a controversy as to whether Voyager 1 has already crossed
the Termination Shock, the first boundary of the Heliosphere. The region
between the Termination Shock and the Heliopause, the Helisheath, is one of the
most unknown regions theoretically. In the Heliosheath magnetic effects are
crucial, as the solar magnetic field is compressed at the Termination Shock by
the slowing flow. Recently, our simulations showed that the Heliosheath
presents remarkable dynamics, with turbulent flows and the presence of a jet
flow at the current sheet that is unstable due to magnetohydrodynamic
instabilities \cite{opher,opher1}. In this paper we review these recent
results, and present an additional simulation with constant neutral atom
background. In this case the jet is still present but with reduced intensity.
Further study, e.g., including neutrals and the tilt of the solar rotation from
the magnetic axis, is required before we can definitively address how the
Heliosheath behaves. Already we can say that this region presents remarkable
dynamics, with turbulent flows, indicating that the Heliosheath might be very
different from what we previously thought.
