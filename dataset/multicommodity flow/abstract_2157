We present some results of recent calculations of rigid rod-like particles in
shear flow, based on the Doi model. This is an ideal model system for
exhibiting the generic behavior of shear-thinning fluids (polymer solutions,
wormlike micelles, surfactant solutions, liquid crystals) in shear flow. We
present calculations of phase coexistence under shear among weakly-aligned
(paranematic) and strongly-aligned phases, including alignment in the shear
plane and in the vorticity direction (log-rolling). Phase coexistence is
possible, in principle, under conditions of both common shear stress and common
strain rate, corresponding to different orientations of the interface between
phases. We discuss arguments for resolving this degeneracy. Calculation of
phase coexistence relies on the presence of inhomogeneous terms in the
dynamical equations of motion, which select the appropriate pair of coexisting
states. We cast this condition in terms of an equivalent dynamical system, and
explore some aspects of how this differs from equilibrium phase coexistence.
