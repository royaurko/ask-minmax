The present study is concerned with the stability of a flow of viscous
conducting liquid driven by pressure gradient in the channel between two
parallel walls subject to a transverse magnetic field. Although the magnetic
field has a strong stabilizing effect, this flow, similarly to its hydrodynamic
counterpart -- plane Poiseuille flow, is known to become turbulent
significantly below the threshold predicted by linear stability theory. We
investigate the effect of the magnetic field on 2D nonlinear travelling-wave
states which are found at substantially subcritical Reynolds numbers starting
from $Re_n=2939$ without the magnetic field and from $Re_n\sim6.50\times10^3Ha$
in a sufficiently strong magnetic field defined by the Hartmann number $Ha.$
Although the latter value is by a factor of seven lower than the linear
stability threshold $Re_l\sim4.83\times10^4Ha$,it is still more by an order of
magnitude higher than the experimentally observed value for the onset of
turbulence in the MHD channel flow.
