In many applications it is advantageous to construct effective slip boundary
conditions, which could fully characterize flow over patterned surfaces. Here
we focus on laminar shear flows over smooth anisotropic surfaces with arbitrary
scalar slip $b(y)$, varying in only one direction. We derive general
expressions for eigenvalues of the effective slip-length tensor, and show that
the transverse component is equal to a half of the longitudinal one with twice
larger local slip, $2b(y)$. A remarkable corollary of this relation is that the
flow along any direction of the 1D surface can be easily determined, once the
longitudinal component of the effective slip tensor is found from the known
spatially nonuniform scalar slip.
