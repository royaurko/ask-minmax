Collective flows in heavy-ion collisions from AGS ($(2-11)A$ GeV) to SPS
($(40,158)A$ GeV) energies are investigated in a nonequilibrium transport model
with nuclear mean-field (MF). Sideward $<p_x>$, directed $v_1$, and elliptic
flows $v_2$ are systematically studied with different assumptions on the
nuclear equation of state (EOS). We find that momentum dependence in the
nuclear MF is important for the understanding of the proton collective flows at
AGS and SPS energies. Calculated results with momentum dependent MF
qualitatively reproduce the experimental data of proton sideward, directed, and
elliptic flows in a incident energy range of $(2-158)A$ GeV.
