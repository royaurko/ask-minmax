The principle of multiple solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations discussed
in this paper is not directed at any particular problems in fluid dynamics, nor
at any specific applications. The non-uniqueness principle states that the
Reynolds number, above its critical value, is insufficient to uniquely
determine a flow field for a given geometry, or for similar geometries. It is a
generic principle for all fluid flow and its transportation properties, but is
not well understood. It compliments the current popular bifurcation theories by
the fact that multiple solutions can exist on each stable bifurcation branch.
