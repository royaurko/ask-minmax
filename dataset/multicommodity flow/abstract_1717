Gamma distributions, which contain the exponential as a special case, have a
distinguished place in the representation of near-Poisson randomness for
statistical processes; typically, they represent distributions of spacings
between events or voids among objects. Here we look at the properties of the
Shannon entropy function and calculate its corresponding flow curves. We
consider univariate and bivariate gamma, as well as Weibull distributions which
also include exponential distributions.
