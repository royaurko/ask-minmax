The distributions of two-jet event shapes contain information on
hadronization in QCD. Near the two-jet limit, these distributions can be
described by convolutions of nonperturbative event shape functions with the
same distributions calculated in resummed perturbation theory. The shape
functions, in turn, are determined by correlations of momentum flow operators
with each other and with light-like Wilson lines, which describe the coupling
of soft, wide-angle radiation to jets. We observe that leading power
corrections to the mean values of event shapes are determined by the
correlation of a single momentum flow operator with the relevant Wilson lines.
This generalizes arguments for the universality of leading power corrections
based on the low-scale behavior of the running coupling or resummation. We also
show how a study of the angularity event shapes can provide information on
correlations involving multiple momentum flow operators, giving a window to the
system of QCD dynamics that underlies the variety of event shape functions. In
deriving these results, we review, develop and compare factorization techniques
in conventional perturbative QCD and soft-collinear effective theory (SCET). We
give special emphasis to the elimination of double counting of momentum regions
in these two formalisms.
