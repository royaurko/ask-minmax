The influence of resonance decays on the elliptic flows of stable hadrons is
studied in the quark coalescence model. Although difference between the
elliptic flow of pions from resonance decays, except the rho meson, and that of
directly produced pions is appreciable, those for other stable hadrons are
small. Since there are more pions from the decays of rho mesons than from other
resonances, including resonance decays can only account partially the deviation
of final pion elliptic flow from the observed scaling of hadron elliptic flows,
i.e., the hadron elliptic flow per quark is the same at same transverse
momentum per quark. The remaining deviation can be explained by including the
effect due to the quark momentum distribution inside hadrons.
