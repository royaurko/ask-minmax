The 2D Ricci flow equation in the conformal gauge is studied using the
linearization approach. Using a non-linear substitution of logarithmic type,
the emergent quadratic equation is split in various ways. New special solutions
involving arbitrary functions are presented. Some special reductions are also
discussed.
