We analyse mesogranular flow patterns in a three-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulation of solar surface convection in order to determine its
characteristics. We calculate divergence maps from horizontal velocities
obtained with the Local Correlation Tracking (LCT) method. Mesogranules are
identified as patches of positive velocity divergence. We track the
mesogranules to obtain their size and lifetime distributions. We vary the
analysis parameters to verify if the pattern has characteristic scales. The
characteristics of the resulting flow patterns depend on the averaging time and
length used in the analysis. We conclude that the mesogranular patterns do not
exhibit intrinsic length and time scales.
