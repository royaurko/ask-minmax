In this paper, we construct finite blow-up examples for symplectic mean
curvature flows and we study properties of symplectic translating solitons. We
prove that, the K\"ahler angle $\alpha$ of a symplectic translating soliton
with $\max |A|=1$ satisfies that $\sup |\alpha|>\frac{\pi}{4}\frac{|T|}{|T|+1}$
where $T$ is the direction in which the surface transltes.
