The recently formulated model of highly-anisotropic and strongly dissipative
hydrodynamics is used in 3+1 dimensions to describe flow characteristics and
strangeness production in Au+Au collisions at the highest RHIC beam energy. Our
results show very weak dependence on the initial momentum anisotropy, provided
the anisotropic phase lasts no longer than 1 fm/c.
