The rheology of dense granular flows is studied numerically in a shear cell
controlled at constant pressure and shear stress, confined between two granular
shear flows. We show that a liquid state can be achieved even far below the
yield stress, whose flow can be described with the same rheology as above the
yield stress. A non-local constitutive relation is derived from dimensional
analysis through a gradient expansion and calibrated using the spatial
relaxation of velocity profiles observed under homogeneous stresses. Both for
frictional and frictionless grains, the relaxation length is found to diverge
as the inverse square-root of the distance to the yield point, on both sides of
that point.
