Our conception of a generalized ergodic theory shall exceed the generality of
general topology: In this first part of the generalized ergodic theory we
investigate the logical constitution of the conception of attractors. We
prepare a general theory of sensitivity of flows, which we intend to present in
the second part of the generalized ergodic theory. As a result of this first
part take the theorem 3.3 and the theorem 3.8: We show a very general ergodic
theorem, however it concerns insensitve flows only.
