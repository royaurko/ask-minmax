In this paper, we study the evolution of L2 p-forms under Ricci flow with
bounded curvature on a complete non-compact or a compact Riemannian manifold.
We show that under curvature pinching conditions on such a manifold, the L2
norm of a smooth p-form is non-increasing along the Ricci flow. The L^{\infty}
norm is showed to have monotonicity property too.
