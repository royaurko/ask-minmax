We study transverse expansion and directed flow in Au(11AGeV)Au reactions
within a multi-fluid dynamical model. Although we do not employ an equation of
state (EoS) with a first order phase transition, we find a slow increase of the
transverse velocities of the nucleons with time. A similar behaviour can be
observed for the directed nucleon flow. This is due to non-equilibrium effects
which also lead to less and slower conversion of longitudinal into transverse
momentum. We also show that the proton rapidity distribution at CERN energies,
as calculated within this model, agrees well with the preliminary NA44-data.
