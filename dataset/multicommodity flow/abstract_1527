We calculate and verify with simulations the ratio between the average
translational and rotational energies of systems with rough, inelastic
particles, either forced or freely cooling. The ratio shows non-equipartition
of energy. In stationary flows, this ratio depends mainly on the particle
roughness, but in nonstationary flows, such as freely cooling granular media,
it also depends strongly on the normal dissipation. The approach presented here
unifies and simplifies different results obtained by more elaborate kinetic
theories. We observe that the boundary induced energy flux plays an important
role.
