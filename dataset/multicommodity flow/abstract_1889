The paper considers the complexity of verifying that a finite state system
satisfies a number of definitions of information flow security. The systems
model considered is one in which agents operate synchronously with awareness of
the global clock. This enables timing based attacks to be captured, whereas
previous work on this topic has dealt primarily with asynchronous systems.
Versions of the notions of nondeducibility on inputs, nondeducibility on
strategies, and an unwinding based notion are formulated for this model. All
three notions are shown to be decidable, and their computational complexity is
characterised.
