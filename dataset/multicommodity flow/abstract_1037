We employ Clarkson and Schneider's "hyperproperties" to classify various
verification problems of quantitative information flow. The results of this
paper unify and extend the previous results on the hardness of checking and
inferring quantitative information flow. In particular, we identify a subclass
of liveness hyperproperties, which we call "k-observable hyperproperties", that
can be checked relative to a reachability oracle via self composition.
