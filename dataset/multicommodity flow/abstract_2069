The effect of rotation is considered to become important when the Rossby
number is sufficiently small, as is the case in many geophysical and
astrophysical flows. Here we present direct numerical simulations to study the
effect of rotation in flows with moderate Rossby numbers (down to Ro~0.1) but
at Reynolds numbers large enough to observe the beginning of a turbulent
scaling at scales smaller than the energy injection scale. We use coherent
forcing at intermediate scales, leaving enough room in the spectral space for
an inverse cascade of energy to also develop. We analyze the spectral behavior
of the simulations, the shell-to-shell energy transfer, scaling laws, and
intermittency, as well as the geometry of the structures in the flow. At late
times, the direct transfer of energy at small scales is mediated by
interactions with the largest scale in the system, the energy containing eddies
with k_perp~1, where "perp" refers to wavevectors perpendicular the axis of
rotation. The transfer between modes with wavevector parallel to the rotation
is strongly quenched. The inverse cascade of energy at scales larger than the
energy injection scale is non-local, and energy is transferred directly from
small scales to the largest available scale. Also, as time evolves and the
energy piles up at the large scales, the intermittency of the direct cascade of
energy is preserved while corrections due to intermittency are found to be the
same (within error bars) as in homogeneous turbulence.
