The effect of oscillatory shear flows on turbulent transport of passive
scalar fields is studied by numerical computations based on the results
provided by E. Kim [\emph{Physics of Plasmas}, {\bf 13}, 022308, 2006].
Turbulent diffusion is found to depend crucially on the competition between
suppression due to shearing and enhancement due to resonances, depending on the
characteristic time and length scales of shear flow and turbulence.
Enhancements in transport occur for turbulence with finite memory time either
due to Doppler and parametric resonances. Scalings of turbulence amplitude and
transport are provided in different parameter spaces. The results suggest that
oscillatory shear flows are not only less efficient in regulating turbulence,
but also can enhance the value of turbulent diffusion, accelerating turbulent
transport.
