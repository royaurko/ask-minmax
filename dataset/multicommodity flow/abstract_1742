The nonlinear, resistive, 3D magnetohydrodynamic equations are solved
numerically to demonstrate the possibility of forming and sustaining a
spheromak by forcing tangential flows at the plasma boundary. The method can by
explained in terms of helicity injection and differs from other helicity
injection methods employed in the past. Several features which were also
observed in previous dc helicity injection experiments are identified and
discussed.
