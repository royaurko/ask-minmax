Electroconvection in a thin, sheared fluid film displays a rich sequence of
bifurcations between different flow states as the driving voltage is increased.
We present a numerical study of an annular film in which a radial potential
difference acts on induced surface charges to drive convection. The film is
also sheared by independently rotating the inner edge of the annulus. This
simulation models laboratory experiments on electroconvection in sheared
smectic liquid crystal films. The applied shear competes with the electrical
forces, resulting in oscillatory and strongly subcritical bifurcations between
localized vortex states close to onset. At higher forcing, the flow becomes
chaotic via a Ruelle-Takens-Newhouse scenario. The simulation allows flow
visualization not available in the physical experiments, and sheds light on
previously observed transitions in the current-voltage characteristics of
electroconvecting smectic films.
