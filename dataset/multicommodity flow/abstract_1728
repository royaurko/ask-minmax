We consider O(N)-symmetric potentials with a logarithmic singularity in the
second field derivative. This class includes BCS and Gross Neveu potentials.
Formally, the exact renormalization group equation for the Legendre transform
of these potentials seems to have ill-defined initial conditions. We show that
the renormalization group equation for the local potential has well-defined
initial conditions and that the logarithmic singularity is smoothed rapidly in
the flow. Our analysis also provides an efficient method for numerical studies.
