Measured 2nd and 4th azimuthal anisotropy coefficients v_{2,4}(N_{part}),
p_T) are scaled with the initial eccentricity \varepsilon_{2,4}(N_{part}) of
the collision zone and studied as a function of the number of participants
N_{part} and the transverse momenta p_T. Scaling violations are observed for
$p_T \alt 3$ GeV/c, consistent with a $p_T^2$ dependence of viscous corrections
and a linear increase of the relaxation time with $p_T$. These empirical
viscous corrections to flow and the thermal distribution function at freeze-out
constrain estimates of the specific viscosity and the freeze-out temperature
for two different models for the initial collision geometry. The apparent
viscous corrections exhibit a sharp maximum for $p_T \agt 3$ GeV/c, suggesting
a breakdown of the hydrodynamic ansatz and the onset of a change from
flow-driven to suppression-driven anisotropy.
