In a previous work[1] exact stable oblique soliton solutions were revealed in
two dimensional nonlinear Schroedinger flow. In this work we show that single
soliton solution can be expressed within the Hirota bilinear formalism. An
attempt to build two-soliton solutions shows that the system is "close" to
integrability provided that the angle between the solitons is small and/or we
are in the hypersonic limit.
