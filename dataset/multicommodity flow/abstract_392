We report the elliptic flow of charged and identified particles at
mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=130$ GeV using the STAR
TPC at RHIC. The integrated elliptic flow signal, $v_2$, for charged particles
reaches values of about 0.06, indicating a higher degree of thermalization than
at lower energies. The differential elliptic flow signal, $v_2$($p_t$) up to
1.5 GeV/$c$, shows a behavior expected from hydrodynamic model calculations.
Above 1.5 GeV/$c$, the data deviate from the hydro predictions; however the
$v_2$($p_t$) is still large, suggesting finite asymmetry for the products of
hard scattering. For the identified particles, elliptic flow as a function of
$p_t$ and centrality differ significantly for particles of different masses.
This dependence can be accounted for in hydrodynamic models, indicating that
the system created shows a behavior consistent with collective hydrodynamical
flow.
