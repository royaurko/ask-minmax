We consider a one-dimensional partial differential equation system modeling
heat flow around a ring. The system includes a Klein-Gordon wave equation for a
field satisfying spatial periodic boundary conditions, as well as
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic differential equations with finite rank
dissipation and stochastic driving terms modeling heat baths.
  There is an energy flow around the ring. In the case of a linear field with
different (fixed) bath temperatures, the energy flow can persist even when the
interaction with the baths is turned off. A simple example is given.
