We examine the linear stability of fluid interfaces subjected to a shear
flow. Our main object is to generalize previous work to arbitrary Atwood
number, and to allow for surface tension and weak compressibility. The
motivation derives from instances in astrophysical systems where mixing across
material interfaces driven by shear flows may significantly affect the
dynamical evolution of these systems.
