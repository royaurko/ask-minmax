A strong differential transverse collective flow is predicted for the first
time to occur in heavy-ion collisions at balance energies. We also give a novel
explanation for the disappearance of the total transverse collective flow at
the balance energies. It is further shown that the differential flow especially
at high transverse momenta is a useful microscope capable of resolving the
balance energy's dual sensitivity to both the nuclear equation of state and
in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross sections in the reaction dynamics.
