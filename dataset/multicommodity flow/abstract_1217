The Refined Kolmogorov Similarity Hypothesis is a valuable tool for the
description of intermittency in isotropic conditions. For flows in presence of
a substantial mean shear, the nature of intermittency changes since the process
of energy transfer is affected by the turbulent kinetic energy production
associated with the Reynolds stresses. In these conditions a new form of
refined similarity law has been found able to describe the increased level of
intermittency which characterizes shear dominated flows. Ideally a length scale
associated with the mean shear separates the two ranges, i.e. the classical
Kolmogorov-like inertial range, below, and the shear dominated range, above.
However, the data analyzed in previous papers correspond to conditions where
the two scaling regimes can only be observed individually.
  In the present letter we give evidence of the coexistence of the two regimes
and support the conjecture that the statistical properties of the dissipation
field are practically insensible to the mean shear. This allows for a
theoretical prediction of the scaling exponents of structure functions in the
shear dominated range based on the known intermittency corrections for
isotropic flows. The prediction is found to closely match the available
numerical and experimental data.
