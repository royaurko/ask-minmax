An algorithm is constructed which allows to express conserved flows of
hyperbolic equations in terms of corresponding conserved densities and to
eliminate these flows from conservation laws of hyperbolic equations. The
application of this algorithm to canonical conservation laws gives constructive
necessary integrability conditions of hyperbolic equations in terms of the
generalized Laplace invariants of these equations.
