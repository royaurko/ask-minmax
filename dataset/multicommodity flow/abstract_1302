An accretion scenario in which the material captured by a black hole from its
environment is assumed to be magnetized (\beta ~ 1) is discussed. We show that
the accretion picture in this case is strongly affected by the magnetic field
of the flow itself. The accretion power within this Magnetically Controlled
Accretion (MCA) scenario is converted predominantly into the magnetic energy of
the accretion flow. The rapidly amplified field prevents the accretion flow
from forming a homogeneous Keplerian disk. Instead, the flow is decelerated by
its own magnetic field at a large distance (Shvartsman radius) from the black
hole and switches into a non-Keplerian dense magnetized slab. The material in
the slab is confined by the magnetic field and moves towards the black hole on
the time scale of the magnetic field annihilation. The basic parameters of the
slab are evaluated. Interchange instabilities in the slab may lead to a
formation of Z-pinch type configuration of the magnetic field over the slab in
which the accretion power can be converted into jets and high-energy radiation.
