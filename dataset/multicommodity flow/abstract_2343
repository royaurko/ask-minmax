A new analytical solution of the set of highly nonlinear two-fluid equations
is presented to explain the mechanism for the generation of "seed" magnetic
field and plasma flow by assuming the density n to have a profile like an
exponential in xy-plane and temperature profiles of electrons (ions) to be
linear in yz-plane. {It is shown that the baroclinic vectors -
$\nabla\Psi\times\nabla T_{j}$ (where $\Psi = ln\bar{n}, \bar{n}$ is normalized
density, and $T_{j}$ denote the temperatures of electrons and ions for j = e,
i) can generate not only the magnetic field but the plasma flow as well.} It is
also pointed out that the electron magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD) model has
inconsistencies because it does not take into account the ion dynamics while
the magnetic field is produced on slow time scale. The estimate of the
magnitude of the magnetic field in a classical laser plasma using this model is
in agreement with the experimental observations.
