Detailed understanding of two-phase gas liquid flows is imperative for
developing efficient multi-phase reactors through precise control of mixing and
reaction kinetics. The bubble column is a good apparatus for elementary studies
of such flows. In the current study experiments are conducted to assess the
effect of liquid viscosity on flow dynamics inside a bubble column. Corn oil
and water are used as the continuous media, and air was the dispersed media.
The objective of this effort is to use the results for a qualitative validation
of the numerical simulations.
