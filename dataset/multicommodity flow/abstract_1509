A new exact nonlinear Newtonian solution for a plane matter flow superimposed
on the isotropic Hubble expansion is reported. The dynamical effect of cosmic
vacuum is taken into account. The solution describes the evolution of nonlinear
perturbations via gravitational instability of matter and the termination of
the perturbation growth by anti-gravity of vacuum at the epoch of transition
from matter domination to vacuum domination. On this basis, an `approximate' 3D
solution is suggested as an analog of the Zeldovich ansatz.
