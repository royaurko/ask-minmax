We derive boundary conditions at interfaces (contact discontinuities) for a
class of Lagrangian models describing, in particular, bubbly flows. We use
these conditions to study Kelvin-Helmholtz' instability which develops in the
flow of two superposed layers of a pure incompressible fluid and a fluid
containing gas bubbles, co-flowing with different velocities. We show that the
presence of bubbles in one layer stabilizes the flow in some intervals of wave
lengths.
