We applied to an open flow a proper orthogonal decomposition (pod) technique,
on 2D snapshots of the instantaneous velocity field, to reveal the spatial
coherent structures responsible of the self-sustained oscillations observed in
the spectral distribution of time series. We applied the technique to 2D planes
out of 3D direct numerical simulations on an open cavity flow. The process can
easily be implemented on usual personal computers, and might bring deep
insights on the relation between spatial events and temporal signature in (both
numerical or experimental) open flows.
