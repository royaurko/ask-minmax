The traditional approach in the study of hydrodynamic stability of stratified
fluids includes the stick boundary conditions between layers. However, this
rule may be violated in polymer systems and as a consequence various
instabilities may arise. The main objective of this paper is to analyze
theoretically the influence of slip boundary conditions on the hydrodynamic
stability of the interface between two immiscible viscous layers subjected to
simple shear flow. It is found that the growth rate of long-wave disturbances
is fairly sensitive to the slip at the interface between layers as well as at
the external boundary. These phenomena are shown to give different
contributions to the stability of shear flow depending on viscosity, thickness,
and density ratios of the layers. Particularly, the interfacial slip can
increase the perturbation growth rate and lead to unstable flow. An important
consequence of this effect is the violation of stability for sheared layers
with equal viscosities and densities in a broad range of thickness ratios. The
conditions of long-wave propagation are analyzed as well, showing a strong
dependence on the type of boundary conditions.
