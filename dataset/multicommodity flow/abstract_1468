We have used the two spectrometers on the Infrared Space Observatory to
observe the HH 7-11 flow, its red-shifted counterpart, and the candidate
exciting source SVS 13, in the star formation region NGC 1333. We detect atomic
([OI]63um and 145um, [SiII]34.8um, [CII]158um) and molecular (H_2, CO, H_2O)
lines at various positions along the bipolar flow.
  Most of the observed lines can be explained in terms of shock-excited
emission. In particular, our analysis shows that dissociative (J-type) and
non-dissociative (C-type) shocks are simultaneously present everywhere along
both lobes of the flow. We confirm the low-excitation nature of the Herbig-Haro
nebulosities, with shock velocities <40-50 km/s. Toward both lobes of the
outflow we find pre-shock densities of n_0~10^4 cm-3 for both the J and C
components, implying B_0~100uG. In the central region of the flow, close to the
exciting source, the pre-shock density deduced for the C-shock component is
n_0~10^5 cm-3, suggesting a magnetic field ~3 times stronger. We propose that
the deficiency of gas-phase water in the post C-shock regions is due to
freezing onto warm grains processed through the J-shock front and traveling
along the magnetic field lines. The total observed cooling from the
dissociative shock components is consistent with the power lost by a slow
molecular outflow accelerated by a fast neutral HI wind.
  Finally, the skin of the cloud seen in projection toward the flow appears to
be weakly photo-ionised by BD +30 549, the dominant illuminating source of the
NGC 1333 reflection nebula.
