The relaxation times over which dissipative fluxes restore their steady state
values have been evaluated for a pion gas using the 14-moment method. The
effect of the medium has been implemented through a temperature dependent pi-pi
cross-section in the collision integral which is obtained by including one-loop
self-energies in the propagators of the exchanged rho and sigma mesons. To
account for chemical freeze out in heavy ion collisions, a temperature
dependent pion chemical potential has been introduced in the distribution
function. The temperature dependence of the relaxation times for shear and bulk
viscous flows as well as the heat flow is significantly affected.
