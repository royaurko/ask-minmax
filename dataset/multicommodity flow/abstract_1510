The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, developed originally to
calculate rarefied gas dynamical problems, is applied to continuous flow
including shocks assuming that the Knudsen number is sufficiently small. In
particular, we study the formation of spiral shocks in the accretion disc of a
close binary system. The method involves viscosity and thermal conduction
automatically, and can thus simulate turbulent viscosity.
