We analyze the reversals of the large scale flow in Rayleigh-B\'enard
convection both through particle image velocimetry flow visualization and
direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the underlying Boussinesq equations in a
(quasi) two-dimensional, rectangular geometry of aspect ratio 1. For medium
Prandtl number there is a diagonal large scale convection roll and two smaller
secondary rolls in the two remaining corners diagonally opposing each other.
These corner flow rolls play a crucial role for the large scale wind reversal:
They grow in kinetic energy and thus also in size thanks to plume detachments
from the boundary layers up to the time that they take over the main, large
scale diagonal flow, thus leading to reversal. Based on this mechanism we
identify a typical time scale for the reversals. We map out the Rayleigh number
vs Prandtl number phase space and find that the occurrence of reversals very
sensitively depends on these parameters.
