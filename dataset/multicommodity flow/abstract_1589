Large transverse momentum distributions of identified particles observed at
RHIC are analyzed by a relativistic stochastic model in the three dimensional
(non-Euclidean) rapidity space. A distribution function obtained from the model
is Gaussian-like in radial rapidity. It can well describe observed transverse
momentum $p_T$ distributions. Estimation of radial flow is made from the
analysis of $p_T$ distributions for $\bar{p}$ in Au + Au Collisions.
Temperatures are estimated from observed large $p_T$ distributions under the
assumption that the distribution function approaches to the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution in the lower momentum limit. Power-law behavior of large $p_T$
distribution is also derived from the model.
