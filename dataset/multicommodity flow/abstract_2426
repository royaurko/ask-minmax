The suppression and collective flow of open and hidden heavy flavor in
ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions is studied with the partonic transport
model Boltzmann Approach to MultiParton Scatterings (BAMPS). Charm and bottom
quarks interact with the rest of the medium via elastic scatterings with an
improved Debye screening and a running coupling. Heavy flavor electron data
from RHIC can only be described if the cross section is multiplied with K=3.5
to mimic the contribution from radiative processes. With the same value for K
we compare to elliptic flow data of D mesons at the LHC and find a good
agreement. However, the nuclear modification factor of D mesons, non-prompt
J/psi, muons, and electrons at the LHC is underestimated in our calculations.
In addition, we present first BAMPS results on the suppression and elliptic
flow of J/psi mesons, which are treated in the same framework.
