Using the generalised set of fluid equations that include the `Coriolis
force' along with the centrifugal and pressure gradient forces, we have
reanalysed the class of self similar solutions, with the pseudo-Newtonian
potential. We find that the class of solutions is well behaved for almost the
entire parameter space except for a few selected combinations of $\gamma$ and
$\alpha$ for the co-rotating flow. The analysis of the Bernoulli number shows
that whereas it remains positive for co-rotating flow for $f>1/3$, for the
counter-rotating flow it does admit both positive and negative values,
indicating the possibility of energy transfer in either direction.
