We have analyzed XMM-Newton Optical Monitor (OM) UV (180-400 nm) data for a
sample of 33 galaxies, of which 30 are cluster members. Nine of these are
central cluster galaxies (CCGs) in cooling flow clusters, having mass
deposition rates which span a range of 8 to 525 solar masses per year. Using
the ratio of UV to 2MASS J band flux, we find a significant UV excess in many,
but not all, cooling flow CCGs. This UV excess is a direct indication of the
presence of young massive stars, and therefore recent star formation, in these
galaxies. Using the Starburst99 spectral energy distribution (SED) model of
continuous star formation over a 900 Myr period, we derive star formation rates
of 0.2 to 219 solar masses per year for the cooling flow sample. For 2/3 of
this sample it is possible to equate Chandra/XMM cooling flow mass deposition
rates with UV inferred star formation rates, for a combination of starburst
lifetime and IMF slope. This is a pilot study of the well populated XMM UV
cluster archive and a more extensive follow up study is currently underway.
