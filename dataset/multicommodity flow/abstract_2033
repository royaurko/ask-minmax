We derive the BRST symmetry, Slavnov-Taylor identities and Nielsen identities
for the ABJM theories in ${\cal N}{=}3$ harmonic superspace. Further, the gauge
dependence of one-particle irreducible amplitudes in such superconformal
Chern-Simons theory is shown to be generated by a canonical flow with respect
to the extended Slavnov-Taylor identity, induced by the extended BRST
transformations (including the BRST transformations of the gauge parameters).
