We investigate time-dependent inviscid hydrodynamical accretion flows onto a
black hole using numerical simulations. We consider the accretion that consists
of hot tenuous gas with low specific angular momentum and cold dense gas with
high specific angular momentum. The former accretes continuously and the latter
highly intermittently as blobs. The high specific angular momentum gas blobs
bounce at the centrifugal barrier and create shock waves. The low specific
angular momentum gas is heated at the shock fronts and escapes along the
rotation axis. The outgoing gas evolves into pressure-driven jets. Jet
acceleration lasts until the shock waves fade out. The total amount of the mass
ejection is about 1-11 % of the mass of the blobs. The jet mass increases when
the gas blobs are more massive or have larger specific angular momentum. We get
narrower well-collimated jets when the hot continuous flow has a lower
temperature. In the numerical simulations we used a finite difference code
based on the total variation diminishing scheme. It is extended to include the
blackbody radiation and to apply the multi time step scheme for time marching.
