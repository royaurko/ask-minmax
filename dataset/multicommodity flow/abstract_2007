We generalize the Gubser solution of viscous hydrodynamics by including the
finite density effect and analytically compute the flow harmonics $v_n$. We
explicitly show how $v_n$ and their viscous corrections depend on the chemical
potential. The difference in $v_n$ between particles and antiparticles is also
analytically computed and shown to be proportional to various chemical
potentials and the viscosity. Excellent agreement is obtained between the
results and the available experimental data from the SPS, RHIC and the LHC.
