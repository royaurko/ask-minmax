Polymer solutions subject to pressure driven flow and in nanoscale slit pores
are systematically investigated using the dissipative particle dynamics
approach. We investigated the effect of molecular weight, polymer concentration
and flow rate on the profiles across the channel of the fluid and polymer
velocities, polymers density, and the three components of the polymers radius
of gyration. We found that the mean streaming fluid velocity decreases as the
polymer molecular weight or/and polymer concentration is increased, and that
the deviation of the velocity profile from the parabolic profile is accentuated
with increase in polymer molecular weight or concentration. We also found that
the distribution of polymers conformation is highly anisotropic and non-uniform
across the channel. The polymer density profile is also found to be
non-uniform, exhibiting a local minimum in the center-plane followed by two
symmetric peaks. We found a migration of the polymer chains either from or
towards the walls. For relatively long chains, as compared to the thickness of
the slit, a migration towards the walls is observed. However, for relatively
short chains, a migration away from the walls is observed.
