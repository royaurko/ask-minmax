We study the blowup behavior at infinity of the normalized Kahler-Ricci flow
on a Fano manifold which does not admit Kahler-Einstein metrics. We prove an
estimate for the Kahler potential away from a multiplier ideal subscheme, which
implies that the volume forms along the flow converge to zero locally uniformly
away from the same set. Similar results are also proved for Aubin's continuity
method.
