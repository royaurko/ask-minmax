Higher-order anisotropic flows $v_{4}$ and $v_{6}$ in heavy ion collisions at
the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider are studied in a multiphase transport model
that has previously been used successfully for describing the elliptic flow
$v_2$ in these collisions. We find that the same parton scattering cross
section of about 10 \textrm{mb} used in explaining the measured $v_2$ can also
reproduce the recent data on $v_{4}$ and $v_{6}$ from Au + Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s}=200$ \textrm{AGeV}. It is further found that the $% v_{4}$ is a more
sensitive probe of the initial partonic dynamics in these collisions than
$v_{2}$. Moreover, higher-order parton anisotropic flows are nonnegligible and
satisfy the scaling relation $v_{n,q}(p_{T})\sim v_{2,q}^{n/2}(p_{T})$, which
leads naturally to the observed similar scaling relation among hadron
anisotropic flows when the coalescence model is used to describe hadron
production from the partonic matter.
