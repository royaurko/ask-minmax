In this paper we introduce the hyperbolic mean curvature flow and prove that
the corresponding system of partial differential equations are strictly
hyperbolic, and based on this, we show that this flow admits a unique
short-time smooth solution and possesses the nonlinear stability defined on the
Euclidean space with dimension larger than 4. We derive nonlinear wave
equations satisfied by some geometric quantities related to the hyperbolic mean
curvature flow. Moreover, we also discuss the relation between the equations
for hyperbolic mean curvature flow and the equations for extremal surfaces in
the Minkowski space-time.
