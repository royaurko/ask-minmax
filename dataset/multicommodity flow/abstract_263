Directed flow in ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions is analyzed
using the reaction plane from elliptic flow, which reduces the bias from
nonflow effects. We combine this method with the determination of elliptic flow
from Lee-Yang zeroes. The resulting method is more consistent and somewhat
easier to implement than the previously used method based on three-particle
cumulants, and is also less biased by nonflow correlations. Error terms from
residual nonflow correlations are carefully estimated, as well as statistical
errors. We discuss the application of the method at RHIC and LHC.
