We study the participant-spectator matter at the energy of vanishing flow for
neutron-rich systems. Our study reveals similar behaviour of
articipant-spectator for neutron-rich systems as for stable systems and also
points towards nearly mass independence behaviour of participant-spectator
matter for neutron-rich systems at the energy of vanishing flow. We also study
the thermalization reached in the reactions of neutron-rich systems.
