In this paper, the reservoir is modeled by homogeneous two-phase media based
on BISQ model. We focus on the effects of the squirt flow on the fundamental
guided waves propagation in borehole embedded in saturated porous media excited
by monopole, dipole and quadrupole point sources. The full waveforms acoustic
logging in a fluid-filled borehole are simulated. The curves of velocity
dispersion, attenuation coefficients and excitation of the fundamental guided
waves have shown that velocity dispersions are almost independent of the
characteristic squirt flow length, attenuations of guided waves are enhanced
due to the squirt flow, and excitations of guided waves are decreased due to
the squirt flow. It is possible to estimate the characteristic squirt flow
length by attenuation coefficients of the guided waves from acoustical logging
data.
