We present our measurement of the "bulk flow" using the kinetic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect in the WMAP 7-year data. As the tracer of
peculiar velocities, we use Planck Early Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Detected Cluster
Catalog and a compilation of X-ray detected galaxy cluster catalogs based on
ROSAT All-Sky Survey. We build a full-sky kSZ template and fit it to the WMAP
data in W-band. Using a Wiener filter we maximize the signal to noise ratio of
the kSZ cluster signal in the data. We find no significant detection of the
bulk flow, and our results are consistent with the LCDM prediction.
