In this work we study the long time, inviscid limit of the 2D Navier-Stokes
equations near the periodic Couette flow, and in particular, we confirm at the
nonlinear level the qualitative behavior predicted by Kelvin's 1887 linear
analysis. At high Reynolds number Re, we prove that the solution behaves
qualitatively like 2D Euler for times t \lesssim Re^(1/3), and in particular
exhibits inviscid damping (e.g. the vorticity weakly approaches a shear flow).
For times t \gtrsim Re^(1/3), which is sooner than the natural dissipative time
scale O(Re), the viscosity becomes dominant and the streamwise dependence of
the vorticity is rapidly eliminated by an enhanced dissipation effect.
Afterward, the remaining shear flow decays on very long time scales t \gtrsim
Re back to the Couette flow. When properly defined, the dissipative
length-scale in this setting is L_D \sim Re^(-1/3), larger than the scale L_D
\sim Re^(-1/2) predicted in classical Batchelor-Kraichnan 2D turbulence theory.
The class of initial data we study is the sum of a sufficiently smooth function
and a small (with respect to Re^(-1)) $L^2$ function.
