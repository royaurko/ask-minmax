We prove the convexity estimates of Huisken-Sinestrari for finite-time
singularities of mean-convex, mean curvature flow with free boundary in a
barrier $S$. Here $S$ can be any properly embedded, oriented surface in
$R^{n+1}$ of bounded geometry. We also give an alternative proof that convex
mean curvature flows with free boundary in $S^n$ pinch to umbilic.
