We discuss a very naive but natural idea that time emerges as the holographic
dimension of gauge systems in euclidean space, which take statistic, e.g. Ising
model as concrete implementations. By identifying the renormalization group
flow of statistic models with the time flow of dual gravities, we get a
universe whose evolution history is qualitatively the same as our real world.
We comment highlights projected by this idea on the cosmological constant
problem and develop preliminary evidences for the validity of this idea.
