At present in the fluid mechanics, mostly one like to use the vortex as a
basic physical quantity, such that some exact solutions is based on the
vorticity evolution equation. For the vortex flow problem with axisymmetry, it
is well known that there exists in the circulation as a mechanical system of
basic physical quantities. In this paper, from the basic dynamic equation of
the mechanical system, the self-similar solution, eigenvalue system into a
self- consistent, new exact solutions of the two-dimensional circular symmetric
vortex flow are obtained, and some further comparison are made with the known
exact solutions. Key words: vortex motion, exact solution, eigenvalue system
