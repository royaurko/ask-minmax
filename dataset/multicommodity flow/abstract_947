In this article we investigate the dynamics of special solutions to the
surface diffusion flow of idealised ribbons. This equation reduces to studying
the curve diffusion flow for the profile curve of the ribbon. We provide: (1) a
complete classification of stationary solutions; (2) qualitative results on
shrinkers, translators, and rotators; and (3) an explicit parametrisation of a
shrinking figure eight curve.
