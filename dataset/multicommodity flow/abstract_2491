We study the collapsing behavior of the Kaehler-Ricci flow on a compact
Kaehler manifold X admitting a holomorphic submersion X -> S coming from its
canonical class, where S is a Kaehler manifold with dim S < dim X. We show that
the flow metric degenerates at exactly the rate of e^{-t} as predicted by the
cohomology information, and so the fibers collapse at the optimal rate diameter
~ e^{-t/2}. Consequently, it leads to some analytic and geometric extensions to
the regular case of Song-Tian's works on elliptic and Calabi-Yau fibrations.
Its applicability to general Calabi-Yau fibrations with possibly singular
fibers will also be discussed in local sense.
