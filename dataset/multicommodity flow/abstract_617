The directed and elliptic flow of protons and negative pions in 4.2A GeV/c
C+C collisions is studied using the Fourier analysis of azimuthal
distributions. It is found that the protons exhibit pronounced directed flow,
while the flow of pions is either non existent or too weak to be detected
experimentally. Also, it is found that in the entire rapidity interval the
elliptic flow is very small if not zero. These results are confirmed by the
Quark-Gluon-String Model (QGSM) and the relativistic transport model (ART 1.0),
except that these models predict very weak antiflow of pions. The more detailed
comparison with the QGSM suggests that the decay of resonances and rescattering
of secondaries dominantly determine the proton and negative pion flow at this
energy.
