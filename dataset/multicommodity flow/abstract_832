We consider a magnetic flow without conjugate points on a closed manifold $M$
with generating vector field $\G$. Let $h\in C^{\infty}(M)$ and let $\theta$ be
a smooth 1-form on $M$. We show that the cohomological equation \[\G(u)=h\circ
\pi+\theta\] has a solution $u\in C^{\infty}(SM)$ only if $h=0$ and $\theta$ is
closed. This result was proved in \cite{DP2} under the assumption that the flow
of $\G$ is Anosov.
