We have developed a three-dimensional numerical model and applied it to
simulate plasma flows in semi-detached binary systems whose accretor possesses
a strong intrinsic magnetic field. The model is based on the assumption that
the plasma dynamics are determined by the slow mean flow, which forms a
backdrop for the rapid propagation of MHD waves. The equations describing the
slow motion of matter were obtained by averaging over rapidly propagating
pulsations. The numerical model includes the diffusion of magnetic field by
current dissipation in turbulent vortices, magnetic buoyancy, and wave MHD
turbulence. A modified three-dimensional, parallel, numerical code was used to
simulate the flow structure in close binary systems with various accretor
magnetic fields, from $10^5$ to $10^8$ G. The conditions for the formation of
the accretion disk and the criteria distinguishing the two types of flow
corresponding to intermediate polars and polars are discussed.
