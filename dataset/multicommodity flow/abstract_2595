Rivulets and their meandering on a partially wetting surface present an
interesting problem, as complex behavior arises from a deceptively simple
setup. Recently Couvreur and Daerr suggested that meandering is caused by an
instability developing as the flow rate $Q$ increases to a critical value
$Q_c$, with stationary (pinned) meandering being the final state of the flow.
We tried to verify this assertion experimentally, but instead produced results
contradicting the claim of Couvreur and Daerr. The likely reason behind the
discrepancy is the persistence of flow-rate perturbations. Moreover, the theory
presented in this paper cannot reproduce the states as considered and disagrees
with other theories.
