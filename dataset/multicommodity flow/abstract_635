We study generation of magnetic fields involving large spatial scales by
time- and space-periodic small-scale parity-invariant flows. The anisotropic
magnetic eddy diffusivity tensor is calculated by the standard procedure
involving expansion of magnetic modes and their growth rates in power series in
the scale ratio. Our simulations, conducted for flows with random harmonic
composition and exponentially decaying energy spectra, demonstrate that
enlargement of the spatial scale of magnetic field is beneficial for generation
by time-periodic flows. However, they turn out, in general, to be less
efficient dynamos, than steady flows.
