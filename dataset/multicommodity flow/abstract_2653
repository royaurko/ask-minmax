A discrete Boltzmann model (DBM) is developed to investigate the
Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) in compressible flows. Compressibility
effects are investigated by inspecting the interplay between thermodynamic and
hydrodynamic non-equilibrium manifestations (TNE, HNE, respectively) and their
impact on the dynamics of the bubble and the spike at the interface between the
heavy and the light fluid. To this purpose, two effective approaches are
presented, one tracking the \emph{local} TNE manifestations and the other
focussing on the mean temperature of the flow. Both compressibility effect and
the \emph{global} TNE intensity show different trends in the initial and the
later stages of the instability. Compressibility is found to retard the initial
stage of the RTI and accelerate the later one. It is also found that TNE
effects are generally enhanced by compressibility, especially in the later
stage of the instability.
