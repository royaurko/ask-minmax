We propose the time-dependent generalization of an `ordinary' autonomous
human biomechanics, in which total mechanical + biochemical energy is not
conserved. We introduce a general framework for time-dependent biomechanics in
terms of jet manifolds derived from the extended musculo-skeletal configuration
manifold. The corresponding Riemannian geometrical evolution follows the Ricci
flow diffusion. In particular, we show that the exponential-like decay of total
biomechanical energy (due to exhaustion of biochemical resources) is closely
related to the Ricci flow on the biomechanical configuration manifold.
