We provide an explicit representation of the nonequilibrium invariant measure
for a chain of harmonic oscillators with conservative noise in the presence of
stationary heat flow. By first determining the covariance matrix, we are able
to express the measure as the product of Gaussian distributions aligned along
some collective modes that are spatially localized with power-law tails.
Numerical studies show that such a representation applies also to a purely
deterministic model, the quartic Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chain.
