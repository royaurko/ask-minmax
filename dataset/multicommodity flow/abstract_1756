We derive a new functional renormalization group equation for Hamiltonian
Yang-Mills theory in Coulomb gauge. The flow equations for the static gluon and
ghost propagators are solved under the assumption of ghost dominance within
different diagrammatic approximations. The results are compared to those
obtained in the variational approach and the reliability of the approximations
is discussed.
