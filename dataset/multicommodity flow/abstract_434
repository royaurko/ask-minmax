We present a simple numerical model of the plasma flow within the open field
line tube in the pulsar magnetosphere. We study how the plasma screens the
rotationally induced electric field and maintains the electric current demanded
by the global structure of the magnetosphere. We show that even though bulk of
the plasma moves outwards with relativistic velocities, a small fraction of
particles is continuously redirected back forming reverse plasma flows. The
density and composition (positrons or electrons, or both) of these reverse
flows are determined by the distribution of the Goldreich-Julian charge density
along the tube and by the global magnetospheric current. These reverse flows
could significantly affect the process of the pair plasma production in the
polar cap accelerator. Our simulations also show that formation of the reverse
flows is accompanied by the generation of long wavelength plasma oscillations,
which could be converted, via the induced scattering on the bulk plasma flow,
into the observed radio emission.
