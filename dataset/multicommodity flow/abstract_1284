Hinode observations have provided a new view of outflows from the Sun. These
have been focussed in particular on flows emanating from the edges of active
regions. These flows are long lasting and seem to exist to some extent in every
active region. The flows measured have values ranging between tens of km
s$^{-1}$ and 200 km s$^{-1}$. Various explanations have been put forward to
explain these flows including reconnection, waves, and compression. Outflows
have also been observed in coronal holes and this review will discuss those as
well as the interaction of coronal holes with active regions. Although
outflowing plasma has been observed in all regions of the Sun from quiet Sun to
active regions, it is not clear how much of this plasma contributes to the
solar wind. I will discuss various attempts to prove that the outflowing plasma
forms part of the solar wind.
