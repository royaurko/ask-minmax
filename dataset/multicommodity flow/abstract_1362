Using the previously developed model to describe laminar/turbulent states of
a viscous fluid flow, which treats the flow as a collection of coherent
structures of various size (Chekmarev, Chaos, 2013, 013144), the statistical
temperature of the flow state is determined as a function of the Reynolds
number. It is shown that at small Reynolds numbers, associated with laminar
states, the temperature is positive, while at large Reynolds numbers,
associated with turbulent states, it is negative. At intermediate Reynolds
numbers, the temperature changes from positive to negative as the size of the
coherent structures increases, similar to what was predicted by Onsager for a
system of parallel point-vortices in an inviscid fluid. It is also shown that
in the range of intermediate Reynolds numbers the temperature exhibits a
power-law divergence characteristic of second-order phase transitions.
