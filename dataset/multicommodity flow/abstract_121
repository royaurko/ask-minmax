It is the purpose of this article to establish a technical tool to study
regularity of solutions to parabolic equations on manifolds. As applications of
this technique, we prove that solutions to the Ricci-DeTurck flow, the surface
diffusion flow and the mean curvature flow enjoy joint analyticity in time and
space, and solutions to the Ricci flow admit temporal analyticity.
