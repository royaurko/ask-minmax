The goal of this work is to study the incidence rate of "cooling flows" in
the high redshift clusters using Chandra observations of z>0.5 objects from a
new large, X-ray selected catalog. We find that only a very small fraction of
high-z objects have cuspy X-ray brightness profiles, which is a characteristic
feature of the cooling flow clusters at z~0. The observed lack of cooling flows
is most likely a consequence of a higher rate of major mergers at z>0.5.
