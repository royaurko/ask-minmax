For accurate simulations of rarefied gas flows around moving obstacles, we
propose a cut cell method on Cartesian grids: it allows exact conservation and
accurate treatment of boundary conditions. Our approach is designed to treat
Cartesian cells and various kind of cut cells by the same algorithm, with no
need to identify the specific shape of each cut cell. This makes the
implementation quite simple, and allows a direct extension to 3D problems. Such
simulations are also made possible by using an adaptive mesh refinement
technique and a hybrid parallel implementation. This is illustrated by several
test cases, including a 3D unsteady simulation of the Crookes radiometer.
