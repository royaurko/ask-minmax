This research is focused on linear analysis of a plane-parallel flow
stability in a transverse magnetic field (Hartmann flow) within a convective
approximation. We derive and solve equations describing the perturbation
growth. Perturbation modes and their nonexcitation conditions have been
determined. An equation for the instability increment has been derived and it
is shown that the equation has an unstable root. Additionally, we show that the
resulting instabilities qualitatively agree with the experimental data.
