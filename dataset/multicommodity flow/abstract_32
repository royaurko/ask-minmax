Centrality dependence of charged particles multiplicity, transverse momentum
spectra, integrated and differential elliptic flow, in $\sqrt{s}_{NN}$=200 GeV
Au+Au collisions are analyzed using event by event ideal hydrodynamics.
Monte-Carlo Glauber model of initial condition, constrained to reproduce
experimental charged particle's multiplicity in 0-10% Au+Au collisions,
reasonably well reproduces all the experimental observables, e.g. centrality
dependence of charged particles multiplicity, integrated and differential
elliptic flow. Model predictions for higher flow harmonics, $v_3$, $v_4$
however overestimate the experimental data, more in the peripheral collisions
than in the central collisions. Correlation between initial (spatial) asymmetry
measures and flow coefficients are also studied. With exception of the elliptic
flow, for all the higher flow coefficients ($v_n$,n=3-5), correlation is
reduced with collision centrality. In peripheral collisions, higher flow
coefficients are only weakly correlated to the asymmetry measures. Elliptic
flow however, remains strongly correlated with initial eccentricity in all the
collision centralities.
