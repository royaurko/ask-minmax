Some work in progress is announced, on the use of algebraic geometry, mostly
concerning elliptic curve theory, to model turbulence. Attention is given to
flows across the scales, on some convenient model space, and some current
trials are exposed, where one seeks for an ordinal correlation between the
escape rates of some L functions and a proper observable on these mentioned
flows across the scales.
