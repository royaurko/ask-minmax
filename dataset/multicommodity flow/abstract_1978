We continue to study an infinite-parametric family of gauge theories with an
arbitrary function of the self-dual part of the field strength as the
Lagrangian. The arising one-loop divergences are computed using the background
field method. We show that they can all be absorbed by a local redefinition of
the gauge field, as well as multiplicative renormalisations of the couplings.
Thus, this family of theories is one-loop renormalisable. The infinite set of
beta-functions for the couplings is compactly stored in a renormalisation group
flow for a single function of the curvature. The flow is obtained explicitly.
