Non-trivial geometrical effects in relativistic central collisions of
deformed nuclei are studied using a simple version of optical Glauber model.
For very small impact parameters large centrality and eccentricity fluctuations
are observed. In very high multiplicity collisions of oblate nuclei (e.g. Au
and Cu) significant fraction of events with elliptic flow strength v_2
dependent on oblateness beta_2 is predicted.
