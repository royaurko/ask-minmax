We extend and reconcile recent work on turbulence and particle heating in
advection-dominated accretion flows. For approximately equipartition magnetic
fields, the turbulence primarily heats the electrons. For weaker magnetic
fields, the protons are primarily heated. The division between electron and
proton heating occurs between $\beta \sim 5$ and $\beta \sim 100$ (where
$\beta$ is the ratio of the gas to the magnetic pressure), depending on unknown
details of how Alfv\'en waves are converted into whistlers on scales of the
proton Larmor radius. We also discuss the possibility that magnetic
reconnection could be a significant source of electron heating.
