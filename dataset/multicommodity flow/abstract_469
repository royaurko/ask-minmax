We study elliptic and triangular flow in the collisions of deuteron-gold
nuclei at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 200$ GeV at RHIC and of proton-lead nuclei at
$\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV at the LHC, utilizing (3+1)-dimensional ideal
hydrodynamics for the dynamic evolution of the fireball and a Glauber-based
Monte-Carlo energy deposition model for simulating the fluctuating initial
conditions. Sizable values of elliptic and triangular flow are obtained for
both colliding systems, and the results are consistent with PHENIX, ALICE,
ATLAS and CMS measurements. For these studied centralities, we find that the
elliptic flow in proton-lead collisions is smaller than deuteron-gold
collisions, while the triangular flows are comparable in both colliding
systems. Our results indicate that the observed collective anisotropic flow in
deuteron-gold and proton-lead collisions may be obtained from relativistic
hydrodynamic evolution of the fireball with initial state fluctuations.
