We study solutions of the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation to better
understand dynamical instabilities occurring in flowing atomic condensates.
Whereas transonic stationary flows can be fully described in simple terms,
time-dependent flows exhibit a wide variety of behaviors. When the sound speed
is crossed once, we observe that flows analogous to black holes obey something
similar to the so-called no hair theorem since their late time profile is
stationary and uniquely fixed by parameters entering the Hamiltonian and
conserved quantities. For flows analogous to white holes, at late time one
finds a macroscopic undulation in the supersonic side which has either a fixed
amplitude, or a widely varying one signaling a quasi periodic emission of
solitons on the subsonic side. When considering flows which cross the sound
speed twice, we observe various scenarios which can be understood from the
above behaviors, and from the hierarchy of the growth rates of the dynamical
instabilities characterizing such flows.
