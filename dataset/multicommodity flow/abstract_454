Let S be an ergodic measure-preserving automorphism on a non-atomic
probability space, and let T be the time-one map of a topologically weak mixing
suspension flow over an irreducible subshift of finite type under a Holder
ceiling function. We show that if the measure-theoretic entropy of S is
strictly less than the topological entropy of T, then there exists an embedding
from the measure-preserving automorphism into the suspension flow. As a
corollary of this result and the symbolic dynamics for geodesic flows on
compact surfaces of negative curvature developed by Bowen and Ratner, we also
obtain an embedding from the measure-preserving automorphism into a geodesic
flow, whenever the measure-theoretic entropy of S is strictly less than the
topological entropy of the time-one map of the geodesic flow.
