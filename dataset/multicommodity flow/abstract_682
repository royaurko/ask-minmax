We compute three-point functions for the $SL(2,\mathbb R)$-WZNW model. After
reviewing the case of the two-point correlator, we compute spectral flow
preserving and nonpreserving correlation functions in the space-time picture
involving three vertex operators carrying an arbitrary amount of spectral flow.
When only one or two insertions have nontrivial spectral flow numbers, the
method we employ allows us to find expressions without any constraint on the
spin values. Unlike these cases, the same procedure restrains the possible spin
configurations when three vertices belong to nonzero spectral flow sectors. We
perform several consistency checks on our results. In particular, we verify
that they are in complete agreement with previously computed correlators
involving states carrying a single unit of spectral flow.
