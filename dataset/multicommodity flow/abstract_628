We investigate how a horizontal plane Poiseuille shear flow changes linear
convection properties in binary fluid layers heated from below. The full linear
field equations are solved with a shooting method for realistic top and bottom
boundary conditions. Through-flow induced changes of the bifurcation thresholds
(stability boundaries) for different types of convective solutions are deter-
mined in the control parameter space spanned by Rayleigh number, Soret coupling
(positive as well as negative), and through-flow Reynolds number. We elucidate
the through-flow induced lifting of the Hopf symmetry degeneracy of left and
right traveling waves in mixtures with negative Soret coupling. Finally we
determine with a saddle point analysis of the complex dispersion relation of
the field equations over the complex wave number plane the borders between
absolute and convective instabilities for different types of perturbations in
comparison with the appropriate Ginzburg-Landau amplitude equation
approximation. PACS:47.20.-k,47.20.Bp, 47.15.-x,47.54.+r
