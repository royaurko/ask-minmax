We investigate the influences of the outer boundary conditions(OBCs) on the
structure of an optically thin accretion flow. We find that OBC plays an
important role in determining the topological structure and the profiles of the
surface density and temperature of the solution, therefore it should be
regarded as a new parameter in the accretion disk model.
