Using a generalization of vector calculus for the case of non-integer
dimensional space we consider a Poiseuille flow of an incompressible viscous
fractal fluid in the pipe. Fractal fluid is described as a continuum in
non-integer dimensional space. A generalization of the Navier-Stokes equations
for non-integer dimensional space, its solution for steady flow of fractal
fluid in a pipe and corresponding fractal fluid discharge are suggested.
