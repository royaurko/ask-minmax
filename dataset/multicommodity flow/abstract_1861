This paper puts forth several closure models for the proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD) reduced order modeling of fluid flows. These new closure
models, together with other standard closure models, are investigated in the
numerical simulation of the Burgers equation. This simplified setting
represents just the first step in the investigation of the new closure models.
It allows a thorough assessment of the performance of the new models, including
a parameter sensitivity study. Two challenging test problems displaying moving
shock waves are chosen in the numerical investigation. The closure models and a
standard Galerkin POD reduced order model are benchmarked against the fine
resolution numerical simulation. Both numerical accuracy and computational
efficiency are used to assess the performance of the models.
