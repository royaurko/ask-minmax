The use of continuum mechanics and invariants built from the deviator as an
adequate foundation for rheology has been recently disputed by this contributor.
Here we give a specific example of the kind of parcel deformations that are
uniquely decomposed by way of microscopic motions into a maximal rotation, a
pure shear and an extension. The construction of these equations depends on
only one free material parameter but they have no nice form in terms of the
operations of vector and tensor calculus which may be why they were overlooked.
Although the first order flow is often sufficient to give the rheological
information, finite sized parcel deformations can give confusion because of
boundary effects, the relevance of which are highly dependent on the global
geometry of the experiment.
