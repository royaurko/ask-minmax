We consider the smooth inverse mean curvature flow of strictly convex
hypersurfaces with boundary embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1},$ which are
perpendicular to the unit sphere from the inside. We prove that the flow
hypersurfaces converge to the embedding of a flat disk in the norm of
$C^{1,\beta},$ $\beta<1.$
