We present results for the quenching, elliptic flow and azimuthal
correlations of heavy flavour particles in high-energy nucleus-nucleus
collisions obtained through the POWLANG transport setup, developed in the past
to study the propagation of heavy quarks in the Quark-Gluon Plasma and here
extended to include a modeling of their hadronization in the presence of a
medium. Hadronization is described as occurring via the fragmentation of
strings with endpoints given by the heavy (anti-)quark Q(Qbar) and a thermal
parton qbar(q) from the medium. The flow of the light quarks is shown to affect
significantly the R_AA and v_2 of the final D mesons, leading to a better
agreement with the experimental data. The approach allows also predictions for
the angular correlation between heavy-flavour hadrons (or their decay
electrons) and the charged particles produced in the fragmentation of the
heavy-quark strings.
