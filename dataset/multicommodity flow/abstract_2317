Using a transport model coupled with a phase-space coalescence after-burner
we study the triton-3He relative and differential transverse flows in
semi-central 132Sn+124Sn reactions at a beam energy of 400 MeV/nucleon. We find
that the triton-3He pairs carry interesting information about the density
dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy. The t-3He relative flow can be used
as a particularly powerful probe of the high-density behavior of the nuclear
symmetry energy.
