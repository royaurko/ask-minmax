We show that any locally conformally flat ancient solution to the Ricci flow
must be rotationally symmetric. As a by-product, we prove that any locally
conformally flat Ricci soliton is a gradient soliton in the shrinking and
steady cases as well as in the expanding case, provided the soliton has
nonnegative curvature.
