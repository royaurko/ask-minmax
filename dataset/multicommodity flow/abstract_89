A new infinitesimal characterization of completely positive but not
necessarily homomorphic Markov flows from a C^*-algebra to bounded operators on
the boson Fock space over L^2(R) is given. Contrarily to previous
characterizations, based on stochastic differential equations, this
characterization is universal, i.e. valid for arbitrary Markov flows. With this
result the study of Markov flows is reduced to the study of four
C_0-semigroups. This includes the classical case and even in this case it seems
to be new. The result is applied to deduce a new existence theorem for Markov
flows.
