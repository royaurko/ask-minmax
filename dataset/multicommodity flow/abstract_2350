We study the spin dependence of accretion onto rotating Kerr black holes
using analytic techniques. In its linear regime, angular momentum transport in
MHD turbulent accretion flow involves the generation of radial magnetic field
connecting plasma in a differentially rotating flow. We take a first principles
approach, highlighting the constraint that limits the generation and
amplification of radial magnetic fields, stemming from the transfer of energy
from mechanical to magnetic form. Because the energy transferred in magnetic
form is ultimately constrained by gravitational potential energy or Killing
energy, the spin-dependence of the latter allows us to derive spin-dependent
constraints on the success of the accreting plasma to expel its angular
momentum and accrete. We find an inverse relationship between this ability and
black hole spin. If this radial magnetic field generation forms the basis for
angular momentum transfer in accretion flows, accretion rates involving Kerr
black holes are expected to be lower as the black hole spin increases in the
prograde sense.
