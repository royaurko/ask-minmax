We investigate energy dissipation associated with the motion of the scalar
condensate in a holographic superconductor model constructed from the charged
scalar field coupled to the Maxwell field. Upon application of constant
magnetic and electric fields, we analytically construct the vortex flow
solution, and find the vortex flow resistance near the second-order phase
transition where the scalar condensate begins. The characteristic feature of
the non-equilibrium state agrees with the one predicted by the time-dependent
Ginzburg-Landau(TDGL) theory. We evaluate the kinetic coefficient in the TDGL
equation along the line of the second-order phase transition. At zero magnetic
field, the other coefficients in the TDGL equation are also evaluated just
below the critical temperature.
