Low angular momentum accretion flows very often have centrifugal pressure
supported standing shock waves which can accelerate flow particles. The
accelerated particles in turn emit synchrotron radiation in presence of
magnetic fields. Efficient cooling of the electrons reduces its temperature in
comparison to the protons. In this paper, we assume two temperature flows to
explore this property of shocks and present an example of the emitted radiation
spectrum.
