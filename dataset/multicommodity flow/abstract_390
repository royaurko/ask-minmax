We describe a numerical procedure to construct a modified velocity field that
does not have any mean flow. Using this procedure, we present two results.
Firstly, we show that, in the absence of mean flow, spiral defect chaos
collapses to a stationary pattern comprising textures of stripes with angular
bends. The quenched patterns are characterized by mean wavenumbers that
approach those uniquely selected by focus-type singularities, which, in the
absence of mean flow, lie at the zig-zag instability boundary. The quenched
patterns also have larger correlation lengths and are comprised of rolls with
less curvature. Secondly, we describe how mean flow can contribute to the
commonly observed phenomenon of rolls terminating perpendicularly into lateral
walls. We show that, in the absence of mean flow, rolls begin to terminate into
lateral walls at an oblique angle. This obliqueness increases with Rayleigh
number.
