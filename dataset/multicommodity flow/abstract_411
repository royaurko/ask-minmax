The solution of a momentum conservation equation for the gas and liquid
stream in the flowing element is obtained on the basis of the modern approach
to a problem on contact interaction of bodies and mediums. A flowing element,
system are: pipe, tube, orifice, mouthpiece, diffuser, etc. and its
combination. The integration of the differential equation has reduced to
distribution law of static head along the length of flowing element and has
proved the elementary algebraic solution that introduced in the previous paper
by these contributors. The received solution allows to describe the motion of fluid
medium in non-stationary conditions, under action of any time-varying physical
factors: a roughness of streamlined surface, the area of the section of the
flowing element, the heat exchange with the streamlined surface, the technical
work, the additional weight flow of fluid medium.
