Life depends as much on the flow of information as on the flow of energy.
Here we review the many efforts to make this intuition precise. Starting with
the building blocks of information theory, we explore examples where it has
been possible to measure, directly, the flow of information in biological
networks, or more generally where information theoretic ideas have been used to
guide the analysis of experiments. Systems of interest range from single
molecules (the sequence diversity in families of proteins) to groups of
organisms (the distribution of velocities in flocks of birds), and all scales
in between. Many of these analyses are motivated by the idea that biological
systems may have evolved to optimize the gathering and representation of
information, and we review the experimental evidence for this optimization,
again across a wide range of scales.
