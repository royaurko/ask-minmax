The basic features of the Poynting flux from the horizon and the ergosphere
of a black hole and from the accreting flow onto a black hole are discussed for
the force-free magnetosphere. The accretion flow dominated by the Poynting flux
is discussed and the possible Poynting flux from the equatorial plane inside
the ergosphere is discussed.
