The Burton-Cabrera-Frank (BCF) model for the flow of line defects (steps) on
crystal surfaces has offered useful insights into nanostructure evolution. This
model has rested on phenomenological grounds. Our goal is to show via scaling
arguments the emergence of the BCF theory for non-interacting steps from a
stochastic atomistic scheme of a simplified kinetic solid-on-solid model in one
spatial dimension. Our main assumptions are: adsorbed atoms (adatoms) form a
dilute system, and elastic effects of the crystal lattice are absent. The step
edge is treated as a front that propagates via probabilistic rules for atom
attachment and detachment at the step. We formally derive a quasistatic step
flow description by averaging out the stochastic scheme when terrace diffusion,
adatom desorption and deposition from above are present.
