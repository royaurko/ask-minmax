It is generally argued that most clusters of galaxies host cooling flows in
which radiative cooling in the centre causes a slow inflow. However, recent
observations by Chandra and XMM conflict with the predicted cooling flow rates.
It has been suggested that radio jets that are situated at the centre of
clusters of galaxies can assist in reducing the deposition of cold gas. Radio
jets inflate cavities of hot radio plasma that rise through the cluster
atmosphere and thus stir the intra-cluster medium. In this letter it is
investigated whether this scenario is consistent with the pronounced
metallicity gradients that have been observed in the cores of clusters.
