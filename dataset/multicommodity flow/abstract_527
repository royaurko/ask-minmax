The pseudorapidity behaviour of the azimuthal anisotropy parameters v_1 and
v_2 of inclusive charged hadrons and their dependence on the centrality has
been studied in Au+Au collisions at full RHIC energy of sqrt(s) = 200 GeV
within the microscopic quark-gluon string model. The QGSM simulation results
for the directed flow v_1 show antiflow alignment within the pseudorapidity
range |eta| < 2 in a fair agreement with the experimental v_1(eta) data, but
cannot reproduce the further development of the antiflow up to |eta| around
3.5. The eta dependence of the elliptic flow v_2 extracted from the simulations
agrees well with the experimental data in the whole pseudorapidity range for
different centrality classes. The centrality dependence of the integrated
elliptic flow of charged hadrons in the QGSM almost coincides with the PHOBOS
experimental distribution. The transverse momentum dependence of the elliptic
flow of identified and inclusive charged hadrons is studied also. The model
reproduces quantitatively the low p_T part of the distributions rather good,
but underestimates the measured elliptic flow for transverse momenta p_T > 1
GeV/c. Qualitatively, however, the model is able to reproduce the saturation of
the v_2(p_T) spectra with rising p_T as well as the crossing of the elliptic
flow for mesons and baryons.
