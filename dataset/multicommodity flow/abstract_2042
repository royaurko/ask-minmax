Conventional cone jet algorithms arose from heuristic considerations of LO
hard scattering coupled to independent showering. These algorithms implicitly
assume that the final states of individual events can be mapped onto a unique
set of jets that are in turn associated with a unique set of underlying hard
scattering partons. Thus each final state hadron is assigned to a unique
underlying parton. The Jet Energy Flow (JEF) analysis described here does not
make such assumptions. The final states of individual events are instead
described in terms of flow distributions of hadronic energy. Quantities of
physical interest are constructed from the energy flow distribution summed over
all events. The resulting analysis is less sensitive to higher order
perturbative corrections and the impact of showering and hadronization than the
standard cone algorithms.
