We present a magneto-hydrodynamic model developed for investigations of
advective non-stationary, asymmetric Keplerian accretion disks in the normal
magnetic field. The introduced model allows us to trace the evolution in
different fixed moments and to get detailed description of the self-structuring
of the disk. We have introduced "meeting coefficients" that define the
feedback. It determines the impact from nonlinear effects have over the
structure of the flow. We have obtained solutions for the radial structure of
the disk for two crucial moments of its evolution.
