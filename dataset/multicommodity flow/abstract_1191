We implement a suggestion by Bakas and consider the Ricci flow of 3-d
manifolds with one Killing vector by dimensional reduction to the corresponding
flow of a 2-d manifold plus scalar (dilaton) field. By suitably modifying the
flow equations in order to make them manifestly parabolic, we are able to show
that the equations for the 2-d geometry can be put in the form explicitly
solved by Bakas using a continual analogue of the Toda field equations. The
only remaining equation, namely that of the scale factor of the extra
dimension, is a linear equation that can be readily solved using standard
techniques once the 2-geometry is specified. We illustrate the method with a
couple of specific examples.
