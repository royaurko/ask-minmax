Cohesive granular media flowing down an inclined plane are studied by
discrete element simulations. Previous work on cohesionless granular media
demonstrated that within the steady flow regime where gravitational energy is
balanced by dissipation arising from intergrain forces, the velocity profile in
the flow direction scales with depth in a manner consistent with the
predictions of Bagnold. Here we demonstrate that this Bagnold scaling does not
hold for the analogous steady-flows in cohesive granular media. We develop a
generalization of the Bagnold constitutive relation to account for our
observation and speculate as to the underlying physical mechanisms responsible
for the different constitutive laws for cohesive and noncohesive granular
media.
