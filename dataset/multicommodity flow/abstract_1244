Large-eddy simulations of the turbulent flow in a lid-driven cubical cavity
have been carried out at a Reynolds number of 12000 using spectral element
methods. Two distinct subgrid-scales models, namely a dynamic Smagorinsky model
and a dynamic mixed model, have been both implemented and used to perform
long-lasting simulations required by the relevant time scales of the flow. All
filtering levels make use of explicit filters applied in the physical space (on
an element-by-element approach) and spectral (modal) spaces. The two
subgrid-scales models are validated and compared to available experimental and
numerical reference results, showing very good agreement. Specific features of
lid-driven cavity flow in the turbulent regime, such as inhomogeneity of
turbulence, turbulence production near the downstream corner eddy, small-scales
localization and helical properties are investigated and discussed in the
large-eddy simulation framework. Time histories of quantities such as the total
energy, total turbulent kinetic energy or helicity exhibit different evolutions
but only after a relatively long transient period. However, the average values
remain extremely close.
