The time interval of successive water-drips from a faucet was examined over a
wide range of the flow rate. The dripping interval alternately exhibits a
stable state and a chaotic state as the flow rate increases. In the stable
state, the volume of the drip is kept constant at fixed flow rates, and the
constant volume increases with the flow rate. In the chaotic state, in addition
to a mechanics that the drip is torn by its own weight, the vibration of the
drip on the faucet takes part in the strange behavior of the interval.
