We investigate the effect of shear in the flow of charged particle equilibria
that are unstable to the Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR) instability.
  Shear may act to quench this instability because it acts to limit the size of
the region with a fixed phase relation between emitters.
  The results are important for the understanding of astrophysical sources of
coherent radiation where shear in the flow is likely.
