This thesis is concerned with the theory and the phenomenology of rapidity
gap processes. We perform perturbative calculations of energy flow observables
in jet-gap-jet processes, which consist of resummed primary emission
calculations specific to the soft gluon geometry at HERA and an estimate of
non-global (secondary emission) effects in clustered energy flow observables.
The resulting predictions agree well with H1 data. We also study hard
diffraction and use a factorised model, with a Monte Carlo event generator, to
make detailed predictions for gap-jet-gap events at the Tevatron. We find that
we can describe the data in a natural way by using HERA parton densities and a
gap surivial factor consistent with theoretical estimates.
