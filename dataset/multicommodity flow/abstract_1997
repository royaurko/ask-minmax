We present a numerical method for approximating the solutions of degenerate
parabolic equations with a formal gradient flow structure. The numerical method
we propose preserves the formal gradient flow structure at the discrete level.
The existence of a solution to and the convergence of the scheme are proved
under very general assumptions on the continuous problem (nonlinearities,
anisotropy, heterogeneity) and on the mesh. We also provide numerical evidences
of the efficiency and of the robustness of our approach.
