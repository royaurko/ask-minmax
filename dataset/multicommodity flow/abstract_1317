Movement and coalescence of magnetic elements could explain the evolution and
growth of pores. There have been numerous studies focusing on flow fields in
and around individual pores. We have undertaken a systematic study of the
statistical properties of such flows. Data of the Hinode Solar Optical
Telescope offer an opportunity for this type of research, because of the
uniform data quality and absence of seeing so that pores can directly be
compared in different environments and at various stages of their evolution. We
analyzed about 220 time-series of G-band images using local correlation
tracking. The thus computed flow maps make up a database, which covers various
scenes on the solar surface. We use an isolated pore to illustrate the
statistical parameters collected for further statistical analysis, which
include information about morphology, horizontal flows, evolutionary stage
(young, mature, or decaying), complexity of the surrounding magnetic field, and
proximity to sunspots or cluster of G-band bright points.
