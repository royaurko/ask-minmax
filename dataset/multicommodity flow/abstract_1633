We find exact solutions describing Ricci flows of four dimensional pp-waves
nonlinearly deformed by two/three dimensional solitons. Such solutions are
parametrized by five dimensional metrics with generic off-diagonal terms and
connections with nontrivial torsion which can be related, for instance, to
antisymmetric tensor sources in string gravity. There are defined nontrivial
limits to four dimensional configurations and the Einstein gravity.
