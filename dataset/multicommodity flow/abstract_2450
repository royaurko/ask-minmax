We report on the elliptic and triangular flow measurements for a number of
hadrons including charged pions, and (anti-)protons, as well as those with
strangeness content: kaons, ${\rm \phi}$-meson, ${\rm K^0_s}$, ${\rm
\Lambda/\bar{\Lambda}}$, ${\rm \Xi}$, and ${\rm \Omega}$. The results reported
cover mid--rapidity, $|\eta|<0.8$, and a wide, $0.2 < p_{\rm T} < 16$ GeV/$c$,
transverse momentum range for Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76
TeV recorded by ALICE at the LHC. The mass splitting and the scaling properties
of the elliptic flow with the number of constituent quarks and the particle
transverse mass are studied as a function of collision centrality. The results
are ompared to RHIC measurements and to hydrodynamic model predictions.
