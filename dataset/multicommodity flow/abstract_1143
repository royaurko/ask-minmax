New X-ray observations with XMM-Newton show a lack of spectral evidence for
large amounts of cooling and condensing gas in the centers of galaxy clusters
believed to harbour strong cooling flows. Here, we explore these diagnostics of
the temperature structure of cooling cores with XMM-spectroscopy. We further
find no evidence of intrinsic absorption in the center of the cooling flows of
M87 and the Perseus cluster. To explain these findings we consider the heating
of the core regions of clusters by jets from a central AGN. We find that the
power of the AGN jets as estimated by their interaction effects with the
intracluster medium in several examples is more then sufficient to heat the
cooling flows. We explore which requirements such a heating model has to
fulfill and find a very promising scenario of self-regulated Bondi accretion of
the central black hole. In summary it is argued that most observational
evidence points towards much lower mass deposition rates than previously
inferred for cooling flow clusters.
