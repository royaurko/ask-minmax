The azimuthal anisotropy coefficients $v_{2,3,4}$, characterizing collective
flow in Au+Au collisions, are presented for identified particle species as a
function of transverse momentum ($p_T$), centrality ($\rm{cent}$) and beam
collision energy ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}=0.039-0.20$ TeV). The $v_n$ values for each
particle species, show little, if any, change over the measured beam energy
range, and ${v_n}/{(n_q)^{n/2}}$ vs. $KE_T/n_q$ scales to a single curve
(constituent quark number ($n_q)$ scaling) for each $n$, over a broad range of
transverse kinetic energies ($KE_T$). A comparison of $v_2(p_T)$ for individual
particle species obtained in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=0.20$ TeV
(RHIC) and Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV (LHC), indicate
stronger collective flow at the LHC. These flow measurements and their scaling
patterns, can provide important additional constraints for extraction of the
specific viscosity $\eta/s$.
