Shaping of magnetic flux surfaces is found to have a strong impact on
turbulence and transport in tokamak edge plasmas. A series of axisymmetric
equilibria with varying elongation and triangularity, and a divertor
configuration are implemented into a computational gyrofluid turbulence model.
The mechanisms of shaping effects on turbulence and flows are identified.
Transport is mainly reduced by local magnetic shearing and an enhancement of
zonal shear flows induced by elongation and X-point shaping.
