Parton showers in Monte Carlo event generators reflect to a certain accuracy
our understanding of QCD radiation at all orders. For observables sensitive to
interjet energy flow in well defined regions of phase space, it has been known
for some time that relevant all-order dynamics is substantially more
complicated than that encoded via angular ordering in parton shower algorithms,
even to leading logarithmic accuracy. Here we investigate the extent of the
numerical mismatch between leading logarithmic analytical estimates
(resummation) and parton showers in an effort to better understand the accuracy
of parton showers for such observables.
