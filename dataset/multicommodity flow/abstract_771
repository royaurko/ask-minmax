In an idealized way, some turbulent flows can be pictured by assemblies of
many vortices characterized by a set of particle distribution functions.
Ultrasound provide an useful, nonintrusive, tool to study the spatial structure
of vorticity in flows. This is analogous to the use of elastic neutron
scattering to determine liquid structure. We express the dispersion relation,
as well as the scattering cross section, of sound waves propagating in a
``liquid'' of identical vortices as a function of vortex pair correlation
functions. In two dimensions, formal analogies with ionic liquids are pointed
out.
