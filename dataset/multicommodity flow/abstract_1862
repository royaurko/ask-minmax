In this paper, we establish two different results. The first result is a
characterization theorem saying that if the stationary state probabilities for
originally described Markovian discriminatory processor sharing (DPS) system
have a closed product geometric form (the exact definition is given in the
paper), then the system must only be Egalitarian, i.e. all flows in this system
must have equal priorities. The second result is the tail asymptotics for the
stationary probabilities. We provide a detailed asymptotic analysis of the
system, and obtain the exact asymptotic form of the stationary probabilities in
DPS systems when the number of flows in the system is large.
