The development of microfluidic devices has recently revived the interest in
"old" problems associated with transport at, or across, interfaces. As the
characteristic sizes are decreased, the use of pressure gradients to transport
fluids becomes problematic, and new, interface driven, methods must be
considered. This has lead to new investigations of flow near interfaces, and to
the conception of interfaces engineered at various scales to reduce flow
friction. In this review, we discuss the present theoretical understanding of
flow past solid interfaces at different length scales. We also briefly discuss
the corresponding phenomenon of heat transport, and the influence of surface
slip on interface driven (e.g. electro-osmotic) flows.
