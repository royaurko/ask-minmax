We consider a simple nonlinear hyperbolic system modeling the flow of an
inviscid fluid. The model includes as state variable the mass density fraction
of the vapor in the fluid and then phase transitions can be taken into
consideration; moreover, phase interfaces are contact discontinuities for the
system. We focus on the special case of initial data consisting of two
different phases separated by an interface. We find explicit bounds on the
(possibly large) initial data in order that weak entropic solutions exist for
all times. The proof exploits a carefully tailored version of the front
tracking scheme.
