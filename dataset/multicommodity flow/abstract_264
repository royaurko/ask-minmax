We report recent results from a multiphase transport (AMPT) model on the
azimuthal anisotropies of particle momentum distributions in heavy ion
collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. These include higher-order
anisotropic flows and their scaling, the rapidity dependence of anisotropic
flows, and the elliptic flow of charm quarks.
