The Adler-Kostant-Symes theorem yields isospectral hamiltonian flows on the
dual $\tilde\grg^{+*}$ of a Lie subalgebra $\tilde\grg^+$ of a loop algebra
$\tilde\grg$. A general approach relating the method of integration of
Krichever, Novikov and Dubrovin to such flows is used to obtain finite-gap
solutions of matrix Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations in terms of quotients of
$\tet$-functions.
