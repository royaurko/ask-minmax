If accretion disc contains weak frozen-in entangled magnetic fields, their
dynamical effect may be important inside the last stable orbit because of the
decompression near the sonic point. Here, I consider the radial and vertical
structure of a nearly free-falling flow inside the last stable orbit of a thin
disc around a Kerr black hole. The thickness of such a flow is determined
primarily by the vertical stress created by radial and azimuthal magnetic
fields. The thickness is predicted to oscillate vertically around its
equilibrium value determined by the magnetic field balance with gravity. For
thin discs, this thickness is much larger than that of the accretion disc
itself. Numerical simulations with HARM2d show the vertical structure is more
complicated. In particular, magnetically supported disc seems to be unstable to
segregation of matter into thinner streams with the vertical scale determined
by thermal pressure or other processes.
