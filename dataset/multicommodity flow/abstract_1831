We study the long-time behavior of global strong solutions to a hydrodynamic
system for nonhomogeneous incompressible nematic liquid crystal flows driven by
two types of external forces in a smooth bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$. For
arbitrary large regular initial data with the initial density being away from
vacuum, we prove the decay of the velocity field for both cases. Furthermore,
for the case with asymptotically autonomous external force, we can prove the
convergence of the density function and the director vector as time goes to
infinity. Estimates on convergence rate are also provided.
