We present the laboratory verification of a method for re- moving the effects
of frozen-flow atmospheric turbulence using a Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG)
controller, also known as a Kalman Filter. This method, which we term
"Predictive Fourier Control," can identify correlated atmospheric motions due
to layers of frozen flow turbulence, and can predictively remove the effects of
these correlated motions in real-time. Our laboratory verification suggests a
factor of 3 improvement in the RMS residual wavefront error and a 10%
improvement in measured Strehl of the system. We found that the RMS residual
wavefront error was suppressed from 35.0 nm to 11.2 nm due to the use of
Predictive Fourier Control, and that the far field Strehl improved from 0.479
to 0.520.
