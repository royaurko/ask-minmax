We introduce `atomic flows': they are graphs obtained from derivations by
tracing atom occurrences and forgetting the logical structure. We study simple
manipulations of atomic flows that correspond to complex reductions on
derivations. This allows us to prove, for propositional logic, a new and very
general normalisation theorem, which contains cut elimination as a special
case. We operate in deep inference, which is more general than other syntactic
paradigms, and where normalisation is more difficult to control. We argue that
atomic flows are a significant technical advance for normalisation theory,
because 1) the technique they support is largely independent of syntax; 2)
indeed, it is largely independent of logical inference rules; 3) they
constitute a powerful geometric formalism, which is more intuitive than syntax.
