We calculate Ohmic and Hall flux flow conductivities in the mixed state of
d-wave superconductors taking into account the spectral flow along the
anomalous branch of the states bound to vortex cores. Three regimes of vortex
dynamics are found. In the moderately clean limit the contribution of the
spectral flow to the conductivities coincides with that for s-superconductors.
In the superclean regime in low magnetic fields both Ohmic and Hall
conductivities acquire relaxation-time-independent universal values. The
contribution of the spectral flow in the superclean regime is suppressed in
higher fields. At not too low temperatures the contribution of the states above
the gap is important.
