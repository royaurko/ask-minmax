This is the first in a series of papers that investigate the properties of
accretion flows in the Kerr metric through three-dimensional, general
relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of tori with a near-Keplerian
initial angular velocity profile. We study four models with increasing black
hole spin, from a/M=0 to 0.998, for which the structural parameters of the
initial tori are maintained nearly constant. The subsequent accretion flows
arise self-consistently from stresses and turbulence created by the
magnetorotational instability. We investigate the overall evolution and the
late-time global structure in the resulting non-radiative accretion flows,
including the magnetic fields within the disks, the properties of the flow in
the plunging region, and the flux of conserved quantities into the black hole.
Independent of black hole spin, the global structure is described in terms of
five regions: the main disk body, the coronal envelope, the inner disk,
consisting of an inner torus and plunging region, an evacuated axial funnel,
and a bi-conical outflow confined to the corona-funnel boundary. We find
evidence for lower accretion rates, stronger funnel-wall outflows, and
increased stress in the near hole region with increasing black hole spin.
