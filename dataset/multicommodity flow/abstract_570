The Teichm\"uller harmonic map flow is a gradient flow for the harmonic map
energy of maps from a closed surface to a general closed Riemannian target
manifold of any dimension, where both the map and the domain metric are allowed
to evolve. In [12], it was shown that given a weak solution existing for all
time $t\geq 0$, the flow decomposes the domain into a finite number of lower
genus surfaces, and makes the map converge to a collection of branched minimal
immersions, and constant maps, from these lower genus surfaces.
  In this paper, we prove that provided one also accounts for the development
of bubbles (which themselves are branched minimal immersions) within the domain
and on any degenerating collars, then the flow enjoys `no loss of energy' in
the limit $t\to\infty$. In other words, the sum of the energies (or areas) of
the branched minimal immersions equals the limit of the energy of the flow as
$t\to\infty$.
  In addition, we consider the issue of `necks' connecting the various
components found above within the target. We give an example of the development
of a neck - i.e. we find that the image of the interior of a collar can be more
than just a point in the limit of large time, even in the absence of bubbles on
the collar. However, we also show that the images of the collars are always
close to curves connecting the branched minimal immersions, including possibly
bubbles, which improves the topological decomposition performed by the flow
compared with the theory from [12].
  A key ingredient in our work is the Poincar\'e estimate for quadratic
differentials discovered in [13].
