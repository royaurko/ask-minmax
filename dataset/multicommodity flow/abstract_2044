Quenching is a recently discovered phenomenon in which QCD jets created in
heavy ion collisions deposit a large fraction or even all their energy and
momentum into the produced matter. At RHIC and higher energies, where that
matter is a strongly coupled Quark-Gluon Plasma (sQGP) with very small
viscosity, we suggest that this energy/momentum propagate as a collective
excitation or ``conical flow''. Similar hydrodynamical phenomena are well
known, e.g. the so called sonic booms from supersonic planes. We solve the
linearized relativistic hydrodynamic equations to detail the flow picture. We
argue that for RHIC collisions the direction of this flow should make a cone at
a specific large angle with the jet, of about $70^o$, and thus lead to peaks in
particle correlations at the angle $\Delta\phi=\pi\pm 1.2$ rad relative to the
large-$p_t$ trigger. This angle happens to matchperfectly the position of the
maximum in the angular distribution of secondaries associated with the trigger
recently seen by the STAR and PHENIX collaborations. We also discuss briefly
possible alternative explanations and suggest some further tests to clarify the
mechanism.
