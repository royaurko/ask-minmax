The present investigation discusses the flow and heat transfer
characteristics of a steady three dimensional Sisko fluid. The flow is induced
due to bidirectional stretching sheet. The influence of power-law index and
stretching ratio on flow and heat transfer is studied thoroughly. Governing
partial differential equations are reduced to coupled ordinary differential
equations by suitable similarity variable. The resulting equations are then
solved numerically by shooting method using adaptive Runge Kutta algorithm in
combination with Broyden's method in the domain . The numerical results for the
velocity and temperature fields are graphically presented and effects of the
relevant parameters are discussed in detail. Moreover, the skin-friction
coefficient and local Nusselt number for different values of the power-law
index and stretching ratio are presented through tabulated data. The numerical
results are verified with the results obtained by HAM. Additionally, the
results are also validated with previously published pertinent literature as a
special case of the problem.
