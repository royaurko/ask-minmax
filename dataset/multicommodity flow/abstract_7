We study Poincar\'e recurrence for flows and observations of flows. For
Anosov flow, we prove that the recurrence rates are linked to the local
dimension of the invariant measure. More generally, we give for the recurrence
rates for the observation an upper bound depending on the push-forward measure.
When the flow is metrically isomorphic to a suspension flow for which the
dynamic on the base is rapidly mixing, we prove the existence of a lower bound
for the recurrence rates for the observation. We apply these results to the
geodesic flow and we compute the recurrence rates for a particular observation
of the geodesic flow, i.e. the projection on the manifold.
