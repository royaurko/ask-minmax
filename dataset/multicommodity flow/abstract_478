We study the melting dynamics of large ice balls in a turbulent von Karman
flow at very high Reynolds number. Using an optical shadowgraphy setup, we
record the time evolution of particle sizes. We study the heat transfer as a
function of the particle scale Reynolds number for three cases: fixed ice balls
melting in a region of strong turbulence with zero mean flow, fixed ice balls
melting under the action of a strong mean flow with lower fluctuations, and ice
balls freely advected in the whole flow. For the fixed particles cases, heat
transfer is observed to be much stronger than in laminar flows, the Nusselt
number behaving as a power law of the Reynolds number of exponent 0.8. For
freely advected ice balls, the turbulent transfer is further enhanced and the
Nusselt number is proportional to the Reynolds number. The surface heat flux is
then independent of the particles size, leading to an ultimate regime of heat
transfer reached when the thermal boundary layer is fully turbulent.
