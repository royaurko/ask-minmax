The key results on lepton-pair production in ultra-relativistic nuclear
collisions are shortly reviewed, starting at the roots of pp collisions in the
seventies, and ending at the perspectives of the colliders RHIC and LHC. The
presence is dominated by the recent precision results from NA60 at the CERN
SPS, culminating in the first measurement of the in-medium rho spectral
function and the transverse flow of the associated thermal radiation. The
seeming cut-off of the flow above the rho may well be the first direct hint for
thermal radiation of partonic origin in nuclear collisions. The major
milestones in the theoretical developments are also covered.
