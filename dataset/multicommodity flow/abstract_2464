I provide a broad framework to embed gradient flow equations in
non-relativistic field theory models that exhibit anisotropic scaling. The
prime example is the heat equation arising from a Lifshitz scalar field theory;
other examples include the Allen-Cahn equation that models the evolution of
phase boundaries. Then, I review recent results reported in arXiv:1002.0062
describing instantons of Horava-Lifshitz gravity as eternal solutions of
certain geometric flow equations on 3-manifolds. These instanton solutions are
in general chiral when the anisotropic scaling exponent is z=3. Some general
connections with the Onsager-Machlup theory of non-equilibrium processes are
also briefly discussed in this context. Thus, theories of Lifshitz type in d+1
dimensions can be used as off-shell toy models for dynamical vacuum selection
of relativistic field theories in d dimensions.
