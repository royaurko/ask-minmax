In this article we consider the general problem of translating definitions
and results from the category of discrete-time dynamical systems to the
category of flows. We consider the dynamics of homeomorphisms and flows on
compact metric spaces, in particular Peano continua. As a translating tool, we
construct continuous, symmetric and monotonous fields of local cross sections
for an arbitrary flow without singular points. Next, we use this structure in
the study of expansive flows on Peano continua. We show that expansive flows
admit no stable point and that every point contains a non-trivial continuum in
its stable set. As a corollary we obtain that no Peano continuum with an open
set homeomorphic with the plane admits an expansive flow. In particular compact
surface admits no expansive flow without singular points.
