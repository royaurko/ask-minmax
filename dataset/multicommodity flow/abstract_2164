We extend the analysis of the mean field schematic model recently introduced
for the description of glass forming liquids to the case of a supercooled fluid
subjected to a shear flow of rate $\gamma$. After quenching the system to a low
temperature $T$, a slow glassy regime is observed before stationarity is
achieved at the characteristic time $\tau_g$. $\tau_g$ is of the order of the
usual equilibration time without shear $\tau_g^o$ for weak shear, $\gamma
\tau_g ^o<1$. For larger shear, $\gamma \tau_g ^o>1$, local rearrangement of
dense regions is instead enhanced by the flow, and $\tau_g \simeq 1/(T\gamma)$.
