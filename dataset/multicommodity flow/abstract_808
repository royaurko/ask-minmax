A simple afterburner including radial flow to the randomized transverse
momentum obtained from event generators, Pythia and Hijing, has been
implemented to calculate the $p/\pi$ ratios and compare them with available
data. A coherent trend of qualitative agreement has been obtained in $pp$
collisions and in $Au+Au$ for various centralities. Those results indicate that
the radial flow does play an important role in the so called baryon puzzle
anomaly.
