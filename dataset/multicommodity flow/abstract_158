We suggest the possibility to disentangle anisotropic flow, flow fluctuation,
and nonflow using two-, four-, and six-particle azimuthal moments assuming
Gaussian fluctuations. We show that such disentanglement is possible when the
flow fluctuations are large, comparable to the average flow magnitude. When
fluctuations are small, the disentanglement becomes difficult. We verify our
results with a toy-model Monte Carlo simulation.
