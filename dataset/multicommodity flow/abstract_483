We analyze the nature of dynamo action that produces horizontally averaged
magnetic fields in two particular flows that were studied by Roberts (1972,
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 271, 411), namely his flows II and III. They have zero
kinetic helicity either pointwise (flow II), or on average (flow III). Using
direct numerical simulations, we determine the onset conditions for dynamo
action at moderate values of the magnetic Reynolds number. Using the test-field
method, we show that the turbulent magnetic diffusivity is then positive for
both flows. However, we demonstrate that for both flows large-scale dynamo
action occurs through delayed transport. Mathematically speaking, the magnetic
field at earlier times contributes to the electromotive force through the
off-diagonal components of the alpha tensor such that a zero mean magnetic
field becomes unstable to dynamo action. This represents a qualitatively new
mean-field dynamo mechanism not previously described.
