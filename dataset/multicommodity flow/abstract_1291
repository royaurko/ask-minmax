We define a Tanaka's equation on an oriented graph with two edges and two
vertices. This graph will be embedded in the unit circle. Extending this
equation to flows of kernels, we show that the laws of the flows of kernels $K$
solution of Tanaka's equation can be classified by pairs of probability
measures $(m^+,m^-)$ on $[0,1]$, with mean 1/2. What happens at the first
vertex is governed by $m^+$, and at the second by $m^-$. For each vertex $P$,
we construct a sequence of stopping times along which the image of the whole
circle by $K$ is reduced to $P$. We also prove that the supports of these flows
contains a finite number of points, and that except for some particular cases
this number of points can be arbitrarily large.
