We develop a method for computing the optimal disturbance based on the
Orr--Sommerfeld--Squire matrices. The method is similar to the one employed
elsewhere in the literature. The basic method compares well when compared to a
benchmark case in single-phase flow. In contrast, for two-phase flows, the
basic method needs to be modified in a substantial manner before agreement can
be obtained with known test cases. These modifications are discussed and
derived below and eventually, good agreement between the present case and the
two-phase test cases is obtained.
