Numerical analysis of time-integration algorithms has been applying advanced
algebraic techniques for more than fourty years. An explicit description of the
group of characters in the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra first appeared
in Butcher's work on composition of integration methods in 1972. In more recent
years, the analysis of structure preserving algorithms, geometric integration
techniques and integration algorithms on manifolds have motivated the
incorporation of other algebraic structures in numerical analysis. In this
paper we will survey structures that have found applications within these
areas. This includes pre-Lie structures for the geometry of flat and torsion
free connections appearing in the analysis of numerical flows on vector spaces.
The much more recent post-Lie and D-algebras appear in the analysis of flows on
manifolds with flat connections with constant torsion. Dynkin and Eulerian
idempotents appear in the analysis of non-autonomous flows and in backward
error analysis. Non-commutative Bell polynomials and a non-commutative Fa\`a di
Bruno Hopf algebra are other examples of structures appearing naturally in the
numerical analysis of integration on manifolds.
