The stability of a rotating flow in a triaxial ellipsoidal shell with an
imposed temperature difference between inner and outer boundaries is studied
numerically. We demonstrate that (i) a stable temperature field encourages the
tidal instability, (ii) the tidal instability can grow on a convective flow,
which confirms its relevance to geo- and astrophysical contexts and (iii) its
growth rate decreases when the intensity of convection increases. Simple
scaling laws characterizing the evolution of the heat flux based on a
competition between viscous and thermal boundary layers are derived
analytically and verified numerically. Our results confirm that thermal and
tidal effects have to be simultaneously taken into account when studying
geophysical and astrophysical flows.
