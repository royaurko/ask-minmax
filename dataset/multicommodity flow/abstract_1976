In this paper we study a gradient flow approach to the problem of
quantization of measures in one dimension. By embedding our problem in $L^2$,
we find a continuous version of it that corresponds to the limit as the number
of particles tends to infinity. Under some suitable regularity assumptions on
the density, we prove uniform stability and quantitative convergence result for
the discrete and continuous dynamics.
