This contribution replies to H. M. Zhang's paper "What Faster-than-traffic
Characteristic Speeds Mean for Vehicular Traffic Flow", which comments on the
manuscript "On the Controversy around Daganzo's Requiem for and Aw-Rascle's
Resurrection of Second-Order Traffic Flow Models" published in this issue of
Eurpean Physical Journal B. The contributor clarifies several points and agrees that
suitable experiments can be a way of deciding the controversy on the existence
of propagation speeds faster than the speed of vehicles. Moreover, he proposes
to aim at an integrated theory, which is both, theoretically consistent and
practically relevant.
