The physical nature of the very local (<3 Mpc) Hubble flow is studied on the
basis of the recent high precision observations in the Local Volume. A model
including both analytical treatment and computer simulations describes the flow
dynamical evolution from a chaotic Little Bang initial state to the present-day
state of a quasi-regular expansion. The two major observational parameters of
the flow, which are the rate of expansion and the velocity dispersion, find a
clear qualitative and quantitative explanation in the model.
