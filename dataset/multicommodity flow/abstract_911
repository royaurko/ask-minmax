This short overview includes recent results from the ALICE Collaboration on
anisotropic flow of charged and identified particles in sqrt(sNN) = 2.76 TeV
Pb-Pb collisions. We also discuss charge dependent and event plane dependent
azimuthal correlations that are important in tests of the chiral magnetic
effect, as well as understanding the dynamics of the system evolution and
hadronization process. Lastly, we present ALICE results obtained with a new
technique, the event shape engineering, which allows to perform a physical
analysis on events with very large or small flow.
