We show how ultra-relativistic collisions of light nuclei with heavy targets
may be used to record snap-shots of the ground-state configurations and reveal
information on cluster correlations. The development of collective flow in the
formed fireball, which reflects the geometric correlations in the initial
state, is essential for the method. As an illustration we analyze the 12C-208Pb
collisions.
