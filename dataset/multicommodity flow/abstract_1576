We discuss the issue of quasi-particle production by ``analogue black holes''
with particular attention to the possibility of reproducing Hawking radiation
in a laboratory. By constructing simple geometric acoustic models, we obtain a
somewhat unexpected result: We show that in order to obtain a stationary and
Planckian emission of quasi-particles, it is not necessary to create a trapped
region in the acoustic spacetime (corresponding to a supersonic regime in the
fluid flow). It is sufficient to set up a dynamically changing flow
asymptotically approaching a sonic regime with sufficient rapidity in
laboratory time.
