In this paper we continue our investigation about selfsimilar solutions of
the vortex filament equation, also known as the binormal flow (BF) or the
localized induction equation (LIE). Our main result is the stability of the
selfsimilar dynamics of small pertubations of a given selfsimilar solution. The
proof relies on finding precise asymptotics in space and time for the tangent
and the normal vectors of the perturbations. A main ingredient in the proof is
the control of the evolution of weighted norms for a cubic 1-D Schr\"odinger
equation, connected to the binormal flow by Hasimoto's transform.
