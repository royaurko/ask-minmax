In linearly stable shear flows turbulence spontaneously decays with a
characteristic lifetime that varies with Reynolds number. The lifetime sharply
increases with Reynolds number so that a possible divergence marking the
transition to sustained turbulence at a critical point has been discussed. We
present a mechanism by which the lifetimes increase: in the system's state
space, turbulent motion is supported by a chaotic saddle. Inside this saddle a
locally attracting periodic orbit is created and undergoes a traditional
bifurcation sequence generating chaos. The formed new 'turbulent bubble' is
initially an attractor supporting persistent chaotic dynamics. Soon after its
creation it collides with its own boundary, by which it becomes leaky and
dynamically connected with the surrounding structures. The complexity of the
chaotic saddle that supports transient turbulence hence increases by
incorporating the remnant of a new bubble. As a a result, the time it takes for
a trajectory to leave the saddle and decay to the laminar state is increased.
We demonstrate this phenomenon in plane Couette flow and show that
characteristic lifetimes vary non-smoothly and non-monotonically with Reynolds
number.
