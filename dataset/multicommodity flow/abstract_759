Thermal conduction has been suggested as a possible mechanism by which
sufficient extra heating is provided in radiation-dominated accretion flows. We
consider the extreme case in which the generated energy due to the viscosity
and the energy transported by a saturated form of thermal conduction are
balanced by the advection cooling. For the steady-state structure of such
accretion flows a set of self-similar solution are presented. Based on these
solutions while the radial and the rotational velocities are both
sub-Keplerian, increasing the level of thermal conduction has the effects of
decreasing the rotational velocity, but increasing the radial velocity.
Conduction provides extra heating and the temperature of the gas increases with
thermal conduction.
