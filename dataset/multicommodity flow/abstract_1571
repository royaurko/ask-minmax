A class of solutions to Einstein field equations is studied, which represents
gravitational collapse of thick spherical shells made of self-similar and
shear-free fluid with heat flow. It is shown that such shells satisfy all the
energy conditions, and the corresponding collapse always forms naked
singularities.
