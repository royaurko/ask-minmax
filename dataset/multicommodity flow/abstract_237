In many clusters of galaxies there is evidence for cooling flow in the
central regions. A possibility is that a fraction of the gas forms cold
molecular clouds. We investigate the minimum temperature which can be reached
by clouds in cooling flows by computing the cooling function due to H2, HD and
CO molecules. As an example, we determine the minimum temperature achievable by
clouds in the cooling flow of PKS 0745-191.
