Any economic agent constituting the monetary economy maintains the activity
of monetary flow equilibration for fulfilling the condition of monetary flow
continuity in the record, except at the central bank. At the same time,
monetary flow equilibration at one economic agent constantly induces at other
agents in the economy further flow disequilibrium to be eliminated
subsequently. We propose the rate of monetary flow disequilibration as a figure
measuring the progressive movement of the economy. The rate of disequilibration
was read out of both the Japanese and the United States monetary economy
recorded over the last fifty years.
