Mechanical forces such as fluid shear have been shown to enhance cell growth
and differentiation, but knowledge of their mechanistic effect on cells is
limited because the local flow patterns and associated metrics are not
precisely known. Here we present real-time, noninvasive measures of local
hydrodynamics in 3D biomaterials based on nuclear magnetic resonance. Microflow
maps were further used to derive pressure, shear and fluid permeability fields.
Finally, remodeling of collagen gels in response to precise fluid flow
parameters was correlated with structural changes. It is anticipated that
accurate flow maps within 3D matrices will be a critical step towards
understanding cell behavior in response to controlled flow dynamics.
