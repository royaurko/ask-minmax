I study fluid flow at the interface between elastic solids with randomly
rough surfaces. I use the contact mechanics model of Persson to take into
account the elastic interaction between the solid walls and the Bruggeman
effective medium theory to account for the influence of the disorder on the
fluid flow. I calculate the flow tensor which determines the pressure flow
factor and, e.g., the leak-rate of static seals. I show how the perturbation
treatment of Tripp can be extended to arbitrary order in the ratio between the
root-mean-square roughness amplitude and the average interfacial surface
separation. I introduce a matrix D(Zeta), determined by the surface roughness
power spectrum, which can be used to describe the anisotropy of the surface at
any magnification Zeta. I present results for the asymmetry factor Gamma(Zeta)
(generalized Peklenik number) for grinded steel and sandblasted PMMA surfaces.
