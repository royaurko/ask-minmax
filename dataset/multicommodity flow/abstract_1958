The Clausius Virial theorem of Classical Kinetic Theory is used to evaluate
the pressure of a suspension of small particles at equilibrium in an isotropic
homogeneous and stationary turbulent flow. It then follows a similar approach
to the way Einstein (1905) evaluated the diffusion coefficient of Brownian
particles (leading to the Stokes-Einstein relation) to similarly evaluate the
long term diffusion coefficient of the suspended particles. In contrast to
Brownian motion, the analogue of temperature in the equation of state which
relates pressure to particle density is not the kinetic energy per unit
particle mass.
