We derive differential equations for the flow of entanglement entropy as a
function of the metric and the couplings of the theory. The variation of the
universal part of entanglement entropy under a local Weyl transformation is
related to the variation under a local change in the couplings. We show that
this relation is in fact equivalent to the trace Ward identity. As a concrete
application of our formalism, we express the entanglement entropy for massive
free fields as a two-point function of the energy-momentum tensor.
