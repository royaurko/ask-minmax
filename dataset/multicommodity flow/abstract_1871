In this paper, we applied an improved Smoothing Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
method by using gradient kernel renormalization in three-dimensional cases. The
purpose of gradient kernel renormalization is to improve the accuracy of
numerical simulation by improving gradient kernel approximation. This method is
implemented for simulating free surface flows, in particular dam break case
with rigid ball structures and the propagation of waves towards a slope in a
rectangular tank.
