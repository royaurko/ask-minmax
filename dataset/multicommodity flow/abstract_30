The effect of interfacial slip on steady-state and time-periodic flows of
monatomic liquids is investigated using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics
simulations. The fluid phase is confined between atomically smooth rigid walls,
and the fluid flows are induced by moving one of the walls. In steady shear
flows, the slip length increases almost linearly with shear rate. We found that
the velocity profiles in oscillatory flows are well described by the Stokes
flow solution with the slip length that depends on the local shear rate.
Interestingly, the rate dependence of the slip length obtained in steady shear
flows is recovered when the slip length in oscillatory flows is plotted as a
function of the local shear rate magnitude. For both types of flows, the
friction coefficient at the liquid-solid interface correlates well with the
structure of the first fluid layer near the solid wall.
