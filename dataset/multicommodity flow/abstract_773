The lattice Boltzmann model is a simplified kinetic method based on the
particle distribution function. We use this method to simulate problems in
MEMS, in which the velocity slip near the wall plays an important role. It is
demonstrated that the lattice Boltzmann method can capture the fundamental
behavior in micro-channel flow, including velocity slip and nonlinear pressure
drop along the channel. The Knudsen number dependence of the position of the
vortex center and the pressure contour in micro-cavity flows is also
demonstrated.
