We experimentally study the behavior of a particle slightly denser than the
surrounding liquid in solid body rotating flow. Earlier work revealed that a
heavy particle has an unstable equilibrium point in unbounded rotation flows.
In the confinement of the rotational flow by a cylindrical wall a heavy sphere
with density 1.05 g/cm$^3$ describes an orbital motion in our experiments. This
is due to the effect of the wall near the sphere, i.e. a repulsive force
($F_w$). We model $F_w$ on the sphere as a function of the distance from the
wall ($L$): $F_W \propto L^{-4}$ as proposed by Takemura and Magnaudet (2003).
Remarkably, the path from the model including $F_w$ reproduce the
experimentally measured trajectory. In addition during an orbital motion the
particle does not spin around its axis, and we provide a possible explanation
for this phenomenon.
