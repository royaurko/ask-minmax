In the present paper we study the C1-robustness of the three properties:
average shadowing, asymptotic average shadowing and limit shadowing within two
classes of conservative flows: the incompressible and the Hamiltonian ones. We
obtain that the first two properties guarantee dominated splitting (or partial
hyperbolicity) on the whole manifold, and the third one implies that the flow
is Anosov.
