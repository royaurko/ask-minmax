In this proceedings, we report measurements of the third harmonic coefficient
of the azimuthal anisotropy, $v_{3}$, known as triangular flow. The analysis is
for charged particles near midrapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt {s_{NN}} $
= 200 GeV, based on data from the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider. Triangular flow as a function of centrality, pseudorapidity and
transverse momentum are reported using various methods, including a study of
the signal for particle pairs as a function of their pseudorapidity separation.
Results are compared with other experiments and model predictions.
