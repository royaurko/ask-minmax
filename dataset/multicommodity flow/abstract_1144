We present a systematic method for constructing two-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic equilibria with compressible flow in Cartesian geometry.
This systematic method has already been developed in spherical geometry and
applied in modelling solar and stellar winds and outflows (Vlahakis &
Tsinganos,1998) but is derived here in Cartesian geometry in the context of the
solar atmosphere for the first time. Using the method we find several new
classes of solutions, some of which generalise known solutions, including the
Kippenhahn & Schl\"uter (1957) and Hood & Anzer (1990) solar prominence models
and the Tsinganos, Surlantzis & Priest (1993) coronal loop model with flow, and
some of which are completely new. Having developed the method in full and
summarised the several classes of solutions, we explore in a some detail one of
the classes to illustrate the general construction method. From one of the new
classes of solutions we calculate two loop-like solutions, one of which is the
first exact two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium with
trans-Alfv\'enic flow.
