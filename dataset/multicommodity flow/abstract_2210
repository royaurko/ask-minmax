We test the fluctuation theorem from measurements in turbulent flows. We
study the time fluctuations of the force acting on an obstacle, and we consider
two experimental situations: the case of a von K\'arm\'an swirling flow between
counter-rotating disks (VK) and the case of a wind tunnel jet. We first study
the symmetries implied by the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation theorem (FT) on the
probability density distributions of the force fluctuations; we then test the
Sinai scaling. We observe that in both experiments the symmetries implied by
the FT are well verified, whereas the Sinai scaling is established, as
expected, only for long times.
