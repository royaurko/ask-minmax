In this paper we introduce and study a geometric heat flow to find Killing
vector fields on closed Riemannian manifolds with positive sectional curvature.
We study its various properties, prove the global existence of the solution of
this flow, discuss its convergence and possible applications, and its relation
to the Navier-Stokes equations on manifolds and Kazdan-Warner-Bourguignon-Ezin
identity for conformal Killing vector fields. We also provide two new
criterions on the existence of Killing vector fields. The similar flow to
finding holomorphic vector fields on K\"ahler manifolds will be studied in
\cite{LL2}.
