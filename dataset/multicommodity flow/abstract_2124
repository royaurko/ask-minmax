The connection between the poloidal and the toroidal rotation of plasma in
tokamak is important for the high confinement regimes, in particular in reactor
regime. The sudden onset of closed convection structures in the poloidal
section, due to the baroclinic production of vorticity, will sustain a fast
increase of the poloidal velocity and a substantial effect on the toroidal
rotation. However this is limited to the short time of the onset transition. In
real plasma however there is random generation and suppression of convection
cells and the sequence of these transient events can prove able to sustain the
effect on the toroidal rotation. We formulate a simplified model which consists
of a laminar sheared, regular, flow situated at the boundary of a region of
drift-wave turbulence. Vortical structures, randomly generated in this
turbulent region are spontaneously advected toward the flow and are absorbed
there, sustaining with their vortical content, the sheared flow. We examine
this dynamics in the wavenumber $\mathbf{k}$ space, using reasonable
approximations. We derive a system of equations (which is a class of
Davey-Stewartson system) and find that indeed, the vortices advected and
absorbed into the layer can preserve its regular, poloidal, flow.
