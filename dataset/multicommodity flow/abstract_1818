We present measurements of the forward (3 < |eta| < 5) energy flow in minimum
bias events and in events with either hard jets or W and Z bosons produced at
central rapidities together with first measurements of the inclusive forward
jet cross section and central forward jet correlations. Results are compared to
MC models with different parameter tunes for the description of the underlying
event.
