In the following work we apply the boundary element method to two-phase flows
in shallow microchannels, where one phase is dispersed and does not wet the
channel walls. These kinds of flows are often encountered in microfluidic
Lab-on-a-Chip devices and characterized by low Reynolds and low capillary
numbers.
  Assuming that these channels are homogeneous in height and have a large
aspect ratio, we use depth-averaged equations to describe these two-phase flows
using the Brinkman equation, which constitutes a refinement of Darcy's law.
These partial differential equations are discretized and solved numerically
using the boundary element method, where a stabilization scheme is applied to
the surface tension terms, allowing for a less restrictive time step at low
capillary numbers. The convergence of the numerical algorithm is checked
against a static analytical solution and on a dynamic test case. Finally the
algorithm is applied to the non-linear development of the Saffman-Taylor
instability and compared to experimental studies of droplet deformation in
expanding flows.
