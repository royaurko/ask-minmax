We present the results of an analysis of superradiant energy flow due to
scalar fields incident on an acoustic black hole. In addition to providing
independent confirmation of the recent results in [5], we determine in detail
the profile of energy flow everywhere outside the horizon. We confirm
explicitly that in a suitable frame the energy flow is inward at the horizon
and outward at infinity, as expected on physical grounds.
