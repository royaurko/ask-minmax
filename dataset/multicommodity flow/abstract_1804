In this paper, we consider the global existence and uniqueness of the
classical solutions for the 3D viscous liquid-gas two-phase flow model. Initial
data is only small in the energy-norm. Our main ideas come from [15] where the
existence of global classical solutions to the compressible Navier-Stokes
equations was obtained by using the continuity methods under the assumption
that the initial energy is sufficiently small.
