We study charge and energy transport in a quasi-1D magnetic wire in the
presence of magnetic textures. The energy flows can be expressed in a fashion
similar to charge currents, leading to new energy-current induced spin torques.
In analogy to charge currents, we can identify two reciprocal effects:
spin-transfer torque on the magnetic order parameter induced by energy current
and the Berry-phase gauge field induced energy flow. In addition, we
phenomenologically introduce new $\beta-$like viscous coupling between magnetic
dynamics and energy current into the LLG equation, which originates from spin
mistracking of the magnetic order. We conclude that the new viscous term should
be important for the thermally induced domain wall motion. We study the
interplay between charge and energy currents and find that many of the effects
of texture motion on the charge currents can be replicated with respect to
energy currents. For example, the moving texture can lead to energy flows which
is an analogue of the electromotive force in case of charge currents. We
suggest a realization of cooling effect by magnetic texture dynamics.
