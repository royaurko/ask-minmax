We present the first measurement of directed flow ($v_1$) at RHIC. $v_1$ is
found to be consistent with zero at pseudorapidities $\eta$ from -1.2 to 1.2,
then rises to the level of a couple of percent over the range $2.4 < |\eta| <
4$. The latter observation is similar to data from NA49 if the SPS rapidities
are shifted by the difference in beam rapidity between RHIC and SPS.
Back-to-back jets emitted out-of-plane are found to be suppressed more if
compared to those emitted in-plane, which is consistent with {\it jet
quenching}. Using the scalar product method, we systematically compared
azimuthal correlations from p+p, d+Au and Au+Au collisions. Flow and non-flow
from these three different collision systems are discussed.
