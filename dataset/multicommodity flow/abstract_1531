Motivated by recent advances in the investigation of fluctuation-driven
ratchets and flows in excited granular media, we have carried out experimental
and simulational studies to explore the horizontal transport of granular
particles in a vertically vibrated system whose base has a sawtooth-shaped
profile. The resulting material flow exhibits novel collective behavior, both
as a function of the number of layers of particles and the driving frequency;
in particular, under certain conditions, increasing the layer thickness leads
to a reversal of the current, while the onset of transport as a function of
frequency can occur either gradually or suddenly in a manner reminiscent of a
phase transition.
