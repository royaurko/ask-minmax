We consider a Morse function $f$ and a Morse-Smale gradient-like vector field
$X$ on a compact connected oriented 3-manifold $M$ such that $f$ has only one
critical point of index 3. Based on Laudenbach's ideas, we will show that the
flow of $X$ can be isotoped into one so that the trajectory spaces of the new
flow provide a stratification for $M$. We will construct "natural" tubular
neighborhoods about each given trajectory space of the new flow such that these
neighborhoods are stratified by open subsets of trajectory spaces that co-bound
the given one. In connection with this we introduce the concept of {\it conic
stratification} of a manifold and point out that this is the appropriate
condition the stratification of $M$ by trajectory spaces should be required to
satisfy.
