The present lecture notes address three columns on which the Lagrangian
perturbation approach to cosmological dynamics is based: 1. the formulation of
a Lagrangian theory of self--gravitating flows in which the dynamics is
described in terms of a single field variable; 2. the procedure, how to obtain
the dynamics of Eulerian fields from the Lagrangian picture, and 3. a precise
definition of a Newtonian cosmology framework in which Lagrangian perturbation
solutions can be studied. While the first is a discussion of the basic
equations obtained by transforming the Eulerian evolution and field equations
to the Lagrangian picture, the second exemplifies how the Lagrangian theory
determines the evolution of Eulerian fields including kinematical variables
like expansion, vorticity, as well as the shear and tidal tensors. The third
column is based on a specification of initial and boundary conditions, and in
particular on the identification of the average flow of an inhomogeneous
cosmology with a ``Hubble--flow''. Here, we also look at the limits of the
Lagrangian perturbation approach as inferred from comparisons with N--body
simulations and illustrate some striking properties of the solutions.
