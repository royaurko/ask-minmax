For any Riemannian foliation F on a closed manifold M with an arbitrary
bundle-like metric, leafwise heat flow of differential forms is proved to
preserve smoothness on M at infinite time. This result and its proof have
consequences about the space of bundle-like metrics on M, about the dimension
of the space of leafwise harmonic forms, and mainly about the second term of
the differentiable spectral sequence of F.
