In this article, we produce infinite families of 4-manifolds with positive
first betti numbers and meeting certain conditions on their homotopy and smooth
types so as to conclude the non-vanishing of the stable cohomotopy
Seiberg-Witten invariants of their connected sums. Elementary building blocks
used in the earlier work of Ishida and Sasahira are shown to be included in our
general construction scheme as well. We then use these families to construct
the first examples of families of closed smooth 4-manifolds for which Gromov's
simplicial volume is nontrivial, Perelman's lambda-bar invariant is negative,
and the relevant Gromov-Hitchin-Thorpe type inequality is satisfied, yet no
non-singular solution to the normalized Ricci flow for any initial metric can
be obtained. Fang, Zhang and Zhang conjectured that the existence of any
non-singular solution to the normalized Ricci flow on smooth 4-manifolds with
non-trivial Gromov's simplicial volume and negative Perelman's lambda-bar
invariant implies the Gromov-Hitchin-Thorpe type inequality. Our results in
particular imply that the converse of this fails to be true for vast families
of 4-manifolds.
