This paper presents a novel mesh-update technique for unsteady free-surface
Newtonian flows using spectral element method and relying on the arbitrary
Lagrangian--Eulerian kinematic description for moving the grid. Selected
results showing compatibility of this mesh-update technique with spectral
element method are given.
