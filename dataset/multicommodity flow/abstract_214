A sectional-Anosov flow on a manifold M is a C^1 vector field inwardly
transverse to the boundary for which the maximal invariant is
sectional-hyperbolic. We prove that every attractor of every vector field C^1
close to a transitive sectional-Anosov flow with singularities on a compact
manifold has a singularity. This extends the three-dimensional result obtained
in [Morales, C.A., The explosion of singular-hyperbolic attractors].
