A simple conservation law formula for field equations with a scaling symmetry
is presented. The formula uses adjoint-symmetries of the given field equation
and directly generates all local conservation laws for any conserved quantities
having non-zero scaling weight. Applications to several soliton equations,
fluid flow and nonlinear wave equations, Yang-Mills equations and the Einstein
gravitational field equations are considered.
