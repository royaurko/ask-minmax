The transverse momentum distributions of hadrons produced in p-p collisions
at LHC energies of Root(sNN) = 0.9 TeV, 2.76 TeV and Root(sNN) = 7.0 TeV have
been studied using a unified statistical thermal freeze-out model. A good
agreement is seen between the theoretical calculations and experimental data.
The extracted thermal freeze-out parameters reveal the presence of significant
collective flow and a well defined temperature in the system thus indicating
the formation of a thermally equilibrated hydrodynamic system in p-p collisions
at LHC. The transverse momentum distributions of protons and Kaons produced in
p-p collisions at Root(sNN) = 200 GeV have also been reproduced successfully.
The model incorporates a longitudinal as well as transverse hydrodynamic flow.
The contributions from heavier decay resonances have also been taken into
account.
