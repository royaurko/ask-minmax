We report first results from the ``Streaming Motions of Abell Clusters''
(SMAC) project, an all-sky Fundamental Plane survey of 699 early-type galaxies
in 56 clusters between ~3000 km/s and ~14000 km/s. For this sample, with a
median distance of ~8000 km/s, we find a bulk flow of amplitude 630+/-200 km/s,
towards l = 260+/-15, b = -1+/-12, with respect to the Cosmic Microwave
Background. The flow is robust against the effects of individual clusters and
data subsets, the choice of Galactic extinction maps, Malmquist bias and
stellar population effects. The direction of the SMAC flow is ~90 degrees away
from the flow found by Lauer & Postman, but is in good agreement with the
gravity dipole predicted from the distribution of X-ray-luminous clusters. Our
detection of a high-amplitude coherent flow on such a large scale argues for
excess mass density fluctuation power at wavelengths >~ 60 h^-1 Mpc, relative
to the predictions of currently-popular cosmological models.
