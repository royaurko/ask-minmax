We analyse the angular dynamics of a neutrally buoyant nearly spherical
particle immersed in a steady general linear flow. The hydrodynamic torque
acting on the particle is obtained by means of a reciprocal theorem, regular
perturbation theory exploiting the small eccentricity of the nearly spherical
particle, and assuming that inertial effects are small, but finite.
