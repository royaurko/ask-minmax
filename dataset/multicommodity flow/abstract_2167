We report numerical results for velocity correlations in dense,
gravity-driven granular flow down an inclined plane. For the grains on the
surface layer, our results are consistent with experimental measurements
reported by Pouliquen. We show that the correlation structure within planes
parallel to the surface persists in the bulk. The two-point velocity
correlation function exhibits exponential decay for small to intermediate
values of the separation between spheres. The correlation lengths identified by
exponential fits to the data show nontrivial dependence on the averaging time
$\dt$ used to determine grain velocities. We discuss the correlation length
dependence on averaging time, incline angle, pile height, depth of the layer,
system size and grain stiffness, and relate the results to other length scales
associated with the rheology of the system. We find that correlation lengths
are typically quite small, of the order of a particle diameter, and increase
approximately logarithmically with a minimum pile height for which flow is
possible, $\hstop$, contrary to the theoretical expectation of a proportional
relationship between the two length scales.
