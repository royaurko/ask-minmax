We consider a hydrodynamic description of the spherically symmetric outward
flow of nuclear matter, accommodating dispersion in it as a very weak effect.
About the resulting stationary conditions in the flow, we apply an Eulerian
scheme to derive a fully nonlinear equation of a time-dependent radial
perturbation. In its linearized limit, with no dispersion, this equation
implies the static acoustic horizon of an analogue gravity model. We, however,
show that time-dependent nonlinear effects destabilize the static horizon. We
also model the perturbation as a high-frequency travelling wave, and perform a
{\it WKB} analysis, in which the effect of weak dispersion is studied
iteratively. We show that even arbitrarily small values of dispersion make the
horizon fully opaque to any acoustic disturbance propagating against the bulk
flow, with the amplitude and the energy flux of the radial perturbation
undergoing a discontinuity at the horizon, and decaying exponentially just
outside it.
