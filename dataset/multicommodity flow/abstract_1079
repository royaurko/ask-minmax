We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of smooth
Lyapunov 1-forms for the flow of a smooth vector field in terms of the behavior
of certain locally finite invariant measures. The main statement generalizes a
result of Schwartzman, whereas the methods are adapted from work of Sullivan.
