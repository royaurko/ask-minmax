Let G=(V,E) be a simple undirected graph. For a given set L of the real line,
a function omega from E to L is called an L-flow. Given a vector gamma whose
coordinates are indexed by V, we say that omega is a gamma-L-flow if for each v
in V, the sum of the values on the edges incident to v is gamma(v). If
gamma(v)=c, for all v in V, then the gamma-L-flow is called a c-sum L-flow. In
this paper we study the existence of gamma-L-flows for various choices of sets
L of real numbers, with an emphasis on 1-sum flows.
  Given a natural k number, a c-sum k-flow is a c-sum flow with values from the
set {-1,1,...,1-k, k-1}. Let L be a subset of real numbers containing 0 and let
L* be L minus 0 by L*. Answering a question from a recent paper we characterize
which bipartite graphs admit a 1-sum R*-flow or a 1-sum Z*-flow. We also show
that that every k-regular graph, with k either odd or congruent to 2 modulo 4,
admits a 1-sum {-1, 0, 1}-flow.
