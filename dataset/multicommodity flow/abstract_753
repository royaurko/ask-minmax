Recently, the discrete unified gas-kinetic scheme (DUGKS) [Z. L. Guo \emph{et
al}., Phys. Rev. E ${\bf 88}$, 033305 (2013)] based on the Boltzmann equation
is developed as a new multiscale kinetic method for isothermal flows. In this
paper, a thermal and coupled discrete unified gas-kinetic scheme is derived for
the Boussinesq flows, where the velocity and temperature fields are described
independently. Kinetic boundary conditions for both velocity and temperature
fields are also proposed. The proposed model is validated by simulating several
canonical test cases, including the porous plate problem, the
Rayleigh-b\'{e}nard convection, and the natural convection with Rayleigh number
up to $10^{10}$ in a square cavity. The results show that the coupled DUGKS is
of second order accuracy in space and can well describe the convection
phenomena from laminar to turbulent flows. Particularly, it is found that this
new scheme has better numerical stability in simulating high Rayleigh number
flows compared with the previous kinetic models.
