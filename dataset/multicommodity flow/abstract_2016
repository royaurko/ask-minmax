The partition function of the two-dimensional Ising model is exactly obtained
on a lattice with a twisted boundary condition. The continuum limit of the
model off the critical temperature is found to give the mass-deformed Ising
conformal field theory (CFT) on the torus with the complex structure $\tau$. We
find that the renormalization group (RG) flow of the mass parameter can be
holographically described in terms of the three-dimensional gravity including a
scalar field with a simple nonlinear kinetic function and a quadratic
potential.
