We derive analytical forms for nonflow contributions from cluster correlation
to the measurement of two-particle elliptic flow (v2{2}). We estimate nonflow
contribution from rho->pi+pi decays and find it is negative but not a major
contributor to the nonflow effect in v2{2}. We also estimate nonflow
contribution from the recent STAR measurement of two-particle angular
correlations.
