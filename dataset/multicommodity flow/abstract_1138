Interstellar magnetic fields in elliptical galaxies are assumed to have their
origin in stellar fields that accompany normal mass loss from an evolving
population of old stars. The seed fields are amplified by interstellar
turbulence driven by stellar mass loss and supernova events. These disordered
fields are further amplified by time-dependent compression in the inward moving
galactic cooling flow and are expected to dominate near the galactic core.
Under favorable circumstances, fields similar in strength to those observed $B
\sim 1-10~(r/10~kpc)^{-1.2}\mu$G can be generated solely from these natural
galactic processes. In general the interstellar field throughout elliptical
galaxies is determined by the outermost regions in the interstellar gas where
the turbulent dynamo process can occur. Because of the long hydrodynamic flow
times in galactic cooling flows, currently observed magnetic fields may result
from periods of intense turbulent field amplification that occurred in the
outer galaxy in the distant past. Particularly strong fields in ellipticals may
result from ancient galactic mergers or shear turbulence introduced at the
boundary between the interstellar gas and ambient cluster gas.
