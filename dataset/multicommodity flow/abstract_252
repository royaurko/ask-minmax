The dynamics of a single fluid bilayer membrane in an external hydrodynamic
flow field is considered. The deterministic equation of motion for the
configuration is derived taking into account both viscous dissipation in the
surrounding liquid and local incompressibility of the membrane. For
quasi-spherical vesicles in shear flow, thermal fluctuations can be
incorporated in a Langevin-type equation of motion for the deformation
amplitudes. The solution to this equation shows an overdamped oscillatory
approach to a stationary tanktreading shape. Inclination angle and ellipiticity
of the contour are determined as a function of excess area and shear rate.
Comparisons to numerical results and experiments are discussed.
