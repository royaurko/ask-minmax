The collective expansion of matter created in collisions of heavy-ions,
ranging from collision energies of tens of MeV to a few TeV per nucleon pair,
proved to be one of the best probes to study the detailed properties of these
unknown states of matter. Collective expansion originates from the initial
pressure gradients in the created hot and dense matter. These pressure
gradients transform the initial spatial deformations and inhomogeneities of the
created matter into momentum anisotropies of the final state particle
production, which we call anisotropic flow. These momentum anisotropies are
experimentally characterised by so-called flow harmonics. In this paper I
review ALICE measurements of the flow harmonics at the CERN Large Hadron
Collider and discuss some of the open questions.
