We study the correlation between the trigger $\pi$ and the associated
$J/\psi$ on near and away sides in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV.
In the region of trigger momentum $p_t>4$ GeV/$c$, the $\pi$ spectrum is
composed of thermal-shower and shower-shower recombinations in the frame work
of the recombination model. We consider the azimuthal anisotropy in the
quenched hard parton distribution and then calculate the elliptic flow
parameter $v_2$ of charmed mesons ($J/\psi$, $D^0$ and $D_s$) for different
centralities.
