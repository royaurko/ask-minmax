We consider the massless tricritical Ising model M(4,5) perturbed by the
thermal operator in a cylindrical geometry and apply integrable boundary
conditions, labelled by the Kac labels (r,s), that are natural off-critical
perturbations of known conformal boundary conditions. We derive massless
thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) equations for all excitations by solving, in
the continuum scaling limit, the TBA functional equation satisfied by the
double-row transfer matrices of the A_4 lattice model of Andrews, Baxter and
Forrester (ABF) in Regime IV. The resulting TBA equations describe the massless
renormalization group flow from the tricritical to critical Ising model. As in
the massive case of Part I, the excitations are completely classified in terms
of (m,n) systems but the string content changes by one of three mechanisms
along the flow. Using generalized q-Vandemonde identities, we show that this
leads to a flow from tricritical to critical Ising characters. The excited TBA
equations are solved numerically to follow the continuous flows from the UV to
the IR conformal fixed points.
