We propose that in nuclear collisions at the LHC the elliptic flow may get a
contribution from leading hard and semihard partons which deposit energy and
momentum into the hydrodynamic bulk medium. The crucial effect is that these
partons induce wakes which interact and merge if they come together. The
contribution to the integrated elliptic flow is estimated with the help of a
toy model to about 25% of the observed value and shows strong event-by-event
fluctuations.
