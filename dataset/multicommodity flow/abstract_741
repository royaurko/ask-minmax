In this paper, a multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann (LB) model
is developed for simulating incompressible axisymmetric thermal flows in porous
media at the representative elementary volume (REV) scale. In the model, a D2Q9
MRT-LB equation is proposed to solve the flow field in addition to the D2Q5 LB
equation for the temperature field. The source terms of the model are simple
and contain no velocity and temperature gradient terms. The generalized
axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations for axisymmetric flows in porous media are
correctly recovered from the MRT-LB model through the Chapman-Enskog analysis
in the moment space. The present model is validated by numerical simulations of
several typical axisymmetric thermal problems in porous media. The numerical
results agree well with the data reported in the literature, demonstrating the
effectiveness and accuracy of the present MRT-LB model for simulating
axisymmetric thermal flows in porous media.
