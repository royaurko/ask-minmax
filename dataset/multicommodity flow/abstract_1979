The piecewise parabolic method and related schemes are widely used to model
stellar flows. Several different methods for extending the validity of these
methods to a general equation of state have been proposed over time, but direct
comparisons amongst one-another and exact solutions with stellar equations of
state are not widely available. We introduce some simple test problems with
exact solutions run with a popular stellar equation of state and test how two
existing codes with different approaches to incorporating general gases
perform. The source code for generating the exact solutions is made available.
