The Kruskal-Segur approach to selection theory in diffusion-limited or
Laplacian growth is extended via combination with the Zauderer decomposition
scheme. This way nonlinear bulk equations become tractable. To demonstrate the
method, we apply it to two-dimensional crystal growth in a potential flow. We
omit the simplifying approximations used in a preliminary calculation for the
same system [T. Fischaleck, K. Kassner, EPL 81, 54004 (2008)], thus exhibiting
the capability of the method to extend mathematical rigor to more complex
problems than hitherto accessible.
