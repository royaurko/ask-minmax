We aim to understand the role of Coulomb interactions as well as of different
equations of state on the disappearance of transverse flow for various
asymmetric reactions leading to same total mass. For the present study, the
total mass of the system is kept constant (ATOT = 152) and asymmetry of the
reaction is varied between 0.2 and 0.7. We find that the contribution of
mean-field at low incident energies is more for nearly symmetric systems, while
the trend is opposite at higher incident energies. The Coulomb interactions as
well as different equations of state are found to affect the balance energy
significantly for larger asymmetric reactions.
