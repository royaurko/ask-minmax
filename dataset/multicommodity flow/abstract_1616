We employ nonperturbative flow equations for an investigation of the
effective action in Yang-Mills theories. We compute the effective action
$\Gamma[B]$ for constant color magnetic fields $B$ and examine Savvidy's
conjecture of an unstable perturbative vacuum. Our results indicate that the
absolute minimum of $\Gamma[B]$ occurs for B=0. Gluon condensation is described
by a nonvanishing expectation value of the regularized composite operator
$F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$ which agrees with phenomenological estimates.
