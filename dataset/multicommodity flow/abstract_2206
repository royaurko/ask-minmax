We analyze the Lagrangian flow in a family of simple Gaussian scale-invariant
velocity ensembles that exhibit both spatial roughness and temporal
correlations. We show that the behavior of the Lagrangian dispersion of pairs
of fluid particles in such models is determined by the scale dependence of the
ratio between the correlation time of velocity differences and the eddy
turnover time. For a non-trivial scale dependence, the asymptotic regimes of
the dispersion at small and large scales are described by the models with
either rapidly decorrelating or frozen velocities. In contrast to the
decorrelated case, known as the Kraichnan model and exhibiting Lagrangian flows
with deterministic or stochastic trajectories, fast separating or trapped
together, the frozen model is poorly understood. We examine the pair dispersion
behavior in its simplest, one-dimensional version, reinforcing analytic
arguments by numerical analysis. The collected information about the pair
dispersion statistics in the limiting models allows to partially predict the
extent of different phases and the scaling properties of the Lagrangian flow in
the model with time-correlated velocities.
