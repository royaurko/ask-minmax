The scaling properties of elliptic flow of hadrons produced in
ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions are investigated at low transverse
momenta, $p_T\lsim 2$\,GeV. Utilizing empirical parameterizations of a
thermalized fireball with collective-flow fields, Resonance Recombination Model
(RRM) is employed to describe hadronization via quark coalescence at the
hadronization transition. We reconfirm that RRM converts equilibrium quark
distribution functions into equilibrated hadron spectra including the effects
of space-momentum correlations on elliptic flow. This provides the basis for a
controlled extraction of quark distributions of the bulk matter at
hadronization from spectra of multi-strange hadrons which are believed to
decouple close to the critical temperature. The resulting elliptic flow from
empirical fits at RHIC exhibits transverse kinetic-energy and valence-quark
scaling. Utilizing the well-established concept of sequential freeze-out we
find that the scaling at low momenta can be extended to bulk hadrons ($\pi$,
$K$, $p$) at thermal freeze-out, and thus result in an overall description
compatible with both equilibrium hydrodynamics and quark recombination.
