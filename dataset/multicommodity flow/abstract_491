We report a gas flow driven voltage generation of Octyltrichlorosilane (OTS)
molecules self assembled on silicon wafers (Si wafers). OTS Self assembled
Monolayer (SAM) has been coated on both p-type and n-type doped silicon wafers
(p-Si and n-Si wafers) using dip coating method. We have measured the flow
induced voltage generation on OTS SAM coated Si wafers/ Uncoated Si wafers at
modest gas flow velocities of subsonic regime (Mach number < 0.2) using
national instruments NI-PXI-1044 Workstation. The gas flow driven voltage
generation is mainly due to the interplay mechanisms of Bernoulli principle and
Seebeck effect. The surface morphology of OTS SAM coated p-Si and n-Si wafers
were characterized by SEM analysis. In this study, our results shows that OTS
SAM coated p-Si and n-Si wafers shows better sensitivity towards nitrogen gas
flow when compared with the uncoated Si wafers. OTS SAM also exhibits high
thermal stability and hydrophobicity.
