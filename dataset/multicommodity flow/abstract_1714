We give a straightforward derivation of the string equation and Virasoro
constraints on the $\tau$ function of the BKP hierarchy by means of some
special additional symmetry flows. The explicit forms of the actions of these
additional symmetry flows on the wave function and then the negative Virasoro
generators $L_{-k}$ are given, where $k$ is a positive integer.
