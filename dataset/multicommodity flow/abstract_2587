We show that for weakly exact magnetic flows with infinite Ma\~n\'e critical
value the action functional satisfies the Palais-Smale condition on the space
of contractible loops with period bounded and bounded away from zero. This
fills a gap in the proof of the existence of one closed contractible magnetic
geodesic for almost every energy in [Merry, 2010]. The gap has also been fixed
independently by Will Merry and it will appear soon in an erratum by the
contributor. The idea used for the weakly exact case is then generalized to
arbitrary magnetic flows to study critical sequences for the action 1-form. As
a corollary we prove that if the second fundamental group of the base manifold
is non-trivial, there exists one closed contractible magnetic geodesic for
almost every energy.
