We investigate the flow field in the sunspot canopy using simultaneous Stokes
vector spectropolarimetry of three sunspots ($\theta$ = 27, 50, 75 deg) and
their surroundings in visible (630.15 and 630.25 nm) and near infrared (1564.8
and 1565.2 nm) neutral iron lines.} {To calibrate the Doppler shifts, we
compare an absolute velocity calibration using the telluric $O_2$-line at
630.20 nm and a relative velocity calibration using the Doppler shift of Stokes
V profiles in the umbra under the assumption that the umbra is at rest. Both
methods yield the same result within the calibration uncertainties (~150 m/s).
We study the radial dependence of Stokes V profiles in the directions of disk
center and limb side. Maps of Stokes V profile shifts, polarity, amplitude
asymmetry, field strength and magnetic field azimuth provide strong evidence
for the presence of a magnetic canopy and for the existence of a radial outflow
in the canopy. Our findings indicate that the Evershed flow does not cease
abruptly at the white-light spot boundary, but that at least a part of the
penumbral Evershed flow continues into the magnetic canopy.
