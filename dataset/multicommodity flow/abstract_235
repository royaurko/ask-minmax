We consider the mixed Ginzburg-Landau flow that is supplemented with
convective derivatives of the unknown function. We show that the associated
vortex motion law is the mixed flow of the renormalized energy with new
nonlinear forcing terms. These terms are uniquely determined by the extra terms
in the initial PDE. Our proof relies on the assumption that the initial data
are close to optimal.
