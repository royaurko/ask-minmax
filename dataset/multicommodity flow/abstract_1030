We study boundary renormalization group flows of N=2 minimal models using
Landau-Ginzburg description of B-type. A simple algebraic relation of matrices
is relevant. We determine the pattern of the flows and identify the operators
that generate them. As an application, we show that the charge lattice of
B-branes in the level k minimal model is Z_{k+2}. We also reproduce the fact
that the charge lattice for the A-branes is Z^{k+1}, applying the B-brane
analysis on the mirror LG orbifold.
