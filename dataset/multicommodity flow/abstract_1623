We study BPS domain wall solutions of 5-dimensional N=2 supergravity where
isometries of the hypermultiplet geometry have been gauged. We derive the
corresponding supersymmetric flow equations and define an appropriate
c-function. As an example we discuss a domain wall solution of Freedman,
Gubser, Pilch and Warner which is related to a RG-flow in a dual superconformal
field theory.
