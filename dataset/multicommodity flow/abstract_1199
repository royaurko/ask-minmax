The three-dimensional baroclinic quasigeostrophic flow model has been widely
used to study basic mechanisms in oceanic flows and climate dynamics. In this
paper, we consider this flow model under random wind forcing and time-periodic
fluctuations on fluid boundary (the interface between the oceans and the
atmosphere). The time-periodic fluctuations are due to periodic rotation of the
earth and thus periodic exposure of the earth to the solar radiation. After
establishing the well-posedness of the baroclinic quasigeostrophic flow model
in the state space, we demonstrate the existence of the random attractors,
again in the state space. We also discuss the relevance of our result to
climate modeling.
