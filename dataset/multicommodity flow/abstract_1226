Finite-size impurities suspended in incompressible flows distribute
inhomogeneously, leading to a drastic enhancement of collisions. A description
of the dynamics in the full position-velocity phase space is essential to
understand the underlying mechanisms, especially for polydisperse suspensions.
These issues are here studied for particles much heavier than the fluid by
means of a Lagrangian approach. It is shown that inertia enhances collision
rates through two effects: correlation among particle positions induced by the
carrier flow and uncorrelation between velocities due to their finite size. A
phenomenological model yields an estimate of collision rates for particle pairs
with different sizes. This approach is supported by numerical simulations in
random flows.
