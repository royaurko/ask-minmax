Using FOPI data on elliptic flow in Au+Au collisions between 0.4 and 1.5A GeV
we extract constraints for the equation of state (EOS) of compressed symmetric
nuclear matter using the transport code IQMD by introducing an observable
describing the evolution of the size of the elliptic flow as a function of
rapidity. This observable is sensitive to the nuclear EOS and a robust tool to
constrain the compressibility of nuclear matter up to 2 $\rho_0$.
