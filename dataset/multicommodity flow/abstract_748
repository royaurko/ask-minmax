We investigate the correlation between various aspects of the initial
geometry of heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
energies and the final anisotropic flow, using v-USPhydro, a 2+1 event-by-event
viscous relativistic hydrodynamical model. We test the extent of which shear
and bulk viscosity affect the prediction of the final flow harmonics, $v_n$,
from the initial eccentricities, $\varepsilon_n$. We investigate in detail the
flow harmonics $v_1$ through $v_5$ where we find that $v_1$, $v_4$, and $v_5$
are dependent on more complicated aspects of the initial geometry that are
especially important for the description of peripheral collisions, including a
non-linear dependence on eccentricities as well as a dependence on
shorter-scale features of the initial density. Furthermore, we compare our
results to previous results from NeXSPheRIO, a 3+1 relativistic ideal
hydrodynamical model that has a non-zero initial flow contribution, and find
that the combined contribution from 3+1 dynamics and non-zero, fluctuating
initial flow decreases the predictive ability of the initial eccentricities, in
particular for very peripheral collisions, but also disproportionately in
central collisions.
