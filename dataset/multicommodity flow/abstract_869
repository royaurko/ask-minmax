We show by systemically experimental investigation that gas-flow-induced
voltage in monolayer graphene is more than twenty times of that in bulk
graphite. Examination over samples with sheet resistances ranging from 307 to
1600 {\Omega}/sq shows that the induced voltage increase with the resistance
and can be further improved by controlling the quality and doping level of
graphene. The induced voltage is nearly independent of the substrate materials
and can be well explained by the interplay of Bernoulli's principle and the
carrier density dependent Seebeck coefficient. The results demonstrate that
graphene has great potential for flow sensors and energy conversion devices.
