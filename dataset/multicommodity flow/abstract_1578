We discuss the general-relativistic contributions to occur in the
electromagnetic properties of a superconductor with a heat flow. The appearance
of general-relativistic contribution to the magnetic flux through a
superconducting thermoelectric bimetallic circuit is shown. A response of the
Josephson junctions to a heat flow is investigated in the general-relativistic
framework. Some gravitothermoelectric effects which are observable in the
superconducting state in the Earth's gravitational field are considered.
