Let Y be a compact, oriented 3-manifold with a contact form a. For any Dirac
operator D, we study the asymptotic behavior of the spectral flow between D and
D+cl(-ira) as r very large. If a is the Thurston-Winkelnkemper contact form
whose monodromy is the product of Dehn twists along disjoint circles, we prove
that the next order term of the spectral flow function is of order r.
