In this paper we analyze Ricci flows on which the scalar curvature is
globally or locally bounded from above by a uniform or time-dependent constant.
On such Ricci flows we establish a new time-derivative bound for solutions to
the heat equation. Based on this bound, we solve several open problems: 1.
distance distortion estimates, 2. the existence of a cutoff function, 3.
Gaussian bounds for heat kernels, and, 4. a backward pseudolocality theorem,
which states that a curvature bound at a later time implies a curvature bound
at a slightly earlier time.
  Using the backward pseudolocality theorem, we next establish a uniform $L^2$
curvature bound in dimension 4 and we show that the flow in dimension 4
converges to an orbifold at a singularity. We also obtain a stronger
$\varepsilon$-regularity theorem for Ricci flows. This result is particularly
useful in the study of K\"ahler Ricci flows on Fano manifolds, where it can be
used to derive certain convergence results.
