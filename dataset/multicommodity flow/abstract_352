This is the first of a series of papers, where we introduce a new class of
estimates for the Ricci flow, and use them both to characterize solutions of
the Ricci flow and to provide a notion of weak solutions to the Ricci flow in
the nonsmooth setting. In this first paper, we prove various new estimates for
the Ricci flow, and show that they in fact characterize solutions of the Ricci
flow. Namely, given a family $(M,g_t)_{t\in I}$ of Riemannian manifolds, we
consider the path space $P\mathcal{M}$ of its space time $\mathcal{M}=M\times
I$. Our first characterization says that $(M,g_t)_{t\in I}$ evolves by Ricci
flow if and only if an infinite dimensional gradient estimate holds for all
functions on $P\mathcal{M}$. We prove additional characterizations in terms of
the $C^{1/2}$-regularity of martingales on path space, as well as
characterizations in terms of log-Sobolev and spectral gap inequalities for a
family of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type operators. Our estimates are infinite
dimensional generalizations of much more elementary estimates for the linear
heat equation on $(M,g_t)_{t\in I}$, which themselves generalize the
Bakry-Emery-Ledoux estimates for spaces with lower Ricci curvature bounds.
Based on our characterizations we can define a notion of weak solutions for the
Ricci flow. We will develop the structure theory of these weak solutions in
subsequent papers.
