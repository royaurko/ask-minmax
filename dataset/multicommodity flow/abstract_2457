We present the first measurement of the direct-photon elliptic flow
v_{2}^{\gamma,dir} in Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt(NN) = 2.76 TeV with data taken
by the ALICE experiment at the LHC. The measurement provides evidence for a
non-zero v_{2}^{\gamma,dir} for 1 < p_T < 3 GeV/c with a magnitude similar to
the observed charged pion v_2. In order to explain the large inverse slope
parameter T_eff of the low p_T direct-photon spectrum observed at LHC and RHIC,
recent hydrodynamical descriptions of the direct-photon production include a
substantial portion of thermal photons from the hot plasma phase. As a
consequence of the early production time, v_{2}^{\gamma,dir} is expected to be
small compared to hadrons. A large v_{2}^{\gamma,dir} might lend support for a
significant direct-photon emission from late stages of the system evolution
where hadron flow has developed.
