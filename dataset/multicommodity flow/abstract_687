Hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic numerical studies of a mechanically
forced two-vortex flow inside a sphere are reported. The simulations are
performed in the intermediate regime between the laminar flow and developed
turbulence where a hydrodynamic instability is found to generate internal waves
with a characteristic m=2 zonal wave number. It is shown that this
time-periodic flow acts as a dynamo although snapshots of the flow as well as
the mean flow are not dynamos. The magnetic fields' growth rate exhibits
resonance effects depending on the wave frequency. Furthermore, a cyclic
self-killing and self-recovering dynamo based on the relative alignment of the
velocity and magnetic fields is presented. The phenomena are explained in terms
of a mixing of non-orthogonal eigenstates of the time dependent linear operator
of the magnetic induction equation. The potential relevance of this mechanism
to dynamo experiments is discussed.
