Dense supercooled colloidal melt in forward shear from a quiescent state
shows overshoot in shear stress at 10% strain with an unchanged fluid structure
at equal stress before and after overshoot. In addition, we find overshoot in
normal stress with a monotonic increase in osmotic pressure at an identical
strain. The first and second normal stress become comparable in magnitude and
opposite in sign. Functional dependence of the steady state stress and osmotic
pressure with Peclet number demonstrate signature of crossover between
Newtonian and nearly- Newtonian regime. Moreover, instantaneous shear reversal
from steady state exhibit Bauschinger effect, where strong history dependence
is observed depending on the time of flow reversal. The distribution of
particulate stress and osmotic pressure at the point of flow reversal is shown
to be a signature of the subsequent response. We link the history dependence of
the stress-strain curves to changes in the fluid structure measured through the
angular components of the radial distribution function. A uniform compression
in transition from forward to reversed flowing state is found.
