We study the elliptic flow $v_2$ of multi-strange hadrons such as the $\phi$,
$\Xi$ and $\Omega$ as a function of transverse momentum in the recombination
and fragmentation model and compare to a standard hydrodynamic calculation. We
find that the measurement of $v_2$ for the $\phi$ and $\Omega$ will allow for
the unambiguous distinction between parton recombination and statistical
hadro-chemistry to be the dominant process in hadronization at intermediate
transverse momenta.
