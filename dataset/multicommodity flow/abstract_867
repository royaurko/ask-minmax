We give a natural definition of geodesics on a Riemannian supermanifold and
extend the usual geodesic flow defined on the cotangent bundle of the body of
the supermanifold, associated to the induced Riemannian structure on the body,
to a geodesic "superflow" on the cotangent bundle of the supermanifold.
Integral curves of this flow turn out to be in natural bijection with geodesics
on the Riemannian supermanifold. We also construct the corresponding
exponential map and generalize the well-known faithful linearization of
isometries to Riemannian supermanifolds.
