A simple model that describes traffic flow in two dimensions is studied. A
sharp {\it jamming transition } is found that separates between the low density
dynamical phase in which all cars move at maximal speed and the high density
jammed phase in which they are all stuck. Self organization effects in both
phases are studied and discussed.
