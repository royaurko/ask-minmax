We prove uniqueness of instantaneously complete Ricci flows on surfaces. We
do not require any bounds of any form on the curvature or its growth at
infinity, nor on the metric or its growth (other than that implied by
instantaneous completeness). Coupled with earlier work, particularly [23, 11],
this completes the well-posedness theory for instantaneously complete Ricci
flows on surfaces.
