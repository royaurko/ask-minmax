We investigate the low-energy behavior of the gradient flow of the $L^2$ norm
of the Riemannian curvature on four-manifolds. Specifically, we show long time
existence and exponential convergence to a metric of constant sectional
curvature when the initial metric has positive Yamabe constant and small
initial energy.
