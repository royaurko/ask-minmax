$\lambda\varphi^4$ theory at finite temperature suffers from infrared
divergences near the temperature at which the symmetry is restored. These
divergences are handled using renormalization group methods. Flow equations
which use a fiducial mass as flow parameter are well adapted to predicting the
non-trivial critical exponents whose presence is reflected in these
divergences. Using a fiducial temperature as flow parameter, we predict the
critical temperature, at which the mass vanishes, in terms of the
zero-temperature mass and coupling. We find some universal amplitude ratios
which connect the broken and symmetric phases of the theory which agree well
with those of the three-dimensional Ising model obtained from high- and
low-temperature series expansions.
