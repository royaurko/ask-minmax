The question what information is necessary for determination of a unique
solution of hydrodynamic equations for ideal fluid is investigated. Arbitrary
inviscid flows of the barotropic fluid and of incompressible fluid are
considered. After integrating hydrodynamic equations, all information on the
fluid flow is concentrated in dynamic equations in the form of indefinite
functions, whereas the initial and boundary conditions contain information on
the fluid particle labeling. It is shown that for determination of the
stationary flow of the incompressible fluid the vorticity on any stream line
must be given. Giving the velocity on the boundary, one does not determine the
vorticity, in general. If there are closed stream lines, the vorticity cannot
be given on them via boundary conditions. This circumstance explains existence
of different stationary vortical flows under the same boundary conditions.
