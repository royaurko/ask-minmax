We show the properties of the blowup limits of \KRf solutions on Fano
surfaces if Riemannian curvature is unbounded. As an application, on every
toric Fano surface, we prove that \KRf converges to a K\"ahler Ricci soliton
metric if the initial metric has toric symmetry. Therefore we give a new Ricci
flow proof of existence of K\"ahler Ricci soliton metrics on toric surfaces.
