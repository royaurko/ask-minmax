Recent studies show that spherical motile micro-organisms in turbulence
subject to gravitational torques gather in down-welling regions of the
turbulent flow. By analysing a statistical model we analytically compute how
shape affects this preferential sampling and small-scale spatial clustering
(determining local encounter rates). By recursively refining approximations for
the paths the organisms take through the flow we determine how preferential
sampling and small-scale clustering in the model depend upon the dimensionless
parameters of the problem. We show that singularities ("caustics") affect the
dynamics of motile micro-organisms.
