Recently, we proposed a new method to extract the string tension from
4-dimensionally smeared Wilson loops. In this talk, we first show that the
results obtained using this smearing method are identical to those obtained by
Wilson flow, once the time step is sufficiently small. We then demonstrate the
practical advantage of our method by applying it to the calculation of string
tension in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory.
