We consider holographic RG flows which interpolate between non-trivial
ultra-violet (UV) and infra-red (IR) conformal fixed points. We study the
``superpotentials'' which characterize different flows and discuss their
expansions near the fixed points. Then we focus on the holographic $c$-function
as defined from the two-point function of the stress-energy tensor. We point
out that the equation for the metric fluctuations in the background flow is
equivalent to a scattering problem and we use this to obtain an expression for
the $c$-function in terms of the associated Jost functions. We propose two
explicit models that realize UV-IR flows. In the first example we consider a
thin wall separating two AdS spaces with different radii, while in the second
one the UV region is replaced with an asymptotically AdS space. We find that
the holographic $c$-function obeys the expected properties. In particular it
reduces to the correct -- nonzero -- central charge in the IR limit.
