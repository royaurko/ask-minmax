For a supersonic Euler flow past a straight wedge whose vertex angle is less
than the extreme angle, there exists a shock-front emanating from the wedge
vertex, and the shock-front is usually strong especially when the vertex angle
of the wedge is large. In this paper, we establish the $L^1$ well-posedness for
two-dimensional steady supersonic Euler flows past a Lipschitz wedge whose
boundary slope function has small total variation, when the total variation of
the incoming flow is sufficiently small. In this case, the Lipschitz wedge
perturbs the flow and the waves reflect after interacting with the strong
shock-front or the wedge boundary. We first obtain the existence of solutions
in $BV$ when the incoming flow has small total variation by the wave front
tracking method and then study the $L^1$ stability of the solutions. In
particular, we incorporate the nonlinear waves generated from the wedge
boundary to develop a Lyapunov functional between two solutions, which is
equivalent to the $L^1$ norm, and prove that the functional decreases in the
flow direction. Then the $L^1$ stability is established, so is the uniqueness
of the solutions by the wave front tracking method. Finally, we show the
uniqueness of solutions in a broader class, i.e. the class of viscosity
solutions.
