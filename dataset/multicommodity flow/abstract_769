We study the spatial patterns formed by interacting populations or reacting
chemicals under the influence of chaotic flows. In particular, we have
considered a three-component model of plankton dynamics advected by a
meandering jet. We report general results, stressing the existence of a
smooth-filamental transition in the concentration patterns depending on the
relative strength of the stirring by the chaotic flow and the relaxation
properties of planktonic dynamical system. Patterns obtained in open and closed
flows are compared.
