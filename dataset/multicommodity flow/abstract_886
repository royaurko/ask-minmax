In the spirit of analog models of and for general relativity, we explore the
isomorphism between the equations of linearized turbulent fluid flow and those
of the linearized form of GR, gravitoelectromagnetism. The correspondence
between the truncated Reynolds system for turbulent fluid flow and the
Maxwell-like gravitoelectromagnetic equations for weak-field GR is shown to
provide yet another example of the relationship between the representation of
fluctuations in background media and curved spacetime formulations.
