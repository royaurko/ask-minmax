The renormalization group flow in the theory space of a BRST invariant string
$\sigma$-model is investigated. For the open bosonic string the
non-perturbative off-shell effective action and its gauge symmetry properties
are determined from $\beta$-functions defined by the local Weyl anomaly. The
interactions are shown to explicitly break the free theory BRST invariance
generating new non-linear gauge symmetries of the type present in Witten's
string field theory. In the Feynman-Siegel gauge the $\sigma$-model is shown to
generate Witten's structure of vertex couplings.
