We investigate the invariant probability measures for Cherry flows, i.e.
flows on the two-torus which have a saddle, a source, and no other fixed
points, closed orbits or homoclinic orbits. In the case when the saddle is
dissipative or conservative we show that the only invariant probability
measures are the Dirac measures at the two fixed points, and the Dirac measure
at the saddle is the physical measure. In the other case we prove that there
exists also an invariant probability measure supported on the quasi-minimal
set, we discuss some situations when this other invariant measure is the
physical measure, and conjecture that this is always the case. The main
techniques used are the study of the integrability of the return time with
respect to the invariant measure of the return map to a closed transversal to
the flow, and the study of the close returns near the saddle.
