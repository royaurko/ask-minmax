A traffic flow is one of the main transportation issues in nowadays
industrialized agglomerations. Configuration of traffic lights is among the key
aspects in traffic flow management. This paper proposes an evolutionary
optimization tool that utilizes multiagent simulator in order to obtain
accurate model. Even though more detailed studies are still necessary, a
preliminary research gives an expectation for promising results.
