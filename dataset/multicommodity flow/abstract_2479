We consider a one dimensional transport model with nonlocal velocity given by
the Hilbert transform and develop a global well-posedness theory of probability
measure solutions. Both the viscous and non-viscous cases are analyzed. Both in
original and in self-similar variables, we express the corresponding equations
as gradient flows with respect to a free energy functional including a singular
logarithmic interaction potential. Existence, uniqueness, self-similar
asymptotic behavior and inviscid limit of solutions are obtained in the space
$\mathcal{P}_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ of probability measures with finite second
moments, without any smallness condition. Our results are based on the abstract
gradient flow theory developed in \cite{Ambrosio}. An important byproduct of
our results is that there is a unique, up to invariance and translations,
global in time self-similar solution with initial data in
$\mathcal{P}_{2}(\mathbb{R})$, which was already obtained in
\textrm{\cite{Deslippe,Biler-Karch}} by different methods. Moreover, this
self-similar solution attracts all the dynamics in self-similar variables. The
crucial monotonicity property of the transport between measures in one
dimension allows to show that the singular logarithmic potential energy is
displacement convex. We also extend the results to gradient flow equations with
negative power-law locally integrable interaction potentials.
