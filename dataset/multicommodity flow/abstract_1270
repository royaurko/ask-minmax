Motivated by the need for a theoretical study in a planar geometry that can
easily be implemented experimentally, we study the pressure driven Poiseuille
flow of a shear banding fluid. After discussing the "basic states" predicted by
a one dimensional calculation that assumes a flat interface between the bands,
we proceed to demonstrate such an interface to be unstable with respect to the
growth of undulations along it. We give results for the growth rate and
wavevector of the most unstable mode that grows initially, as well as for the
ultimate flow patterns to which the instability leads. We discuss the relevance
of our predictions to the present state of the experimental literature
concerning interfacial instabilities of shear banded flows, in both
conventional rheometers and microfluidic channels.
