We study the evolution of wormhole geometries under Ricci flow using
numerical methods. Depending on values of initial data parameters, wormhole
throats either pinch off or evolve to a monotonically growing state. The
transition between these two behaviors exhibits a from of critical phenomena
reminiscent of that observed in gravitational collapse. Similar results are
obtained for initial data that describe space bubbles attached to
asymptotically flat regions. Our numerical methods are applicable to
"matter-coupled" Ricci flows derived from conformal invariance in string
theory.
