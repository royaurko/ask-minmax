In this section, we examine the transition from statistically homogeneous
turbulence to inhomogeneous turbulence with zonal flows. Statistical equations
of motion can be derived from the quasilinear approximation to the
Hasegawa-Mima equation. We review recent work that finds a bifurcation of these
equations and shows that the emergence of zonal flows mathematically follows a
standard type of pattern formation. We also show that the dispersion relation
of modulational instability can be extracted from the statistical equations of
motion in a certain limit. The statistical formulation can thus be thought to
offer a more general perspective on growth of coherent structures, namely
through instability of a full turbulent spectrum. Finally, we offer a physical
perspective on the growth of large-scale structures.
