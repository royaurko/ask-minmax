In this work we illustrate some well-known facts about the evolution of $S^3$
under the Ricci flow. The Dirac flow we introduce allows us to describe the 4-
dimensional metrics with constant curvature. Another new flow leads to the
Eguchi-Hanson metric and can be defined either on metric or on corresponding
contact forms.
