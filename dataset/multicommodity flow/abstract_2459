We briefly summarize the method of simulating Sgr A* polarized sub-mm spectra
from the accretion flow and fitting the observed spectrum. The dynamical flow
model is based on three-dimensional general relativistic magneto hydrodynamic
simulations. Fully self-consistent radiative transfer of polarized
cyclo-synchrotron emission is performed. We compile a mean sub-mm spectrum of
Sgr A* and fit it with the mean simulated spectra. We estimate the ranges of
inclination angle theta=42-75deg, mass accretion rate
Mdot=(1.4-7.0)*10^{-8}Msun/yr, and electron temperature Te=(3-4)*10^{10}K at
6M. We discuss multiple caveats in dynamical modeling, which must be resolved
to make further progress.
