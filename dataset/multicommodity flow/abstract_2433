A same-side (SS, on azimuth $\phi$) 2D peak in measured angular correlations
from 200 GeV \pp collisions exhibits properties expected for jet formation. In
more-central \auau collisions the SS peak becomes elongated on pseudorapidity
$\eta$ and the transverse momentum $p_t$ structure is modified. In the latter
case the SS 2D peak has been referred to as a "Soft Ridge", and arguments have
been presented that the elongated peak represents flow phenomena ("triangular"
and "higher harmonic" flows), possibly related to the initial-state \aa
geometry. In this presentation I demonstrate that "higher harmonic flows" are
related to SS 2D peak properties and review evidence for a jet interpretation
of the SS peak for all \auau centralities.
