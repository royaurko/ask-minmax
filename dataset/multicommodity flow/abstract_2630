Understanding the relaxation of a system towards equilibrium is a
longstanding problem in statistical mechanics. Here we address the role of
long-range interactions in this process by considering a class of
two-dimensional or geophysical flows where the interaction between fluid
particles varies with the distance as $\sim$ r^($\alpha$--2) with $\alpha$
\textgreater{} 0. Previous studies in the Euler case $\alpha$ = 2 had shown
convergence towards a variety of quasi-stationary states by changing the
initial state. Unexpectedly, all those regimes are recovered by changing
$\alpha$ with a prescribed initial state. For small $\alpha$, a coarsening
process leads to the formation of a sharp interface between two regions of
homogenized $\alpha$-vorticity; for large $\alpha$, the flow is attracted to a
stable dipolar structure through a filamentation process.
