We address in this paper the study of a geometric evolution, corresponding to
a curvature which is non-local and singular at the origin. The curvature
represents the first variation of the energy recently proposed as a variant of
the standard perimeter penalization for the denoising of nonsmooth curves.
  To deal with such degeneracies, we first give an abstract existence and
uniqueness result for viscosity solutions of non-local degenerate Hamiltonians,
satisfying suitable continuity assumption with respect to Kuratowsky
convergence of the level sets. This abstract setting applies to an approximated
flow. Then, by the method of minimizing movements, we also build an "exact"
curvature flow, and we illustrate some examples, comparing the results with the
standard mean curvature flow.
