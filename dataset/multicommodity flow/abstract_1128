This paper presents existence and uniqueness results for a class of parabolic
systems with non linear diffusion and nonlocal interaction. These systems can
be viewed as regular perturbations of Wasserstein gradient flows. Here we
extend results known in the periodic case to the whole space and on a smooth
bounded domain. Existence is obtained using a semi-implicit
Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto scheme and uniqueness follows from a displacement
convexity argument.
