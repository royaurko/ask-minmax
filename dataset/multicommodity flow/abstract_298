The flow of charm is calculated in 2+1 ideal hydrodynamics by introducing the
charge of $c\bar{c}$ pair assuming that the number of $c\bar{c}$ pairs is
conserved in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. It is found that the mean
radial flow velocity of charm quarks is smaller than that of bulk matter by
10$\sim$15 \% and the measured $v_2$ of heavy-flavor electrons is reproduced up
to $p_T^e=$ 1.5 GeV/c in Au+Au collision at RHIC. The same flow is applied to
regenerated $J/\psi$ and its $v_2$ is discussed.
