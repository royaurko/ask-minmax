Event shapes for Au + Au collisions at 11.4 GeV/c per nucleon were studied
over nearly the full solid angle with the E877 apparatus. The analysis was
performed by Fourier expansion of azimuthal distributions of the transverse
energy (E_T) measured in different pseudorapidity intervals. For semicentral
collisions a pronounced event anisotropy is identified beyond that expected due
to fluctuations in particle multiplicity. The signal decreases for peripheral
and very central collisions. The amplitude of the flow signal reaches up to 7%
of the mean E_T.
