Many astrophysical disks, such as protoplanetary disks, are in a regime where
non-ideal, plasma-specific magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects can significantly
influence the behavior of the magnetorotational instability (MRI). The
possibility of studying these effects in the Plasma Couette Experiment (PCX) is
discussed. An incompressible, dissipative global stability analysis is
developed to include plasma-specific two-fluid effects and neutral collisions,
which are inherently absent in analyses of Taylor-Couette flows (TCFs) in
liquid metal experiments. It is shown that with boundary driven flows, a
ion-neutral collision drag body force significantly affects the azimuthal
velocity profile, thus limiting the flows to regime where the MRI is not
present. Electrically driven flow (EDF) is proposed as an alternative body
force flow drive in which the MRI can destabilize at more easily achievable
plasma parameters. Scenarios for reaching MRI relevant parameter space and
necessary hardware upgrades are described.
