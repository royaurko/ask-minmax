Inviscid flow within an evaporating sessile drop is analyzed. The field
equation, E^2(Psi)=0, is solved for the stream function. The exact analytical
solution is obtained for arbitrary contact angle and distribution of
evaporative flux along the free boundary. Specific results and computations are
presented for evaporation corresponding to both uniform flux and purely
diffusive gas phase transport into an infinite ambient. Wetting and non-wetting
contact angles are considered with flow patterns in each case being
illustrated. The limiting behaviors of small contact angle and droplets of
hemispherical shape are treated. All of the above categories are considered for
the cases of droplets whose contact lines are either pinned or free to move
during evaporation.
