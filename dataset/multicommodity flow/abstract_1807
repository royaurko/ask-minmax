It is shown that a certain class of Riesz product type measure on $\R$ is
singular. This proves the singularity of the spectral types of some class of
rank one flows. Our method is based on the extension of the Central Limit
Theorem approach to the real line which gives a new extension of Salem-Zygmund
Central Limit Theorem.
