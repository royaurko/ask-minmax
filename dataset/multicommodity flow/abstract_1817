Dynamics of single flexible non-Brownian fibers, tumbling in a Poiseuille
flow between two parallel solid plane walls, is studied with the use of the
hydromultipole numerical code, based on the multipole expansion of the Stokes
equations, corrected for lubrication. It is shown that for a wide range of the
system parameters, the migration rate towards the middle plane of the channel
increases for fibers, which are closer to a wall, or are more flexible (less
stiff), or are longer. The faster motion towards the channel center is
accompanied by a slower translation along the flow and a larger fiber
deformation.
