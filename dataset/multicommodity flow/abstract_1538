A glass surface may still flow below the bulk glass transition temperature,
where the underlying bulk is frozen. Assuming the existence at T=T* of a bulk
thermodynamical glass transition, we show that the glass-vapor interface is
generally wetted by a liquid layer of thickness ~ -ln(T*-T) when T--> T*.
Contrary to standard surface melting of crystals however, the integrated value
of the diffusivity across the interface remains finite for T-->T*. Difference
in shape induced by bulk and by surface flow is discussed as a possible means
of experimental detection of surface defreezing.
