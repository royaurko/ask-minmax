A periodic Kolmogorov type flow is implemented in a lattice gas automaton.
For given aspect ratios of the automaton universe and within a range of
Reynolds number values, the averaged flow evolves towards a stationary
two-dimensional $ABC$ type flow. We show the analogy between the streamlines of
the flow in the automaton and the phase plane trajectories of a dynamical
system. In practice flows are commonly studied by seeding the fluid with
suspended particles which play the role of passive tracers. Since an actual
flow is time-dependent and has fluctuations, the tracers exhibit interesting
intrinsic dynamics. When tracers are implemented in the automaton and their
trajectories are followed, we find that the tracers displacements obey a
diffusion law, with ``super-diffusion'' in the direction orthogonal to the
direction of the initial forcing.
