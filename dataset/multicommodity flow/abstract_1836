We consider the hydrodynamics of strongly interacting quark gluon plasma in
finite temperature and density using the holographic duality of charged black
hole in anti DeSitter space. We calculate the transport coefficients at
arbitrary energy scale by considering the holographic screen at finite radial
position. We first calculate the flow of sound velocity in this method and
check the consistence with previous result. Then we calculate diffusion
constant of charge and find that Einstein relation between susceptibility,
conductivity and diffusion constant will hold at arbitrary slice.
