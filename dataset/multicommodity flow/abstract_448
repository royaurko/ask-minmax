In the particle-flow approach information from all available sub-detector
systems is combined to reconstruct all stable particles. The global event
reconstruction has been shown to improve, in particular, the resolution of jet
energy and missing transverse energy in pp collisions compared to purely
calorimetric measurements. This improvement is achieved primarily by combining
the precise momentum determination of charged hadrons in the silicon tracker
with the associated energy depositions in the calorimeters. By resolving
individual particles inside jets, particle flow reduces the sensitivity of the
jet energy scale to the jet fragmentation pattern, which is known to be one of
the largest sources of systematic uncertainty in jet reconstruction. Particle
flow reconstruction is thus potentially well-suited for the study of potential
modifications to jet fragmentation in heavy-ion collisions. The particle flow
algorithm has been adapted to the heavy-ion environment. The performance of jet
reconstruction from particle flow objects in PbPb collisions using the anti-kT
jet reconstruction algorithm is presented.
