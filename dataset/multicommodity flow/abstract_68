I explore properties of the inflationary flow equations. I show that the flow
equations do not correspond directly to inflationary dynamics. Nevertheless,
they can be used as a rather complicated algorithm for generating inflationary
models. I demonstrate that the flow equations can be solved analytically and
give a closed form solution for the potentials to which flow equation solutions
correspond. I end by considering some simpler algorithms for generating
stochastic sets of slow-roll inflationary models for confrontation with
observational data.
