In this paper we investigate renormalisation group flows of supersymmetric
minimal models generated by the boundary perturbing field (\hat
G_{-1/2}\phi_{1,3}). Performing the Truncated Conformal Space Approach analysis
the emerging pattern of the flow structure is consistent with the theoretical
expectations. According to the results, this pattern can be naturally extended
to those cases for which the existing predictions are uncertain.
