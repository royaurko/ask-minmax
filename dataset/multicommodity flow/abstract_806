The Lie point symmetries and corresponding invariant solutions are obtained
for a Gaussian, irrotational, compressible fluid flow. A supersymmetric
extension of this model is then formulated through the use of a superspace and
superfield formalism. The Lie superalgebra of this extended model is determined
and a classification of its subalgebras is performed. The method of symmetry
reduction is systematically applied in order to derive special classes of
invariant solutions of the supersymmetric model. Several new types of
algebraic, hyperbolic, multi-solitonic and doubly periodic solutions are
obtained in explicit form.
