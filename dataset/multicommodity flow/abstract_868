This paper presents the Eclipse plug-ins for the Task Flow model in the
Discovery Method. These plug-ins provide an IDE for the Task Algebra compiler
and the model-checking tools. The Task Algebra is the formal representation for
the Task Model and it is based on simple and compound tasks. The model-checking
techniques were developed to validate Task Models represented in the algebra.
