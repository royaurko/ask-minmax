The initial-boundary value problem for the density-dependent incompressible
flow of liquid crystals is studied in a three-dimensional bounded smooth
domain. For the initial density away from vacuum, the existence and uniqueness
is established for both the local strong solution with large initial data and
the global strong solution with small data. It is also proved that when the
strong solution exists, a weak solution with the same data must be equal to the
unique strong solution.
