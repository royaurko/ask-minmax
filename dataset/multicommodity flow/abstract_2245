The NA60 experiment at the CERN SPS has studied low-mass dimuon production in
158 AGeV In-In collisions. An excess of pairs above the known meson decays has
been reported before. We now present precision results on the associated
transverse momentum spectra. The slope parameter Teff extracted from the
spectra rises with dimuon mass up to the rho, followed by a sudden decline
above. While the initial rise is consistent with the expectations for radial
flow of a hadronic decay source, the decline signals a transition to an
emission source with much smaller flow. This may well represent the first
direct evidence for thermal radiation of partonic origin in nuclear collisions.
