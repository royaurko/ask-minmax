We address the question whether a singularity in a three-dimensional
incompressible inviscid fluid flow can occur in finite time. Analytical
considerations and numerical simulations suggest high-symmetry flows being a
promising candidate for a finite-time blowup. Utilizing Lagrangian and
geometric non-blowup criteria, we present numerical evidence against the
formation of a finite-time singularity for the high-symmetry vortex dodecapole
initial condition. We use data obtained from high resolution adaptively refined
numerical simulations and inject Lagrangian tracer particles to monitor
geometric properties of vortex line segments. We then verify the assumptions
made by analytical non-blowup criteria introduced by Deng et. al [Commun. PDE
31 (2006)] connecting vortex line geometry (curvature, spreading) to velocity
increase to rule out singular behavior.
