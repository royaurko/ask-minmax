We propose a positivity preserving entropy decreasing finite volume scheme
for nonlinear nonlocal equations with a gradient flow structure. These
properties allow for accurate computations of stationary states and long-time
asymptotics demonstrated by suitably chosen test cases in which these features
of the scheme are essential. The proposed scheme is able to cope with
non-smooth stationary states, different time scales including metastability, as
well as concentrations and self-similar behavior induced by singular nonlocal
kernels. We use the scheme to explore properties of these equations beyond
their present theoretical knowledge.
