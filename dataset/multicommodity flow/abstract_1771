In this paper, we present a simplified model for magnetized
neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) in which effect of black hole (BH)
spin is taken into account by adopting a set of relativistic correction factor,
and the magnetic field is parameterized as \beta, the ratio of the magnetic
pressure to the total pressure. It is found that the disc properties are
sensitive to the values of the BH spin and \beta, and more energy can be
extracted from NDAF for the faster spin and lower \beta.
