Equation-free methods make possible an analysis of the evolution of a few
coarse-grained or macroscopic quantities for a detailed and realistic model
with a large number of fine-grained or microscopic variables, even though no
equations are explicitly given on the macroscopic level. This will facilitate a
study of how the model behavior depends on parameter values including an
understanding of transitions between different types of qualitative behavior.
These methods are introduced and explained for traffic jam formation and
emergence of oscillatory pedestrian counter flow in a corridor with a narrow
door.
