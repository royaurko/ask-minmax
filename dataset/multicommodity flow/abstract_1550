The deBroglie relation is applied to the analysis of auto-wave processes of
localized plastic flow in various materials and the results obtained are
considered. It is found that the localization of plastic deformation can be
conveniently addressed by invoking a hypothetical quasi-particle conjugated
with the wave process of flow localization. The mass of the quasiparticle and
the area of its localization have been defined.
