We extend the concept of optical flow with spatiotemporal regularisation to a
dynamic non-Euclidean setting. Optical flow is traditionally computed from a
sequence of flat images. The purpose of this paper is to introduce variational
motion estimation for images that are defined on an evolving surface.
Volumetric microscopy images depicting a live zebrafish embryo serve as both
biological motivation and test data.
