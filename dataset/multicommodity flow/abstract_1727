We investigate the rapidity dependence of the elliptical flow in heavy ion
collisions at 200 GeV (cms), by employing a three-dimensional hydrodynamic
evolution, based on different initial conditions, and different freeze-out
scenarios. It will be shown that the form of pseudo-rapidity ($\eta$)
dependence of the elliptical flow is almost identical to space-time-rapidity
($\eta_{s}$) dependence of the initial energy distribution, independent of the
freeze-out prescriptions.
