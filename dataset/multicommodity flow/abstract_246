We propose a new model of one-dimensional traffic flow using a coupled map
lattice. In the model, each vehicle is assigned a map and changes its velocity
according to it. A single map is designed so as to represent the motion of a
vehicle properly, and the maps are coupled to each other through the headway
distance. By simulating the model, we obtain a plot of the flow against the
concentration similar to the observed data in real traffic flows. Realistic
traffic jam regions are observed in space-time trajectories.
