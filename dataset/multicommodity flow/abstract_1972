In this article, we prove linear stability, scattering and inviscid damping
with optimal decay rates for the linearized 2D Euler equations around a large
class of strictly monotone shear flows, $(U(y),0)$, in a periodic channel under
Sobolev perturbations. Here, we consider the settings of both an infinite
periodic channel of period $L$, $\mathbb{T}_{L}\times \mathbb{R}$, as well as a
finite periodic channel, $\mathbb{T}_{L} \times [0,1]$, with impermeable walls.
The latter setting is shown to not only be technically more challenging, but to
exhibit qualitatively different behavior due to boundary effects.
