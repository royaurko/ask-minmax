A new model potential in the presence of collective flow describing the
interaction of the hard jet with scattering centers is derived based on the
static color-screened Yukawa potential. The flow effect on jet quenching with
detailed balance is investigated in pQCD. It turns out that the collective flow
changes the emission current and the LPM destructive interference comparing to
that in the static medium. Considering the collective flow with velocity v_z
along the jet direction, the energy loss is (1 - v_z) times that in the static
medium to the first order of opacity. The flow dependence of the energy loss
will affect the suppression of high p_T hadron spectrum and anisotropy
parameter v_2 in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.
