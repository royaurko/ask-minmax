We present simulations of granular flows in a modified Couette cell, using a
continuum model recently proposed for dense granular flows. Based on a friction
coefficient, which depends on an inertial number, the model captures the
positions of the wide shear bands. We show that a smooth transition in
velocity-profile shape occurs when increasing the height of the granular
material, leading to a differential rotation of the central part close to the
surface. The numerical predictions are in qualitative agreement with previous
experimental results. The model provides predictions for the increase of the
shear bands width when increasing the rotation rate.
