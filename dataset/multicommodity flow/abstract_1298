Segregation and mixing of granular mixtures during heap formation have
important consequences in industry and agriculture. This research investigates
three different final particle configurations of bi-disperse granular mixtures
-- stratified, segregated and mixed -- during filling of quasi-two dimensional
silos. We consider a larger number and relatively wider range of control
parameters than previous studies, including particle size ratio, flow rate,
system size and heap rise velocity. The boundary between stratified and
unstratified states is primarily controlled by the two-dimensional flow rate,
with the critical flow rate for the transition depending weakly on particle
size ratio and flowing layer length. In contrast, the transition from
segregated to mixed states is controlled by the rise velocity of the heap, a
control parameter not previously considered. The critical rise velocity for the
transition depends strongly on the particle size ratio.
