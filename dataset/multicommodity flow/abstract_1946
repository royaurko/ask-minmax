We propose Elliptic Power and Power parameterizations for the probability
distribution of initial state anisotropies in heavy-ion collisions. By assuming
a linear eccentricity scaling, the new parameterizations can also be applied to
fluctuations of harmonic flow. In particular, we analyze flow multi-particle
cumulants and event-by-event distributions, both of which are recently measured
at the LHC.
