We prove that the rate of mixing of the Weil-Petersson geodesic flow on the
moduli space of Riemann surfaces of genus $g$ with $n$ punctures is at most
polynomial when $3g-3+n>1$. Also, we give an outline of an argument showing
that the Weil-Petersson geodesic flow on the moduli spaces of once-punctured
torii and four-times punctured spheres is rapid mixing (i.e., its rate of
mixing is faster than any given polynomial).
