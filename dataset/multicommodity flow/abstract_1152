Recent observations of the interactions between radio sources and the
X-ray-emitting gas in cooling flows in the cores of clusters of galaxies are
reviewed. The radio sources inflate bubbles in the X-ray gas, which then rise
buoyantly outward in the clusters transporting energy to the intracluster
medium (ICM). The bright rims of gas around the radio bubbles are cool, rather
than hot, and do not show signs of being strongly shocked. Energy deposited
into the ICM over the lifetime of a cluster through several outbursts of a
radio source helps to account for at least some of the gas that is missing in
cooling flows at low temperatures.
