We report STAR measurements relating to higher flow harmonics including the
centrality dependence of two- and four-particle cumulants for harmonics 1 to 6.
Two-particle correlation functions vs. \Delta\eta and \Delta\phi are presented
for pT and number correlations. We find the power spectra (Fourier Transforms
of the correlation functions) for central collisions drop quickly for higher
harmonics. The \Delta\eta dependence of v3{2}2 and the pT and centrality
dependence of v2 and v3 are studied. Trends are conistent with expectations
from models including hot-spots in the initial energy density and an expansion
phase. We also present v3 and v2{2}2 - v2{4}2 vs. \surdsNN .
