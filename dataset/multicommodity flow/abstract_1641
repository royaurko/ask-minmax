The parameter changes resulting from a combination of Lorentz transformation
are shown to form vector field flows. The exact, finite Thomas rotation angle
is determined and interpreted intuitively. Using phase portraits, the
parameters evolution can be clearly visualized. In addition to identifying the
fixed points, we obtain an analytic invariant, which correlates the evolution
of parameters.
