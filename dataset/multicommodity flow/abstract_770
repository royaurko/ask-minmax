We investigate fluid transport in random velocity fields with unsteady drift.
First, we propose to quantify fluid transport between flow regimes of different
characteristic motion, by escape probability and mean residence time. We then
develop numerical algorithms to solve for escape probability and mean residence
time, which are described by backward Fokker-Planck type partial differential
equations. A few computational issues are also discussed. Finally, we apply
these ideas and numerical algorithms to a tidal flow model.
