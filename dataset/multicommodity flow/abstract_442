The problem of the splitting of a suspension in bifurcating channels dividing
into two branches of non equal flow rates is addressed. As observed for long,
in particular in blood flow studies, the volume fraction of particles generally
increases in the high flow rate branch and decreases in the other one. In the
literature, this phenomenon is sometimes interpreted as the result of some
attraction of the particles towards this high flow rate branch. In this paper,
we focus on the existence of such an attraction through microfluidic
experiments and two-dimensional simulations and show clearly that such an
attraction does not occur but is, on the contrary, directed towards the low
flow rate branch. Arguments for this attraction are given and a discussion on
the sometimes misleading arguments found in the literature is proposed.
Finally, the enrichment in particles in the high flow rate branch is shown to
be mainly a consequence of the initial distribution in the inlet branch, which
shows necessarily some depletion near the walls.
