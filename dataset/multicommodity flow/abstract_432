The dynamics of the Reynolds stress tensor for turbulent flows is described
with an evolution equation coupling both geometric effects and turbulent source
terms. The effects of the mean flow geometry are shown up when the source terms
are neglected: the Reynolds stress tensor is then expressed as the sum of three
tensor products of vector fields which are governed by a distorted gyroscopic
equation. Along the mean flow trajectories, the fluctuations of velocity are
described by differential equations whose coefficients depend only on the mean
flow deformation. If the mean flow vorticity is small enough, an approximate
turbulence model is derived, and its application to shear shallow water flows
is proposed. Moreover, the approximate turbulence model admits a variational
formulation which is similar to the one of capillary fluids.
