We apply the functional renormalization group theory to the dynamics of
first-order phase transitions and show that a potential with all odd-order
terms can describe spinodal decomposition phenomena. We derive a
momentum-dependent dynamic flow equation which is decoupled from the static
flow equation. We find the expected instability fixed points; and their
associated exponents agree remarkably with the existent theoretical and
numerical results. The complex renormalization group flows are found and their
properties are shown. Both the exponents and the complex flows show that the
spinodal decomposition possesses singularity with consequent scaling and
universality.
