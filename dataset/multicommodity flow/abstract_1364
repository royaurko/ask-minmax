Hamilton's Ricci flow (RF) equations were recently expressed in terms of the
edge lengths of a d-dimensional piecewise linear (PL) simplicial geometry, for
d greater than or equal to 2. The structure of the simplicial Ricci flow (SRF)
equations are dimensionally agnostic. These SRF equations were tested
numerically and analytically in 3D for simple models and reproduced
qualitatively the solution of continuum RF equations including a Type-1
neckpinch singularity. Here we examine a continuum limit of the SRF equations
for 3D neck pinch geometries with an arbitrary radial profile. We show that the
SRF equations converge to the corresponding continuum RF equations as reported
by Angenent and Knopf.
