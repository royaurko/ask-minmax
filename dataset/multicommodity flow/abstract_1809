We discuss jet vetoes as a means of probing colour flow in hard-scattering
processes in hadronic collisions. As an example, we describe a calculation of
the dijet cross-section with a jet veto, which resums the leading logarithms of
the veto scale and is matched to a fixed-order computation. We compare this
prediction to the measurement performed by the ATLAS collaboration. Finally, we
outline future developments in this research area.
