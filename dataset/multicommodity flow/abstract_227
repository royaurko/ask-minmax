We introduce the notion of the joint spectral flow, which is a generalization
of the spectral flow, by using Segal's model of the connective $K$-theory
spectrum. We apply it for some localization results of indices motivated by
Witten's deformation of Dirac operators and rephrase some analytic techniques
in terms of topology.
