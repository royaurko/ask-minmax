We consider a class of continuous time Markov chains on a compact metric
space that admit an invariant measure strictly positive on open sets together
with absorbing states. We prove the joint large deviation principle for the
empirical measure and flow. Due to the lack of uniform ergodicity, the zero
level set of the rate function is not a singleton. As corollaries, we obtain
the Donsker-Varadhan rate function for the empirical measure and a variational
expression of the rate function for the empirical flow.
