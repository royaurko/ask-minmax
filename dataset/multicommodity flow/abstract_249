The cellular automaton model for traffic flow exhibits a jamming transition
from a free-flow phase to a congested phase. In the deterministic case this
transition corresponds to a critical point with diverging correlation length.
We present data from numerical simulations which suggest the absence of
critical behavior in the presence of noise. The transition of the deterministic
case is smeared out and one only observes the remnants of the critical point.
