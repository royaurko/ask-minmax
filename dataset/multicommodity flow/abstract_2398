We study the variation of elliptic flow of thermal dileptons with transverse
momentum and invariant mass of the pairs for Pb+Pb collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV. The dilepton productions from quark gluon plasma
(QGP) and hot hadrons have been considered including the spectral change of
light vector mesons in the thermal bath. The space time evolution has been
carried out within the frame work of 2+1 dimensional ideal hydrodynamics with
lattice+hadron resonance gas equation of state. We find that a judicious
selection of invariant mass(M) and transverse momentum (p_T) windows can be
used to extract the collective properties of quark matter, hadronic matter and
also get a distinct signature of medium effects on vector mesons. Our results
indicate a reduction of elliptic flow (v_2) for M beyond phi mass, which if
observed experimentally would give the measure of v_2 of the partonic phase.
