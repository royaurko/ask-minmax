In heavy ion collisions, event-by-event fluctuations in participating nucleon
positions can lead to triangular flow. With fluctuating initial conditions,
flow coefficients will also fluctuate. In a hydrodynamic model, we study the
fluctuations in elliptic and triangular flow, due to fluctuating initial
conditions. Both elliptic and triangular flow fluctuates strongly, triangular
flow more strongly than the elliptic flow. Strong fluctuations greatly reduce
the sensitivity of elliptic and triangular flow to viscosity.
