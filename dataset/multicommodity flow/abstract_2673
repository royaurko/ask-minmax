Both physical arguments and simulations of the global heliosphere indicate
that the tailward heliopause is flattened considerably in the direction
perpendicular to the large-scale interstellar magnetic field. Despite this
fact, all existing global analytical models of the outer heliosheath's magnetic
field assume a circular cross section of the heliotail. To eliminate this
inconsistency, we introduce a mathematical procedure by which any analytically
or numerically given magnetic field can be deformed in such a way that the
cross sections along the heliotail axis attain freely prescribed, spatially
dependent values for their total area and aspect ratio. The distorting
transformation of this method honors both the solenoidality condition and the
stationary induction equation with respect to an accompanying flow field,
provided that both constraints were already satisfied for the original magnetic
and flow fields prior to the transformation. In order to obtain realistic
values for the above parameters, we present the first quantitative analysis of
the heliotail's overall distortion as seen in state-of-the-art 3D hybrid
MHD-kinetic simulations.
