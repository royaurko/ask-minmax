We further develop a thermal LB model for multiphase flows. In the improved
model, we propose to use the FFT scheme to calculate both the convection term
and external force term. The usage of FFT scheme is detailed and analyzed. By
using the FFT algorithm spatiotemporal discretization errors are decreased
dramatically and the conservation of total energy is much better preserved. A
direct consequence of the improvement is that the unphysical spurious
velocities at the interfacial regions can be damped to neglectable scale.
Together with the better conservation of total energy, the more accurate flow
velocities lead to the more accurate temperature field which determines the
dynamical and final states of the system. With the new model, the phase diagram
of the liquid-vapor system obtained from simulation is more consistent with
that from theoretical calculation. Very sharp interfaces can be achieved. The
accuracy of simulation results are also verified by the Laplace law. The FFT
scheme can be easily applied to other models for multiphase flows.
