The integral method can be used to model accurately flows down an inclined
plane. Such a method consists in projecting the full 3D equations on a lower
dimensional representation. The vertical velocity profiles have their
functional form fixed, based from the exact solution of homogeneous steady
flows. This projection is achieved by integration of the momentum equation over
the flow depth -- Saint-Venant approach. Here we generalize the viscous case to
two non-newtonian constitutive relations: a Prandtl-like turbulent closure and
a local granular rheology. We discuss one application in each case: the
formation of anti-dunes in viscous streams, the transverse velocity profile in
turbulent channels and the Kapitza instability in dense granular flows. They
demonstrate the usefulness of this approach to get a model qualitatively
correct, quantitatively reasonable and in which the dynamical mechanisms at
work can be easily identified.
