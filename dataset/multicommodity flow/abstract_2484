We theoretically demonstrate the possibility to observe the macroscopic Zeno
effect for nonlinear waveguides with a localized dissipation. We show the
existence of stable stationary flows, which are balanced by the losses in the
dissipative domain. The macroscopic Zeno effect manifests itself in the
non-monotonic dependence of the stationary flow on the strength of the
dissipation. In particular, we highlight the importance of the parameters of
the dissipation to observe the phenomenon. Our results are applicable to a
large variety of systems, including condensates of atoms or quasi-particles and
optical waveguides.
