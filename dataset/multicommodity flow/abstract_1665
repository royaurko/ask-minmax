Time-accurate simulation of gas dynamic structures resulting in viscous, heat
conducting and radiating gas flows through localized heat release areas is
performed. Cases of intensive heat release in to air at atmospheric pressure
are investigated, whereby the gas is heated up to temperatures 3000-20000 K, so
that local differences of density reach tens and hundreds times. Bifurcation of
the gas dynamic structure has been found at certain relation between gas
velocity and heat release power.
