Steady-state properties of microemulsions in shear flow are studied in the
context of a Ginzburg-Landau free-energy approach. Explicit expressions are
given for the structure factor and the time correlation function at the one
loop level of approximation. Our results predict a four-peak pattern for the
structure factor, implying the simultaneous presence of interfaces aligned with
two different orientations.
 Due to the peculiar interface structure a non-monotonous relaxation of the
time correlator is also found.
