The recently developed gauge-invariant formalism for the treatment of
fluctuations in holographic renormalization group (RG) flows overcomes most of
the previously encountered technical difficulties. I summarize the formalism
and present its application to the GPPZ flow, where scattering amplitudes
between glueball states have been calculated and a set of selection rules been
found.
