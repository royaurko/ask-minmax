The Willmore flow is well known problem from the differential geometry. It
minimizes the Willmore functional defined as integral of the mean-curvature
square over given manifold. For the graph formulation, we derive modification
of the Willmore flow with anisotropic mean curvature. We define the weak
solution and we prove an energy equality. We approximate the solution
numerically by the complementary finite volume method. To show the stability,
we re-formulate the resulting scheme in terms of the finite difference method.
By using simple framework of FDM we show discrete version of the energy
equality. The time discretization is done by the method of lines and the
resulting system of ODEs is solved by the Runge-Kutta-Merson solver with
adaptive integration step. We also show experimental order of convergence as
well as results of the numerical experiments, both for several different
anisotropies.
