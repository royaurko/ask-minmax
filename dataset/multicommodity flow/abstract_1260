We investigate the case of the Kahler-Ricci flow blowing down disjoint
exceptional divisors with normal bundle O(-k) to orbifold points. We prove
smooth convergence outside the exceptional divisors and global Gromov-Hausdorff
convergence. In addition, we establish the result that the Gromov-Hausdorff
limit coincides with the metric completion of the limiting metric under the
flow. This improves and extends the previous work of the contributors. We apply this
to P^1-bundles which are higher-dimensional analogues of the Hirzebruch
surfaces. In addition, we consider the case of a minimal surface of general
type with only distinct irreducible (-2)-curves and show that solutions to the
normalized Kahler-Ricci flow converge in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense to a
Kahler-Einstein orbifold.
