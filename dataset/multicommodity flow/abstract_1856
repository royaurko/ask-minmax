We develop an embedded boundary method (EBM) to solve the two-phase
incompressible flow with piecewise constant density. The front tracking method
is used to track the interface. The fractional step methods are used to solve
the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations while the EBM is used in the
projection step to solve an elliptic interface problem for the pressure with a
jump equal to the surface tension force across the interface. Several examples
are used to verify the accuracy of the method.
