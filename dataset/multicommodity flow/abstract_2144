The density irregularities and holes visible in many Chandra X-ray images of
cluster and galactic cooling flows can be produced by symmetrically heated gas
near the central galactic black hole. As the heated gas rises away from the
galactic center, a relatively small number of large plumes and bubbles are
formed in qualitative agreement with the observed features. The expanding
centrally heated gas drives a shock into the surrounding gas, displacing it
radially. Both computational and analytic results show that the ambient gas
near the bubble is cooled by expansion, accounting for the cool rims commonly
observed around X-ray holes in cooling flows.
