We use a hydrodynamic model to study the space-time evolution transverse to
the beam direction in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions with nonzero
impact parameters. We focus on the influence of early pressure on the
development of radial and elliptic flow. We show that at high energies elliptic
flow is generated only during the initial stages of the expansion while radial
flow continues to grow until freeze-out. Quantitative comparisons with SPS data
from semiperipheral Pb+Pb collisions suggest the applicability of
hydrodynamical concepts already $\approx$ 1 fm/c after impact.
