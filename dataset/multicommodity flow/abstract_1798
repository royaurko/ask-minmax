We study the renormalization group flow of higher derivative gravity,
utilizing the functional renormalization group equation for the average action.
Employing a recently proposed algorithm, termed the universal renormalization
group machine, for solving the flow equation, all the universal features of the
one-loop beta-functions are recovered. While the universal part of the
beta-functions admits two fixed points, we explicitly show that the existence
of one of them depends on the choice of regularization scheme, indicating that
it is most probably unphysical.
