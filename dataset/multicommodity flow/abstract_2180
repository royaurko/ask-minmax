Numerical calculations of the 2-D steady incompressible driven cavity flow
are presented. The Navier-Stokes equations in streamfunction and vorticity
formulation are solved numerically using a fine uniform grid mesh of 601x601.
The steady driven cavity solutions are computed for Re<21,000 with a maximum
absolute residuals of the governing equations that were less than 10-10. A new
quaternary vortex at the bottom left corner and a new tertiary vortex at the
top left corner of the cavity are observed in the flow field as the Reynolds
number increases. Detailed results are presented and comparisons are made with
benchmark solutions found in the literature.
