We present preliminary results from the Shellflow program, an all-sky
Tully-Fisher (TF) survey of 297 Sb-Sc with redshifts between 4000 and 7500
km/s. The program was designed to ensure uniformity of the data between
observing runs and between telescopes, thereby eliminating the possibility of a
spurious bulk flow caused by data inhomogeneity. A simple bulk flow model
suggests that the Shellflow galaxies are nearly at rest with respect to the
cosmic microwave background (CMB). Taken at face value, this result suggests
that most of the ~600 km/s motion of the Local Group with respect to the CMB is
due to material within ~60 Mpc/h -- a striking confirmation of the
gravitational instability picture and the notion of homogeneity in the
Universe. Differences between our Shellflow ``null'' result and claims of
larger bulk motions based on analyses of the MarkIII catalog are possibly due
to small inhomogeneities between the sub-samples in MarkIII. Our preliminary
Shellflow bulk velocity, V_bulk = 80+/-150 km/s in the CMB frame, must still be
refined with Monte-Carlo simulations and tidal field analysis.
