We measure directed flow ($v_1$) for charged particles in Au+Au and Cu+Cu
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 200 GeV and 62.4 GeV, as a function of
pseudorapidity ($\eta$), transverse momentum ($p_t$) and collision centrality,
based on data from the STAR experiment. We find that the directed flow depends
on the incident energy but, contrary to all existing models, not on the size of
the colliding system at a given centrality. We extend the validity of the
limiting fragmentation concept to different collision systems, and investigate
possible explanations for the observed sign change in $v_1(p_t)$.
