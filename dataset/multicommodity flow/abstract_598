We present evidence for the existence of infinitely-many new families of
renormalisation group flows between the nonunitary minimal models of conformal
field theory. These are associated with perturbations by the $\phi_{21}$ and
$\phi_{15}$ operators, and generalise a family of flows discovered by Martins.
In all of the new flows, the finite-volume effective central charge is a
non-monotonic function of the system size. The evolution of this effective
central charge is studied by means of a nonlinear integral equation, a massless
variant of an equation recently found to describe certain massive perturbations
of these same models. We also observe that a similar non-monotonicity arises in
the more familiar $\phi_{13}$ perturbations, when the flows induced are between
nonunitary minimal models.
