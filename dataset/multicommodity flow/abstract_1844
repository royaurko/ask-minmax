We consider mean curvature flow of n-dimensional surface clusters. At
(n-1)-dimensional triple junctions an angle condition is required which in the
symmetric case reduces to the well-known 120 degree angle condition. Using a
novel parametrization of evolving surface clusters and a new existence and
regularity approach for parabolic equations on surface clusters we show local
well-posedness by a contraction argument in parabolic Hoelder spaces.
