In minimum bias (0-80%) Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV, the
elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) measurements for di-electrons from the low to
intermediate mass region are presented. The differential elliptic flow as a
function of transverse momentum in different mass regions are also reported.
The simulated and measured $v_{2}$ of di-electrons are compared in the mass
regions of $M_{ee}<0.14$ GeV/$c^{2}$ and $0.14<M_{ee}<0.3$ GeV/$c^{2}$.
