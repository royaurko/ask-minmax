I study a possible effect of momentum deposition from many hard partons
traversing the hot and dense region produced early in nuclear collisions at the
LHC. The expected number of such hard partons is large. It is argued that the
induced diffusion wakes which carry the momentum deposited to the medium may
interact. Due to azimuthally asymmetric geometry in non-central collisions,
this may lead to small preference of the collective flow in the direction of
the impact parameter. As a result, a small contribution to the azimuthal
asymmetry of hadronic spectra is obtained. It may be important to take even
such a small contribution into account if quantitative conclusions about early
thermalisation and low viscosity are to be made, based on the measurements of
the elliptic flow parameter v2.
