The stationary spherically symmetric accretion flow in the Schwarzschild
metric has been set up as an autonomous first-order dynamical system, and it
has been studied completely analytically. Of the three possible critical points
in the flow, the one that is physically realistic behaves like the saddle point
of the standard Bondi accretion problem. One of the two remaining critical
points exhibits the strange mathematical behaviour of being either a saddle
point or a centre-type point, depending on the values of the flow parameters.
The third critical point is always unphysical and behaves like a centre-type
point. The treatment has been extended to pseudo-Schwarzschild flows for
comparison with the general relativistic analysis.
