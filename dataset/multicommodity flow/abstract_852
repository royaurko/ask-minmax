We explore the possibility of observing elliptic flow in low multiplicity
events in central pp collisions at LHC energy, $\sqrt{s}$=14 TeV. It is assumed
that the initial interactions produces a number of hot spots. Hydrodynamical
evolution of two or more hot spots can generate sufficiently large elliptic
flow to be accessible experimentally in 4-th order cumulant analysis.
