In this paper we study the flow of an inviscid fluid composed by three
different phases. The model is a simple hyperbolic system of three conservation
laws, in Lagrangian coordinates, where the phase interfaces are stationary. Our
main result concerns the global existence of weak entropic solutions to the
initial-value problem for large initial data.
