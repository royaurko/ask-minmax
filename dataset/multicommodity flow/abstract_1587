Differential elliptic flow and particle spectra are calculated from covariant
Boltzmann transport theory taking into account the finite transport opacity of
the gluon plasma produced in Au+Au at $E_{cm}\sim 130$ $A$ GeV at RHIC. The
solutions are shown to depend mainly on the transport opacity, $\chi=\int dz
\sigma_t\rho_g$. The elliptic flow saturation pattern reported by STAR
indicates that $\chi_{b=0} \sim 25$, i.e., the gluon plasma is $\sim 80$ times
more opaque than the pQCD estimate based on HIJING. Such large opacities are
also consistent with the measured charged hadron spectra.
