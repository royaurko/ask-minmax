We investigate the fine structure of the sunspot penumbra by means of a model
that allows for a flux tube in horizontal pressure balance with the magnetic
background atmosphere in which it is embedded. We apply this model to
spectropolarimetric observations of two neutral iron lines at 1.56 $\mu$m and
invert several radial cuts in the penumbra of the same sunspot at two different
heliocentric angles. In the inner part of the penumbra we find hot flux tubes
that are somewhat inclined to the horizontal. They become gradually more
horizontal and cooler with increasing radial distance. This is accompanied by
an increase in the velocity of the plasma and a decrease of the gas pressure
difference between flux tube and the background component. At large radial
distances the flow speed exceeds the critical speed and evidence is found for
the formation of a shock front. These results are in good agreement with
simulations of the penumbral fine structure and provide strong support for the
siphon flow as the physical mechanism driving the Evershed flow.
