An ionocraft is a small instrument that generates net vertical force from
electrostatic field. A model of ionization and flow is built to explain this
force. The assumption of a threshold field density and the constant charge
density is applied to simplify the flow model. With these assumptions,
corresponding simulation results and comparison with experimental data, we have
shown that this model is sufficient to explain the force on the ionocraft.
