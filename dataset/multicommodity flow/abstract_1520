The problem of the physical nature of the Hubble flow in the Local Volume ($D
< 10$ Mpc) stated by Sandage(1986, 1999) is studied. New observational data on
galaxy motions and matter distribution around the Local Group and nearby
similar systems are described. Dynamical models are discussed on the basis of
the recent data on cosmic vacuum or dark energy.
