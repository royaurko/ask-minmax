We study the distribution of eigenvalues for selfadjoint
$h$--pseudodifferential operators in dimension two, arising as perturbations of
selfadjoint operators with a periodic classical flow. When the strength
$\varepsilon$ of the perturbation is $\ll h$, the spectrum displays a cluster
structure, and assuming that $\varepsilon \gg h^2$ (or sometimes $\gg h^{N_0}$,
for $N_0 >1$ large), we obtain a complete asymptotic description of the
individual eigenvalues inside subclusters, corresponding to the regular values
of the leading symbol of the perturbation, averaged along the flow.
