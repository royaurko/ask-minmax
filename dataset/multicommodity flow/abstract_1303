There are described equations for a pair comprising a Riemannian metric and a
Killing field on a surface that contain as special cases the Einstein Weyl
equations (in the sense of D. Calderbank) and a real version of a special case
of the Abelian vortex equations, and it is shown that the property that a
metric solve these equations is preserved by the Ricci flow. The equations are
solved explicitly, and among the metrics obtained are all steady gradient Ricci
solitons (e.g. the the cigar soliton) and the sausage metric; there are found
other examples of eternal, ancient, and immortal Ricci flows, as well as some
Ricci flows with conical singularities.
