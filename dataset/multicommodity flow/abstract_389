Pattern formation in Rayleigh-Benard convection in a large-aspect-ratio
cylinder with a radial ramp in the plate separation is studied analytically and
numerically by performing numerical simulations of the Boussinesq equations. A
horizontal mean flow and a vertical large scale counterflow are quantified and
used to understand the pattern wavenumber. Our results suggest that the mean
flow, generated by amplitude gradients, plays an important role in the roll
compression observed as the control parameter is increased. Near threshold the
mean flow has a quadrupole dependence with a single vortex in each quadrant
while away from threshold the mean flow exhibits an octupole dependence with a
counter-rotating pair of vortices in each quadrant. This is confirmed
analytically using the amplitude equation and Cross-Newell mean flow equation.
By performing numerical experiments the large scale counterflow is also found
to aid in the roll compression away from threshold but to a much lesser degree.
Our results yield an understanding of the pattern wavenumbers observed in
experiment away from threshold and suggest that near threshold the mean flow
and large scale counterflow are not responsible for the observed shift to
smaller than critical wavenumbers.
