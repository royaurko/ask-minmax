We investigate the influence of a temperature-dependent shear viscosity over
entropy density ratio eta/s on the transverse momentum spectra and elliptic
flow of hadrons in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. We find that the
elliptic flow in sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC is dominated by
the viscosity in the hadronic phase and in the phase transition region, but
largely insensitive to the viscosity of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). At the
highest LHC energy, the elliptic flow becomes sensitive to the QGP viscosity
and insensitive to the hadronic viscosity.
