We consider a model for flow in a porous medium with a fracture in which the
flow in the fracture is governed by the Darcy-Forchheimer law while that in the
surrounding matrix is governed by Darcy's law. We give an appropriate mixed,
variational formulation and show existence and uniqueness of the solution. To
show existence we give an analogous formulation for the model in which the
Darcy-Forchheimer law is the governing equation throughout the domain. We show
existence and uniqueness of the solution and show that the solution for the
model with Darcy's law in the matrix is the weak limit of solutions of the
model with the Darcy-Forchheimer law in the entire domain when the Forchheimer
coefficient in the matrix tends toward zero.
