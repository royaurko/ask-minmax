We extend the results on the RG flow in the next to leading order to the case
of the supersymmetric minimal models SM_p for p>> 1. We explain how to compute
the NS and Ramond fields conformal blocks in the leading order in 1/p and
follow the renormalization scheme propsed in [1]. As a result we obtained the
anomalous dimensions of certain NS and Ramond fields. It turns out that the
linear combination expressing the infrared limit of these fields in term of the
IR theory SM_{p-2} is exactly the same as those of the nonsupersymmetric
minimal theory.
