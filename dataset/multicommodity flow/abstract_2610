We study the high frequency dynamics in the braided magnetic structure of an
active region (AR 11520) moss as observed by High-Resolution Coronal Imager
(Hi-C). We detect quasi periodic flows and waves in these structures. We search
for high frequency dynamics while looking at power maps of the observed region.
We find that shorter periodicites (30 - 60 s) are associated with small spatial
scales which can be resolved by Hi-C only. We detect quasi periodic flows with
wide range of velocities from 13 - 185 km/s associated with braided regions.
This can be interpreted as plasma outflows from reconnection sites. We also
find presence of short period and large amplitude transverse oscillations
associated with braided magnetic region. Such oscillations could be triggered
by reconnection or such oscillation may trigger reconnection.
