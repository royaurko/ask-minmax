The spherically symmetric stationary transonic (Bondi) flow is considered a
classic example of an accretion flow. This flow, however, is along a
separatrix, which is usually not physically realizable. We demonstrate, using a
pedagogical example, that it is the dynamics which selects the transonic flow.
