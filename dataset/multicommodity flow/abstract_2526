While the existence of a strongly interacting state of matter, known as
'quark-gluon plasma' (QGP), has been established in heavy ion collision
experiments in the past decade, the task remains to map out the transition from
the hadronic matter to the QGP. This is done by measuring the dependence of key
observables (such as particle suppression and elliptic flow) on the collision
energy of the heavy ions. This procedure, known as 'beam energy scan', has been
most recently performed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC).
Utilizing a Boltzmann+hydrodynamics hybrid model, we study the collision energy
dependence of initial state eccentricities and the final state elliptic and
triangular flow. This approach is well suited to investigate the relative
importance of hydrodynamics and hadron transport at different collision
energies.
