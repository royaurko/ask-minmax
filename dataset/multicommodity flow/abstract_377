Based on the statistical evaluation of experimental single-vehicle data, we
propose a quantitative interpretation of the erratic scattering of flow-density
data in synchronized traffic flows. A correlation analysis suggests that the
dynamical flow-density data are well compatible with the so-called jam line
characterizing fully developed traffic jams, if one takes into account the
variation of their propagation speed due to the large variation of the netto
time gaps (the inhomogeneity of traffic flow). The form of the time gap
distribution depends not only on the density, but also on the measurement cross
section: The most probable netto time gap in congested traffic flow upstream of
a bottleneck is significantly increased compared to uncongested freeway
sections. Moreover, we identify different power-law scaling laws for the
relative variance of netto time gaps as a function of the sampling size. While
the exponent is -1 in free traffic corresponding to statistically independent
time gaps, the exponent is about -2/3 in congested traffic flow because of
correlations between queued vehicles.
