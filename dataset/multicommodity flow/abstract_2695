We analyse the large--scale velocity field obtained by N--body simulations of
cold dark matter (CDM) models with non--Gaussian primordial density
fluctuations, considering models with both positive and negative primordial
skewness in the density fluctuation distribution. We study the velocity
probability distribution and calculate the dependence of the bulk flow,
one--point velocity dispersion and Cosmic Mach Number on the filtering size. We
find that the sign of the primordial skewness of the density field provides
poor discriminatory power on the evolved velocity field. All non--Gaussian
models here considered tend to have lower velocity dispersion and bulk flow
than the standard Gaussian CDM model, while the Cosmic Mach Number turns out to
be a poor statistic in characterizing the models. Next, we compare the
large--scale velocity field of a composite sample of optically selected
galaxies as described by the Local Group properties, bulk flow, velocity
correlation function and Cosmic Mach Number, with the velocity field of mock
catalogues extracted from the N--body simulations. The comparison does not
clearly permit to single out a best model: the standard Gaussian model is
however marginally preferred by the maximum likelihood analysis.
