This brief article accompanies a fluid dynamics video presenting the results
of a large-eddy simulation of the flow in a realistic left heart. The left
heart geometry, from the pulmonary veins to the aortic root, is extracted from
medical images and the endocardium movements are reconstructed through image
registration. Large-eddy simulations are thus performed in a patient-specific
heart model, where the patient-specific movements of the geometry are
prescribed. The flow obtained is intermittent, showing both in the left atrium
and in the left ventricle turbulent spots correlated to flow decelerations.
