The interacting vorticity wave formalism for shear flow instabilities is
extended here to the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) setting, to provide a
mechanistic description for the stabilising and destabilising of shear
instabilities by the presence of a background magnetic field. The
interpretation relies on local vorticity anomalies inducing a non-local
velocity field, resulting in action-at-a-distance. It is shown here that the
waves supported by the system are able to propagate vorticity via the Lorentz
force, and waves may interact; existence of instability then rests upon whether
the choice of basic state allows for phase-locking and constructive
interference of the vorticity waves via mutual interaction. To substantiate
this claim, we solve the instability problem of two representative basic
states, one where a background magnetic field stabilises an unstable flow and
the other where the field destabilises a stable flow, and perform relevant
analyses to show how this mechanism operates in MHD.
