Aligned superhydrophobic surfaces with the same texture orientation reduce
drag in the channel and generate secondary flows transverse to the direction of
the applied pressure gradient. Here we show that a transverse shear can be
easily generated by using superhydrophobic channels with misaligned textured
surfaces. We propose a general theoretical approach to quantify this transverse
flow by introducing the concept of an effective shear tensor. To illustrate its
use, we present approximate theoretical solutions and Dissipative Particle
Dynamics simulations for striped superhydrophobic channels. Our results
demonstrate that the transverse shear leads to complex flow patterns, which
provide a new mechanism of a passive vertical mixing at the scale of a texture
period. Depending on the value of Reynolds number two different scenarios
occur. At relatively low Reynolds number the flow represents a transverse shear
superimposed with two co-rotating vortices. For larger Reynolds number these
vortices become isolated, by suppressing fluid transport in the transverse
direction.
