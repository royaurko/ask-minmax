Following the same treatment of Bellucci et.al., we obtain the hitherto
unknown general solutions of the radial attractor flow equations for extremal
black holes, both for non-BPS with non-vanishing and vanishing central charge Z
for the so-called st^2 model, the minimal rank-2 N=2 symmetric supergravity in
d=4 space-time dimensions.
  We also make useful comparisons with results that already exist in
literature,and introduce the fake supergravity (first-order) formalism to be
used in our analysis. An analysis of the BPS bound all along the non-BPS
attractor flows and of the marginal stability of corresponding D-brane charge
configurations has also been presented.
