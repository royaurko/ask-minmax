Recent highlights from the anisotropic flow and the azimuthal correlation
measurements in a heavy-ion collisions at the LHC are presented. Various flow
harmonics measured for the charged and identified particles versus transverse
momentum, pseudo-rapidity, and the collision centrality are reported. New
experimental probes of the local parity violation at the LHC energies using the
charge dependent azimuthal correlations are also discussed.
