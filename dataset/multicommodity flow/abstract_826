General conservation equations are derived for 2D dense granular flows within
the Boussinesq approximation. Assuming that forcing and dissipation equilibrate
on average, the relationships between local granular temperature, vorticity and
stream function are shown to be characterized by two functions. Once these two
functions are known, the whole velocity and temperature fields can be deduced.
We checked these predictions on steady surface flows in rotating drum simulated
through the Non-Smooth Contact Dynamics methods. Also, we briefly discuss some
possible ways to derive these two functions using statistical mechanics.
