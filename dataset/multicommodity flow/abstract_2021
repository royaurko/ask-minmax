We introduce a novel technique to produce monodisperse droplets through the
snap-off mechanism. The methodology is simple, versatile, and requires no
specialized or expensive components. The droplets produced have polydispersity
<1% and can be as small as 2.5 $\mu$m radius. A convenient feature is that the
droplet size is constant over a 100-fold change in flow rate, while at higher
flows the droplet size can be continuously adjusted.
