We derive moment estimates and a strong limit theorem for space inverses of
stochastic flows generated by jump SDEs with adapted coefficients in weighted
H\"older norms using the Sobolev embedding theorem and the change of variable
formula. As an application of some basic properties of flows of continuous
SDEs, we derive the existence and uniqueness of classical solutions of linear
parabolic second order SPDEs by partitioning the time interval and passing to
the limit. The methods we use allow us to improve on previously known results
in the continuous case and to derive new ones in the jump case.
