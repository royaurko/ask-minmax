Current theories of nanochannel flow impose no upper bound on flow rates, and
predict friction through nanochannels can be vanishingly small. We reassess
neglecting channel entry effects in extremely long channels and find violations
at the nanoscale. Even in frictionless nanochannels, end effects provide a
finite amount of friction. Hence, the speed at which nanochannels transport
liquids is limited. Flow-rate and slip length measurements are reevaluated
using calculations which include end-effect friction. End effects are critical
for the design of new technological devices and to understand biological
transport.
