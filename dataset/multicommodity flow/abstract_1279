We investigate the mixing properties of scalars stirred by spatially smooth,
divergence-free flows and maintained by a steady source-sink distribution. We
focus on the spatial variation of the scalar field, described by the {\it
dissipation wavenumber}, $k_d$, that we define as a function of the mean
variance of the scalar and its gradient. We derive a set of upper bounds that
for large P\'eclet number ($\Pe\gg1$) yield four distinct regimes for the
scaling behavior of $k_d$, one of which corresponds to the Batchelor regime.
The transition between these regimes is controlled by the value of $\Pe$ and
the ratio $\rho=\ell_u/\ell_s$, where $\ell_u$ and $\ell_s$ are respectively,
the characteristic lengthscales of the velocity and source fields. A fifth
regime is revealed by homogenization theory. These regimes reflect the balance
between different processes: scalar injection, molecular diffusion, stirring
and bulk transport from the sources to the sinks. We verify the relevance of
these bounds by numerical simulations for a {two-dimensional, chaotically
mixing} example flow and discuss their relation to previous bounds. Finally, we
note some implications for three dimensional turbulent flows.
