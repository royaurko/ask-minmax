Non-Riemannian geometry of acoustic non-relativistic turbulent flows is
irrotationally perturbed generating a acoustic geometry model with acoustic
metric and acoustic Cartan contortion. The contortion term is due to
nonlinearities in the turbulent fluid. The acoustic curvature and acoustic
contortion are given by Dirac delta distributions. Violation of Lorentz
invariance due to turbulence is considered and analog gravity is suggested to
be linked to planar acoustic domain walls.
