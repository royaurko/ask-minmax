We study current fluctuations in a one-dimensional interacting particle
system known as the dual smoothing process that is dual to random motions in a
Howitt-Warren flow. The Howitt-Warren flow can be regarded as the transition
kernels of a random motion in a continuous space-time random environment. It
turns out that the current fluctuations of the dual smoothing process fall in
the Edwards-Wilkinson universality class, where the fluctuations occur on the
scale $t^{1/4}$ and the limit is a universal Gaussian process. Along the way,
we prove a quenched invariance principle for a random motion in the
Howitt-Warren flow. Meanwhile, the centered quenched mean process of the random
motion also converges on the scale $t^{1/4}$, where the limit is another
universal Gaussian process.
