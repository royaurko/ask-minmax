We present results for the quenching, elliptic flow and azimuthal
correlations of heavy flavour particles in high-energy nucleus-nucleus
collisions obtained through the POWLANG transport setup, developed in the past
to study the propagation of heavy quarks in the Quark-Gluon Plasma and here
extended to include a modeling of their hadronization in the presence of a
medium. Hadronization is described as occurring via the fragmentation of
strings with endpoints given by the heavy (anti-)quark Q(Qbar) and a thermal
parton $qbar(q)$ from the medium. The flow of the light quarks is shown to
affect significantly the R_AA} and v_2 of the final D mesons, leading to a
better agreement with the experimental data.
