An exterior space is a topological space provided with a quasi-filter of open
subsets (closed by finite intersections). In this work, we analyze some
relations between the notion of an exterior space and the notion of a discrete
semi-flow. On the one hand, for an exterior space, one can consider limits,
bar-limits and different sets of end points (Steenrod, \v Cech,
Brown-Grossman). On the other hand, for a discrete semi-flow one can analyze
fixed points, periodic points, omega-limits, et cetera. In this paper, we see
that a discrete semi-flow can be provided with the canonical structure of an
exterior space given by the family of right-absorbing open subsets that can be
used to study the relation between limits and periodic points and connections
between bar-limits and omega-limits. The different notions of end point can be
used to decompose the region of attraction of an exterior discrete semi-flow as
a disjoint union of basins of end points.
