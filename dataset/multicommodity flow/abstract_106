The main results of this paper are limit theorems for horocycle flows on
compact surfaces of constant negative curvature. One of the main objects of the
paper is a special family of horocycle-invariant finitely-additive Hoelder
measures on rectifiable arcs. An asymptotic formula for ergodic integrals for
horocycle flows is obtained in terms of the finitely-additive measures, and
limit theorems follow as a corollary of the asymptotic formula. The objects and
results of this paper are similar to those in [15], [16], [4] and [5] for
translation flows on flat surfaces. The arguments are based on the
classification of invariant distributions for horocycle flows established in
[12].
