Schwope et al (1997) suggested that the newly discovered Polar RX J2115-5840
is a near-synchronous system. We have obtained circular polarisation
observations of RX J2115-5840 which show that the spin and orbital periods
differ by 1.2%. We find the first direct evidence of `pole-switching' in a
near-synchronous Polar. Further our data requires that the accretion flow must
be directed onto the same magnetic field line at all spin-orbit beat phases
implying that at some phases the flow must follow a path around the white dwarf
before accreting.
