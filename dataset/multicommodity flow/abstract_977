We suggest that magnetic fields in the accretion disks of AGN reach into the
coronae above and have a profound effect on the mass flow rate in the corona.
This strongly affects the location where the accretion flow changes from a
geometrically thin disk to a pure vertically extended coronal or
advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). We show that this can explain the
different disk truncation radii in elliptical galaxies and low luminosity AGN
with about the same mass flow rate, a discrepancy pointed out by Quataert et
al. (1999). Without disk magnetic activity the disk truncation is expected to
be uniquely related to the mass flow rate (Meyer et al. 2000b). Whether dynamo
action occurs depends on whether the electrical conductivity measured by a
magnetic Reynolds number surpasses a critical value (Gammie and Menou 1998).In
elliptical galaxies the disk is self-gravitating at the radii where the
truncation should occur. It is plausible that instead of a cool disk a ``layer
of clouds'' may form (Shlosman et al. 1990, Gammie 2001) for which no dynamo
action is expected. For low luminosity AGN the magnetic Reynolds number is well
above critical. Simple model calculations show that magnetic fields in the
underlying disks reduce the strength of the coronal flow and shift the
truncation radius significantly inward.
