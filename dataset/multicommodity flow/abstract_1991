We study the evolution of hypersurfaces in spacetime initial data sets by
their null mean curvature. A theory of weak solutions is developed using the
level-set approach. Starting from an arbitrary mean convex, outer untapped
hypersurface $\partial\Omega_0$, we show that there exists a weak solution to
the null mean curvature flow, given as a limit of approximate solutions that
are defined using the $\varepsilon$-regularization method. We show that the
approximate solutions blow up on the outermost MOTS and the weak solution
converges (as boundaries of finite perimeter sets) to a generalized MOTS.
