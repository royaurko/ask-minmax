Let M be a smooth manifold and F be a vector field on $M$. My article
["Smooth shifts along trajectories of flows", Topol. Appl. 130 (2003) 183-204,
arXiv:math/0106199] concerning the homotopy types of the group of
diffeomorphisms preserving orbits of F contains two errors. They imply that the
principal statement of that paper holds under additional assumptions on F.
Unfortunately this result was essentially used in another paper of mine
["Homotopy types of stabilizers and orbits of Morse functions on surfaces" Ann.
Glob. Anal. Geom., 29 no. 3, (2006) 241-285, arXiv:math/0310067]. The aim of
this article is to expose the results of the first paper in a right way, extend
them to a larger class of flows with degenerate singularities, and show that
the results of the second paper remain true.
