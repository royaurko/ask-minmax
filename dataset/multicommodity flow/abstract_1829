For a closed oriented 3-manifold $Y$ we define $n(Y)$ to be the minimal
non-negative number such that in each homotopy class of non-singular vector
fields of $Y$ there is a Morse-Smale vector field with less or equal to $n(Y)$
periodic orbits. We combine the construction process of Morse-Smale flows given
in [2] with handle decompositions of compact orientable surfaces to provide an
upper bound to the number $n(Y)$ for oriented Seifert manifolds and oriented
graph manifolds prime to $\stwo\times\sone$.
