We employ nonperturbative flow equations for the description of the effective
action in Yang-Mills theories. We find that the perturbative vacuum with
vanishing gauge field strength does not correspond to the minimum of the
Euclidean effective action. The true ground state is characterized by a
nonvanishing gluon condensate.
