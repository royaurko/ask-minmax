Even in two dimensions, the spectrum of the linearized Euler operator is
notoriously hard to compute. In this paper we give a new geometric calculation
of the essential spectrum for 2D flows. This generalizes existing
results---which are only available when the flow has arbitrarily long periodic
orbits---and clarifies the role of individual streamlines in generating
essential spectra.
