In this paper we analyze the behavior of the distance function under Ricci
flows whose scalar curvature is uniformly bounded. We will show that on small
time-intervals the distance function is $\frac12$-H\"older continuous in a
uniform sense. This implies that the distance function can be extended
continuously up to the singular time.
