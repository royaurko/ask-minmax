Simulations of hot, pressure supported, tilted black hole accretion flows, in
which the angular momentum of the flow is misaligned with the black hole spin
axis, can exhibit two non-axisymmetric shock structures in the inner regions of
the flow. We analyze the strength and significance of these shock structures in
simulations with tilt angles of 10 and 15 degrees. By integrating fluid
trajectories in the simulations through the shocks, and tracking the variations
of fluid quantities along these trajectories, we show that these shocks are
strong, with substantial compression ratios, in contrast to earlier claims.
However, they are only moderately relativistic. We also show that the two
density enhancements resembling flow streams in their shape are in fact merely
post-shock compressions, as fluid trajectories cut across, rather than flow
along, them. The dissipation associated with the shocks is a substantial
fraction ($\simeq3-12$ percent) of the rest mass energy advected into the hole,
and therefore comparable to the dissipation expected from turbulence. The
shocks should therefore make order unity changes in the observed properties of
black hole accretion flows that are tilted.
