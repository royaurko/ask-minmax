In the present paper, recent experimental results on large scale coherent
steady states observed in experimental von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n flows are revisited
from a statistical mechanics perspective. The latter is rooted on two levels of
description. We first argue that the coherent steady states may be described as
the equilibrium states of well-chosen lattice models, that can be used to
define global properties of von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n flows, such as their
temperatures. The equilibrium description is then enlarged, in order to
reinterpret a series of results about the stability of those steady states,
their susceptibility to symmetry breaking, in the light of a deep analogy with
the statistical theory of Ferromagnetism. We call this analogy
"Ferro-Turbulence"
