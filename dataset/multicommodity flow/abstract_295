Assuming that hot spots are formed in initial pp collisions, in a modified
Knudsen ansatz, which accounts for the entropy generation in viscous fluid
evolution, we have given predictions for elliptic flow in
  $\sqrt{s}$=14 TeV pp collisions. Predicted flow depends on the number of hot
spots and hot spot sizes. If two to four hot spots of size $\approx$0.1 fm are
formed in initial pp collisions, in events with multiplicity $n_
{mult}\approx$10-15, modified Knudsen ansatz predicted flow is accessible
experimentally in 4th order cumulant method.
