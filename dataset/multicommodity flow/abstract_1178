We present a direct comparison between two different techniques time-distance
helioseismology and a local correlation tracking method for measuring mass
flows in the solar photosphere and in a near-surface layer: We applied both
methods to the same dataset (MDI high-cadence Dopplergrams covering almost the
entire Carrington rotation 1974) and compared the results. We found that after
necessary corrections, the vector flow fields obtained by these techniques are
very similar. The median difference between directions of corresponding vectors
is 24 degrees, and the correlation coefficients of the results for mean zonal
and meridional flows are 0.98 and 0.88 respectively. The largest discrepancies
are found in areas of small velocities where the inaccuracies of the computed
vectors play a significant role. The good agreement of these two methods
increases confidence in the reliability of large-scale synoptic maps obtained
by them.
