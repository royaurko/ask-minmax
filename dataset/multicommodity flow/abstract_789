A Topological examination of phospholipid dynamics in the Far from
Equilibrium state has demonstrated that metabolically active cells use waste
heat to generate spatially patterned membrane flows by forced convection and
shear. This paper explains the resemblance between this nonlinear membrane
model and Witten Kitaev type Topological Quantum Computation systems, and
demonstrates how this self-organising membrane enables biological cells to
circumvent the decoherence problem, perform error correction procedures, and
produce classical level output as shielded current flow through cytoskeletal
protein conduit. Cellular outputs are shown to be Turing compatible as they are
determined by computable in principle hydromagnetic fluid flows, and
importantly, are Adaptive from an Evolutionary perspective.
