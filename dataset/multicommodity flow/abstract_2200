We report an experimental and numerical study of turbulent fluid motion in a
free surface. The flow is realized experimentally on the surface of a tank
filled with water stirred by a vertically oscillating grid positioned well
below the surface. Particles floating on the surface are used to visualize the
flow. The effect of surface waves appears to be negligible. The flow is
unconventional in that it is confined to two dimensions but does not have
squared vorticity as a conservation law, that it is not divergence free and
that it inherits scaling features of the mean square velocity differences
S_2(R) and the vorticity fluctuations Omega(R) from the bulk 3-d turbulence.
