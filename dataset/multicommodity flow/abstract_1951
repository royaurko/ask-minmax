A simple variant of recycling and rescaling method to generate inflow
turbulence using unstructured grid CFD codes is presented. The method has been
validated on large eddy simulation of spatially developing flat plate turbulent
boundary layer. The proposed rescaling algorithm is based on the momentum
thickness which is more robust and essentially obviates the need of finding the
edge of the turbulent boundary layer in unstructured grid codes. Extension of
this algorithm to hybrid RANS/LES type of approaches and for wall-bounded
turbomachinery flows is also discussed. Results from annular diffuser with
different inflow boundary layer characteristics is presented as an example
application to show the utility of such an algorithm.
