We analyze the dynamics of a simple but nontrivial classical Hamiltonian
system of infinitely many coupled rotators. We assume that this infinite system
is driven out of thermal equilibrium either because energy is injected by an
external force (Case I), or because heat flows between two thermostats at
different temperatures (Case II). We discuss several possible definitions of
the entropy production associated with a finite or infinite region, or with a
partition of the system into a finite number of pieces. We show that these
definitions satisfy the expected bounds in terms of thermostat temperatures and
energy flow.
