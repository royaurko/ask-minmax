Density waves of granular material (sand) flowing through a vertical pipe
have been investigated. Clear density waves emerge when the cock attached to
bottom end of the pipe is closed. The FFT power spectra were found to show a
stable power-law form $ P(f) \sim f^{-\alpha}. $ The value of the exponent was
evaluated as $\alpha \cong 4/3$. We also introduce a simple one-dimensional
model which reproduces $\alpha = 4/3$ from both simulation and theoretical
analysis. (to be published in Phys.Rev.Lett.)
