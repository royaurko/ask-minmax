We have developed a model in which the diffuse synchrotron emission from
radio mini-halos, observed in some cooling flow clusters, is due to a relic
population of relativistic electrons reaccelerated by MHD turbulence via
Fermi-like processes. In this model the energetics is supplied by the cooling
flow itself. Here, the model (successfully applied to the Perseus cluster,
A426) is preliminarily applied to the possible mini-halo candidate A2626, for
which we present VLA data.
