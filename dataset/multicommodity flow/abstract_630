Dispersion curves to a oscillatory reaction-diffusion system with the
self-consistent flow have obtained by means of numerical calculations. The flow
modulates the shape of dispersion curves and characteristics of traveling
waves. The point of inflection which separates the dispersion curves into two
branches corresponding to trigger and phase waves, moves according to the value
of the advection constant. The dynamics of phase wave in
reaction-diffusion-advection equations has been studied by limit cycle
perturbations. The dispersion relation obtained from the phase equation shows
that the competition between diffusion and advection constants modulates the
oscillation frequency from the bulk oscillation in the long-wave dynamics. Such
a competition implies that phase waves with the flow have a wider variety of
dynamics than waves without the flow.
