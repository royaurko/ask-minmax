Iron abundance distribution is now known for 12 clusters of galaxies. For
some clusters (e.g. Centaurus) the observed abundance increases toward the
cluster center, while for the others (e.g. Coma and Hydra-A) no significant
inhomogeneity was observed. In order to understand this difference, we
investigate the influence of cooling flow and turbulence produced by galactic
motion on the iron abundance distribution by simple spherical models. We show
that the cooling flow has a significant effect to flatten the iron abundance
distribution if the flow velocity is sufficiently large. Further, by applying
our analysis to the above clusters we show that we can give a systematic
account for the observed variety of the iron abundance distribution
qualitatively.
