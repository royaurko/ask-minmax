The efficiency and uniqueness of the diffusive shock acceleration is studied
on the basis of the novel kinetic solutions. These solutions obtained earlier
(paper I, astro-ph/9707152) selfconsistently describe a strong coupling of
cosmic rays with the gas flow. They show that the dependence of the
acceleration efficiency upon physical parameters is critical in nature. In this
paper we investigate a steady acceleration in the parameter space formed by the
injection rate (\nu ), the upper cut-off momentum p_1 and the Mach number M
while the flow compression R serves as an order parameter. We determine a
manifold of all possible solutions in this parameter space.
