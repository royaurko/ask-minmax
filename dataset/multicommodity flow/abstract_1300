We study the spatial and temporal behavior of fluid in fully
three-dimensional, general relativistic, magnetohydrodynamical simulations of
both tilted and untilted black hole accretion flows. We uncover
characteristically greater variability in tilted simulations at frequencies
similar to those predicted by the formalism of trapped modes, but ultimately
conclude that its spatial structure is inconsistent with a modal
interpretation. We find instead that previously identified, transient,
over-dense clumps orbiting on roughly Keplerian trajectories appear generically
in our global simulations, independent of tilt. Associated with these
fluctuations are acoustic spiral waves interior to the orbits of the clumps. We
show that the two nonaxisymmetric standing shock structures that exist in the
inner regions of these tilted flows effectively amplify the variability caused
by these spiral waves to markedly higher levels than in untilted flows, which
lack standing shocks. Our identification of clumps, spirals, and spiral-shock
interactions in these fully general relativistic, magnetohydrodynamical
simulations suggests that these features may be important dynamical elements in
models which incorporate tilt as a way to explain the observed variability in
black hole accretion flows.
