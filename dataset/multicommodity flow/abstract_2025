We completely integrate the magnetic geodesic flow on a flat two-torus with
the magnetic field $F = \cos (x) dx \wedge dy$ and describe all contractible
periodic magnetic geodesics. It is shown that there are no such geodesics for
energy $E \geq 1/2$, for $E< 1/2$ simple periodic magnetic geodesics form two
$S^1$-families for which the (fixed energy) action functional is positive and
therefore there are no periodic magnetic geodesics for which the action
functional is negative.
