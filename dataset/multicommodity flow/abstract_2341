Flow of dissipative particles driven by peristaltic motion of a tube is
numerically studied. A transition from slow unjammed flow to fast jammed flow
is found through the observation of the mass flux if the minimum width of the
peristaltic tube is smaller than a critical value. It is also found that
average and fluctuation of the transition time, and the peak value of the
second moment of the mass flux exhibit power-law divergences at the critical
point and these variables satisfy scaling relationships near the critical
point. Dependences of the critical width and exponents on peristaltic velocity
and on density are also discussed.
