We discuss how the different estimates of elliptic flow are influenced by
flow fluctuations and nonflow effects. It is explained why the event-plane
method yields estimates between the two-particle correlation methods and the
multiparticle correlation methods. It is argued that nonflow effects and
fluctuations cannot be disentangled without other assumptions. However, we
provide equations where, with reasonable assumptions about fluctuations and
nonflow, all measured values of elliptic flow converge to a unique mean
v_{2,PP} elliptic flow in the participant plane and, with a Gaussian assumption
on eccentricity fluctuations, can be converted to the mean v_{2,RP} in the
reaction plane. Thus, the 20% spread in observed elliptic flow measurements
from different analysis methods is no longer mysterious.
