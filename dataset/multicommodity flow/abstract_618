We investigate the effect of early chemical freeze-out on radial flow,
elliptic flow and HBT radii by using a fully three dimensional hydrodynamic
model. When we take account of the early chemical freeze-out, the space-time
evolution of temperature in the hadron phase is considerably different from the
conventional model in which chemical equilibrium is always assumed. As a
result, we find that radial and elliptic flows are suppressed and that the
lifetime and the spatial size of the fluid are reduced. We analyze the p_t
spectrum, the differential elliptic flow, and the HBT radii at the RHIC energy
by using hydrodynamics with chemically non-equilibrium equation of state.
