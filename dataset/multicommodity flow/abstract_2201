A discrete-time model of reacting evolving fields, transported by a
bidimensional chaotic fluid flow, is studied. Our approach is based on the use
of a Lagrangian scheme where {\it fluid particles} are advected by a $2d$
symplectic map possibly yielding Lagrangian chaos. Each {\it fluid particle}
carries concentrations of active substances which evolve according to its own
reaction dynamics. This evolution is also modeled in terms of maps. Motivated
by the question, of relevance in marine ecology, of how a localized
distribution of nutrients or preys affects the spatial structure of predators
transported by a fluid flow, we study a specific model in which the population
dynamics is given by a logistic map with space-dependent coefficient, and
advection is given by the standard map. Fractal and random patterns in the
Eulerian spatial concentration of predators are obtained under different
conditions. Exploiting the analogies of this coupled-map (advection plus
reaction) system with a random map, some features of these patterns are
discussed.
