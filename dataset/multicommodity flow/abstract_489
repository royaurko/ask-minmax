New fundamental solutions for micropolar fluids are derived in explicit form
for two- and three-dimensional steady unbounded Stokes and Oseen flows due to a
point force and a point couple, including the two-dimensional micropolar
Stokeslet, the two- and three-dimensional micropolar Stokes couplet, the
three-dimensional micropolar Oseenlet, and the three-dimensional micropolar
Oseen couplet. These fundamental solutions do not exist in Newtonian flow due
to the absence of microrotation velocity field. The flow due to these
singularities is useful for understanding and studying microscale flows. As an
application, the drag coefficients for a solid sphere or a circular cylinder
that translates in a low-Reynolds-number micropolar flow are determined and
compared with those corresponding to Newtonian flow. The drag coefficients in a
micropolar fluid are greater than those in a Newtonian fluid.
