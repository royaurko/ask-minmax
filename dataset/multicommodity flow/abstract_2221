We report on the first measurement of elliptic flow $v_2(p_T)$ of
multi-strange baryons $\Xi+\bar{Xi}$ and $\Omega+\bar{Omega} in heavy-ion
collisions. In minimum bias Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV, a
significant amount of elliptic flow, comparable to other non-strange baryons,
is observed for multi-strange baryons which are expected to be particularly
sensitive to the dynamics of the partonic stage of heavy-ion collisions. The
$p_T$ dependence of $v_2$ of the multi-strange baryons confirms the number of
constituent quark scaling previously observed for lighter hadrons. These
results support the idea that a substantial fraction of the observed collective
motion is developed at the early partonic stage in ultra-relativistic nuclear
collisions at RHIC.
