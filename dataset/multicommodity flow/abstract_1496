We present a new complete set of Lagrangian relativistic hydrodynamical
equations describing the transfer of energy and momentum between a standard
fluid and a radiation fluid in a general non-stationary spherical flow. The new
set of equations has been derived for a particular application to the study of
the cosmological Quark--Hadron transition but can also be used in other
contexts.
