We calculate the elliptic flow parameter $v_2$ for Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV employing the parton cascade BAMPS (Boltzmann Approach
of Multiparton Scatterings). Besides gluon interactions including the
bremsstrahlung process, interactions with quarks are considered in an
effective, but approximate way to investigate the dependence of the collective
flow on the number of parton degrees of freedom. We find that $v_2$ as a
function of the transverse momentum $p_T$ is sensitive to the number of parton
degrees of freedom, whereas the $p_T$ averaged $v_2$ does not. When including
quarks, $v_2(p_T)$ shifts to lower $p_T$, the parton transverse momentum
spectra become softer and the mean parton transverse momenta decrease.
