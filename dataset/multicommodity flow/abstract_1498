Reviews observational situation in the measurement of peculiar velocities in
the local universe. Emphasis is placed on such topics as: Do spirals and
ellipticals yield the same peculiar velocity field? What is the cluster
velocity distribution function? What is the convergence depth of the local
universe, as seen by inspection of motions of clusters and of field galaxies?
Are there large-scale bulk flows? A reconstruction of the density field and an
estimate of the Hubble constant are also given.
