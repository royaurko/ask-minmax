We present a new approach for calculating the physical properties of highly
ionized X-ray flows in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Our method relies on a
detailed treatment of the structure, dynamics and spectrum of the gas. A
quantitative comparison of our model predictions with the 900 ksec Chandra/HETG
X-ray spectrum of NGC 3783 shows that: (1) The highly ionized outflow is driven
by thermal pressure gradients and radiation pressure force is less important.
(2) A full featured dynamical model that provides a very good fit to the high
resolution X-ray spectrum requires a multi-phased flow with a density power
spectrum reminiscent of the interstellar medium. (3) Adiabatic cooling is an
important factor and so is an additional heating source that may be related to
the apparent multi-phase and turbulent nature of the flow. (4) The base of the
flow is ~1pc from the central object, in agreement with some, but not all
previous estimates. (5) The mass loss rate is in the range 0.01-0.1 solar
masses per year which is smaller than previous estimates and of the same order
of the mass accretion rate in this object.
