This paper is concerned with the mean-field limit for the gradient flow
evolution of particle systems with pairwise Riesz interactions, as the number
of particles tends to infinity. Based on the method introduced by Serfaty in
the context of the Ginzburg-Landau vortices, using regularity and stability
properties of the limiting equation, we prove a mean-field limit result in
dimensions 1 and 2 in cases for which this problem was still open.
