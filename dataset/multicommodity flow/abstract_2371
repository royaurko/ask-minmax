We describe a tensorial generalization of the Navier slip boundary condition
and illustrate its use in solving for flows around anisotropic textured
surfaces. Tensorial slip can be derived from molecular or microstructural
theories or simply postulated as an constitutive relation, subject to certain
general constraints on the interfacial mobility. The power of the tensor
formalism is to capture complicated effects of surface anisotropy, while
preserving a simple fluid domain. This is demonstrated by exact solutions for
laminar shear flow and pressure-driven flow between parallel plates of
arbitrary and different textures. From such solutions, the effects of rotating
a texture follow from simple matrix algebra. Our results may be useful to
extracting local slip tensors from global measurements, such as the
permeability of a textured channel or the force required to move a patterned
surface, in experiments or simulations.
