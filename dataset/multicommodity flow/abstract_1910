This paper deals with the spherically symmetric flow of compressible viscous
and polytropic ideal fluid in unbounded domain exterior to a ball in $\rr
(n\ge2).$ We show that the global solutions are convergent as time goes to
infinity. The critical step is obtaining the point-wise bound of the specific
volume $v(x,t)$ and the absolute temperature $\th(x,t)$ from up and below both
for $x$ and $t$. Note that the initial data can be arbitrarily large and,
compared with \cite{nn}, our method applies to the spatial dimension $n=2.$ The
proof is based on the elementary energy methods.
