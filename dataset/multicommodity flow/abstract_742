Transportation departments take actions to manage traffic flow and reduce
travel times based on estimated current and projected traffic conditions.
Travel time estimates and forecasts require information on traffic density
which are combined with a model to project traffic flow such as the
Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model. We develop a particle filtering and
learning algorithm to estimate the current traffic density state and the LWR
parameters. These inputs are related to the so-called fundamental diagram,
which describes the relationship between traffic flow and density. We build on
existing methodology by allowing real-time updating of the posterior
uncertainty for the critical density and capacity parameters. Our methodology
is applied to traffic flow data from interstate highway I-55 in Chicago. We
provide a real-time data analysis of how to learn the drop in capacity as a
result of a major traffic accident. Our algorithm allows us to accurately
assess the uncertainty of the current traffic state including at shock waves,
where the uncertainty is a mixture distribution. We show that Bayesian learning
can correct the estimation bias that is present in model with fixed parameters.
Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.
