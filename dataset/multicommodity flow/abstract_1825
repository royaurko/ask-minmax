We compute the sum of the positive Lyapunov exponents of the Hodge bundle
with respect to the Teichmuller geodesic flow. The computation is based on the
analytic Riemann-Roch Theorem and uses a comparison of determinants of flat and
hyperbolic Laplacians when the underlying Riemann surface degenerates.
