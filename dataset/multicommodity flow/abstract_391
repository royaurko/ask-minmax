Topologically chaotic fluid advection is examined in two-dimensional flows
with either or both directions spatially periodic. Topological chaos is created
by driving flow with moving stirrers whose trajectories are chosen to form
various braids. For spatially periodic flows, in addition to the usual
stirrer-exchange braiding motions, there are additional
topologically-nontrivial motions corresponding to stirrers traversing the
periodic directions. This leads to a study of the braid group on the cylinder
and the torus. Methods for finding topological entropy lower bounds for such
flows are examined. These bounds are then compared to numerical stirring
simulations of Stokes flow to evaluate their sharpness. The sine flow is also
examined from a topological perspective.
