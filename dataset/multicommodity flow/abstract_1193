We consider supersymmetric SL(3,R) deformations of various type IIB
supergravity backgrounds which exhibit flows away from an asymptotically
locally AdS_5 x S^5 fixed point. This includes the gravity dual of the Coulomb
branch of N=1 super Yang Mills theory, for which the deformed superpotential is
known. We also consider the gravity duals of field theories which live on
various curved backgrounds, such as Minkowski_2 x H^2, AdS_3 x S^1 and R x S^3.
Some of the deformed theories flow from a four-dimensional N=1 superconformal
UV fixed point to a two-dimensional (2,2) superconformal IR fixed point. We
study nonsupersymmetric generalizations of the deformations of the above
Coulomb branch flows.
