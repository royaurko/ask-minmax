Fluctuation and correlation observables are often measured using
multi-particle correlation methods and therefore mutually probe the origins of
genuine correlations present in multi-particle distribution functions. We
investigate the common influence of correlations arising from the spatially
inhomogeneous initial state on multiplicity and momentum fluctuations as well
as flow fluctuations. Although these observables reflect different aspects of
the initial state, taken together, they can constrain a correlation scale set
at the earliest moments of the collision. We calculate both the correlation
scale in an initial stage Glasma flux tube picture and the modification to
these correlations from later stage hydrodynamic flow and find quantitative
agreement with experimental measurements over a range of collision systems and
energies.
