We review the acceleration of energetic particles in relativistic
astrophysical jets characterized by a significant velocity shear. The possible
formation of power-law momentum spectra is discussed and typical acceleration
timescales are determined for a variety of different conditions such as
parallel and azimuthal shear flows. Special attendance is given to the analysis
of parallel shear flows with either a linear decreasing or a Gaussian-type
velocity profile. It is shown that in the presence of a gradual shear flow and
a particle mean free path scaling with the gyroradius, synchrotron radiation
losses may no longer be able to stop the acceleration once it has started to
work efficiently. Finally, the relevance of shear acceleration in small- and
large-scale relativistic jets is addressed.
