Using a reduced model focusing on the in-plane dependence of plane Couette
flow, it is shown that the turbulent-to-laminar relaxation process can be
understood as a nucleation problem similar to that occurring at a thermodynamic
first-order phase transition. The approach, apt to deal with the large
extension of the system considered, challenges the current interpretation in
terms of chaotic transients typical of temporal chaos. The study of the
distribution of the sizes of laminar domains embedded in turbulent flow proves
that an abrupt transition from sustained spatiotemporal chaos to laminar flow
can take place at some given value of the Reynolds number R_{low}, whether or
not the local chaos lifetime, as envisioned within low-dimensional dynamical
systems theory, diverges at finite R beyond R_{low}.
