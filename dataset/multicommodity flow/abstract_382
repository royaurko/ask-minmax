The dense flow of air bubbles in a two-dimensional silo (through an aperture
D) filled with a liquid is studied experimentally. A particle tracking
technique has been used to bring out the main properties of the flow:
displacements of the bubbles, transverse and axial velocities. The behavior of
the air bubbles is observed to present similarities with non-deformable solid
grains in a granular flow. Nevertheless, a correlation between the bubble
velocities and their deformations has been evidenced. Moreover, a new discharge
law (Beverloo-like) must be considered for such a system, where the flow rate
is observed to vary as D^{1/2} and depends on the deformability of the
particles.
