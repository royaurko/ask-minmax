The stationary distribution of passive tracers chaotically advected by a
two-dimensional large-scale flow is investigated. The tracer field is force by
resetting the value of the tracer in certain localised regions. This problem is
mathematically equivalent to advection in open flows and results in a fractal
tracer structure. The spectral exponent of the tracer field is different from
that for a passive tracer with the usual additive forcing (the so called
Batchelor spectrum) and is related to the fractal dimension of the set of
points that have never visited the forcing regions. We illustrate this
behaviour by considering a time-periodic flow whose effect is equivalent to a
simple two-dimensional area-preserving map. We also show that similar structure
in the tracer field is found when the flow is aperiodic in time.
