Understanding the flow of liquid crystals in microfluidic environments plays
an important role in many fields, including device design and microbiology. We
perform hybrid lattice-Boltzmann simulations of a nematic liquid crystal
flowing under an applied pressure gradient in two-dimensional channels with
various anchoring boundary conditions at the substrate walls. We investigate
the relation between flow rate and pressure gradient and the corresponding
profile of the nematic director, and find significant departures from the
linear Poiseuille relation. We also identify a morphological transition in the
director profile and explain this in terms of an instability in the dynamical
equations. We examine the qualitative and quantitative effects of changing the
type and strength of the anchoring. Understanding such effects may provide a
useful means of quantifying the anchoring of a substrate by measuring its flow
properties.
