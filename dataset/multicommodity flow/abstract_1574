This paper presents a method for computing two-dimensional constant mean
curvature surfaces. The method in question uses the variational aspect of the
problem to implement an efficient algorithm. In principle it is a flow like
method in that it is linked to the gradient flow for the area functional, which
gives reliable convergence properties. In the background a preconditioned
conjugate gradient method works, that gives the speed of a direct elliptic
multigrid method.
