The effect of shear flow on the phase-ordering dynamics of a binary mixture
with field-dependent mobility is investigated. The problem is addressed in the
context of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation with an external
velocity term, studied in self-consistent approximation. Assuming a scaling
ansatz for the structure factor, the asymptotic behavior of the observables in
the scaling regime can be analytically calculated. All the observables show
log-time periodic oscillations which we interpret as due to a cyclical
mechanism of stretching and break-up of domains. These oscillations are dumped
as consequence of the vanishing of the mobility in the bulk phase.
