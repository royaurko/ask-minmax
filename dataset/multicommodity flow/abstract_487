We report the direct observation of resistive flow through a weak link in a
weakly interacting atomic Bose-Einstein condensate. Two weak links separate our
ring-shaped superfluid atomtronic circuit into two distinct regions, a source
and a drain. Motion of these weak links allows for creation of controlled flow
between the source and the drain. At a critical value of the weak link
velocity, we observe a transition from superfluid flow to superfluid plus
resistive flow. Working in the hydrodynamic limit, we observe a conductivity
that is 4 orders of magnitude larger than previously reported conductivities
for a Bose-Einstein condensate with a tunnel junction. Good agreement with
zero-temperature Gross-Pitaevskii simulations and a phenomenological model
based on phase slips indicate that the creation of excitations plays an
important role in the resulting conductivity. Our measurements of resistive
flow elucidate the microscopic origin of the dissipation and pave the way for
more complex atomtronic devices.
