In this paper we compute the Hausdorff dimension of the set D_n of points on
divergent trajectories of the homogeneous flow induced by a certain
one-parameter subgroup of G=SL(2,R) acting by left multiplication on the
product space G^n/Gamma^n, where Gamma=SL(2,Z). We prove that the Hausdorff
dimension of D_n equals 3n-(1/2) for any n greater than one.
