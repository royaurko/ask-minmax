The quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy ion collisions contains charged chiral
fermions evolving in an external magnetic field. At finite density of electric
charge or baryon number (resulting either from nuclear stopping or from
fluctuations), the triangle anomaly induces in the plasma the Chiral Magnetic
Wave (CMW). The CMW first induces a separation of the right and left chiral
charges along the magnetic field; the resulting dipolar axial charge density in
turn induces the oppositely directed vector charge currents leading to an
electric quadrupole moment of the quark-gluon plasma. Boosted by the strong
collective flow, the electric quadrupole moment translates into the charge
dependence of the elliptic flow coefficients, so that $v_2(\pi^+) < v_2(\pi^-)$
(at positive net charge). Using the latest quantitative simulations of the
produced magnetic field and solving the CMW equation, we make further
quantitative estimates of the produced $v_2$ splitting and its centrality
dependence. We compare the results with the available experimental data.
