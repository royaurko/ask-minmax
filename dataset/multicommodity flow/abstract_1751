We consider relativistic fluid flow under Chern-Simons modified Maxwell
theory and under Chern-Simons modified gravity theory. We take account of the
effects of Chern-Simons corrections on the quantities of fluid flow that are
conserved without the Chern-Simons corrections. We find that the conservations
of several quantities are generally broken by the Chern-Simons corrections.
