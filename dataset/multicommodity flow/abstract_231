We prove a local trace formula for Anosov flows. It relates Pollicott--Ruelle
resonances to the periods of closed orbits. As an application, we show that the
counting function for resonances in a sufficiently wide strip cannot have a
sublinear growth. In particular, for any Anosov flow there exist strips with
infinitely many resonances.
