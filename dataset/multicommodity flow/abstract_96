Bidimensional incompressible viscous flows with well-localised vorticity are
well-known to develop vortex structures. The purpose of the present paper is to
recover the asymptotic profiles describing these phenomena for homogeneous
finite-energy flows as asymptotic profiles for near-equilibrium isentropic
compressible flows. This task is performed by extending the sharp description
of the asymptotic behaviour of near-equilibrium compressible flows obtained by
David Hoff and Kevin Zumbrun to the case of finite-energy vortex-like
solutions.
