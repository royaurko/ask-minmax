In some chemical processes, the formation of the counter flow in the
colliding-jets regime is the most promising phenomenon if there is a need of
fast quenching of an obtained product [1]. Particularly this method can be used
to control disperse and phase composition of the final product. The complex
calculation and experimental research of the counter collision and mixing of
the circular argon jet and aluminum steams at 2000 K, and a relative cold argon
jet (1000 K) is presented in [2]. It is shown there that the counter quenching
regime enables to control particles grow owing to the flow dilution with the
quenching jet and variation of the temperature drop rate.
