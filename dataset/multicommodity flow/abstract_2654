The aim of this paper is to verify the new numerical implementation of a
binary fluid, heat conduction dominated solidification model. First, we extend
a semi-analytical solution to the heat diffusion equation, next, the range of
its applicability is investigated. It was found that the linearization
introduced to the heat diffusion equation negatively affects the ability to
predict solidus and liquidus lines positions whenever the magnitude of latent
heat of fusion exceeds a certain value. Next, a binary fluid solidification
model is coupled with a flow solver, and is used in a numerical study of
Al-4.1%Cu alloy solidification in a two-dimensional rectangular cavity. An
accurate coupling between the solidification model and the flow solver is
crucial for the correct forecast of solidification front positions and
macrosegregation patterns.
