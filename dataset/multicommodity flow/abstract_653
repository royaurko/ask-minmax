The Solar Optical Telescope onboard Hinode revealed the fine-scale structure
of the Evershed flow and its relation to the filamentary structures of the
sunspot penumbra. The Evershed flow is confined in narrow channels with nearly
horizontal magnetic fields, embedded in a deep layer of the penumbral
atmosphere. It is a dynamic phenomenon with flow velocity close to the
photospheric sound speed. Individual flow channels are associated with tiny
upflows of hot gas (sources) at the inner end and downflows (sinks) at the
outer end. SOT/Hinode also discovered ``twisting'' motions of penumbral
filaments, which may be attributed to the convective nature of the Evershed
flow. The Evershed effect may be understood as a natural consequence of thermal
convection under a strong, inclined magnetic field. Current penumbral models
are discussed in the lights of these new Hinode observations.
