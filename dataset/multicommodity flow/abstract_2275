The effect of a uniform spanwise magnetic field on a turbulent channel flow
is investigated for the case of low magnetic Reynolds number. DNS and LES
computations are performed for two values of the hydrodynamic Reynolds number
(10^4 and 2\times 10^4) and the Hartmann number varying in a wide range. It is
shown that the main effect of the magnetic field is the suppression of
turbulent velocity fluctuations and momentum transfer in the wall-normal
direction. This leads to drag reduction and transformation of the mean flow
profile. The centerline velocity grows, the mean velocity gradients near the
wall decrease, and the typical horizontal dimensions of the coherent structures
enlarge upon increasing the Hartmann number. Comparison between LES and DNS
results shows that the dynamic Smagorinsky model accurately reproduces the flow
transformation.
