For stochastic systems driven by continuous semimartingales an explicit
formula for the logarithm of the Ito flow map is given. A similar formula is
also obtained for solutions of linear matrix-valued SDEs driven by arbitrary
semimartingales. The computation relies on the lift to quasi-shuffle algebras
of formulas involving products of Ito integrals of semimartingales. Whereas the
Chen-Strichartz formula computing the logarithm of the Stratonovich flow map is
classically expanded as a formal sum indexed by permutations, the analogous
formula in Ito calculus is naturally indexed by surjections. This reflects the
change of algebraic background involved in the transition between the two
integration theories.
