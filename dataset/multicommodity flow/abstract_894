At the LHC, using forward + central detectors, it becomes possible for the
first time to carry out measurements of the transverse energy flow due to
``minijets" accompanying production of two jets separated by a large rapidity
interval. We discuss parton-shower calculations of energy flow observables in a
high-energy factorized Monte Carlo framework, and comment on the role of these
observables to study high parton multiplicity effects.
