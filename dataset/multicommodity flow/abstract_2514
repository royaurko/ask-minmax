The structure of a hydrodynamic, double transonic flow driven by neutrino
annihilation in the polar region of a Schwarzschild black hole is computed for
different energy deposition profiles. The requirement that both, the inflow
into the black hole and the outflow to infinity pass smoothly through their
sonic points fixes the stagnation radius and stagnation pressure. The
asymptotic power of the outflow is shown to be the integral of the energy
deposition rate above the stagnation radius. The outflow production efficiency
depends on the energy deposition profile, and is generally higher for shallower
profiles. Using recent calculations of the neutrino annihilation rate, we
estimate that over 50 percents of the total energy deposited above the horizon
can emerge in the form of a relativistic outflow at infinity. The continuous
creation of plasma during the expansion of the outflow leads to generation of a
large specific entropy. This has important implications for the prompt
photospheric emission in GRBs.
