We argue that relativistic nuclear collisions may provide experimental
evidence of alpha clustering in light nuclei. A light alpha-clustered nucleus
has a large intrinsic deformation. When collided against a heavy nucleus at
very high energies, this deformation transforms into the deformation of the
fireball in the transverse plane. The subsequent collective evolution of the
fireball leads to harmonic flow reflecting the deformation of the initial
shape, which can be measured with standard methods of relativistic heavy-ion
collisions. We illustrate the feasibility of the idea by modeling the 12C-208Pb
collisions and point out that very significant quantitative and qualitative
differences between the alpha-clustered and uniform 12C nucleus occur in such
quantities as the triangular flow, its event-by-event fluctuations, or the
correlations of the elliptic and triangular flows. The proposal offers a
possibility of studying low-energy nuclear phenomena with "snapshots" made with
relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
