In this paper we prove the existence of an invariant measure for the cubic
NLS on the real line in the sense that we prove the existence of a measure
$\rho(t)$ supported by non-localised functions such that there exists random
variables X(t) whose laws are $\rho$ (thus independent of t) and such that t ->
X(t) is a solution to the cubic NLS. Our strategy for the proof is inspired by
a recent paper by Burq, Thomann and Tzvetkov and relies on the application of
Prokhorov and Skorokhod Theorems to a sequence of measures which are invariant
under some approximating flows.
