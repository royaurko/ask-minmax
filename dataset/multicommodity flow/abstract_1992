We present the effects of the vertical convection on the structure and
luminosity of the neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) around a
stellar-mass black hole in spherical coordinates. We found that the convective
energy transfer can suppress the radial advection in the NDAF, and that the
density, temperature and opening angle are slightly changed. As a result, the
neutrino luminosity and annihilation luminosity are increased, which is
conducive to achieve the energy requirement of gamma-ray bursts.
