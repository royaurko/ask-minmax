B List has recently studied a geometric flow whose fixed points correspond to
static Ricci flat spacetimes. It is now known that this flow is in fact Ricci
flow modulo pullback by a certain diffeomorphism. We use this observation to
associate to each static Ricci flat spacetime a local Ricci soliton in one
higher dimension. As well, solutions of Euclidean-signature Einstein gravity
coupled to a free massless scalar field with nonzero cosmological constant are
associated to shrinking or expanding Ricci solitons. We exhibit examples,
including an explicit family of complete expanding solitons which can be
thought of as a Ricci flow for a complete Lorentzian metric. The possible
generalization to Ricci-flat stationary metrics leads us to consider an
alternative to Ricci flow.
