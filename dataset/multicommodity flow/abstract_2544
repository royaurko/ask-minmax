The LHC data on azimuthal anisotropy harmonics from PbPb collisions at
center-of-mass energy 2.76 TeV per nucleon pair are analyzed and interpreted in
the framework of the HYDJET++ model. The cross-talk of elliptic $v_2$ and
triangular $v_3$ flow in the model generates both even and odd harmonics of
higher order. Comparison with the experimental data shows that this mechanism
is able to reproduce the $p_{\rm T}$ and centrality dependencies of
quadrangular flow $v_4$, and also the basic trends for pentagonal $v_5$ and
hexagonal $v_6$ flows.
