The constituent quark number scaling of elliptic flow is studied in a
non-equilibrium hadronization and freeze-out model with rapid dynamical
transition from ideal, deconfined and chirally symmetric Quark Gluon Plasma, to
final non-interacting hadrons. In this transition a Bag model of constituent
quarks is considered, where the quarks gain constituent quark mass while the
background Bag-field breaks up and vanishes. The constituent quarks then
recombine into simplified hadron states, while chemical, thermal and flow
equilibrium break down one after the other. In this scenario the resulting
temperatures and flow velocities of baryons and mesons are different. Using a
simplified few source model of the elliptic flow, we are able to reproduce the
constituent quark number scaling, with assumptions on the details of the
non-equilibrium processes.
