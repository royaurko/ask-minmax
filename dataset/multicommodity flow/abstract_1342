The results of a combined experimental and numerical study of the flow in
slowly diverging pipes are presented. Interestingly, an axisymmetric conical
recirculation cell has been observed. The conditions for its existence and the
length of the cell are simulated for a range of diverging angles and expansion
ratios. There is a critical velocity for the appearance of this state. When the
flow rate increases further, a subcritical transition for localized turbulence
arises. The transition and relaminarization experiments described here quantify
the extent of turbulence. The findings suggest that the transition scenario in
slowly diverging pipes is a combination of stages similar to those observed in
sudden expansions and in straight circular pipe flow.
