We develop models of 1+1 dimensional dilaton gravity describing flows to
$AdS_2$ from higher dimensional $AdS$ and other spaces. We use these to study
the effects of backreaction on holographic correlators. We show that this
scales as a relevant effect at low energies, for compact transverse spaces. We
also discuss effects of matter loops, as in the CGHS model.
