We prove a uniform Sobolev inequality for Ricci flow, which is independent of
the number of surgeries. As an application, under less assumptions, a
non-collapsing result stronger than Perelman's $\kappa$ non-collapsing with
surgery is derived. The proof is shorter and seems more accessible. The result
also improves some earlier ones where the Sobolev inequality depended on the
number of surgeries.
