The "reverse-dynamo" mechanism - the amplification/generation of fast plasma
flows by micro scale (turbulent) magnetic fields via magneto-fluid coupling is
recognized and explored. It is shown that macro-scale magnetic fields and flows
are generated simultaneously and proportionately from micro scale fields and
flows. The stronger the micro-scale driver, the stronger are the macro-scale
products. Stellar and astrophysical applications are suggested.
