We numerically investigate the propelled motions of a Janus particle in a
periodically phase-separating binary fluid mixture. In this study, the surface
of the particle tail prefers one of the binary fluid components and the
particle head is neutral in the wettability. During the demixing period, the
more wettable phase is selectively adsorbed to the particle tail. Growths of
the adsorbed domains induce the hydrodynamic flow in the vicinity of the
particle tail, and this asymmetric pumping flow drives the particle toward the
particle head. During the mixing period, the particle motion almost ceases
because the mixing primarily occurs via diffusion and the resulting
hydrodynamic flow is negligibly small. Repeating this cycle unboundedly moves
the Janus particle toward the head. The dependencies of the composition and the
repeat frequency on the particle motion are discussed.
