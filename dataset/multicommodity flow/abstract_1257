In this paper we will give a simple proof of a modification of a result on
pseudolocality for the Ricci flow by P.Lu without using the pseudolocality
theorem 10.1 of Perelman [P1]. We also obtain an extension of a result of
Hamilton on the compactness of a sequence of complete pointed Riemannian
manifolds $\{(M_k,g_k(t),x_k)\}_{k=1}^{\infty}$ evolving under Ricci flow with
uniform bounded sectional curvatures on $[0,T]$ and uniform positive lower
bound on the injectivity radii at $x_k$ with respect to the metric $g_k(0)$.
