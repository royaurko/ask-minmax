In this paper, it is elaborated the theory the Ricci flows for manifolds
enabled with nonintegrable (nonholonomic) distributions defining nonlinear
connection structures. Such manifolds provide a unified geometric arena for
nonholonomic Riemannian spaces, Lagrange mechanics, Finsler geometry, and
various models of gravity (the Einstein theory and string, or gauge,
generalizations). We follow the method of nonholonomic frames with associated
nonlinear connection structure and define certain classes of nonholonomic
constraints on Riemann manifolds for which various types of generalized Finsler
geometries can be modelled by Ricci flows. We speculate on possible
applications of the nonholnomic flows in modern geometry, geometric mechanics
and physics.
