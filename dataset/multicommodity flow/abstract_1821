After a short elementary introduction to the exact renormalization group for
the effective action, I discuss a particular truncation of the hierarchy of
flow equations that allows for the determination of the full momentum of the
$n$-point functions. Applications are then briefly presented, to critical O(N)
models, to Bose-Einstein condensation and to finite temperature field theory.
