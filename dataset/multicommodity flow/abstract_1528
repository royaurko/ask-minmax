Similar to the treatment of dense gases, fluid-dynamic equations for the
dynamics of congested vehicular traffic are derived from Enskog-like kinetic
equations. These contain additional terms due to the anisotropic vehicle
interactions. The calculations are carried out up to Navier-Stokes order. A
linear instability analysis indicates an additional kind of instability
compared to previous macroscopic traffic models. The relevance for describing
granular flows is outlined.
