Various notions of "zooming in" on measures exist in the literature and the
scenery flow is one of them. It is of interest to describe the joint
asymptotics of the scenery flows generated by a measure and the measure
transported by a local diffeomorphism. We give both sufficient and necessary
conditions for the scenery distributions to be asymptotic and provide some
examples.
