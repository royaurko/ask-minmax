We investigate the implications of a nonzero bulk viscosity coefficient on
the azimuthal momentum anisotropy of ultracentral relativistic heavy ion
collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. We find that, with IP-Glasma initial
conditions, a finite bulk viscosity coefficient leads to a better description
of the flow harmonics in ultracentral collisions. We then extract optimal
values of bulk and shear viscosity coefficients that provide the best agreement
with flow harmonic coefficients data in this centrality class.
