We present an investigation of the statistics of velocity gradient related
quantities, in particluar energy dissipation rate and enstrophy, along the
trajectories of fluid tracers and of heavy/light particles advected by a
homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flow. The Refined Similarity Hypothesis
(RSH) proposed by Kolmogorov and Oboukhov in 1962 is rephrased in the
Lagrangian context and then tested along the particle trajectories. The study
is performed on state-of-the-art numerical data resulting from numerical
simulations up to Re~400 with 2048^3 collocation points. When particles have
small inertia, we show that the Lagrangian formulation of the RSH is well
verified for time lags larger than the typical response time of the particle.
In contrast, in the large inertia limit when the particle response time
approaches the integral-time-scale of the flow, particles behave nearly
ballistic, and the Eulerian formulation of RSH holds in the inertial-range.
