We use a rigid axisymetric microfluidic flow focusing device to produce
monodisperse bubbles, dispersed in a surfactant solution. The gas volume
fraction of the dispersion collected out of this device can be as large as 90%,
demonstrating that foam with solid-like viscoelastic properties can be produced
in this way. The polydispersity of the bubbles is so low that we observe
crystallization of our foam. We measure the diameter of the bubbles and compare
these data to recent theoretical predictions. The good control over bubble size
and foam gas volume fraction shows that our device is a flexible and promising
tool to produce calibrated foam at a high flow rate.
