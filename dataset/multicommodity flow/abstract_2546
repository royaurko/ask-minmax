In this paper, a two-dimensional eight-velocity (D2Q8)
multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann (LB) model is proposed for
incompressible porous flows at the representative elementary volume scale based
on the Brinkman-Forchheimer-extended Darcy formulation. In the model, the
porosity is included into the pressure-based equilibrium moments, and the
linear and nonlinear drag forces of the porous media are incorporated into the
model by adding a forcing term to the MRT-LB equation in the moment space.
Through the Chapman-Enskog analysis, the generalized Navier-Stokes equations
can be recovered exactly without artificial compressible errors. Numerical
simulations of several typical two-dimensional porous flows are carried out to
validate the present MRT-LB model. The numerical results of the present MRT-LB
model are in good agreement with the analytical solutions and/or other
numerical solutions reported in the literature.
