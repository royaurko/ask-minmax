This work deals with braneworld scenarios driven by real scalar fields with
standard dynamics. We show how the first-order formalism which exists in the
case of four dimensional Minkowski space-time can be extended to de Sitter or
anti-de Sitter geometry in the presence of several real scalar fields. We
illustrate the results with some examples, and we take advantage of our
findings to investigate renormalization group flow. We have found symmetric
brane solutions with four-dimensional anti-de Sitter geometry whose
holographically dual field theory exhibits a weakly coupled regime at high
energy.
