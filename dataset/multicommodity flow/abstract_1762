In this paper, we give a precise description of the rescaling behaviors of
global strong polynomial solutions to the reformulation of zero surface tension
Hele-Shaw problem driven by injection, the Polubarinova-Galin equation, in
terms of Richardson complex moments. From past results, we know that this set
of solutions is large. This method can also be applied to zero surface tension
Stokes flow driven by injection and a rescaling behavior is given in terms of
many conserved quantities as well.
