Meteorological inputs are an important part of subsurface flow and transport
modeling. The choice of source for meteorological data used as inputs has
significant impacts on the results of subsurface flow and transport studies.
One method to obtain the meteorological data required for flow and transport
studies is the use of weather generating models. This paper compares the
difference in performance of two weather generating models at Technical Area 54
of Los Alamos National Lab. Technical Area 54 is contains several waste pits
for low-level radioactive waste and is the site for subsurface flow and
transport studies. This makes the comparison of the performance of the two
weather generators at this site particularly valuable.
