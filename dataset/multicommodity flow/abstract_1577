Angular momentum has recently been defined as a surface integral involving an
axial vector and a twist 1-form, which measures the twisting around of
space-time due to a rotating mass. The axial vector is chosen to be a
transverse, divergence-free, coordinate vector, which is compatible with any
initial choice of axis and integral curves. Then a conservation equation
expresses rate of change of angular momentum along a uniformly expanding flow
as a surface integral of angular momentum densities, with the same form as the
standard equation for an axial Killing vector, apart from the inclusion of an
effective energy tensor for gravitational radiation.
