We present results of several numerical simulations of two dimensional
axi-symmetric accretion flows around black holes using the Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics (SPH). We consider both stellar black holes and as well as
super-massive black holes. We assume bremsstrahlung to be the only source of
cooling as it is simpler to implement in numerical simulations. We observe that
due to both radial and vertical oscillation of shock waves in the accretion
flow, the luminosity and average thermal energy content of the inner disk
exhibit very interesting behaviors. When power density spectra are taken,
quasi-periodic oscillations are seen at a few Hz and also occasionally at
hundreds of Hz for stellar black holes. For super-massive black holes, the
time-scale of the oscillations ranges from hours to weeks. The power density
spectra have usual flat top behavior with average {\it rms} amplitude a few
percent and a broken power-law behavior. The break frequency is generally found
to be close to the QPO frequency as seen in the observed power spectra of black
holes.
