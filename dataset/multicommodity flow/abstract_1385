We present two modifications of the standard cell list algorithm for
nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of homogeneous, linear flows.
When such a flow is modeled with periodic boundary conditions, the simulation
box deforms with the flow, and recent progress has been made developing
boundary conditions suitable for general 3D flows of this type. For the typical
case of short-ranged, pairwise interactions, the cell list algorithm reduces
computational complexity of the force computation from O($N^2$) to O($N$),
where $N$ is the total number of particles in the simulation box. The new
versions of the cell list algorithm handle the dynamic, deforming simulation
geometry. We include a comparison of the complexity and efficiency of the two
proposed modifications of the standard algorithm.
