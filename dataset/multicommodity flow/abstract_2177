Transport coefficients associated with the mass flux of an impurity immersed
in a granular gas under simple shear flow are determined from the inelastic
Boltzmann equation. A normal solution is obtained via a Chapman-Enskog-like
expansion around a local shear flow distribution that retains all the
hydrodynamic orders in the shear rate. Due to the anisotropy induced by the
shear flow, tensorial quantities are required to describe the diffusion process
instead of the conventional scalar coefficients. The mass flux is determined to
first order in the deviations of the hydrodynamic fields from their values in
the reference state. The corresponding transport coefficients are given in
terms of the solutions of a set of coupled linear integral equations, which are
approximately solved by considering the leading terms in a Sonine polynomial
expansion. The results show that the deviation of these generalized
coefficients from their elastic forms is in general quite important, even for
moderate dissipation.
