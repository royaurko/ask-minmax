Until recently, Ricci flow was viewed almost exclusively as a way of
deforming Riemannian metrics of bounded curvature. Unfortunately, the bounded
curvature hypothesis is unnatural for many applications, but is hard to drop
because so many new phenomena can occur in the general case. This article
surveys some of the theory from the past few years that has sought to rectify
the situation in different ways.
