Let $(M, \mathcal{F})$ be a compact Riemannian foliated manifold. We consider
a family of compatible Feller semigroups in $C(M^n)$ associated to laws of the
$n$-point motion. Under some assumptions (Le Jan and Raimond, \cite{Le
Jan-Raimond}) there exists a stochastic flow of measurable mappings in $M$. We
study the degeneracy of these semigroups such that the flow of mappings is
foliated, i.e. each trajectory lays in a single leaf of the foliation a.s,
hence creating a geometrical obstruction for coalescence of trajectories in
different leaves. As an application, an averaging principle is proved for a
first order perturbation transversal to the leaves. Estimates for the rate of
convergence are calculated.
