We show that additional p-wave component is generated in the pure d-wave
superconductor in the presence of the uniform current. When the current flows
in the antinodal direction the spectrum has a gap over all Fermi surface. If
the current flows in the nodal direction, the gap opens only in the direction
parallel to the current. The correction to the current due to the p-wave
component of the order parameter is linear in vector potential. We show, that
the spin-orbit coupling may be responsible for the additional component of the
order parameter.
