We study the effect of pre-collisional velocity correlations on granular
shear flow by molecular dynamics simulations of the inelastic hard sphere
system. Comparison of the simulations with the kinetic theory reveals that the
theory overestimates both the energy dissipation rate and the normal stress in
the dense flow region. We find that the relative normal velocity of colliding
particles is smaller than that expected from random collisions, and the
discrepancies in the dissipation and the normal stress can be adjusted by
introducing the idea of the collisional temperature, from which we conclude
that the velocity correlation neglected in the kinetic theory is responsible
for the discrepancies. Our analysis of the distributions of the pre-collisional
velocity suggests that the correlation grows through multiple inelastic
collisions during the time scale of the inverse of the shear rate. As for the
shear stress, the discrepancy is also found in the dense region, but it depends
strongly on the particle inelasticity.
