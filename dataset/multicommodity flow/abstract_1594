We consider the impact of the kt algorithm on energy flow into gaps between
jets in any QCD hard process. While we confirm the observation that the kt
clustering procedure considerably reduces the impact of non-global logarithms,
we unearth yet new sources of logarithmic enhancement, that stem from using the
$k_t$ algorithm to define the final state. We comment on the nature of the
logarithms we find and discuss their all-orders treatment.
