The topologies are obtained for accretion flows around black holes as the
parameters, accretion rate and specific angular momentum are varied.
Paczy{\'n}ski-Wiita pseudo-Newtonian potential is used to mimic the
gravitational field of a Schwarzschild black hole. Both stellar
mass($14M_{\odot}$) and supermassive($10^8M_{\odot}$) black holes are
considered. The effects of bremsstrahlung and synchrotron cooling processes on
the flow dynamics are studied. Rankine-Hugoniot conditions are checked for
possible shock formation of solution branches of the topology. Stability of the
branches and the boundary conditions of the flow are likely to decide the
uniqueness of the solution.
