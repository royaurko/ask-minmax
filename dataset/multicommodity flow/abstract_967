We numerically solve the set of dynamical equations describing
advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAF) around black holes, using a method
similar to that of Chakrabarti (1996a). We choose the sonic radius of the flow
$R_s$ and the integration constant in angular momentum equation $j$ as free
parameters, and integrate the equations from the sonic point inwards to see if
the solution can extend supersonically to the black hole horizon, and outwards
to see if and where an acceptable outer boundary of the flow can be found. We
recover the ADAF-thin disk solution constructed in Narayan, Kato, & Honma
(1997, NKH97), an representative paper of the previous works on global ADAF
solutions, although in that paper an apparently very different procedure was
adopted. We obtain a complete picture in the form of $R_s-j$ parameter space
which sums up the situation of ADAF solution at a glance. For comparison we
also present the distribution of global solutions for inviscid flows in the
$R_s-j$ space, which supports the view that there should be some similarities
between the dynamical behavior of ADAF and that of adiabatic flows, and that
there should be a continuous change from the properties of viscous flows to
those of inviscid ones.
