We study the zero-temperature dynamic transition from the disordered flow to
an ordered flow state in driven vortices in type-II superconductors. The
transition current $I_{p}$ is marked by a sharp kink in the $V(I)$
characteristic with a concomitant large increase in the defect concentration.
On increasing magnetic field $B$, the $I_{p}(B)$ follows the behaviour of the
critical current $I_{c}(B)$. Specifically, in the peak effect regime $I_{p}(B)$
increases rapidly along with $I_{c}$. We also discuss the effect of varying
disorder strength on $I_{p}$.
