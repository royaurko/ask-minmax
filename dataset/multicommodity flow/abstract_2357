Fully dynamic simulations of heavy ion collisions at RHIC and at LHC energies
within the perturbative QCD-based partonic transport model BAMPS (Boltzmann
Approach to Multi-Parton Scatterings) are presented, focusing on the
simultaneous investigation of jet quenching and elliptic flow. The model
features inelastic 2 <-> 3 processes based on the Gunion-Bertsch matrix element
and has recently been extended to include light quark degrees of freedom,
allowing for direct comparison to hadronic data on the nuclear modification
factor via a fragmentation scheme for high-pT partons. The nuclear modification
factor of neutral pions in central Au+Au collisions at RHIC energy is compared
to experimental data. Furthermore first results on the nuclear modification
factor and the integrated elliptic flow of charged hadrons in Pb+Pb collisions
at LHC are presented and compared to recent ALICE data. These investigations
are complemented by a study on the suppression of D-mesons at LHC based on
elastic interactions with the medium.
