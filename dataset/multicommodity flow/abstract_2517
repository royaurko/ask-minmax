Existence and uniqueness of global in time measure solution for a one
dimensional nonlinear aggregation equation is considered. Such a system can be
written as a conservation law with a velocity field computed through a
selfconsistant interaction potential. Blow up of regular solutions is now well
established for such system. In Carrillo et al. (Duke Math J (2011)), a theory
of existence and uniqueness based on the geometric approach of gradient flows
on Wasserstein space has been developped. We propose in this work to establish
the link between this approach and duality solutions. This latter concept of
solutions allows in particular to define a flow associated to the velocity
field. Then an existence and uniqueness theory for duality solutions is
developped in the spirit of James and Vauchelet (NoDEA (2013)). However, since
duality solutions are only known in one dimension, we restrict our study to the
one dimensional case.
