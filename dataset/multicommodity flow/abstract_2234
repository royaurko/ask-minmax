From the macroscopic viewpoint for describing the acceleration behavior of
drivers, this letter presents a weighted probabilistic cellular automaton model
(the WP model, for short) by introducing a kind of random acceleration
probabilistic distribution function. The fundamental diagrams, the
spatio-temporal pattern are analyzed in detail. It is shown that the presented
model leads to the results consistent with the empirical data rather well,
nonlinear velocity-density relationship exists in lower density region, and a
new kind of traffic phenomenon called neo-synchronized flow is resulted.
Furthermore, we give the criterion for distinguishing the high-speed and
low-speed neo-synchronized flows and clarify the mechanism of this kind of
traffic phenomena. In addition, the result that the time evolution of
distribution of headways is displayed as a normal distribution further
validates the reasonability of the neo-synchronized flow. These findings
suggest that the diversity and randomicity of drivers and vehicles has indeed
remarkable effect on traffic dynamics.
