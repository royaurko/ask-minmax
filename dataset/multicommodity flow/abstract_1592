We propose a final state interaction model to describe the fixed $p_T$
suppression of the yield of particles at all values of $p_T$. We make an
extension of the model to the motion in the transverse plane which introduces a
dependence of the suppression on the azimuthal angle $\theta_R$. We obtain
values of the elliptic flow $v_{2}$ close to the experimental ones for all
values of $p_T$.
