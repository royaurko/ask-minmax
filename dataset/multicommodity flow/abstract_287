The locally BPS Wilson loop and the pure gauge Wilson loop map under AdS/CFT
duality to string world-sheet boundaries with standard and alternate
quantizations of the world-sheet fields. This implies an RG flow between the
two operators, which we verify at weak coupling. Many additional loop operators
exist at strong coupling, with a rich pattern of RG flows.
