This paper is concerned with properties of maximal solutions of the Ricci and
cross curvature flows on locally homogeneous three-manifolds of type SL(2,R).
We prove that, generically, a maximal solution originates at a sub-Riemannian
geometry of Heisenberg type. This solves a problem left open in earlier work by
two of the contributors.
