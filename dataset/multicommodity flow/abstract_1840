The Cauchy problem for the three-dimensional compressible flow of nematic
liquid crystals is considered. Existence and uniqueness of the global strong
solution are established in critical Besov spaces provided that the initial
datum is close to an equilibrium state $(1,{\bf 0}, \hat{\d})$ with a constant
vector $\hat{\d}\in S^2$. The global existence result is proved via the local
well-posedness and uniform estimates for proper linearized systems with
convective terms.
