Granular materials do not flow homogeneously like fluids when submitted to
external stress,but often form rigid regions that are separated by narrow shear
bands where the material yields and flows. This shear localization impacts
their apparent rheology, which makes it difficult to infer a constitutive
behaviour from conventional rheometric measurements. Moreover, they present a
dilatant behaviour, which makes their study in classical fixedvolume geometries
difficult. These features led to perform extensive studies with inclined plane
flows, which were of crucial importance for the development and the validation
of the $\mu(I)$ rheology. Our aim is to develop a method to characterize
granular materials with rheometrical tools. Using unusual rheometry
measurements in an annular shear cell adapted from Boyer et al. (2011), dense
granular flows are studied. A focus is placed on the comparison between the
present results and the $\mu(I)$-rheology.
