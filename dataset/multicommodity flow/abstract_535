Analogies are elaborated in the qualitative description of two systems: the
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow moving through a region where an external local
magnetic field (magnetic obstacle) is applied, and the ordinary hydrodynamic
flow around a solid obstacle. The former problem is of interest both
practically and theoretically, and the latter one is a classical problem being
well understood in ordinary hydrodynamics. The first analogy is the formation
in the MHD flow of an impenetrable region -- core of the magnetic obstacle --
as the interaction parameter $N$, i.e. strength of the applied magnetic field,
increases significantly. The core of the magnetic obstacle is streamlined both
by the upstream flow and by the induced cross stream electric currents, like a
foreign insulated insertion placed inside the ordinary hydrodynamic flow. In
the core, closed streamlines of the mass flow resemble contour lines of
electric potential, while closed streamlines of the electric current resemble
contour lines of pressure. The second analogy is the breaking away of attached
vortices from the recirculation pattern produced by the magnetic obstacle when
the Reynolds number $Re$, i.e. velocity of the upstream flow, is larger than a
critical value. This breaking away of vortices from the magnetic obstacle is
similar to that occurring past a real solid obstacle. Depending on the inlet
and/or initial conditions, the observed vortex shedding can be either symmetric
or asymmetric.
