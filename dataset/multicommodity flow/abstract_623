A dynamical appearance of scaling solutions in the relativistic hydrodynamics
applied to describe ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions is studied. We
consider the boost-invariant cylindrically symmetric systems and the effects of
the phase transition are taken into account by using a temperature dependent
sound velocity inferred from the lattice simulations of QCD. We find that the
transverse flow acquires the scaling form r/t within the short evolution times,
10 - 15 fm, only if the initial transverse flow originating from the
pre-equilibrium collective behavior is present at the initial stage of the
hydrodynamic evolution. The amount of such pre-equilibrium flow is correlated
with the initial pressure gradient; larger gradients require smaller initial
flow. The results of the numerical calculations support the phenomenological
parameterizations used in the Blast-Wave, Buda-Lund, and Cracow models of the
freeze-out process.
