Stochastic flows generated by reflected SDEs in a half-plane with an additive
diffusion term are considered. A derivative in the initial data is represented
a.s. as an infinite product of matrices. We use this representation and
construct an example of a reflecting flow with a linear drift such that it is
not locally continuously differentiable.
