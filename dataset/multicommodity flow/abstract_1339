We propose a unified approach to the formal long-wave reduction of several
fluid models for thin-layer incompressible homogeneous flows driven by a
constant external force like gravity. The procedure is based on a mathematical
coherence property that univoquely defines one reduced model given one rheology
and one thin-layer regime. For the first time, as far as we know, various known
reduced models can thus be investigated within a single mathematical framework,
for various rheologies (viscous and viscoelastic) and various limit regimes
(fast inertial flows and slow viscous flows). Furthermore, our systematic
procedure also produces new reduced models for viscoelastic non-Newtonian
fluids and improves on our previous work [Bouchut & Boyaval, M3AS (23) 8,
2013].
