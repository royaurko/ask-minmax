It has recently been shown theoretically that the time-dependent heat
conduction equation is form-invariant under curvilinear coordinate
transformations. Thus, in analogy to transformation optics, fictitious
transformed space can be mapped onto (meta-)materials with spatially
inhomogeneous and anisotropic heat-conductivity tensors in the laboratory
space. On this basis, we design, fabricate, and characterize a micro-structured
thermal cloak that molds the flow of heat around an object in a metal plate.
This allows for transient protection of the object from heating, while
maintaining the same downstream heat flow as without object and cloak.
