Theoretical arguments predict that the distribution of cold dark matter in
spiral galaxies has peaks in velocity space associated with non-thermalized
flows of dark matter particles. We searched for the corresponding peaks in the
spectrum of microwave photons from axion to photon conversion in the cavity
detector of dark matter axions. We found none and place limits on the density
of any local flow of axions as a function of the flow velocity dispersion over
the axion mass range 1.98 to 2.17 $\mu$eV.
