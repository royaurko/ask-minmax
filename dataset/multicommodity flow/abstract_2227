In our experiment, an interface between a viscous liquid and air is deformed
by a sink flow of constant flow rate to form a sharp tip. Using a microscope,
the interface shape is recorded down to a tip size of 1 $\rm{\mu m}$. The
curvature at the tip is controlled by the distance $h$ between the tip and the
sink. As a critical distance $h^{\star}$ is approached, the curvature diverges
like $1/(h-h^{\star})^3$ and the tip becomes cone-shaped. As the distance to
the sink is decreased further, the opening angle of the cone vanishes like
$h^2$. No evidence for air entrainment was found, except when the tip was
inside the orifice.
