The kinetic energy of barotropic flow coupled to an infnitely massive
rotating sphere by an unresolved complex torque mechanism is approximated by a
discrete spin-lattice model of fluid vorticity on a rotating sphere, analogous
to a one-step renormalized Ising model on a sphere with global interactions.
The constrained energy functional is a function of spin-spin coupling and spin
coupling with the rotation of the sphere. A mean field approximation similar to
the Curie-Weiss theory, modeled after that used by Bragg and Williams to treat
a two dimensional Ising model of ferromagnetism, is used to find the barotropic
vorticity states at thermal equilibrium for given temperature and rotational
frequency of the sphere. A fixed point equation for the most probable
barotropic flow state is one of the main results.
