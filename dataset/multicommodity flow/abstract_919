Viscous hydrodynamics gives a satisfactory description of the transverse
momentum spectra, of the elliptic and triangular flow, and of the femtoscopic
correlations for particles produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. On
general grounds, a similar collective behavior has been predicted for
proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions at the LHC. We present results of the
hydrodynamics calculation of the elliptic and triangular flow in p-Pb. We
discuss the mass dependence of flow coefficients and of the average transverse
momentum for identified particles.
