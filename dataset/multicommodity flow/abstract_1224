The equation of the density field of an assembly of macroscopic particles
advected by a hydrodynamic flow is derived from the microscopic description of
the system. This equation allows to recognize the role and the relative
importance of the different microscopic processes implicit in the model: the
driving of the external flow, the inertia of the particles, and the collisions
among them.
 The validity of the density description is confirmed by comparisons of
numerical studies of the continuum equation with Direct Simulation Monte Carlo
(DSMC) simulations of hard disks advected by a chaotic flow. We show that the
collisions have two competing roles: a dispersing-like effect and a clustering
effect (even for elastic collisions). An unexpected feature is also observed in
the system: the presence of collisions can reverse the effect of inertia, so
that grains with lower inertia are more clusterized.
