Event-by-event fluctuations of the initial transverse density profile result
in a collective flow pattern which also fluctuates event by event. We propose a
number of new correlation observables to characterize these fluctuations and
discuss how they should be analyzed experimentally. We argue that most of these
quantities can be measured at RHIC and LHC.
