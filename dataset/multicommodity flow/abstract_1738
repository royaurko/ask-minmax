In this short note we show that non-negative Ricci curvature is not preserved
under Ricci flow for closed manifolds of dimensions four and above,
strengthening a previous result of Knopf in \cite{K} for complete non-compact
manifolds of bounded curvature. This brings down to four dimensions a similar
result B\"ohm and Wilking have for dimensions twelve and above, \cite{BW}.
Moreover, the manifolds constructed here are \Kahler manifolds and relate to a
question raised by Xiuxiong Chen in \cite{XC}, \cite{XCL}.
