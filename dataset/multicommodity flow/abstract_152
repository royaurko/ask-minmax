In order to study the mechanical behaviour of polar ice masses, the method of
continuum mechanics is used. The newly developed CAFFE model
(Continuum-mechanical, Anisotropic Flow model, based on an anisotropic Flow
Enhancement factor) is described, which comprises an anisotropic flow law as
well as a fabric evolution equation. The flow law is an extension of the
isotropic Glen's flow law, in which anisotropy enters via an enhancement factor
that depends on the deformability of the polycrystal. The fabric evolution
equation results from an orientational mass balance and includes constitutive
relations for grain rotation and recrystallization. The CAFFE model fulfills
all the fundamental principles of classical continuum mechanics, is
sufficiently simple to allow numerical implementations in ice-flow models and
contains only a limited number of free parameters. The applicability of the
CAFFE model is demonstrated by a case study for the site of the EPICA (European
Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica) ice core in Dronning Maud Land, East
Antarctica.
