At the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), key insights into the bulk
properties of the hot and dense partonic matter arise from the study of
azimuthal anisotropy ($v_2$) of the produced particles. These insights include
indicating the matter undergoes rapid thermalization and behaves
hydrodynamically at low $p_T$. Recently a low energy scan ($\le \sqrt{s_{NN}}$
= 62.4 GeV) began at RHIC to search for the QGP critical point, where a change
in $v_2$ from higher energies could play a key role in its identification.
Additionally, higher order flow harmonics have recently been shown to provide
constraints on initial geometry fluctuations. Discussed here are some of the
latest low energy and higher order flow results from PHENIX.
