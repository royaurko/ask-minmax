In this paper we investigate the existence of $L^{2}(\pi)$-spectral gaps for
$\pi$-irreducible, positive recurrent Markov chains on general state space. We
obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of
$L^{2}(\pi)$-spectral gaps in terms of a sequence of isoperimetric constants
and establish their asymptotic behavior. It turns out that in some cases the
spectral gap can be understood in terms of convergence of an induced
probability flow to the uniform flow. The obtained theorems can be interpreted
as mixing results and yield sharp estimates for the spectral gap of some Markov
chains.
