A statistical treatment of finite unbound systems in the presence of
collective motions is presented and applied to a classical Lennard-Jones
Hamiltonian, numerically simulated through molecular dynamics. In the ideal gas
limit, the flow dynamics can be exactly re-casted into effective time-dependent
Lagrange parameters acting on a standard Gibbs ensemble with an extra total
energy conservation constraint. Using this same ansatz for the low density
freeze-out configurations of an interacting expanding system, we show that the
presence of flow can have a sizeable effect on the microstate distribution.
