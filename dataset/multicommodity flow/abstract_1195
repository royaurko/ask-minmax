We construct an infinite family of asymptotically flat 3-charge solutions
carrying D1, D5 and momentum charges. Generically the solutions also carry two
angular momenta. The geometries describe the spectral flow of all the ground
states of the D1-D5 CFT. The family is parametrized by four functions
describing the embedding of a closed curve in R^4 and an integer n labelling
the spectral flow on the left sector. After giving the general prescription for
spectral flowing any of the ground states, we give an explicit example of the
construction. We identify the asymptotic charges of the resulting solution and
show the matching with the corresponding CFT result.
