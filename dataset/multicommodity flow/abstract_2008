In this paper, we prove that in the system of bending flows on the moduli
space of polygons with fixed side lengths introduced by Kapovich and Millson,
the singular fibers are isotropic homogeneous submanifolds. The proof covers
the case where the system is defined by any maximal family of disjoint
diagonals. We also take in account the case where the fixed side lengths are
not generic. In this case, the phase space is an orbispace, and our result
holds in the sense that singular fibers are isotropic orbispaces.
