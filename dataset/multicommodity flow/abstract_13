In this article we consider Cherry flows on torus which have two
singularities: a source and a saddle, and no periodic orbits. We show that
every Cherry flow admits a unique physical measure, whose basin has full
volume. This proves a conjecture given by R. Saghin and E. Vargas in~\cite{SV}.
We also show that the perturbation of Cherry flow depends on the divergence at
the saddle: when the divergence is negative, this flow admits a neighborhood,
such that any flow in this neighborhood belongs to the following three cases:
(a) has a saddle connection; (b) a Cherry flow; (c) a Morse-Smale flow whose
non-wandering set consists two singularities and one periodic sink. In
contrary, when the divergence is non-negative, this flow can be approximated by
non-hyperbolic flow with arbitrarily larger number of periodic sinks.
