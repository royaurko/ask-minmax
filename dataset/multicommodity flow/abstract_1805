We study blow-ups around fixed points at Type I singularities of the Ricci
flow on closed manifolds using Perelman's W-functional. First, we give an
alternative proof of the result obtained by Naber and Enders-M\"{u}ller-Topping
that blow-up limits are non-flat gradient shrinking Ricci solitons. Our second
and main result relates a limit W-density at a Type I singular point to the
entropy of the limit gradient shrinking soliton obtained by blowing-up at this
point. In particular, we show that no entropy is lost at infinity during the
blow-up process.
