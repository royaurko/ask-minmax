We develop a model of traffic flows that is capable of capturing
non-linearities and discontinuities present in flow dynamics. Our model
includes a hidden state variable that captures sudden regime shifts between
traffic free flow, breakdown and recovery. We develop an efficient particle
learning algorithm for real time on-line inference and prediction. This
requires a two step algorithm to resample the current particles, with a mixture
predictive distribution and then propagation of states using the conditional
posterior. Particle learning is achieved via updating recursions for
conditional sufficient statistics. We also describe how our model can be
adopted to special events and severe weather conditions. To illustrate our
methodology, we analyze measurements of daily traffic flow from the Illinois
interstate I-55 highway system. Finally, we conclude with directions for future
research.
