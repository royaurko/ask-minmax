Accurate knowledge of time-variation in meridional flow-speed and profile is
crucial for estimating a solar cycle's features, which are ultimately
responsible for causing space climate variations. However, no consensus has
been reached yet about the Sun's meridional circulation pattern observations
and theories. By implementing an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) data
assimilation in a Babcock-Leighton solar dynamo model using Data Assimilation
Research Testbed (DART) framework, we find that the best reconstruction of
time-variation in meridional flow-speed can be obtained when ten or more
observations are used with an updating time of 15 days and a $\le 10\%$
observational error. Increasing ensemble-size from 16 to 160 improves
reconstruction. Comparison of reconstructed flow-speed with "true-state"
reveals that EnKF data assimilation is very powerful for reconstructing
meridional flow-speeds and suggests that it can be implemented for
reconstructing spatio-temporal patterns of meridional circulation.
