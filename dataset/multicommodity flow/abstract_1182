Atmospheric flows exhibit fluctuations of all scales (space -time) ranging
from turbulence (millimeters-seconds) to climate (thousands of
kilometers-years). The apparently random fluctuations however exhibit
long-range spatio-temporal correlations manifested as the selfsimilar fractal
geometry to the global cloud cover pattern concomitant with inverse power law
form for power spectra of temporal fluctuations . Long-range spatiotemporal
correlations are ubiquitous to dynamical systems in nature and are recently
identified as signatures of self-organized criticality . Traditional
meteorological theory cannot explain satisfactorily the observed selforganized
criticality in atmospheric flows . This paper gives a summary of an alternative
non-deterministic cell dynamical systems model for atmospheric flows which
predicts the observed self-organized criticality as intrinsic to quantumlike
mechanics governing flow dynamics.
