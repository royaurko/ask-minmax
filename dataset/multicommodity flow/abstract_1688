Two types of cosmology are discussed and their implications for the observed
cmb (cosmic microwave background radiation) dipole are described. Theorems
useful for understanding the cause for a cmb dipole are presented. Since the
present peculiar velocity of the solar system relative to the GA (Great
Attracter) cannot explain the observed cmb dipole, the contributor presents the
possibility of Hubble flow of the GA as a cause in one case and a further
peculiar velocity of the GA in the other case.
