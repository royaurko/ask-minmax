Several results on singularities and convergence of the Yang-Mills flow in
dimension four are given. We show that a singularity of pure + or - charge
cannot form within finite time, in contrast to the analogous situation of
harmonic maps between Riemann surfaces. We deduce long-time existence given low
initial self-dual energy, and in this case study convergence of the flow at
infinite time. If a global weak Uhlenbeck limit is anti-self-dual and has
vanishing self-dual second cohomology, then the limit exists smoothly and
exponential convergence holds. We also recover the classical grafting theorem,
and derive asymptotic stability of this class of instantons in the appropriate
sense.
