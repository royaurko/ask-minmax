Mixing of a passive scalar in the peripheral region close to a wall is
investigated by means of accurate direct numerical simulations of both a
three-dimensional Couette channel flow at low Reynolds numbers and a
two-dimensional synthetic flow. In both cases, the resulting phenomenology can
be understood in terms of the theory recently developed by Lebedev and Turitsyn
[Phys. Rev. E 69, 036301, 2004]. Our results prove the robustness of the
identified mechanisms responsible for the persistency of scalar concentration
close to the wall with important consequences in completely different fields
ranging from microfluidic applications to environmental dispersion modeling.
