An average pedestrian flow through an exit is one of the most important index
in evaluating pedestrian dynamics. In order to study the flow in detail, the
floor field model, which is a crowd model by using cellular automaton, is
extended by taking into account a realistic behavior of pedestrians around the
exit. The model is studied by both numerical simulations and cluster analysis
to obtain a theoretical expression of an average pedestrian flow through the
exit. It is found quantitatively that the effect of exit door width, a wall,
and pedestrian's mood of competition or cooperation significantly influence the
average flow. The results show that there is suitable width of the exit and
position according to pedestrian's mood.
