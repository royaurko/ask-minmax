We prove dynamical stability and instability theorems for compact Einstein
metrics under the Ricci flow. The stability and instability conditions are
given in terms of the conformal Yamabe invariant and the Laplace spectrum.
These theorems generalize results recently obtained in the Ricci-flat case.
