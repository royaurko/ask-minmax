Lyapunov exponents are indicators for the chaotic properties of a classical
dynamical system. They are most naturally defined in terms of the time
evolution of a set of so-called covariant vectors, co-moving with the
linearized flow in tangent space. Taking a simple spring pendulum and the
H\'enon-Heiles system as examples, we demonstrate the consequences of
symplectic symmetry and of time-reversal invariance for such vectors, and study
the transformation between different parameterizations of the flow.
