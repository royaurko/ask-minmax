In a stationary, general relativistic, axisymmetric, inviscid and rotational
accretion flow, described within the Kerr geometric framework, transonicity has
been examined by setting up the governing equations of the flow as a
first-order autonomous dynamical system. The consequent linearised analysis of
the critical points of the flow leads to a comprehensive mathematical
prescription for classifying these points, showing that the only possibilities
are saddle points and centre-type points for all ranges of values of the fixed
flow parameters. The spin parameter of the black hole influences the
multitransonic character of the flow, as well as some of its specific critical
properties. The special case of a flow in the space-time of a non-rotating
black hole, characterised by the Schwarzschild metric, has also been studied
for comparison and the conclusions are compatible with what has been seen for
the Kerr geometric case.
