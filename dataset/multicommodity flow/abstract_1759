We present the first measurement of the color representation of the
hadronically decaying W boson in t-tbar events, from 5.3 fb^-1 of integrated
luminosity collected with the D0 experiment. A novel calorimeter-based
vectorial variable, "jet pull," is used, sensitive to the color-flow structure
of the final state. We find that the fraction of uncolored W bosons is 0.56 +-
0.42(stat+syst), in agreement with the standard model.
