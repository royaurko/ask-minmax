We describe the stress energy of a fluid with two unequal stresses and heat
flow in terms of two perfect fluid components. The description is in terms of
the fluid velocity overlap of the components, and makes no assumptions about
the equations of state of the perfect fluids. The description is applied to the
metrics of a conformally flat system and a black string.
