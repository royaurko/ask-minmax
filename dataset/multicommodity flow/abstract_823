We investigate the effect of polymer additives on a two-dimensional
Kolmogorov flow at very low Reynolds numbers by direct numerical simulations of
the Oldroyd-B viscoelastic model. We find that above the elastic instability
threshold the flow develops the elastic turbulence regime recently observed in
experiments. We observe that both the turbulent drag and the Lyapunov exponent
increase with Weissenberg, indicating the presence of a disordered,
turbulent-like mixing flow. The energy spectrum develops a power-law scaling
range with an exponent close to the experimental and theoretical expectations.
