A Hydro+Cascade model has been used to describe radial and elliptic flow at
the SPS and successfully predicted the radial and elliptic flow measured by the
both STAR and PHENIX collaborations . Furthermore, a combined description of
the radial and elliptic flow for different particle species, restricts the
Equation of State(EoS) and points towards an EoS with a phase transition to the
Quark Gluon Plasma(QGP) .
