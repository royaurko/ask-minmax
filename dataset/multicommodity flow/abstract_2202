Numerical studies performed with a primitive equation model on
two-dimensional sinusoidal hills show that the local velocity profiles behave
logarithmically to a very good approximation, from a distance from the surface
of the order of the maximum hill height almost up to the top of the boundary
layer. This behavior is well known for flows above homogeneous and flat
topographies (``law-of-the-wall'') and, more recently, investigated with
respect to the large-scale (``asymptotic'') averaged flows above complex
topography. Furthermore, this new-found local generalized law-of-the-wall
involves effective parameters showing a smooth dependence on the position along
the underlying topography. This dependence is similar to the topography itself,
while this property does not absolutely hold for the underlying flow, nearest
to the hill surface.
