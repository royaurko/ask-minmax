We identify a condition on spacelike 2-surfaces in a spacetime that is
relevant to understanding the concept of mass in general relativity. We prove a
formula for the variation of the spacetime Hawking mass under a uniformly area
expanding flow and show that it is nonnegative for these so-called "time flat
surfaces." Such flows generalize inverse mean curvature flow, which was used by
Huisken and Ilmanen to prove the Riemannian Penrose inequality for one black
hole. A flow of time flat surfaces may have connections to the problem in
general relativity of bounding the mass of a spacetime from below by the
quasi-local mass of a spacelike 2-surface contained therein.
