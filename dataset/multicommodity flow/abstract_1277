In the paper, some aspects of the polytropic analysis are developed that
concerned with various processes changing the thermodynamic state of flow of a
real fluid and with reduction of these processes to processes having a given
temperature and pressure of a given real mixture at the inlet. It is shown that
all parameters of the process can be converted under condition of full
similarity of flow that is formulated in the paper. An operating point of a
compressor represents such process. It is to emphasize that parameters of the
reduced point include not only volume flow, speed and polytropic head, for
which a requirement of similarity of flow at inlet is sufficient, but also
polytropic exponent, polytropic efficiency, outlet pressure and outlet
temperature. This allows a conversion of all compressor characteristics. A
method for that is described.
