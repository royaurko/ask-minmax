Research into mechanisms of hematogenous metastasis has largely become
genetic in focus, attempting to understand the molecular basis of `seed-soil'
relationships. Preceeding this biological mechanism is the physical process of
dissemination of circulating tumour cells (CTCs). We utilize a `filter-flow'
paradigm to show that assumptions about CTC dynamics strongly affect metastatic
efficiency: without data on CTC dynamics, any attempt to predict metastatic
spread in individual patients is impossible.
