We prove a product estimate that allows to estimate the quadratic first order
nonlinearity of the harmonic map flow in the $L^p$ norm. Then the parabolic
analogue of Weyl's lemma for the Lapace operator is established. Both results
are applied to prove regularity for the heat flow by parabolic bootstrapping.
