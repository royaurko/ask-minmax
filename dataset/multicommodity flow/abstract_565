In this paper, we continue our study of the trajectory spaces of traversally
generic flows on smooth compact manifolds with boundary.
  With the help of a traversally generic field v on X, we divide its boundary
d_1X into two complementary compact manifolds, d_1^+X(v) and d_1^-X(v), which
share a common boundary d_2X(v). Then we introduce the causality map C_v:
d_1^+X(v) --> d_1^-X(v), a far relative of the Poincare return map. Our main
results, Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 4.2, claim that, for traversally generic
flows, the knowledge of the causality map C_v is sufficient for a
reconstruction of the pair (X, F(v))$, up to a piecewise differential
homeomorphism \Phi: X \to X (respectively, up to a diffeomorphism \Phi) which
is the identity on the boundary d_1X. Here F(v) denotes the oriented
1-dimensional foliation on X, produced by the v-flow.
  We call these results "holographic" since the (n+1)-dimensional X and the
unparameterized dynamics of the flow on it are captured by a single
correspondece C_v between two n-dimensional screens, d_1^+X(v) and d_1^-X(v).
  This holography of traversing flows has numerous applications to the dynamics
of general flows. Some of them include results about the geodesic flows on
manifolds M with boundary and the classical scattering problems. These results
are valid for special class of Riemannian metrics on M which we call
traversally generic. For such metrics, we prove that the space of geodesic
curves on $M$ can be reconstructed from the geodesic scattering data (see
Theorem 5.3).
