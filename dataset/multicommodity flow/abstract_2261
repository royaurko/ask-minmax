The non-perturbative renormalization-group approach is extended to lattice
models, considering as an example a $\phi^4$ theory defined on a
$d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice. Within a simple approximation for the
effective action, we solve the flow equations and obtain the renormalized
dispersion $\eps(\q)$ over the whole Brillouin zone of the reciprocal lattice.
In the long-distance limit, where the lattice does not matter any more, we
reproduce the usual flow equations of the continuum model. We show how the
numerical solution of the flow equations can be simplified by expanding the
dispersion in a finite number of circular harmonics.
