At the point of pinch-off of an underwater air bubble, the speed of water
rushing in diverges. Previous studies that assumed radial flow throughout
showed that the local axial shape is two smoothly connected, slender cones that
transition very slowly (logarithmically) to a cylindrical segment. Our
simulations show that even with initially radial flow, a transient vertical
flow develops with comparable speeds. Bernoulli pressure draws water into the
singularity region while incompressibility forces it away from the neck
minimum, generating significant vertical flows that rapidly slenderize and
symmetrize the collapse region. This transition is due to a different
mechanism, occurring much faster than previously expected. Vertical flows
dictate the neck shape evolution.
