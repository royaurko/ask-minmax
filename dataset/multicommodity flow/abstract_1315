We show that flow anisotropies in relativistic heavy-ion collisions can be
analyzed using a certain technique of shape analysis of excursion sets recently
proposed by us for CMBR fluctuations to investigate anisotropic expansion
history of the universe. The technique analyzes shapes (sizes) of patches above
(below) certain threshold value for transverse energy/particle number (the
excursion sets) as a function of the azimuthal angle and rapidity. Modeling
flow by imparting extra anisotropic momentum to the momentum distribution of
particles from HIJING, we compare the resulting distributions for excursion
sets at two different azimuthal angles. Angles with maximum difference in the
two distributions identify the event plane, and the magnitude of difference in
the two distributions relates to the magnitude of momentum anisotropy, i.e.
elliptic flow.
