We study a superconducting loop that encloses a magnetic flux, connected to a
superconducting and to a normal electrode, when a fixed electric current
between the electrodes flows through the loop. The considered circuit does not
contain Josephson junctions. We find that in a very broad range of parameters
the current flow converges to a stationary regime. The potential difference
between the electrodes depends on the magnetic flux, so that measuring this
voltage would provide information on the enclosed flux. The sizes of the
voltage and of the power dissipation could be appropriate for the design of a
practical fluxmeter. We found narrow ranges of flux at which the voltage varies
sharply with the flux.
