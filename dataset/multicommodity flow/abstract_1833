Kinetic models for vehicular traffic are reviewed and considered from the
point of view of deriving macroscopic equations. A derivation of the associated
macroscopic traffic flow equations leads to different types of equations: in
certain situations modified Aw-Rascle equations are obtained. On the other
hand, for several choices of kinetic parameters new Hamilton-Jacobi type
traffic equations are found. Associated microscopic models are discussed and
numerical experiments are presented discussing several situations for highway
traffic and comparing the different models.
