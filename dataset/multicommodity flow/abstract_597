The use of gauged ${\cal N} = 8$ supergravity as a tool in studying the
AdS/CFT correspondence for ${\cal N} = 4$ Yang-Mills theory is reviewed. The
supergravity potential implies a non-trivial, supersymmetric IR fixed point,
and the flow to this fixed point is described in terms of a supergravity kink.
The results agree perfectly with earlier, independent field theory results. A
supergravity inspired $c$-function, and corresponding $c$-theorem is discussed
for general flows, and the simplified form for supersymmetric flows is also
given. Flows along the Coulomb branch of the Yang-Mills theory are also
described from the five-dimensional perspective.
