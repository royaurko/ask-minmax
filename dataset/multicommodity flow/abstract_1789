We present an event-by-event hydrodynamical framework which takes into
account the initial density fluctuations arising from a Monte Carlo Glauber
model. The elliptic flow is calculated with the event plane method and a
one-to-one comparison with the measured event plane $v_2$ is made. Both the
centrality- and $p_T$-dependence of the $v_2$ are remarkably well reproduced.
We also find that the participant plane is a quite good approximation for the
event plane.
