Dynamic arrest is a general phenomenon across a wide range of dynamic
systems, but the universality of dynamic arrest phenomena remains unclear. We
relate the emergence of traffic jams in a simple traffic flow model to the
dynamic slow down in kinetically constrained models for glasses. In kinetically
constrained models, the formation of glass becomes a true (singular) phase
transition in the limit $T\to 0$. Similarly, using the Nagel-Schreckenberg
model to simulate traffic flow, we show that the emergence of jammed traffic
acquires the signature of a sharp transition in the deterministic limit $\pp\to
1$, corresponding to overcautious driving. We identify a true dynamical
critical point marking the onset of coexistence between free flowing and jammed
traffic, and demonstrate its analogy to the kinetically constrained glass
models. We find diverging correlations analogous to those at a critical point
of thermodynamic phase transitions.
