We consider one of the well-known solutions in eleven-dimensional
supergravity where the seven-dimensional Einstein space is given by a
SO(3)-bundle over the CP^2. By reexaming the AdS_4 supergravity scalar
potential, the holographic renormalization group flow from N=(0,1) SU(3) x
SU(2)-invariant UV fixed point to N=(3,0) SU(3) x SU(2)-invariant IR fixed
point is reinterpreted. A dual operator in three-dimensional superconformal
Chern-Simons matter theories corresponding to this RG flow is described.
