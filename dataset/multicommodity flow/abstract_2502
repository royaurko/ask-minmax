In this fluid dynamic video we present simulations of converging
two-dimensional detonation in a radially expanding supersonic flow of ideal
reactive gas. The detonation is found to be unstable and leads to formation of
characteristic cellular patterns. Without any obstacles in the flow, the
detonation keeps expanding radially. To retain the wave within a bounded
region, we place a number of rigid obstacles in the flow so that the detonation
shock stands some distance toward the center from the obstacles. This leads to
generation of reflected shock waves from the obstacles which help the
detonation wave to remain at a finite distance from the source. The cellular
structure of detonation creates beautiful patterns of shock waves and contact
discontinuities within and after the reaction zone. The patterns often resemble
a sunflower, hence the name of "sunflower detonation".
