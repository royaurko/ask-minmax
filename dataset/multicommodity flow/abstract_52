A black hole accretion is necessarily transonic. In presence of sufficiently
high viscosity and cooling effects, a low-angular momentum transonic flow can
become a standard Keplerian disc except close to the where hole where it must
pass through the inner sonic point. However, if the viscosity is not high
everywhere and cooling is not efficient everywhere, the flow cannot completely
become a Keplerian disc. In this paper, we show results of rigorous numerical
simulations of a transonic flow having vertically varying viscosity parameter
(being highest on the equatorial plane) and optical depth dependent cooling
processes to show that the flow indeed segregates into two distinct components
as it approaches a black hole. The component on the equatorial plane has
properties of a standard Keplerian disc, though the flow is not truncated at
the inner- most stable circular orbit. This component extends till the horizon
as a sub-Keplerian flow. This standard disc is found to be surrounded by a hot,
low angular momentum component forming a centrifugal barrier dominated
oscillating shock wave, consistent with the Chakrabarti-Titarchuk two component
advective flow configuration.
