The results of three-dimensional numerical simulations of the flow of matter
in non-magnetic semidetached binary systems are presented. Self-consistent
solutions indicate the absence of a shock interaction between the stream of
matter flowing from the inner Lagrange point and the accretion disk (a "hot
spot"). At the same time, the interaction between the stream and the common
envelope of the system forms an extended shock wave along the edge of the
stream, whose observational properties are roughly equivalent to those of a hot
spot in the disk. Comparison of synethesized and observed light curves confirm
the adequacy of the proposed model for the flow of matter without formation of
a hot spot. The model makes it possible for the first time to reproduce the
variety of the observed light curves of cataclysmic variables in the framework
of a single model, without invoking additional assumptions.
