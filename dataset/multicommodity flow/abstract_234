As for the solutions of the generalized Beltrami flows to the incompressible
Euler equations besides the solutions separating radius and axial components,
there are only several solutions found as the Hill's vortex solutions. We will
present a series of vortex solutions in this category for the generalized
Beltrami flows to the incompressible Euler equations.
