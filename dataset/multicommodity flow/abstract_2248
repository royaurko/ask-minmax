We consider a model dense colloidal dispersion at the glass transition, and
investigate the connection between equilibrium stress fluctuations, seen in
linear shear moduli, and the shear stresses under strong flow conditions far
from equilibrium, viz. flow curves for finite shear rates. To this purpose
thermosensitive core-shell particles consisting of a polystyrene core and a
crosslinked poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)(PNIPAM) shell were synthesized. Data
over an extended range in shear rates and frequencies are compared to
theoretical results from integrations through transients and mode coupling
approaches. The connection between non-linear rheology and glass transition is
clarified. While the theoretical models semi-quantitatively fit the data taken
in fluid states and the predominant elastic response of glass, a yet
unaccounted dissipative mechanism is identified in glassy states.
