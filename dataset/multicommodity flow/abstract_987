We construct invariants of relative K-theory classes of multiparameter
dependent pseudodifferential operators, which recover and generalize Melrose's
divisor flow and its higher odd-dimensional versions of Lesch and Pflaum. These
higher divisor flows are obtained by means of pairing the relative K-theory
modulo the symbols with the cyclic cohomological characters of relative cycles
constructed out of the regularized operator trace together with its symbolic
boundary. Besides giving a clear and conceptual explanation to all the
essential features of the divisor flows, this construction allows to uncover
the previously unknown even-dimensional counterparts. Furthermore, it confers
to the totality of these invariants a purely topological interpretation, that
of implementing the classical Bott periodicity isomorphisms in a manner
compatible with the suspension isomorphisms in both K-theory and in cyclic
cohomology. We also give a precise formulation, in terms of a natural Clifford
algebraic suspension, for the relationship between the higher divisor flows and
the spectral flow.
