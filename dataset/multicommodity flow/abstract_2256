We present a novel thermodynamically guided, low-noise, time-scale bridging,
and pertinently efficient strategy for the dynamic simulation of microscopic
models for complex fluids. The systematic coarse-graining method is exemplified
for low-molecular polymeric systems subjected to homogeneous flow fields. We
use established concepts of nonequilibrium thermodynamics and an alternating
Monte-Carlo--molecular dynamics iteration scheme in order to obtain the model
equations for the slow variables. For chosen flow situations of interest, the
established model predicts structural as well as material functions beyond the
regime of linear response. As a by-product, we present the first steady state
equibiaxial simulation results for polymer melts. The method is simple to
implement and allows for the calculation of time-dependent behavior through
quantities readily available from the nonequilibrium steady states.
