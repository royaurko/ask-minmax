We use the r-matrix formulation to show the integrability of geodesic flow on
an $N$-dimensional space with coordinates $q_k$, with $k=1,...,N$, equipped
with the co-metric $g^{ij}=e^{-|q_i-q_j|}\big(2-e^{-|q_i-q_j|}\big)$. This flow
is generated by a symmetry of the integrable partial differential equation
(pde) $m_t+um_x+3mu_x=0, m=u-\alpha^2u_{xx}$ ($\al $ is a constant). This
equation -- called the Degasperis-Procesi (DP) equation -- was recently proven
to be completely integrable and possess peakon solutions by Degasperis, Holm
and Hone (DHH[2002]). The isospectral eigenvalue problem associated with the
integrable DP equation is used to find a new $L$-matrix, called the Lax matrix,
for the geodesic dynamical flow. By employing this Lax matrix we obtain the
$r$-matrix for the integrable geodesic flow.
