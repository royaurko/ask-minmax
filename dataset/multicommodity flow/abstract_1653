We obtain an extension of Bjorken's 1+1 dimensional scaling relativistic flow
solution to relativistic transverse velocities with cylindrical symmetry in 1+3
dimensions at constant, homogeneous pressure (vanishing sound velocity). This
can be the situation during a first order phase transition converting quark
matter into hadron matter in relativistic heavy ion collisions.
