In heavy ion collisions, event-by-event fluctuations in participating nucleon
positions can lead to triangular flow. Generally, one uses Monte-Carlo Glauber
model to obtain the participating nucleon positions. To use in a hydrodynamic
model, the positions needs to be smoothened. We study the effect of smoothening
of Glauber Monte-Carlo initial conditions on elliptic and triangular flow. It
is shown that integrated as well as differential elliptic and triangular flow
remain largely unaltered, irrespective of functional form of the smoothening
function, or the smoothening parameter
