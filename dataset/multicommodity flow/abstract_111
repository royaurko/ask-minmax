In this visualisation, the transition from laminar to turbulent flow is
characterised by the intermittent ejection of wall fluid into the outer stream.
The normalised thickness of the viscous flow layer reaches an asymptotic value
but the physical thickness drops exponentially after transition. The critical
transition pipe Reynolds number can be obtained simply by equating it with the
asymptotic value of the normalised thickness of viscous flow layer.
  Key words: Transition, critical stability Reynolds number, critical
