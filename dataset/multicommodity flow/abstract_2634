Extending previous work~[arXiv:1408.0628] by the first contributor we present a
variant of the Arratia flow of a field of coalescing Brownian motions starting
from every point of the unit interval. The important new feature of the model
is that individual particles carry mass which aggregated upon colascence and
which scales the diffusivity of each particle in inverse proportional way. --
As our main results we show uniqueness in law of this system and a large
deviation principle for small times, leading to a Varadhan-formula for the
induced measure valued flow with the quadratic Wasserstein distance as rate
function. Hence this model is proposed as another candidate for an intrinsic
Brownian motion on the Wasserstein space of probability measures.
