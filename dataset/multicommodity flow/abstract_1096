Elliptic flow, elliptic flow fluctuations and fluctuations in the initial
geometry point to a description of nuclear collisions that is driven by the
initial geometry, a quantity which appears to be imprinted from the instant of
the collision. In these proceedings, recent results from the PHOBOS
collaboration are discussed in the context of the importance of the collision
geometry.
