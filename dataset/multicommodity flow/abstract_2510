Observing the excitation mechanisms of incompressible transverse waves is
vital for determining how energy propagates through the lower solar atmosphere.
We aim to show the connection between convectively driven photospheric flows
and incompressible chromospheric waves. The observations presented here show
the propagation of incompressible motion through the quiet lower solar
atmosphere, from the photosphere to the chromosphere. We determine photospheric
flow vectors to search for signatures of vortex motion and compare results to
{photospheric flows present in} convective simulations. Further, we search for
the chromospheric response to vortex motions. Evidence is presented that
suggests incompressible waves can be excited by the vortex motions of a strong
magnetic flux concentration in the photosphere. A chromospheric counterpart to
the photospheric vortex motion is also observed, presenting itself as a
quasi-periodic torsional motion. Fine-scale, fibril structures that emanate
from the chromospheric counterpart support transverse waves that are driven by
the observed torsional motion. A new technique for obtaining details of
transverse waves from time-distance diagrams is presented and the properties of
transverse waves (e.g., amplitudes and periods) excited by the chromospheric
torsional motion are measured.
