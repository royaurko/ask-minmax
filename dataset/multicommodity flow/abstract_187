We produce infinitely many examples of Anosov flows in closed 3-manifolds
where the set of periodic orbits is partitioned into two infinite subsets. In
one subset every closed orbit is freely homotopic to infinitely other closed
orbits of the flow. In the other subset every closed orbit is freely homotopic
to only one other closed orbit. The examples are obtained by Dehn surgery on
geodesic flows. The manifolds are toroidal and have Seifert fibered pieces and
atoroidal pieces in their torus decompositions.
