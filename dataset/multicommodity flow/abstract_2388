A small amplitude perturbation analysis is developed to describe the effect
of a uniform electric field on the dynamics of a lipid bilayer vesicle in a
simple shear flow. All media are treated as leaky dielectrics and fluid motion
is described by the Stokes equations. The instantaneous vesicle shape is
obtained by balancing electric, hydrodynamic, bending, and tension stresses
exerted on the membrane. We find that in the absence of ambient shear flow, it
is possible that an applied step--wise uniform DC electric field could cause
the vesicle shape to evolve from oblate to prolate over time if the
encapsulated fluid is less conducting than the suspending fluid. For a vesicle
in ambient shear flow, the electric field damps the tumbling motion leading to
a stable tank-treading state.
