We consider the long-time behavior of the mean curvature flow in
heterogeneous media with periodic fibrations, modeled as an additive driving
force. Under appropriate assumptions on the forcing term, we show existence of
generalized traveling waves with maximal speed of propagation, and we prove the
convergence of solutions to the forced mean curvature flow to these generalized
waves.
