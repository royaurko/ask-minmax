A new and very general technique for simulating solid-fluid suspensions is
described; its most important feature is that the computational cost scales
linearly with the number of particles. The method combines Newtonian dynamics
of the solid particles with a discretized Boltzmann equation for the fluid
phase; the many-body hydrodynamic interactions are fully accounted for, both in
the creeping-flow regime and at higher Reynolds numbers. Brownian motion of the
solid particles arises spontaneously from stochastic fluctuations in the fluid
stress tensor, rather than from random forces or displacements applied directly
to the particles. In this paper, the theoretical foundations of the technique
are laid out, illustrated by simple analytical and numerical examples; in the
companion paper, extensive numerical tests of the method, for stationary flows,
time-dependent flows, and finite Reynolds number flows, are reported.
