The combined effect of mean flow and rotation on hexagonal patterns is
investigated using Ginzburg-Landau equations that include nonlinear gradient
terms as well as the nonlocal coupling provided by the mean flow. Long-wave and
short-wave side-band instabilities are determined. Due to the nonlinear
gradient terms and enhanced by the mean flow, the penta-hepta defects can
become unstable to the induced nucleation of dislocations in the defect-free
amplitude, which can lead to the proliferation of penta-hepta defects and
persistent spatio-temporal chaos. For individual penta-hepta defects the
nonlinear gradient terms enhance climbing or gliding motion, depending on
whether they break the chiral symmetry or not.
