The paper presents a dynamic solution method for dynamic minimum parametric
networks flow. The solution method solves the problem for a special parametric
dynamic network with linear lower bound functions of a single parameter.
Instead directly work on the original network, the method implements a
labelling algorithm in the parametric dynamic residual network and uses
quickest paths from the source node to the sink node in the time-space network
along which repeatedly decreases the dynamic flow for a sequence of parameter
values, in their increasing order. In each iteration, the algorithm computes
both the minimum flow for a certain subinterval of the parameter values, and
the new breakpoint for the maximum parametric dynamic flow value function.
