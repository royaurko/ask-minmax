A complete theoretical presentation of the Continuum-mechanical, Anisotropic
Flow model, based on an anisotropic Flow Enhancement factor (CAFFE model) is
given. The CAFFE model is an application of the theory of mixtures with
continuous diversity for the case of large polar ice masses in which induced
anisotropy occurs. The anisotropic response of the polycrystalline ice is
described by a generalization of Glen's flow law, based on a scalar anisotropic
enhancement factor. The enhancement factor depends on the orientation mass
density, which is closely related to the orientation distribution function and
describes the distribution of grain orientations (fabric). Fabric evolution is
governed by the orientation mass balance, which depends on four distinct
effects, interpreted as local rigid body rotation, grain rotation, rotation
recrystallization (polygonization) and grain boundary migration (migration
recrystallization), respectively. It is proven that the flow law of the CAFFE
model is truly anisotropic despite the collinearity between the stress deviator
and stretching tensors.
