It is known that entanglement dynamics of two noninteracting qubits, locally
subjected to classical environments, may exhibit revivals. A simple explanation
of this phenomenon may be provided by using the concept of hidden entanglement,
which signals the presence of entanglement that may be recovered without the
help of nonlocal operations. Here we discuss the link between hidden
entanglement and the (non-Markovian) flow of classical information between the
system and the environment.
