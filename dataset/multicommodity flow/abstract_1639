Analysis of the Stockholm group data on zero-pressure-gradient boundary
flows, presented in the thesis of J.~M.~\"Osterlund ({\tt
http://www.mesh.kth.se/$\sim$jens/zpg/}) is performed. The results of
processing of all 70 mean velocity profiles are presented. It is demonstrated
that, properly processed, these data lead to a conclusion opposite from that of
the thesis and related papers: they confirm the Reynolds-number-dependent
scaling law and disprove the conclusion that the flow in the intermediate
("overlap") region is Reynolds-number-independent.
