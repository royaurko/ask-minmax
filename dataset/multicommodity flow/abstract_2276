For a massless fluid (density = 0), the steady flow along a duct is governed
exclusively by viscous losses. In this paper, we show that the velocity profile
obtained in this limit can be used to calculate the pressure drop up to the
first order in density. This method has been applied to the particular case of
a duct, defined by two plane-parallel discs. For this case, the first-order
approximation results in a simple analytical solution which has been favorably
checked against numerical simulations. Finally, an experiment has been carried
out with water flowing between the discs. The experimental results show good
agreement with the approximate solution.
