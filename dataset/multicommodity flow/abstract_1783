A new method of measuring the pressure anisotropy in the early stage of
heavy-ion collisions is discussed. It is shown that the transverse momentum
spectra, elliptic flow and interferometry radii are not sensitive to the early
anisotropy. We propose the directed flow as a measure of the early transverse
and longitudinal pressures. Calculations indicate that the transverse and
longitudinal pressures equilibrate in less than 0.25 fm/c.
