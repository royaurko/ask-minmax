We examine 1D two-temperature accretion flows around a supermassive black
hole, adopting the specific angular momentum \lambda, the total specific energy
\epsilon and the input accretion rate \dot M_{input} = 4.0x10^{-6} solar
mass/yr estimated in the recent analysis of stellar wind of nearby stars around
Sgr A*.
  The two-temperature flow is almost adiabatic even if we take account of the
heating of electrons by ions, the bremsstrahlung cooling and the synchrotron
cooling, as long as the ratio \beta of the magnetic energy density to the
thermal energy density is taken to be as \beta < 1. The different temperatures
of ions and electrons are caused by the different adiabatic indices of ions and
electrons which depend on their temperature states under the relativistic
regime. The total luminosity increases with increasing \beta and results in -
10^{35} - 10^{36} erg/s for \beta=10^{-3} - 1.
  Furthermore, from 2D time-dependent hydrodynamical calculations of the above
flow, we find that the irregularly oscillating shocks are formed in the inner
region and that the luminosity and the mass-outflow rate vary by a factor of 2
-- 3 and 1.5 -- 4, respectively. The time variability may be relevant to the
flare activity of Sgr A*.
