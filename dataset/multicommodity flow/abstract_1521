Traffic jam in a fluid model of traffic flows proposed by Kerner and
Konh\"auser (B. S. Kerner and P. Konh\"auser, Phys. Rev. E 52 (1995), 5574.) is
analyzed. An analytic scaling solution is presented near the critical point of
the hetero-clinic bifurcation. The validity of the solution has been confirmed
from the comparison with the simulation of the model.
