In this paper we give a description of the asymptotic behavior, as
$\epsilon\to 0$, of the $\epsilon$-gradient flow in the finite dimensional
case.
  Under very general assumptions we prove that it converges to an evolution
obtained by connecting some smooth branches of solutions to the equilibrium
equation (slow dynamics) through some heteroclinic solutions of the gradient
flow (fast dynamics).
