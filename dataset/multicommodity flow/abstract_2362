In this paper we study the short time existence problem for the (generalized)
Lagrangian mean curvature flow in (almost) Calabi--Yau manifolds when the
initial Lagrangian submanifold has isolated conical singularities modelled on
stable special Lagrangian cones. Given a Lagrangian submanifold
$F_0:L\rightarrow M$ in an almost Calabi--Yau manifold $M$ with isolated
conical singularities at $x_1,...,x_n\in M$ modelled on stable special
Lagrangian cones $C_1,...,C_n$ in $\mathbb{C}^m$, we show that for a short time
there exist one-parameter families of points $x_1(t),... x_n(t)\in M$ and a one
parameter family of Lagrangian submanifolds $F(t,\cdot):L\rightarrow M$ with
isolated conical singularities at $x_1(t),...,x_n(t)\in M$ modelled on
$C_1,...,C_n$, which evolves by (generalized) Lagrangian mean curvature flow
with initial condition $F_0:L\rightarrow M$.
