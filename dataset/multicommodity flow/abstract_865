We consider the motion of a rigid body immersed in an ideal flow occupying
the plane, with bounded initial vorticity. In that case there exists a unique
corresponding solution which is global in time, in the spirit of the famous
work by Yudovich for the fluid alone. We prove that if the body's boundary is
Gevrey then the body's trajectory is Gevrey. This extends the previous work
[Glass-Sueur-Takahashi, 2011] to a case where the flow is irregular.
