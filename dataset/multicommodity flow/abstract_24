Consider the unnormalized Ricci flow $(g_{ij})_t = -2R_{ij}$ for $t\in
[0,T)$, where $T < \infty$. Richard Hamilton showed that if the curvature
operator is uniformly bounded under the flow for all times $t\in [0,T)$ then
the solution can be extended beyond $T$. We prove that if the Ricci curvature
is uniformly bounded under the flow for all times $t\in [0,T)$, then the
curvature tensor has to be uniformly bounded as well.
