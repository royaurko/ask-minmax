We consider a compact, star-shaped, mean convex hypersurface $\Sigma^2\subset
\mathbb{R}^3$. We prove that in some cases the flow exists until it shrinks to
a point in a spherical manner, which is very typical for convex surfaces as
well (see \cite{An1}). We also prove that in the case we have a surface of
revolution which is star-shaped and mean convex, a smooth solution always
exists up to some finite time $T < \infty$ at which the flow shrinks to a point
asymptotically spherically.
