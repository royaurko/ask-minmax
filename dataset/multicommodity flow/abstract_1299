The syncytial cells of a filamentous fungus consist of a mass of growing,
tube-like hyphae. Each extending tip is fed by a continuous flow of nuclei from
the colony interior, pushed by a gradient in turgor pressure. The myco-fluidic
flows of nuclei are complex and multidirectional, like traffic in a city. We
map out the flows in a strain of the model filamentous fungus {\it N. crassa}
that has been transformed so that nuclei express either hH1-dsRed (a red
fluorescent nuclear protein) or hH1-GFP (a green-fluorescent protein) and
report our results in a fluid dynamics video.
