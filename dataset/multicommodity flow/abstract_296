We will study a certain synchronizing property of subshifts called
$\lambda$-synchronization. The $\lambda$-synchronizing subshifts form a large
class of irreducible subshifts containing irreducible sofic shifts. We prove
that the $\lambda$-synchronization is invariant under flow equivalence of
subshifts. The $\lambda$-synchronizing K-groups and the $\lambda$-synchronizing
Bowen-Franks groups are studied and proved to be invariant under flow
equivalence of $\lambda$-synchronizing subshifts. They are new flow equivalence
invariants for $\lambda$-synchronizing subshifts.
