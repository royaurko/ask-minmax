In this article, we first investigate the kinematics of specific geodesic
flows on two dimensional media with constant curvature, by explicitly solving
the evolution (Raychaudhuri) equations for the expansion, shear and rotation
along the flows. We point out the existence of singular (within a finite value
of the time parameter) and non-singular solutions and illustrate our results
through a `phase' diagram. This diagram demonstrates under which initial
conditions (or combinations thereof) we end up with a singularity in the
congruence and when, if at all, we encounter non--singular solutions for the
kinematic variables. Our analysis illustrates the differences which arise due
to a positive or negative value of the curvature. Subsequently, we move on to
geodesic flows on two dimensional spaces with varying curvature. As an example,
we discuss flows on a torus, where interesting oscillatory features of the
expansion, shear and rotation emerge, which are found to depend on the ratio of
the radii of the torus. The singular (within a finite time)/non--singular
nature of the solutions are also discussed. Finally, we arrive at some general
statements and point out similarities or dissimilarities that arise in
comparison to our earlier work on media in flat space.
