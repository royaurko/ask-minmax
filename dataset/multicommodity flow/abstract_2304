We introduce and study a da Vinci Fluid, a fluid whose dissipation is
dominated by solid friction. We analyse the flow rheology of a discrete model
and then coarse-grain it to the continuum. We find that the model gives rise to
behaviour that is characteristic of dense granular fluids. In particular, it
leads to plug flow. We analyse the nucleation mechanism of plugs and their
development. We find that plug boundaries generically expand and we calculate
the growth rate of plug regions. In systems whose internal effective friction
coefficient is relatively uniform we find that the linear size of plug regions
grows as (time)$^{1/3}$. The suitability of the model to granular materials is
discussed.
