A cellular automaton named Rule 184++C is proposed as a meta-model to
investigate the flow of various complex particles. In this model, unlike the
granular pipe flow and the traffic flow, not only the free-jam phase transition
but also the free-intermediate, the intermediate-jam, and the dilute-dense
phase transitions appear. Moreover, the freezing phenomena appear if the system
contains two types of different particles.
