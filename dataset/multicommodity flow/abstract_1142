We present multi-frequency VLA observations of the radio galaxy PKS 1246-410
at the center of the Centaurus Cluster, and compare these results to recent
Chandra observations. The unusual radio morphology of PKS 1246-410 probably
results from interactions with the hot, X-ray emitting gas. This gas, along
with cluster magnetic fields, also produces substantial Faraday Rotation
Measures towards PKS 1246-410. We discuss these observations in the context of
a sample of 14 luminous X-ray clusters with embedded radio galaxies and
possible cooling flows. A correlation is found between the cooling flow rate
and the maximum Faraday Rotation Measures. Magnetic fields of strength 10-40 uG
are found to be common to the centers of clusters with strong cooling flows,
and somewhat lower field strengths of 2-10 uG are found in the non cooling-flow
clusters.
