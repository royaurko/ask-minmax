Normal geodesic flows flows of Carnot-Caratheodory are discussed from the
point of view of the theory of Hamiltonian systems. The geodesic flows
corresponding to left-invariant metrics and left- and -right-invariant rank 2
distributions on the three-dimensional Heisenberg group are analysed as
integrable systems. The flows corresponding to left-invariant metrics and
left-invariant distributions on Lie groups are reduced to Euler equations on
Lie groups. Relation of these constructions to problems of analytical mechanics
is discussed.
