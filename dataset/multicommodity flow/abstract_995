We present a comprehensive study of the slip and flow of concentrated
colloidal suspensions using cone-plate rheometry and simultaneous confocal
imaging. In the colloidal glass regime, for smooth, non-stick walls, the solid
nature of the suspension causes a transition in the rheology from
Herschel-Bulkley (HB) bulk flow behavior at large stress to a Bingham-like slip
behavior at low stress, which is suppressed for sufficient colloid-wall
attraction or colloid-scale wall roughness. Visualization shows how the
slip-shear transition depends on gap size and the boundary conditions at both
walls and that partial slip persist well above the yield stress. A
phenomenological model, incorporating the Bingham slip law and HB bulk flow,
fully accounts for the behavior. Microscopically, the Bingham law is related to
a thin (sub-colloidal) lubrication layer at the wall, giving rise to a
characteristic dependence of slip parameters on particle size and
concentration. We relate this to the suspension's osmotic pressure and yield
stress and also analyze the influence of van der Waals interaction. For the
largest concentrations, we observe non-uniform flow around the yield stress, in
line with recent work on bulk shear-banding of concentrated pastes. We also
describe residual slip in concentrated liquid suspensions, where the vanishing
yield stress causes coexistence of (weak) slip and bulk shear flow for all
measured rates.
