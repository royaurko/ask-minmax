We examine the efficacy of streamwise traveling waves generated by a
zero-net-mass-flux surface blowing and suction for controlling the onset of
turbulence in a channel flow. For small amplitude actuation, we utilize weakly
nonlinear analysis to determine base flow modifications and to assess the
resulting net power balance. Receptivity analysis of the velocity fluctuations
around this base flow is then employed to design the traveling waves. Our
simulation-free approach reveals that, relative to the flow with no control,
the downstream traveling waves with properly designed speed and frequency can
significantly reduce receptivity which makes them well-suited for controlling
the onset of turbulence. In contrast, the velocity fluctuations around the
upstream traveling waves exhibit larger receptivity to disturbances. Our
theoretical predictions, obtained by perturbation analysis (in the wave
amplitude) of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations with spatially periodic
coefficients, are verified using full-scale simulations of the nonlinear flow
dynamics in companion paper, Lieu, Moarref & Jovanovi\'c (2010).
