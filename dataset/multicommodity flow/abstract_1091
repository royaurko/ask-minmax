The Lagrangian complex-space singularities of the steady Eulerian flow with
stream function $\sin x_1 \cos x_2$ are studied by numerical and analytical
methods. The Lagrangian singular manifold is analytic. Its minimum distance
from the real domain decreases logarithmically at short times and exponentially
at large times.
