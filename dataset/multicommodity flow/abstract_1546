We present simulations of the dynamic critical state for a 2D superconductor
with strong pinning centers, corresponding to a matching field twice the
applied magnetic field. The sharp crossover between the plastic regime, at low
current density and temperature, and the fluid flow regime for flux motion is
characterized by the activation energy for flux motion and the transverse
diffusion of the vortices trajectory.
