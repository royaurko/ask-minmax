We add thermal noise consistently to reduced models of undeformable vesicles
and capsules in shear flow and derive analytically the corresponding stochastic
equations of motion. We calculate the steady-state probability distribution
function and construct the corresponding phase diagrams for the different
dynamical regimes. For fluid vesicles, we predict that at small shear rates
thermal fluctuations induce a tumbling motion for any viscosity contrast. For
elastic capsules, due to thermal mixing, an intermittent regime appears in
regions where deterministic models predict only pure tank treading or tumbling.
