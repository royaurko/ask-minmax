The Parker model for coronal heating is investigated through a high
resolution simulation. An inertial range is resolved where fluctuating magnetic
energy E_M (k_perp) \propto k_\perp^{-2.7} exceeds kinetic energy E_K (k_\perp)
\propto k_\perp^{-0.6}. Increments scale as \delta b_\ell \simeq \ell^{-0.85}
and \delta u_\ell \simeq \ell^{+0.2} with velocity increasing at small scales,
indicating that magnetic reconnection plays a prime role in this turbulent
system. We show that spectral energy transport is akin to standard
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence even for a system of reconnecting current
sheets sustained by the boundary. In this new MHD turbulent cascade, kinetic
energy flows are negligible while cross-field flows are enhanced, and through a
series of "reflections" between the two fields, cascade more than half of the
total spectral energy flow.
