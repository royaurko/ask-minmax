Using an approach due to Bowen, Franco showed that continuous expansive flows
with specification have unique equilibrium states for potentials with the Bowen
property. We show that this conclusion remains true using weaker non-uniform
versions of specification, expansivity, and the Bowen property. We also
establish a corresponding result for homeomorphisms. In the homeomorphism case,
we obtain the upper bound from the level-2 large deviations principle for the
unique equilibrium state. Forthcoming work will apply these results in
partially hyperbolic and non-uniformly hyperbolic settings.
