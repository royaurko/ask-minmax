We obtain an analytical solution of a one-dimensional sandpile problem in a
thick flow regime, when it can be formulated in terms of linear equations. It
is shown that a space periodicity takes place during the sandpile evolution
even for a sandpile of only one type of particles. Similar periodicity was
observed previo usly for many component sandpiles. Space periods are
proportional to an input flow of particles $r_0$. We find that the surface
angle $\theta$ of the pile reaches it's final critical value ($\theta_f$) from
lower values only at long times. The deviation ($\theta_f - \theta$) behaves as
$(t/r_{0})^{-1/2}$.
