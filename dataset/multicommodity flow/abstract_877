The effects of chaotic advection and diffusion on fast chemical reactions in
two-dimensional fluid flows are investigated using experimentally measured
stretching fields and fluorescent monitoring of the local concentration. Flow
symmetry, Reynolds number, and mean path length affect the spatial distribution
and time dependence of the reaction product. A single parameter \lambda*N,
where \lambda is the mean Lyapunov exponent and N is the number of mixing
cycles, can be used to predict the time-dependent total product for flows
having different dynamical features.
