This paper is devoted to obtain the one-dimensional group invariant solutions
of the two-dimensional Ricci flow ((2D) Rf) equation. By classifying the orbits
of the adjoint representation of the symmetry group on its Lie algebra, the
optimal system of one-dimensional subalgebras of the ((2D) Rf) equation is
obtained. For each class, we will find the reduced equation by the method of
similarity reduction. By solving these reduced equations, we will obtain new
sets of group invariant solutions for the ((2D) Rf) equation.
