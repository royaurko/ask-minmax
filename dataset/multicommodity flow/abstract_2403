The cloud model's dependence on massive parallelism and resource sharing
exacerbates the security challenge of timing side-channels. Timing Information
Flow Control (TIFC) is a novel adaptation of IFC techniques that may offer a
way to reason about, and ultimately control, the flow of sensitive information
through systems via timing channels. With TIFC, objects such as files,
messages, and processes carry not just content labels describing the ownership
of the object's "bits," but also timing labels describing information contained
in timing events affecting the object, such as process creation/termination or
message reception. With two system design tools-deterministic execution and
pacing queues-TIFC enables the construction of "timing-hardened" cloud
infrastructure that permits statistical multiplexing, while aggregating and
rate-limiting timing information leakage between hosted computations.
