Differential transverse flow of protons and pions in central C-Ne and C-Cu
collisions at a beam energy of 3.7 GeV/nucleon was measured as a function of
transverse momentum at the SKM-200-GIBS setup of JINR. In agreement with
predictions of a transversely moving thermal model, the strength of proton
differential transverse flow is found to first increase gradually and then
saturate with the increasing transverse momentum in both systems. While pions
are preferentially emitted in the same direction of the proton transverse flow
in the reaction of C-Ne, they exhibit an anti-flow to the opposote direction of
the proton transverse flow in the reaction of C-Cu due to stronger shadowing
effects of the heavier target in thr whole range of transverse momentum.
