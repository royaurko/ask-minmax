Mean curvature flow evolves isometrically immersed base manifolds $M$ in the
direction of their mean curvatures in an ambient manifold $\bar{M}$. If the
base manifold $M$ is compact, the short time existence and uniqueness of the
mean curvature flow are well-known. For complete isometrically immersed
submanifolds of arbitrary codimensions, the existence and uniqueness are still
unsettled even in the Euclidean space. In this paper, we solve the uniqueness
problem affirmatively for the mean curvature flow of general codimensions and
general ambient manifolds. In the second part of the paper, inspired by the
Ricci flow, we prove a pseudolocality theorem of mean curvature flow. As a
consequence, we obtain a strong uniqueness theorem, which removes the
assumption on the boundedness of the second fundamental form of the solution.
