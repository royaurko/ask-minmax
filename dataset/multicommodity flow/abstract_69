We compute f-mode sensitivity kernels for flows. Using a two-dimensional
model, the scattered wavefield is calculated in the first Born approximation.
We test the correctness of the kernels by comparing an exact solution (constant
flow), a solution linearized in the flow, and the total integral of the kernel.
In practice, the linear approximation is acceptable for flows as large as about
400 m/s.
