Immersed boundary methods for computing confined fluid and plasma flows in
complex geometries are reviewed. The mathematical principle of the volume
penalization technique is described and simple examples for imposing Dirichlet
and Neumann boundary conditions in one dimension are given. Applications for
fluid and plasma turbulence in two and three space dimensions illustrate the
applicability and the efficiency of the method in computing flows in complex
geometries, for example in toroidal geometries with asymmetric poloidal
cross-sections.
