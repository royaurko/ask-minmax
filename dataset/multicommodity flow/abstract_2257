We use perfect-fluid hydrodynamical model to predict the elliptic flow
coefficients in Pb + Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The
initial state for the hydrodynamical calculation for central $A + A$ collisions
is obtained from the perturbative QCD + saturation (EKRT) model. The centrality
dependence of the initial state is modeled by the optical Glauber model. We
show that the baseline results obtained from the framework are in good
agreement with the data from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), and
show predictions for the $p_T$ spectra and elliptic flow of pions in Pb + Pb
collisions at the LHC. Also mass and multiplicity effects are discussed.
