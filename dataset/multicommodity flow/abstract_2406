We investigate the conditional vorticity budget of fully developed
three-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence with respect to coherent and
incoherent flow contributions. The Coherent Vorticity Extraction based on
orthogonal wavelets allows to decompose the vorticity field into coherent and
incoherent contributions, of which the latter are noise-like. The impact of the
vortex structures observed in fully developed turbulence on statistical balance
equations is quantified considering the conditional vorticity budget. The
connection between the basic structures present in the flow and their
statistical implications is thereby assessed. The results are compared to those
obtained for large- and small-scale contributions using a Fourier
decomposition, which reveals pronounced differences.
