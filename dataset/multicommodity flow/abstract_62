We develop a general approach to study geometric flows on homogeneous spaces.
Our main tool will be a dynamical system defined on the variety of Lie algebras
called the bracket flow, which coincides with the original geometric flow after
a natural change of variables. The advantage of using this method relies on the
fact that the possible pointed (or Cheeger-Gromov) limits of solutions, as well
as self-similar solutions or soliton structures, can be much better visualized.
The approach has already been worked out in the Ricci flow case and for general
curvature flows of almost-hermitian structures on Lie groups. This paper is
intended as an attempt to motivate the use of the method on homogeneous spaces
for any flow of geometric structures under minimal natural assumptions. As a
novel application, we find a closed G2-structure on a nilpotent Lie group which
is an expanding soliton for the Laplacian flow and is not an eigenvector.
