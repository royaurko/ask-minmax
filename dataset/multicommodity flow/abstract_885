Using mode-coupling theory, we derive a constitutive equation for the
nonlinear rheology of dense colloidal suspensions under arbitrary
time-dependent homogeneous flow. Generalizing previous results for simple
shear, this allows the full tensorial structure of the theory to be identified.
Macroscopic deformation measures, such as the Cauchy-Green tensors, thereby
emerge. So does a direct relation between the stress and the distorted
microstructure, illuminating the interplay of slow structural relaxation and
arbitrary imposed flow. We present flow curves for steady planar and uniaxial
elongation and compare these to simple shear. The resulting non-linear Trouton
ratios point to a tensorially nontrivial dynamic yield condition for colloidal
glasses.
