The analysis of multiwavelength properties of propagating disturbances (PDs)
using Hinode/EIS observations is presented. Quasi-periodic PDs were mostly
interpreted as slow magnetoacoustic waves in early studies, but recently
suggested to be intermittent upflows of the order of 50-150 km/s based on the
Red-Blue (RB) asymmetry analysis of spectral line profiles. Using the forward
models, velocities of the secondary component derived from the RB analysis are
found significantly overestimated due to the saturation effect when its offset
velocities are smaller than the Gaussian width. We developed a different method
to examine spectral features of the PDs. This method is assuming that the
excessive emission of the PD profile against the background (taken as that
prior to the PD) is caused by a hypothetic upflow. The derived LOS velocities
of the flow are on the order of 10-30 km/s from the warm (1-1.5 MK) coronal
lines, much smaller than those inferred from the RB analysis. This result does
not support the flow interpretation but favors of the early wave
interpretation.
