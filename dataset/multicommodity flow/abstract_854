We introduce density dependence of the cell size in cellular-automaton models
for traffic flow, which allows a more precise correspondence between real-world
phenomena and what observed in simulation. Also, we give an explicit
calibration of the particle density particularly for the asymmetric simple
exclusion process with some update rules. We thus find that the present method
is valid in that it reproduces a realistic flow-density diagram.
