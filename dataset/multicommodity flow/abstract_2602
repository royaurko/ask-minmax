We show that filamentous Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) over the Northern Atlantic
Ocean are closely linked to attracting Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) in
the large scale wind field. LCSs represent lines of attraction in the evolving
flow with a significant impact on all passive tracers. Using Finite-Time
Lyapunov Exponents (FTLE), we extract LCSs from a two-dimensional flow derived
from water vapor flux of atmospheric reanalysis data and compare them to the
three-dimensional LCS obtained from the wind flow. We correlate the typical
filamentous water vapor patterns of ARs with LCSs and find that LCSs bound the
filaments on the back side. Passive advective transport of water vapor from
tropical latitudes is potentially possible.
