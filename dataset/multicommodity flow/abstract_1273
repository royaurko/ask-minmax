Probing the fluid dynamics of thin films is an excellent tool to study the
solid/liquid boundary condition. There is no need for external stimulation or
pumping of the liquid due to the fact that the dewetting process, an internal
mechanism, acts as a driving force for liquid flow. Viscous dissipation within
the liquid and slippage balance interfacial forces. Thereby, friction at the
solid/liquid interface plays a key role towards the flow dynamics of the
liquid. Probing the temporal and spatial evolution of growing holes or
retracting straight fronts gives, in combination with theoretical models,
information of the liquid flow field and especially the boundary condition at
the interface. We review the basic models and experimental results obtained
during the last years with exclusive regard to polymers as ideal model liquids
for fluid flow. Moreover, concepts that aim on explaining slippage on the
molecular scale are summarized and discussed.
