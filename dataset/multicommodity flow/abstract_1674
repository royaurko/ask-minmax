The balanced vehicular traffic model is a macroscopic model for vehicular
traffic flow. We use this model to study the traffic dynamics at highway
bottlenecks either caused by the restriction of the number of lanes or by
on-ramps or off-ramps. The coupling conditions for the Riemann problem of the
system are applied in order to treat the interface between different road
sections consistently. Our numerical simulations show the appearance of
synchronized flow at highway bottlenecks.
