The physical nature of compressible turbulence is of fundamental importance
in a variety of astrophysical settings. We present the first direct evidence
that mean kinetic energy cascades conservatively beyond a transitional
"conversion" scale-range despite not being an invariant of the compressible
flow dynamics. We use high-resolution three-dimensional simulations of
compressible hydrodynamic turbulence on $512^3$ and $1024^3$ grids. We probe
regimes of forced steady-state isothermal flows and of unforced decaying ideal
gas flows. The key quantity we measure is pressure dilatation cospectrum,
$E^{PD}(k)$, where we provide the first numerical evidence that it decays at a
rate faster than $k^{-1}$ as a function of wavenumber. This is sufficient to
imply that mean pressure dilatation acts primarily at large-scales and that
kinetic and internal energy budgets statistically decouple beyond a
transitional scale-range. Our results suggest that an extension of Kolmogorov's
inertial-range theory to compressible turbulence is possible.
