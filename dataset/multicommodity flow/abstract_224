We introduce and characterize a class of flows, which turn out to be
Gaussian. This characterization allows us to show, using the Monotonicity
inequality, that the transpose of the flow, for an extended class of initial
conditions, is the unique solution of the SPDE introduced in Rajeev and
Thangavelu (2008).
