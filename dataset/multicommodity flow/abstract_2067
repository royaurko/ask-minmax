We propose two sets of initial conditions for magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in
which both the velocity and the magnetic fields have spatial symmetries that
are preserved by the dynamical equations as the system evolves. When
implemented numerically they allow for substantial savings in CPU time and
memory storage requirements for a given resolved scale separation. Basic
properties of these Taylor-Green flows generalized to MHD are given, and the
ideal non-dissipative case is studied up to the equivalent of 2048^3 grid
points for one of these flows. The temporal evolution of the logarithmic
decrements, delta, of the energy spectrum remains exponential at the highest
spatial resolution considered, for which an acceleration is observed briefly
before the grid resolution is reached. Up to the end of the exponential decay
of delta, the behavior is consistent with a regular flow with no appearance of
a singularity. The subsequent short acceleration in the formation of small
magnetic scales can be associated with a near collision of two current sheets
driven together by magnetic pressure. It leads to strong gradients with a fast
rotation of the direction of the magnetic field, a feature also observed in the
solar wind.
