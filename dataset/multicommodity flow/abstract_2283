A direct Biot-Savart integration is used to decompose the strain rate into
its local and nonlocal constituents, allowing the vorticity alignment with the
local and nonlocal strain rate eigenvectors to be investigated. These strain
rate tensor constituents are evaluated in a turbulent flow using data from
highly-resolved direct numerical simulations. While the vorticity aligns
preferentially with the intermediate eigenvector of the \textit{combined}
strain rate, as has been observed previously, the present results for the first
time clearly show that the vorticity aligns with the most extensional
eigenvector of the \textit{nonlocal} strain rate. This in turn reveals a
significant linear contribution to the vortex stretching dynamics in turbulent
flows.
