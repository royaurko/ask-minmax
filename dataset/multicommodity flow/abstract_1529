We analyze the reactions $A+A \to \emptyset$ and $A + B \to \emptyset$
occurring in a model of turbulent flow in two dimensions. We find the reactant
concentrations at long times, using a field-theoretic renormalization group
analysis. We find a variety of interesting behavior, including, in the presence
of potential disorder, decay rates faster than that for well-mixed reactions.
