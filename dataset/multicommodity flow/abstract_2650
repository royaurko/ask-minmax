The elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = $ 11.5, 39, and 200 GeV
and triangular flow ($v_{3}$) at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = $ 200 GeV of identified
particles ($\pi^{\pm}, K^{\pm}, K^{0}_{S}, p, \bar{p}, \phi, \Lambda$ and
$\bar{\Lambda}$) from 0\%--80\% central Au+Au collisions are analyzed using a
multiphase transport (AMPT) model. It is shown that the experimental results
from the $\eta$-sub event plane method can be reproduced with a parton
scattering cross section between 1.5 and 3 mb. We also studied the differential
and integrated $v_{2}/v_{3}$ ratios and conclude that they are anti-corrected
with the parton scattering cross section.
