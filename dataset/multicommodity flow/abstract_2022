In this short paper, periodic homogenization of a steady heat flow in
two-component media with highly adhesive contact is performed via the two-scale
convergence technique. Our micro-model is based on mass conservation for the
heat flow in each phase with interfacial contact of adhesive type between these
constituents. It is shown that the macroscopic model is a single phase elliptic
equation.
