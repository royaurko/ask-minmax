We report the first experimental observation of stationary zonal flows in the
pedestal region of the H-mode plasma in the H-1 toroidal heliac. Strong peaks
in E_r shear mark the top and foot of the density pedestal. Strong m=n=0
low-frequency (f < 0.6 kHz) zonal flows are observed in regions of increased
E_r, suggesting substantial contribution of zonal flows to the spatial
modulation of E_r radial profiles. Radial localization of zonal flows is
correlated with a region of zero magnetic shear and low-order (7/5) rational
surfaces.
