The results on elliptic flow in sqrt(s)=2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) reported by the ALICE collaboration are remarkably
similar to those for sqrt(s)=200 GeV gold-gold collisions at the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). This result is surprising, given the expected longer
lifetime of the system at the higher collision energies. We show that it is
nevertheless consistent with 3+1 dimensional viscous event-by-event
hydrodynamic calculations, and demonstrate that elliptic flow at both RHIC and
LHC is built up mostly within the first 5 fm/c of the evolution. We conclude
that an "almost perfect liquid" is produced in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC.
Furthermore, we present predictions for triangular flow as a function of
transverse momentum for different centralities.
