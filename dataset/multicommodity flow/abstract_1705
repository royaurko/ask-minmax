Particle-particle and particle-wall collisions occur in many natural and
industrial applications such as sedimentation, agglomeration, and granular
flows. To accurately predict the behavior of particulate flows, fundamental
knowledge of the mechanisms of a single collision is required. In this fluid
dynamics video, particle-wall collisions onto a wall coated with 1.5%
poly(ethylene-oxide) (PEO) (viscoelastic liquid) and 80% Glycerol and water
(Newtonian liquid) are shown.
