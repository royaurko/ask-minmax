Let $Y$ be a topological Markov chain with finite leading and follower sets.
Special flow over $Y$ whose height function depends on the time zero of
elements of $Y$ is constructed. Then a formula for computing the entropy of
this flow will be given. As an application, we give a lower estimate for the
entropy of a class of geodesic flows on the modular surface. We also give
sufficient conditions to guarantee the existence of a measure with maximal
entropy.
