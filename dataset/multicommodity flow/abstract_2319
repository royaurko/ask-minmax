A new multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann scheme for compressible
flows with arbitrary specific heat ratio and Prandtl number is presented. In
the new scheme, which is based on a two-dimensional 16-discrete-velocity model,
the moment space and the corresponding transformation matrix are constructed
according to the seven-moment relations associated with the local equilibrium
distribution function. In the continuum limit, the model recovers the
compressible Navier-Stokes equations with flexible specific-heat ratio and
Prandtl number. Numerical experiments show that compressible flows with strong
shocks can be simulated by the present model up to Mach numbers $Ma \sim 5$.
