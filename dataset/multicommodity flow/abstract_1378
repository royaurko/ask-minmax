Recently, J. Streets and G. Tian introduced a natural way to evolve an
almost-K\"ahler manifold called the symplectic curvature flow, in which the
metric, the symplectic structure and the almost-complex structure are all
evolving. We study in this paper different aspects of the flow on locally
homogeneous manifolds, including long-time existence, solitons, regularity and
convergence. We develop in detail two classes of Lie groups, which are
relatively simple from a structural point of view but yet geometrically rich
and exotic: solvable Lie groups with a codimension one abelian normal subgroup
and a construction attached to each left symmetric algebra. As an application,
we exhibit a soliton structure on most of symplectic surfaces which are Lie
groups. A family of ancient solutions which develop a finite time singularity
was found; neither their Chern scalar nor their scalar curvature are monotone
along the flow and they converge in the pointed sense to a (non-K\"ahler)
shrinking soliton solution on the same Lie group.
