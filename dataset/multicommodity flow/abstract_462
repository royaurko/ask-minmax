In this survey article, we discuss some topics on self-similar solutions to
the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow. Self-similar solutions to the Ricci
flow are known as Ricci solitons. In the first part of this paper we discuss a
lower diameter bound for compact manifolds with shrinking Ricci solitons. Such
a bound can be obtained from an eigenvalue estimate for a twisted Laplacian,
called the Witten-Laplacian. In the second part we discuss self-similar
solutions to the mean curvature flow on cone manifolds. Many results have been
obtained for solutions in $\bfR^n$ or $\bfC^n$. We see that many of them extend
to cone manifolds, and in particular results on $\bfC^n$ for special
Lagrangians and self-shrinkers can be extended to toric Calabi-Yau cones. We
also see that a similar lower diameter bound can be obtained for self-shrinkers
to the mean curvature flow as in the case of shrinking Ricci solitons.
