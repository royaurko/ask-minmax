We continue the work of Lopes Filho, Mazzucato and Nussenzveig Lopes [LMN],
on the vanishing viscosity limit of circularly symmetric viscous flow in a disk
with rotating boundary, shown there to converge to the inviscid limit in
$L^2$-norm as long as the prescribed angular velocity $\alpha(t)$ of the
boundary has bounded total variation. Here we establish convergence in stronger
$L^2$ and $L^p$-Sobolev spaces, allow for more singular angular velocities
$\alpha$, and address the issue of analyzing the behavior of the boundary
layer. This includes an analysis of concentration of vorticity in the vanishing
viscosity limit. We also consider such flows on an annulus, whose two boundary
components rotate independently.
