The transverse momentum technique is used to analyse charged-particle
exclusive data in the central C-Ne and C-Cu interactions at energy of 3.7 Gev
per nucleon. The clear evidence of in-plane and out-of-plane (squeeze-out) flow
effects for protons and $\pi^{-}$ mesons have been obtained. In C-Ne
interactions the $\pi^{-}$ mesons in-plane flow is in the same direction to the
protons, while in C-Cu collisions pions show antiflow behaviour. From the
transverse momentum and azimuthal distributions of protons and pi^{-} mesons
with respect to the reaction plane the flow F (the measure of the amount of
collective transverse momentum transfer in the reaction plane) and the
parameter a_{2} (the measure of the strength of the anisotropic emission) have
been extracted. The flow effects increase with the mass of the particle and
atomic number of target A_{T}. The comparison of our in-plane flow results with
flow data of various projectile/target configurations had been done by a scaled
flow F_{S}=F/(A_{P}^{1/3}+A_{T}^{1/3}). F_{S} demonstrates a common scaling
behaviour among flow values from different systems.
