The plastic flow of a foam results from bubble rearrangements. We study their
occurrence in experiments where a foam is forced to flow in 2D: around an
obstacle; through a narrow hole; or sheared between rotating disks. We describe
their orientation and frequency using a topological matrix defined in the
companion paper (Graner et al., preprint), which links them with continuous
plasticity at large scale. We then suggest a phenomenological equation to
predict the plastic strain rate: its orientation is determined from the foam's
local elastic strain; and its rate is determined from the foam's local
elongation rate. We obtain a good agreement with statistical measurements. This
enables us to describe the foam as a continuous medium with fluid, elastic and
plastic properties. We derive its constitutive equation, then test several of
its terms and predictions.
