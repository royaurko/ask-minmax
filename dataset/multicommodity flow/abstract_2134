We analyze the mixing efficiency of multiple-cylinder in potential flow to
assess the effect of schooling in ocean-biomixing. The model is a
generalization of Thiffeault & Childress's work [Physics Letters A 374, 3487
(2010)], where fluid particle displacements due to a single inviscid swimmer
were analyzed to produce an effective diffusivity. Here we climb the population
ladder to see how the interaction among swimmers would influence the motion of
particles in the flow. Two cylinders moving synchronously through the flow in
various angles and separations were studied, with several important patterns
revealed---when the separation is small (less than $\frac{1}{3}$ body length),
two cylinders moving side-by-side ($\theta=\pi/2$) has the highest mixing
efficiency, while the chasing configuration ($\theta=0$) takes over for larger
separations. But regardless of the angle and separation, the normalized
effective diffusivity is constantly higher than single-swimmer value, which
indicates schooling effect as an important factor in ocean biomixing. In the
detailed trajectory analysis of fluid particles we also observed trajectory
bifurcation and symmetry-breaking of particle drift-length over parameter
space. The effective diffusivity of three and more cylinders in various
configurations were also studied. Our result shall help illuminate the role of
schooling in ocean-biomixing, as well as open a new direction for the debate on
the relative importance of biomxing in ocean circulation.
