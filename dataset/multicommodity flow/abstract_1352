We introduce a nonlinear generalized tensorial Maxwell-type constitutive
equation to describe shear-thinning glass-forming fluids, motivated by a recent
microscopic approach to the nonlinear rheology of colloidal suspensions. The
model captures a nonvanishing dynamical yield stress at the glass transition
and incorporates normal-stress differences. A modified lattice-Boltzmann (LB)
simulation scheme is presented that includes non-Newtonian contributions to the
stress tensor and deals with flow-induced pressure differences. We test this
scheme in pressure-driven 2D Poiseuille flow of the nonlinear generalized
Maxwell fluid. In the steady state, comparison with an analytical solution
shows good agreement. The transient dynamics after startup and cessation of the
pressure gradient are studied; the simulation reproduces a finite stopping time
for the cessation flow of the yield-stress fluid in agreement with previous
analytical estimates.
