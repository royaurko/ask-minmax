Particles with strange quark content produced in the system 1.93 AGeV
$^{58}$Ni on $^{58}$Ni have been investigated at GSI Darmstadt with the FOPI
detector system. The correlation of these produced particles was analyzed with
respect to the reaction plane. Lambda baryons exhibit a very pronounced
sideward flow pattern which is qualitatively similar to the proton flow.
However, the kaon ($K^+$,$K^0_S$) flow patterns are significantly different
from that of the protons, and their form may be useful to restrict theoretical
models on the form of the kaon potential in the nuclear medium.
