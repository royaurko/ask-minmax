This paper investigates whether observations of seismic anisotropy are
compatible with a cubic structure of the inner core Fe alloy. We assume that
anisotropy is the result of plastic deformation within a large scale flow
induced by preferred growth at the inner core equator. Based on elastic moduli
from the literature, bcc- or fcc-Fe produce seismic anisotropy well below
seismic observations ($\textless{}0.4\%$). A Monte-Carlo approach allows us to
generalize this result to any form of elastic anisotropy in a cubic system.
Within our model, inner core global anisotropy is not compatible with a cubic
structure of Fe alloy. Hence, if the inner core material is indeed cubic, large
scale coherent anisotropic structures, incompatible with plastic deformation
induced by large scale flow, must be present.
