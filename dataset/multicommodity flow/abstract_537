We recall the PFS model constructed for the modeling of unsteady mixed flows
in closed water pipes where transition points between the free surface and
pressurized flow are treated as a free boundary associated to a discontinuity
of the gradient of pressure. Then we present a numerical kinetic scheme for the
computations of unsteady mixed flows in closed water pipes. This kinetic method
that we call FKA for "Full Kinetic Approach" is an easy and mathematically
elegant way to deal with multiple transition points when the changes of state
between free surface and pressurized flow occur. We use two approaches namely
the "ghost waves approach" and the "Full Kinetic Approach" to treat these
transition points. We show that this kinetic numerical scheme has the following
properties: it is wet area conservative, under a CFL condition it preserves the
wet area positive, it treats "naturally" the drying and flooding area and most
of all it preserves every stationary flow. Finally numerical experiment versus
laboratory experiment is presented and the scheme produces results that are in
a very good agreement. We also present a numerical experiment when flooding and
drying flows may occur and finally make a numerical study of the order of the
kinetic method.
