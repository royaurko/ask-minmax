In a recent paper, Brendle proved that the inscribed radius of closed
embedded mean convex hypersurfaces moving by mean curvature flow is at least
1/((1+\delta)H) at all points with H > C(\delta,M_0). In this note, we give a
shorter proof of Brendle's estimate, and of a more general result for
alpha-Andrews flows, based on our recent estimates from Haslhofer-Kleiner.
