We use the distances introduced in a previous joint paper to exhibit the
gradient flow structure of some drift-diffusion equations for a wide class of
entropy functionals. Functional inequalities obtained by the comparison of the
entropy with the entropy production functional reflect the contraction
properties of the flow. Our approach provides a unified framework for the study
of the Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck (KFP) equation.
