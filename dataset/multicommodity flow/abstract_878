Numerical simulations of turbulent channel flows, with or without additives,
are limited in the extent of the Reynolds number \Re and Deborah number \De.
The comparison of such simulations to theories of drag reduction, which are
usually derived for asymptotically high \Re and \De, calls for some care. In
this paper we present a study of drag reduction by rodlike polymers in a
turbulent channel flow using direct numerical simulation and illustrate how
these numerical results should be related to the recently developed theory.
