We establish various criteria, which are known in the incompressible case,
for the validity of the inviscid limit for the compressible Navier-Stokes flows
considered in a general domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with or without a
boundary. In the presence of a boundary, a generalized Navier boundary
condition for velocity is assumed, which in particular by convention includes
the classical no-slip boundary conditions. In this general setting we extend
the Kato criteria and show the convergence to a solution which is dissipative
"up to the boundary". In the case of smooth solutions, the convergence is
obtained in the relative energy norm.
