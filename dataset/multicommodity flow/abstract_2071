The spot model has been developed by Bazant and co-workers to describe
quasistatic granular flows. It assumes that granular flow is caused by the
opposing flow of so-called spots of excess free volume, with spots moving along
the slip lines of Mohr-Coulomb plasticity. The model is two-dimensional and has
been successfully applied to a number of different geometries. In this paper we
investigate whether the spot model in its simplest form can describe the wide
shear zones observed in experiments and simulations of a Couette cell with
split bottom. We give a general argument that is independent of the particular
description of the stresses, but which shows that the present formulation of
the spot model in which diffusion and drift terms are postulated to balance on
length scales of order of the spot diameter, i.e. of order 3-5 grain diameters,
is difficult to reconcile with the observed wide shear zones. We also discuss
the implications for the spot model of co-axiality of the stress and strain
rate tensors found in these wide shear flows, and point to possible extensions
of the model that might allow one to account for the existence of wide shear
zones.
