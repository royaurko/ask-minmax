In order for the widely discussed benefits of flow batteries for
electrochemical energy storage to be applied at large scale, the cost of the
electrochemical stack must come down substantially. One promising avenue for
reducing stack cost is to increase the system power density while maintaining
efficiency, enabling smaller stacks. Here we report on a membrane-less,
hydrogen bromine laminar flow battery as a potential high power density
solution. The membrane-less design enables power densities of 0.795 W cm$^{-2}$
at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, with a round-trip voltage
efficiency of 92\% at 25\% of peak power. Theoretical solutions are also
presented to guide the design of future laminar flow batteries. The high power
density achieved by the hydrogen bromine laminar flow battery, along with the
potential for rechargeable operation, will translate into smaller, inexpensive
systems that could revolutionize the fields of large-scale energy storage and
portable power systems.
