Using the properties of defect lines, we study boundary renormalisation group
flows. We find that when there exists a flow between maximally symmetric
boundary conditions "a" and "b" then there also exists a boundary flow between
"c x a" and "c x b" where "x" denotes the fusion product. We also discuss
applications of this simple observation.
