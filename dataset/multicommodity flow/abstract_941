We report forced radial imbibition of water in a porous medium in a Hele-Shaw
cell. Washburn's law is confirmed in our experiment. Radial imbibition follows
scaling dynamics and shows anomalous roughening dynamics when the front invades
the porous medium. The roughening dynamics depend on the flow rate of the
injected fluid. The growth exponents increase linearly with an increase in the
flow rate while the roughness exponents decrease with an increase in the flow
rate. Roughening dynamics of radial imbibition is markedly different from one
dimensional imbibition with a planar interface window. Such difference caused
by geometric change suggests that "universality class" for the interface growth
is not universal.
