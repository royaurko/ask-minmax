We consider the flow of a Newtonian fluid in a nano or microchannel with
walls that have patterned variations in slip length. We formulate a set of
equations to describe the effects on an incompressible Newtonian flow of small
variations in slip, and solve these equations for slow flows. We test these
equations using molecular dynamics simulations of flow between two walls which
have patterned variations in wettability. Good qualitative agreement and a
reasonable degree of quantitative agreement is found between the theory and the
molecular dynamics simulations. The results of both analyses show that
patterned wettability can be used to induce complex variations in flow. Finally
we discuss the implications of our results for the design of microfluidic
mixers using slip.
