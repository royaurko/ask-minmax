We prove that Ricci flows with almost maximal extinction time must be nearly
round, provided that they have positive isotropic curvature when crossed with
$\mathbb{R}^{2}$. As an application, we show that positively curved metrics on
$S^{3}$ and $RP^{3}$ with almost maximal width must be nearly round.
