The predictive power of mean-field theory is emphasized by comparing theory
with simulations under controlled conditions. The recently developed test-field
method is used to extract turbulent transport coefficients both in kinematic as
well as nonlinear and quasi-kinematic cases. A striking example of the
quasi-kinematic method is provided by magnetic buoyancy-driven flows that
produce an alpha effect and turbulent diffusion.
