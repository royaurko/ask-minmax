Renormalization group flows of quiver gauge theories play a central role in
determining the low-energy properties of string vacua. We demonstrate that
useful predictions about the RG dynamics of a quiver gauge theory may be
extracted from the global structure of its quiver diagram. For quiver theories
of a certain type, we develop an efficient and practical method for determining
which superpotential deformations generate a flow to an interacting conformal
fixed point.
