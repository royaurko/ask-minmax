We consider Reeb flows on the tight $3$-sphere admitting a pair of closed
orbits forming a Hopf link. If the rotation numbers associated to the
transverse linearized dynamics at these orbits fail to satisfy a certain
resonance condition then there exist infinitely many periodic trajectories
distinguished by their linking numbers with the components of the link. This
result admits a natural comparison to the Poincar\'e-Birkhoff theorem on
area-preserving annulus homeomorphisms. An analogous theorem holds on $SO(3)$
and applies to geodesic flows of Finsler metrics on $S^2$.
