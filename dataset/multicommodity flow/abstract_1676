Macroscopic derivation of the entrainment in a supersolid cylinder induced by
a surface elastic wave (of small amplitude) propagating along the flexible
interface is conducted by considering the nonlinear coupling between the
interface and the rarefaction effect. We obtain the critical bounds for
zero-volume-flow-rate states corresponding to specific rarefaction measure and
wave number which is relevant to the rather small critical velocity or
disappearance of supersolid flows reported by Rittner and Reppy.
