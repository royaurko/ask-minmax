Recently the traffic related problems have become strategically important,
due to the continuously increasing vehicle number. As a result, microscopic
simulation software has become an efficient method in traffic engineering for
its cost-effectiveness and safety characteristics. In this paper, a new fuzzy
logic based simulation software (FLOWSIM) is introduced, which can reflect the
mixed traffic flow phenomenon in China better. The fuzzy logic based
car-following model and lane-changing model are explained in detail.
Furthermore, its applications for mixed traffic flow management in mid-size
cities and for signalized intersection management assessment in large cities
are illustrated by examples in China. Finally, further study objectives are
discussed.
