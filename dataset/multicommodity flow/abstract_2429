The Sun is a non-equilibrium dissipative system subjected to an energy flow
which originates in its core. Convective overshooting motions create
temperature and velocity structures which show a temporal and spatial
evolution. As a result, photospheric structures are generally considered to be
the direct manifestation of convective plasma motions. The plasma flows on the
photosphere govern the motion of single magnetic elements. These elements are
arranged in typical patterns which are observed as a variety of multiscale
magnetic patterns. High resolution magnetograms of quiet solar surface revealed
the presence of magnetic underdense regions in the solar photosphere, commonly
called voids, which may be considered a signature of the underlying convective
structure. The analysis of such patterns paves the way for the investigation of
all turbulent convective scales from granular to global. In order to address
the question of magnetic structures driven by turbulent convection at granular
and mesogranular scales we used a "voids" detection method. The computed voids
distribution shows an exponential behavior at scales between 2 and 10 Mm and
the absence of features at 5-10 Mm mesogranular scales. The absence of
preferred scales of organization in the 2-10 Mm range supports the multiscale
nature of flows on the solar surface and the absence of a mesogranular
convective scale.
