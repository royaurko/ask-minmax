A numerical model was established to investigate the lateral mass transfer as
well as the mechanism of bed-inventory overturn inside a pant-leg circulating
fluidized bed (CFB), which are of great importance to maintain safe and
efficient operation of the CFB. Results show that the special flow structure in
which the solid particle volume fraction along the central line of the pant-leg
CFB is relative high enlarges the lateral mass transfer rate and make it more
possible for bed inventory overturn. Although the lateral pressure difference
generated from lateral mass transfer inhibits continuing lateral mass transfer,
providing the pant-leg CFB with self-balancing ability to some extent, the
primary flow rate change due to the outlet pressure change often disable the
self-balancing ability by continually enhancing the flow rate difference. As
the flow rate of the primary air fan is more sensitive to its outlet pressure,
it is easier to lead to bed inventory overturn. While when the solid particle
is easier to change its flow patter to follow the surrounding air flow,the
self-balancing ability is more active.
