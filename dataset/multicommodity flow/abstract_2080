In the steady Couette flow of a granular gas the sign of the heat flux
gradient is governed by the competition between viscous heating and inelastic
cooling. We show from the Boltzmann equation for inelastic Maxwell particles
that a special class of states exists where the viscous heating and the
inelastic cooling exactly compensate each other at every point, resulting in a
uniform heat flux. In this state the (reduced) shear rate is enslaved to the
coefficient of restitution $\alpha$, so that the only free parameter is the
(reduced) thermal gradient $\epsilon$. It turns out that the reduced moments of
order $k$ are polynomials of degree $k-2$ in $\epsilon$, with coefficients that
are nonlinear functions of $\alpha$. In particular, the rheological properties
($k=2$) are independent of $\epsilon$ and coincide exactly with those of the
simple shear flow. The heat flux ($k=3$) is linear in the thermal gradient
(generalized Fourier's law), but with an effective thermal conductivity
differing from the Navier--Stokes one. In addition, a heat flux component
parallel to the flow velocity and normal to the thermal gradient exists. The
theoretical predictions are validated by comparison with direct Monte Carlo
simulations for the same model.
