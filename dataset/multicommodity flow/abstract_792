In this paper, basing on a generalized Newtonian dynamics (GND) approach
which has been proposed elsewhere we present a conjecture for turbulent flow.
We firstly utilize the GND to reasonably unify the two phenomenological methods
recently proposed of the water movement in unsaturated soils. Then in the same
way a modified Euler equation (MEE) is yielded. Under a zero-order
approximation, a simple split solution of the MEE can be obtained that shows
flow fluids would have a velocity field with the power-law scaling feature
(power-law fluid) for the case of high Reynolds number.
