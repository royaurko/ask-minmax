We discuss the Ricci flow on homogeneous 4-manifolds. After classifying these
manifolds, we note that there are families of initial metrics such that we can
diagonalize them and the Ricci flow preserves the diagonalization. We analyze
the long time behavior of these families. We find that if a solution exists for
all time, then the flow exhibits a type III singularity in the sense of
Hamilton.
