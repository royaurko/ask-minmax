We discuss a possible theoretical interpretation of the self scaling property
of turbulent flows (Extended Self Similarity). Our interpretation predicts
that, even in cases when ESS is not observed, a generalized self scaling, must
be observed. This prediction is checked on a number of laboratory experiments
and direct numerical simulations.
