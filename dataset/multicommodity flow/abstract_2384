Sunspot fine structure has been modeled in the past by a combination of
idealized magneto-convection simulations and simplified models that prescribe
the magnetic field and flow structure to a large degree. Advancement in
numerical methods and computing power has enabled recently 3D radiative MHD
simulations of entire sunspots with sufficient resolution to address details of
umbral dots and penumbral filaments. After a brief review of recent
developments we focus on the magneto-convective processes responsible for the
complicated magnetic structure of the penumbra and the mechanisms leading to
the driving of strong horizontal outflows in the penumbra (Evershed effect).
The bulk of energy and mass is transported on scales smaller than the radial
extent of the penumbra. Strong horizontal outflows in the sunspot penumbra
result from a redistribution of kinetic energy preferring flows along the
filaments. This redistribution is facilitated primarily through the Lorentz
force, while horizontal pressure gradients play only a minor role. The Evershed
flow is strongly magnetized: While we see a strong reduction of the vertical
field, the horizontal field component is enhanced within filaments.
