We study curvature flows in the locally homogeneous case (e.g. compact
quotients of Lie groups, solvmanifolds, nilmanifolds) in a unified way, by
considering a generic flow under just a few natural conditions on the broad
class of almost-hermitian structures. As a main tool, we use an ODE system
defined on the variety of 2n-dimensional Lie algebras, called the bracket flow,
whose solutions differ from those to the original curvature flow by only
pull-back by time-dependent diffeomorphisms. The approach, which has already
been used to study the Ricci flow on homogeneous manifolds, is useful to better
visualize the possible pointed limits of solutions, under diverse rescalings,
as well as to address regularity issues. Immortal, ancient and self-similar
solutions arise naturally from the qualitative analysis of the bracket flow.
The Chern-Ricci flow and the symplectic curvature flow are considered in more
detail.
