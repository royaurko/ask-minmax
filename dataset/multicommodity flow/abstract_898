This paper presents our proposal for the evolution of the metamodel for the
Task Algebra in the Task Flow model for the Discovery Method. The original Task
Algebra is based on simple and compound tasks structured using operators such
as sequence, selection, and parallel composition. Recursion and encapsulation
were also considered. We propose additional characteristics to improve the
capabilities of the metamodel to represent accurately the Task Flow Model.
