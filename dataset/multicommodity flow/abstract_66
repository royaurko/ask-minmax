Below the scale of supergranules we find that cellular flows are present in
the solar photosphere at two distinct size scales, approximately 2 Mm and 4 Mm,
with distinct characteristic times. Simultaneously present in the flow is a
non-cellular component, with turbulent scaling properties and containing 30% of
the flow energy. These results are obtained by means of wavelet spectral
analysis and modeling of vertical photospheric motions in a 2-hour sequence of
120 SOHO/MDI, high resolution, Doppler images near disk center. The wavelets
permit detection of specific local flow patterns corresponding to convection
cells.
