We consider the so-called inverse $F$-curvature flow (IFCF) $\dot x =
-F^{-1}\nu$ in ARW spaces, i.e. in Lorentzian manifolds with a special future
singularity. Here, $F$ denotes a curvature function of class $(K^*)$, which is
homogenous of degree one, e.g. the $n$-th root of the Gaussian curvature, and
$\nu$ the past directed normal. We prove existence of the IFCF for all times
and convergence of the rescaled scalar solution in $C^{\infty}(S_0)$ to a
smooth function. Using the rescaled IFCF we maintain a transition from big
crunch to big bang into a mirrored spacetime.
