In this paper, we prove that the $L^4$-norm of Ricci curvature is uniformly
bounded along a K\"ahler-Ricci flow on any minimal algebraic manifold. As an
application, we show that on any minimal algebraic manifold $M$ of general type
and with dimension $n\le 3$, any solution of the normalized K\"ahler-Ricci flow
converges to the unique singular K\"ahler-Einstein metric on the canonical
model of $M$ in the Cheeger-Gromov topology.
