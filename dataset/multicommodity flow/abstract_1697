We discuss the nonlinear rheology of dense colloidal dispersions at the glass
transition. A first principles approach starting with interacting Brownian
particles in given arbitrary homogeneous (incompressible) flow neglecting
hydrodynamic interactions is sketched. It e.g. explains steady state flow
curves for finite shear rates measured in dense suspensions of thermosensitive
core-shell particles consisting of a polystyrene core and a crosslinked
poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)(PNIPAM) shell. The exponents of simple and
generalized Herschel Bulkley laws are computed for hard spheres.
