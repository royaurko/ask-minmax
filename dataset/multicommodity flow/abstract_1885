We discuss the results of modelling of young magnetized stars, where matter
flow is calculated using the three-dimensional (3D) magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD)
"Cubed Sphere" code, and the spectra are calculated using the 3D Monte Carlo
radiative transfer code "TORUS". Two examples of modelling are shown: (1)
accretion onto stars in stable and unstable regimes, and (2) accretion to a
young star V2129 Oph, modelled with realistic parameters.
