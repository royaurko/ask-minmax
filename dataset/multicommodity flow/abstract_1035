We show an explicit relation between an RG flow of a two-dimensional gravity
and an on-shell tachyon condensation in the corresponding string theory, in the
case when the string theory is supercritical. The shape of the tachyon
potential in this case can, in principle, be obtained by examining various RG
flows. We also argue that the shape of tachyon potential for a (sub)critical
string can be obtained by analyzing a supercritical string which is obtained
from the (sub)critical string.
