We present 850-um observations with the SCUBA submillimetre (sub-mm) camera
of the central galaxies in seven concentrated clusters of galaxies at redshifts
between 0.19 and 0.41. We detect sub-mm emission from the central galaxies in
the rich clusters A1835 and A2390, and present upper limits for the central
galaxies in the remaining five clusters. The two galaxies which we detect both
exhibit unusually blue UV-optical colours and lie in clusters which contain
massive cooling flows, >1000 Mo/yr. Moreover, both galaxies host relatively
strong radio sources. Focusing on these two systems, we present new and
archival radio-optical observations to provide a detailed view of their
spectral energy distributions. Our analysis indicates that sub-mm emission from
the central galaxy of A1835 can be best understood as arising from dust, heated
either by vigorous star formation or an obscured active galactic nucleus. For
the central galaxy of A2390, the sub-mm flux is marginally consistent with an
extrapolation of the centimetre-millimetre emission from the luminous radio
source that lies in its core; although we cannot rule out an excess flux
density from dust emission comparable to that seen in A1835. We present details
of our multi-wavelength observations and discuss the implications of these data
for the interpretation of star formation in cooling-flow galaxies.
