The Okubo [2]-Weiss [3] criterion is recast by using the 2D hydrodynamic
Beltrami condition (Shivamoggi et al.[13]) that approximates the slow
flow-variation ansatz imposed in its derivation. This turns out to provide an
interesting interpretation of the Okubo-Weiss criterion very logically in terms
of the topological properties of the underlying vorticity manifold. These
developments are then extended to 2D quasi-geostrophic flows (via the potential
divorticity framework), magnetohydrodynamic flows and electron
magnetohydrodynamic flows (via the generalized magnetic flux framework) and the
Okubo-Weiss criteria for these cases are considered.
