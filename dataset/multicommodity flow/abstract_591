We identify a class of perturbatively computable measures of interjet energy
flow, which can be associated with well-defined color flow at short distances.
As an illustration, we calculate correlations between event shapes and the flow
of energy, Q_Omega, into an interjet angular region, Omega, in high-energy
two-jet e^+e^- -annihilation events. Laplace transforms with respect to the
event shapes suppress states with radiation at intermediate energy scales, so
that we may compute systematically logarithms of interjet energy flow. This
method provides a set of predictions on energy radiated between jets, as a
function of event shape and of the choice of the region Omega in which the
energy is measured. Non-global logarithms appear as corrections. We apply our
method to a continuous class of event shapes.
