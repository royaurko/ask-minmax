Event shape analysis has been used to look for DCC signals in simulated
ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collision data at SPS energy. A simple
redistribution of particles, with two detectors to detect charged particles and
photons, is seen to result in the same flow direction with the flow angle
difference peaking at zero. However, events where the neutral pion fraction has
been modified according to the DCC probability distribution, show the flow
angles in two detectors to be almost $90^o$ apart. The results presented here
show that the technique is complementary to the one based on the discrete
wavelet transformation. Together the techniques are seen to provide a very
powerful tool for DCC search in ultra relativistic heavy ion collision.
