We consider the transition of the Nagel-Schreckenberg traffic flow model from
the free flow regime to the jammed regime. We examine the inhomogeneous
character of the system by introducing a new method of analysis which is based
on the local density distribution. We investigated the characteristic
fluctuations in the steady state and present the phase diagram of the system.
