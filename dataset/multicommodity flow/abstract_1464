We have investigated the effects of permeable walls, modeled by linear
acoustic impedance with zero reactance, on compressible channel flow via linear
stability analysis (LSA). Base flow profiles are taken from impermeable
isothermal-wall laminar and turbulent channel flow simulations at bulk Reynolds
number, $Re_b$= 6900 and Mach numbers, $M_b$ = 0.2, 0.5, 0.85. For a
sufficiently high value of permeability, two dominant modes are excited: a bulk
pressure mode, causing symmetric expulsion and suction of mass from the porous
walls (Mode 0); a standing-wave-like mode, with a pressure node at the
centerline (Mode 1). In the case of turbulent mean flow profiles, both modes
generate additional Reynolds shear stresses augmenting the (base) turbulent
ones, but concentrated in the viscous sublayer region; the trajectories of the
two modes in the complex phase velocity space follow each other very closely
for values of wall permeability spanning two orders of magnitude, suggesting
their coexistence. The transition from subcritical to supercritical
permeability does not alter significantly the structure of the two modes for
the range of wavenumbers investigated, suggesting that wall permeability simply
accentuates pre-existing otherwise stable modes. Results from the present
investigation will inform the design of new control strategies for compressible
turbulent boundary layers based on more general impedance boundary conditions
and high-fidelity numerical simulation.
