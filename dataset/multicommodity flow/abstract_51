In general, before separating from a boundary, the flow moves toward reverse
direction near the boundary against the laminar flow direction. Here in this
paper, a clue to such reverse flow phenomena (in the mathematical sense) is
observed. More precisely, the non-stationary two-dimensional Navier-Stokes
equation with an initial datum having a parallel laminar flow (we define it
rigorously in the paper) is considered. We show that the direction of the
material differentiation is opposite to the initial flow direction and effect
of the material differentiation (inducing the reverse flow) becomes bigger when
the curvature of the boundary becomes bigger. We also show that the parallel
laminar flow cannot be a stationary Navier-Stokes flow near a portion of the
boundary with nonzero curvature.
