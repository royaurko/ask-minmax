The spectral flow in the supersymmetric {\it t-J} model with $1/r^2$
interaction is studied by analyzing the exact spectrum with twisted boundary
conditions. The spectral flows for the charge and spin sectors are shown to
nicely fit in with the motif picture in the asymptotic Bethe ansatz. Although
fractional exclusion statistics for the spin sector clearly shows up in the
period of the spectral flow at half filling, such a property is generally
hidden once any number of holes are doped, because the commensurability
condition in the motif is not met in the metallic phase.
