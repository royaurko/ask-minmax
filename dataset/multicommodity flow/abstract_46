We study a class of fourth order curvature flows on a compact Riemannian
manifold, which includes the gradient flows of a number of quadratic geometric
functionals, as for instance the L2 norm of the curvature. Such flows can
develop a special kind of singularities, that could not appear in the Ricci
flow, namely singularities where the manifold collapses with bounded curvature.
We show that this phenomenon cannot occur if we assume a uniform positive lower
bound on the Yamabe invariant. In particular, for a number of gradient flows in
dimension four, such a lower bound exists if we assume a bound on the initial
energy. This implies that these flows can only develop singularities where the
curvature blows up, and that blowing-up sequences converge (up to a
subsequence) to a "singularity model", namely a complete Bach-flat, scalar-flat
manifold. We prove a rigidity result for those model manifolds and show that if
the initial energy is smaller than an explicit bound, then no singularity can
occur. Under those assumptions, the flow exists for all time, and converges up
to a subsequence to the sphere or the real projective space. This gives an
alternative proof, under a slightly stronger assumption, of a result from
Chang, Gursky and Yang asserting that integral pinched 4-manifolds with
positive Yamabe constant are space forms.
