In this paper we introduce a geometric quantity, the $r$-multiplicity, that
controls the length of a smooth curve as it evolves by curve shortening flow.
The length estimates we obtain are used to prove results about the level set
flow in the plane. If $K$ is locally-connected, connected and compact, then the
level set flow of $K$ either vanishes instantly, fattens instantly or instantly
becomes a smooth closed curve. If the compact set in question is a Jordan curve
$J$, then the proof proceeds by using the $r$-multiplicity to show that if
$\gamma_n$ is a sequence of smooth curves converging uniformly to $J$, then the
lengths $\mathscr{L}({\gamma_n}_t)$, where ${\gamma_n}_t$ denotes the result of
applying curve shortening flow to $\gamma_n$ for time t, are uniformly bounded
for each $t>0$. Once the level set flow has been shown to be smooth we prove
that the Cauchy problem for curve shortening flow has a unique solution if the
initial data is a finite length Jordan curve.
