We study the uniqueness of solutions with a transonic shock in a duct in a
class of transonic shock solutions, which are not necessarily small
perturbations of the background solution, for steady potential flow. We prove
that, for given uniform supersonic upstream flow in a straight duct, there
exists a unique uniform pressure at the exit of the duct such that a transonic
shock solution exists in the duct, which is unique modulo translation. For any
other given uniform pressure at the exit, there exists no transonic shock
solution in the duct. This is equivalent to establishing a uniqueness theorem
for a free boundary problem of a partial differential equation of second order
in a bounded or unbounded duct. The proof is based on the maximum/comparison
principle and a judicious choice of special transonic shock solutions as a
comparison solution.
