In the present paper construction of the modified function of Green equation
for internal gravity waves in the stratum of the stratified medium at presence
of constant average flows is considered, properties of the corresponding
spectral problems, the modified eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are
investigated. Usage of the modified function of Green equation can give in some
physically interesting events more friendly representations of the solutions
for the fields of the internal gravity waves, including the wave fields
disturbed by the non-local disturbing bodies.
