First we have assumed the most general static spherically symmetric black
hole metric. The accretion of any general kind of fluid flow around the black
hole have been investigated. The accretion of fluid flow around the modified
Hayward black hole have been analyzed and we then calculated the critical
point, fluid 4 velocity and velocity of sound during accretion process. Also
the nature of the dynamical mass of black hole during accretion of fluid flow
and taking into consideration of Hawking radiation from black hole i.e.,
evaporation of black hole have been analyzed.
