We present the directed flow measurement ($v_1$) from Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrtsNN = 62$ GeV. Over the pseudorapidity range we have studied, which
covers $\eta$ from -1.2 to 1.2 and $2.4 < |\eta| < 4$, the magnitude of $v_1$
for charged particles is found to increase monotonously with pseudorapidity for
all centralities. No ``$v_1$ wiggle'', as predicted by various theoretical
models, is observed at midrapidity. Elliptic flow ($v_2$) from moderate high
$p_t$ particles ($3-6 GeV/c$) at $\sqrtsNN = 200$ GeV is presented as a
function of impact parameter. It is found that models that are based on {\it
jet quenching} alone appear to underpredict $v_2$ at moderate high $p_t$, while
the model that incorporates both, recombination and fragmentation, describes
the data better.
