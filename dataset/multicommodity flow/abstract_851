On the space of positive 3-forms on a seven-manifold, we study a natural
functional whose critical points induce metrics with holonomy contained in
$G_2$. We prove short-time existence and uniqueness for its negative gradient
flow. Furthermore, we show that the flow exists for all times and converges
modulo diffeomorphisms to some critical point for any initial condition
sufficiently $C^\infty$-close to a critical point.
