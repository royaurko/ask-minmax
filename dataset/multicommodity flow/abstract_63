We investigate the possibility that the spatial dependency of stress in
generalized Newtonian flow systems is a function of the applied pressure field
and the conduit geometry but not of the fluid rheology. This possibility is
well established for the case of a one-dimensional flow through simply
connected regions, specifically tubes of circular uniform cross sections and
plane thin slits. If it can also be established for the more general case of
generalized Newtonian flow through non-circular or multiply connected
geometries, such as the two-dimensional flow through conduits of rectangular or
elliptical cross sections or the flow through annular circular pipes, then
analytical or semi-analytical or highly accurate numerical solutions; regarding
stress, rate of strain, velocity profile and volumetric flow rate; for these
geometries can be obtained from the stress function, which can be easily
obtained from the Newtonian case, in combination with the constitutive
rheological relation for the particular non-Newtonian fluid, as done previously
for the case of the one-dimensional flow through simply connected regions.
