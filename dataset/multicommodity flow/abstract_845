We describe an algorithm to enhance and binarize a fingerprint image. The
algorithm is based on accurate determination of orientation flow of the ridges
of the fingerprint image by computing variance of the neighborhood pixels
around a pixel in different directions. We show that an iterative algorithm
which captures the mutual interdependence of orientation flow computation,
enhancement and binarization gives very good results on poor quality images.
