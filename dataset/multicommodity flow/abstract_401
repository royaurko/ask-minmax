We study flow phenomena in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, both in
transverse and radial direction, in comparison to experimental data. The
collective dynamics of the nucleus-nucleus collision is described within a
transport model of the coupled channel BUU type (CBUU). This recently developed
version includes all nucleonic resonances up to 1.95 GeV in mass and mean-field
potentials both of the Skyrme and momentum dependent MDYI type. We find that
heavy resonances play an important role in the description of transverse flow
above 1 AGeV incident energy. For radial flow we analyse reaction times and
equilibration and extract the parameters $T$ and $\beta$ for temperature and
collective flow velocity within different prescriptions. Furthermore, we apply
a coalescence model for fragment production and check the mass dependence of
the flow signals.
