This arXiv article describes the fluid dynamics video on `Bi-disperse
particle-laden flows in the Stokes regime', presented at the 65th Annual
Meeting of the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics in San Diego, CA in November
2012. The video shows three different experiments which aim to investigate the
dynamics of a thin film of silicone oil, laden with glass beads and the effects
of adding a second species of particles to the slurry. The mixture of oil and
particles is allowed to flow down an incline under the action of gravity. The
videos were recorded at the UCLA Applied Math Laboratory.
