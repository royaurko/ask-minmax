Numerical simulations indicate that the filamentation of sunspot penumbrae
and the associated systematic outflow (the Evershed effect) are due to
convectively driven fluid motions constrained by the inclined magnetic field.
We investigate whether these motions, in particular the upflows in the bright
filaments and the downflows at their edges can be reliably observed with
existing instrumentation. We use a snapshot from a sunspot simulation to
calculate 2D maps of synthetic line profiles for the spectral lines Fe\sci
7090.4 \AA ~ and C\sci 5380.34 \AA. The maps are spatially and spectrally
degraded according to typical instrument properties. Line-of-sight velocities
are determined from line bisector shifts. We find that the detectability of the
convective flows is strongly affected by spatial smearing, particularly so for
the downflows. Furthermore, the line-of-sight velocities are dominated by the
Evershed flow unless the observation is made very near to disk center. These
problems may have compromised recent attempts to detect overturning penumbral
convection. Lines with a low formation height are best suited to detect the
convective flows.
