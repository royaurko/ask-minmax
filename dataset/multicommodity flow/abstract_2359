The internal 4-form field strengths with 7-dimensional indices have been
constructed by de Wit and Nicolai in 1986. They are determined by the following
six quantities: the 56-bein of 4-dimensional N=8 gauged supergravity, the
Killing vectors on the round seven-sphere, the covariant derivative acting on
these Killing vectors, the warp factor, the field strengths with 4-dimensional
indices and the 7-dimensional metric.
  In this paper, by projecting out the remaining mixed 4-form field strengths
in an SU(8) tensor that appears in the variation of spin 1/2 fermionic sector,
we also write down them explicitly in terms of some of the above quantities.
For the known critical points, the N=8 SO(8) point and the nonsupersymmetric
SO(7)^{+} point, we reproduce the corresponding 11-dimensional uplifts by
computing the full nonlinear expressions. Moreover, we find out the
11-dimensional lift of the nonsupersymmetric SO(7)^{+} invariant flow. We
decode their implicit formula for the first time and the present work will
provide how to obtain the new supersymmetric or nonsupersymmetric membrane
flows in 11-dimensions.
