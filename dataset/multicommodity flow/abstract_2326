We find a unique direction in the CMB sky around which giant rings have an
anomalous mean temperature profile. This direction is in very close alignment
with the afore measured anomalously large bulk flow direction. Using Monte
Carlo simulations, we estimate the significance of the giant rings at the
$3\sigma$ level and the alignment with the bulk flow at $2.5\sigma$. We argue
that a cosmic defect seeded by a pre-inflationary particle could explain the
giant rings, the large bulk flow and their alignment.
