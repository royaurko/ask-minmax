In this paper we first propose a framework of structure-preserving
submersions, which generalises the concept of a Riemannian submersion, and
dualises the concept of subgeometry, or "structure-preserving immersions". The
emphasis of our approach is on making precise the free variables and the degree
of freedom in a given system, thus making the messy calculations in such
problems more bearable and, more importantly, algorithmic. In particular, we
derive the degrees of freedom of Riemannian submersions and of Weyl
submersions. Then we apply our framework to the study of relativistic
dissipationless flow and shear-free flows, obtaining generalisations of the
classical Herglotz-Noether theorem to conformally flat spacetime in all
dimensions and a partial result of Ellis conjecture to all dimensions.
