Solar prominences are partially ionised plasmas displaying flows and
oscillations. These oscillations show time and spatial damping and, commonly,
have been explained in terms of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. We study the
spatial damping of linear non-adiabatic MHD waves in a flowing partially
ionised plasma, having prominence-like physical properties. We consider single
fluid equations for a partially ionised hydrogen plasma including in the energy
equation optically thin radiation, thermal conduction by electrons and
neutrals, and heating. Keeping the frequency real and fixed, we have solved the
obtained dispersion relations for the complex wavenumber, k, and have analysed
the behaviour of the damping length, wavelength and the ratio of the damping
length to the wavelength, versus period, for Alfven, fast, slow and thermal
waves.
