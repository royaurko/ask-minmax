This talk reviews the development of imaging calorimeters for the purpose of
applying Particle Flow Algorithms (PFAs) to the measurement of hadronic jets at
a future lepton collider. After a short introduction, the current status of PFA
developments is presented, followed by a review of the major developments in
electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry.
