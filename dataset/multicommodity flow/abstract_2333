These notes are based on three lectures given by the second contributor at
Copenhagen University (October 2009) and at Aarhus University, Denmark
(December 2009). We mostly present here a survey of results of Dieter Mayer on
relations between Selberg and Smale-Ruelle dynamical zeta functions. In a
special situation the dynamical zeta function is defined for a geodesic flow on
a hyperbolic plane quotient by an arithmetic cofinite discrete group. More
precisely, the flow is defined for the corresponding unit tangent bundle. It
turns out that the Selberg zeta function for this group can be expressed in
terms of a Fredholm determinant of a classical transfer operator of the flow.
The transfer operator is defined in a certain space of holomorphic functions
and its matrix representation in a natural basis is given in terms of the
Riemann zeta function and the Euler gamma function.
