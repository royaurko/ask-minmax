The previously reported non-equilibrium dissipation law is investigated in
turbulent flows generated by various regular and fractal square grids. The
flows are documented in terms of various turbulent profiles which reveal their
differences. In spite of significant inhomogeneity and anisotropy differences,
the new non-equilibrium dissipation law is observed in all these flows. Various
transverse and longitudinal integral scales are measured and used to define the
dissipation coefficient $C_{\varepsilon}$. It is found that the new
non-equilibrium dissipation law is not an artefact of a particular choice of
the integral scale and that the usual equilibrium dissipation law can actually
coexist with the non-equilibrium law in different regions of the same flow.
