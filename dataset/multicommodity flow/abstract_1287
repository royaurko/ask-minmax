Dufty, Lee, Lutsko, Montanero, and Santos have carried out stability analyses
of steady stationary shear flows. Their approach is based on the compressible
and heat conducting Navier-Stokes-Fourier model. It predicts the unstable
exponential growth of long-wavelength transverse perturbations for both two-
and three-dimensional fluids. We point out that the patently-stable
two-dimensional periodic shear flows studied earlier by Petravic, Posch, and
ourselves contradict these predicted instabilities. The stable steady-state
shear flows are based on nonequilibrium molecular dynamics with simple
thermostats maintaining nonequilibrium stationary states in two space
dimensions. The failure of the stability analyses remains unexplained.
