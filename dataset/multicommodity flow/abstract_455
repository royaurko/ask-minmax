The present study examines self-similarity evolution of advection dominated
accretion flow (ADAF) in the presence of a toroidal magnetic field. In this
research, it was assumed that the angular momentum transport is due to viscous
turbulence and $\alpha$-prescription was used for kinematics coefficient of
viscosity. In order to solve the integrated equations which govern the
dynamical behavior of the accretion flow, self-similar solution was used. The
solutions show that the behavior of physical quantities in a dynamical ADAF are
different from steady accretion flow and a disk with polytropic approach. The
solution indicates a transonic point in the accretion flow for all selected
amounts of advection parameter. Also, by adding strength of the magnetic field
and the degree of advection, the radial-thickness of the disk decreased and the
disk compressed. The model implies that the flow has differential rotation and
is sub-Keplerian at small radii and is super-Keplerian in large radii.
