Three-dimensional (3D), time dependent numerical simulations, of flow of
matter in stars, now have sufficient resolution to be fully turbulent. The late
stages of the evolution of massive stars, leading up to core collapse to a
neutron star (or black hole), and often to supernova explosion and
nucleosynthesis, are strongly convective because of vigorous neutrino cooling
and nuclear heating. Unlike models based on current stellar evolutionary
practice, these simulations show a chaotic dynamics characteristic of highly
turbulent flow. Theoretical analysis of this flow, both in the
Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) framework and by simple dynamic models,
show an encouraging consistency with the numerical results. It may now be
possible to develop physically realistic and robust procedures for convection
and mixing which (unlike 3D numerical simulation) may be applied throughout the
long life times of stars. In addition, a new picture of the presupernova stages
is emerging which is more dynamic and interesting (i.e., predictive of new and
newly observed phenomena) than our previous one.
