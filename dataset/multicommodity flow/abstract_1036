We propose MITRA, a meta-model for the information flow in (computational)
trust and reputation architectures. On an abstract level, MITRA describes the
information flow as it is inherent in prominent trust and reputation models
from the literature. We use MITRA to provide a structured comparison of these
models. This makes it possible to get a clear overview of the complex research
area. Furthermore, by doing so, we identify interesting new approaches for
trust and reputation modeling that so far have not been investigated.
