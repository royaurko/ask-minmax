We present high resolution imaging of the nucleus of NGC4258 from 1 micron to
18 microns. Our observations reveal that the previously discovered compact
source of emission is unresolved even at the near-infrared resolution of about
0.2 arcsec FWHM which corresponds to about 7 pc at the distance of the galaxy.
This is consistent with the source of emission being the region in the
neighborhood of the purported 3.5*10^7 M_sun black hole. After correcting for
about 18 mags of visual extinction, the infrared data are consistent with a
F_nu \propto nu^(-1.4+/-0.1) spectrum from 1.1 micron to 18 micron, implying a
non-thermal origin. Based on this spectrum, the total extinction corrected
infrared luminosity (1-20 micron) of the central source is 2*10^8 L_sun. We
argue that the infrared spectrum and luminosity of the central source obviates
the need for a substantial contribution from a standard, thin accretion disk at
these wavelengths and calculate the accretion rate through an advection
dominated accretion flow to be Mdot \sim 10^(-3) M_sun/yr. The agreement
between these observations and the theoretical spectral energy distribution for
advection dominated flows provides evidence for the existence of an advection
dominated flow in this low luminosity AGN.
