We explore nanoscale hydrodynamical effects on synthesis and self-assembly of
cadmium sulfide nanotubes oriented along one direction. These nanotubes are
synthesized by horizontal capillary flow of two different chemical reagents
from opposite directions through nanochannels of porous anodic alumina which
are used primarily as nanoreactors. We show that uneven flow of different
chemical precursors is responsible for directionally asymmetric growth of these
nanotubes. On the basis of structural observations using scanning electron
microscopy, we argue that chemohydrodynamic convective interfacial instability
of multicomponent liquid-liquid reactive interface is necessary for sustained
nucleation of these CdS nanotubes at the edges of these porous nanochannels
over several hours. However, our estimates clearly suggest that classical
hydrodynamics cannot account for the occurrence of such instabilities at these
small length scales. Therefore, we present a case which necessitates further
investigation and understanding of chemohydrodynamic fluid flow through
nanoconfined channels in order to explain the occurrence of such interfacial
instabilities at nanometer length scales.
