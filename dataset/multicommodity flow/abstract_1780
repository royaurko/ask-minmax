Experimental observations of confined granular materials in the presence of
an electric field that induces cohesive forces are reported. The angle of
repose is found to increase with the cohesive force. A theoretical model for
the stability of a granular heap, including both the effect of the sidewalls
and cohesion is proposed. A good agreement between this model and the
experimental results is found. The steady-state flow angle is practically
unaffected by the electric field except for high field strengths and low flow
rates.
