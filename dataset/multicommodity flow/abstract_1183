We consider a convection process in a thin loop. At $Ra=Ra^{\prime}_{cr}$ a
first transition leading to the generation of corner vortices is observed. At
higher $Ra$ a coherent large-scale flow, which persists for a very long time,
sets up. The mean velocity $\bar{v}$, mass flux $\dm$, and the Nusselt number
$Nu$ in this flow scale with $Ra$ as $\bar{v} \propto \dot{m} \propto
Ra^{0.45}$ and $Nu\propto Ra^{0.9}$, respectively. The time evolution of the
coherent flow is well described by the Landau amplitude equation within a wide
range of $Ra$-variation. The anomalous scaling of the mean velocity, found in
this work, resembles the one experimentally observed in the ``hard turbulence''
regime of Benard convection. A possible relation between the two systems is
discussed.
