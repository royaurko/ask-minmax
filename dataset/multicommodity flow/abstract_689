Using explicit analytical computations, generic occurrence of inequivalence
between two or more statistical ensembles is obtained for a large class of
equilibrium states of two-dimensional and geophysical turbulent flows. The
occurrence of statistical ensemble inequivalence is shown to be related to
previously observed phase transitions in the equilibrium flow topology. We find
in these turbulent flow equilibria, two mechanisms for the appearance of
ensemble equivalences, that were not observed in any physical systems before.
These mechanisms are associated respectively with second-order azeotropy
(simultaneous appearance of two second-order phase transitions), and with
bicritical points (bifurcation from a first-order to two second-order phase
transition lines). The important roles of domain geometry, of topography, and
of a screening length scale (the Rossby radius of deformation) are discussed.
It is found that decreasing the screening length scale (making interactions
more local) surprisingly widens the range of parameters associated with
ensemble inequivalence. These results are then generalized to a larger class of
models, and applied to a complete description of an academic model for inertial
oceanic circulation, the Fofonoff flow.
