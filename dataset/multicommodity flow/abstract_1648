We develop a complete and consistent description for the hadron spectra from
heavy ion collisions in terms of a few collective variables, in particular
temperature, longitudinal and transverse flow. To achieve a meaningful
comparison with presently available data, we also include the resonance decays
into our picture. To disentangle the influences of transverse flow and
resonance decays in the $m_T$-spectra, we analyse in detail the shape of the
$m_T$-spectra.
