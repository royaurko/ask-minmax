It has long been noticed that Laudau-Lifshitz theory can be used to study the
fluctuation of a system that contains a black hole. Since the black string can
be constructed by extending n-dimensional black hole into one extra dimension.
We study the fluctuation of black string flow with a Schwarzschlid-like metric
in D=n+1 dimensional spacetime and a charged solution in D=5 dimensional
spacetime and get the second moments of the fluctuation of the mass flux and
charge flux.
