An axisymmetric magnetic field is applied to a spherical, turbulent flow of
liquid sodium. An induced magnetic dipole moment is measured which cannot be
generated by the interaction of the axisymmetric mean flow with the applied
field, indicating the presence of a turbulent electromotive force. It is shown
that the induced dipole moment should vanish for any axisymmetric laminar flow.
Also observed is the production of toroidal magnetic field from applied
poloidal magnetic field (the omega-effect). Its potential role in the
production of the induced dipole is discussed.
