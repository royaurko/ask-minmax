We introduce the notion of a generalized flow on a graph with coefficients in
a R-representation and show that the module of flows is isomorphic to the first
derived functor of the colimit. We generalize Kirchhoff's laws and build an
exact sequence for calculating the module of flows on the union of graphs.
