Industrial and power systems rely on engineering predictions of the flow
properties of working fluids. The paper proposes a way of the utilization of
the vapor quality values along the new retrograde condensation curve in the
generation of the void fraction design guidelines and reliable prediction of
the saturated liquid specific volumes/densities. The new procedure eliminates
the involvement of semi-empirical relationships like rectilinear diameter and
other similar models.
