Parker's interface dynamo is generalized to the case when a homogeneous flow
is present in the high-diffusivity (upper) layer in the lateral direction (i.e.
perpendicular to the shear flow in the lower layer). This is probably a
realistic first representation of the situation near the bottom of the solar
convective zone, as the strongly subadiabatic stratification of the tachocline
(lower layer in the interface dynamo) imposes a strong upper limit on the speed
of any meridional flow there.
  Analytic solutions to the eigenvalue problem are presented for the cases of
vanishing diffusivity contrast and infinite diffusivity contrast, respectively.
Unlike the trivial case of a homogeneous system, the ability of the meridional
flow to reverse the propagation of the dynamo wave is strongly reduced in the
interface dynamo. In particular, in the limit of high diffusivity contrast
relevant to the solar case it is found that a meridional flow of realistic
amplitude cannot reverse the direction of propagation of the dynamo wave. The
implications of this result for the solar dynamo problem are discussed.
