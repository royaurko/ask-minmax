Based on numerical simulations of a lattice kinetic model for soft-glassy
materials, we characterize the global rheology of a dense emulsion-like system,
under three representative load conditions: Couette flow, time-oscillating
Strain and Kolmogorov flow. It is found that in all cases the rheology is
described by a Herschel-Bulkley (HB) relation, $\sigma = {\sigma}_{Y} + A
S^{\beta}$, with the yield stress ${\sigma}_{Y}$ largely independent of the
loading scenario. A proper rescaling of the HB parameters permits to describe
heterogeneous flows with space-dependent stresses, based on the notion of
cooperativity, as recently proposed to characterize the degree of non-locality
of stress relaxation phenomena in soft-glassy materials.
