We provide a proof that nonholonomically constrained Ricci flows of (pseudo)
Riemannian metrics positively result into nonsymmetric metrics (as explicit
examples, we consider flows of some physically valuable exact solutions in
general relativity). There are constructed and analyzed three classes of
solutions of Ricci flow evolution equations defining nonholonomic deformations
of Taub NUT, Schwarzschild, solitonic and pp--wave symmetric metrics into
nonsymmetric ones.
