The heat transfer characteristics of thin film flow over a hot sphere
resulting from a cold vertical jet of liquid falling onto the surface has been
investigated. The underlying physical features have been illustrated by
numerical solutions of high accuracy based on the modified Keller box method.
The solutions for film thickness distribution are good agreement with those
obtained approximately by using the Pohlhausen integral momentum technique and
observed experimentally by using water as working fluid, thus providing a basic
confirmation of the validity of the results presented.
