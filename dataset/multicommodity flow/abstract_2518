Shear-flow-induced structure formation in surfactant-water mixtures is
investigated numerically using a meshless-membrane model in combination with a
particle-based hydrodynamics simulation approach for the solvent. At low shear
rates, uni-lamellar vesicles and planar lamellae structures are formed at small
and large membrane volume fractions, respectively. At high shear rates,
lamellar states exhibit an undulation instability, leading to rolled or
cylindrical membrane shapes oriented in the flow direction. The spatial
symmetry and structure factor of this rolled state agree with those of
intermediate states during lamellar-to-onion transition measured by
time-resolved scatting experiments. Structural evolution in time exhibits a
moderate dependence on the initial condition.
