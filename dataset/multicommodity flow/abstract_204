We present several dye visualization and numerical simulation fluid dynamics
videos of a sessile jellyfish subjected to channel flow. The low resolution
video and the high resolution video display the vortex patterns in different
channel flows. This description accompanies the video submission V038 to the
2011 APS DFD Gallery of Fluid Motion.
