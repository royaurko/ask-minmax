We study the gradient flow for Yang-Mills theories with twisted boundary
conditions. The perturbative behavior of the energy density $\langle
E(t)\rangle$ is used to define a running coupling at a scale given by the
linear size of the finite volume box. We compute the non-perturbative running
of the pure gauge $SU(2)$ coupling constant and conclude that the technique is
well suited for further applications due to the relatively mild cutoff effects
of the step scaling function and the high numerical precision that can be
achieved in lattice simulations. We also comment on the inclusion of matter
fields.
