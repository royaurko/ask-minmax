Using a covariant coalescence model, we study hadron production in
relativistic heavy ion collisions from both soft partons in the quark-gluon
plasma and hard partons in minijets. Including transverse flow of soft partons
and independent fragmentation of minijet partons, the model is able to describe
available experimental data on pion, kaon, and antiproton spectra. The
resulting antiproton to pion ratio is seen to increase at low transverse
momenta and reaches a value of about one at intermediate transverse momenta, as
observed in experimental data at RHIC. A similar dependence of the antikaon to
pion ratio on transverse momentum is obtained, but it reaches a smaller value
at intermediate transverse momenta. At high transverse momenta, the model
predicts that both the antiproton to pion and the antikaon to pion ratio
decrease and approach those given by the perturbative QCD. Both collective flow
effect and coalescence of minijet partons with partons in the quark-gluon
plasma affect significantly the spectra of hadrons with intermediate transverse
momenta. Elliptic flows of protons, Lambdas, and Omegas have also been
evaluated from partons with elliptic flows extracted from fitting measured pion
and kaon elliptic flows, and they are found to be consistent with available
experimental data.
