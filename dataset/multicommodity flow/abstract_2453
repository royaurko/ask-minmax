In absence of advection, reaction-diffusion systems are able to organize into
spatiotemporal patterns, in particular spiral and target waves. Whenever
advection is present and can be parameterised in terms of effective or
turbulent diffusion $D_{*}$, these patterns should be attainable on much
greater, boosted lengthscale. However, so far, experimental evidence of these
boosted patterns in turbulent flow was lacking. Here, we report the first
experimental observation of boosted target and spiral patterns in an excitable
chemical reaction in a quasi two-dimensional turbulent flow. The wave patterns
observed are $\sim 50$ times larger than in the case of molecular diffusion
only. We vary the turbulent diffusion coefficient $D_{*}$ of the flow and find
that the fundamental Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP) equation
$v_{f} \propto \sqrt{D_{*}}$ for the asymptotic speed of a reactive wave
remains valid. However, not all measures of the boosted wave scale with $D_{*}$
as expected from molecular diffusion, since the wavefronts turn out to be
highly filamentous.
