Measurements of anisotropic flow in heavy-ion collisions provide evidence for
the creation of strongly interacting matter which appears to behave as an
almost ideal fluid. Anisotropic flow signals the presence of multiple
interactions and is very sensitive to the initial spatial anisotropy of the
overlap region in non-central heavy-ion collisions. In this article we report
measurements of elliptic $v_2$, triangular $v_3$, quadrangular $v_4$ and
pentagonal $v_5$ flow. These measurements have been performed with 2- and
multi-particle correlation techniques.
