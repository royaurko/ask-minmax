This work presents a framework for tracking head movements and capturing the
movements of the mouth and both the eyebrows in real-time. We present a head
tracker which is a combination of a optical flow and a template based tracker.
The estimation of the optical flow head tracker is used as starting point for
the template tracker which fine-tunes the head estimation. This approach
together with re-updating the optical flow points prevents the head tracker
from drifting. This combination together with our switching scheme, makes our
tracker very robust against fast movement and motion-blur. We also propose a
way to reduce the influence of partial occlusion of the head. In both the
optical flow and the template based tracker we identify and exclude occluded
points.
