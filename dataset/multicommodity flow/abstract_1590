Thermalization and collective flow of charm (c) and bottom (b) quarks are
evaluated from elastic parton scattering via "D"- and "B"-meson resonances in
an expanding, strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma at RHIC. Pertinent drag
and diffusion coefficients are implemented into a relativistic Langevin
simulation to compute transverse-momentum spectra and azimuthal flow
asymmetries (v_2) of c- and b-quarks. Upon hadronization (including coalescence
and fragmentation) and semileptonic D- and B-decays, the resulting electron
spectra (R_{AA} and v_2) are compared to recent RHIC data.
