Vortex stretching in a compressible fluid is considered. Two-dimensional and
axisymmetric cases are considered separately. The flows associated with the
vortices are perpendicular to the plane of the uniform straining flows.
Externally-imposed density build-up near the axis leads to enhanced compactness
of the vortices - "dressed" vortices (in analogy to "dressed" charged particles
in a dielectric system). The compressible vortex flow solutions in the 2D as
well as axisymmetric cases identify a length scale relevant for the
compressible case which leads to the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili spectrum for
compressible turbulence. Vortex reconnection process in a compressible fluid is
shown to be possible even in the inviscid case - compressibility leads to
defreezing of vortex lines in the fluid.
