We report on the discovery of mostly horizontal field channels just outside
sunspot penumbrae (in the so-called `moat' region) that are seen to sustain
supersonic flows (line-of-sight component of 6 km s{-1}). The spectral
signature of these supersonic flows corresponds to circular polarization
profiles with an additional, satellite, third lobe of the same sign as the
parent sunspot' Stokes V blue lobe, for both downflows and upflows. This is
consistent with an outward directed flow that we interpret as the continuation
of the magnetized Evershed flow outside sunspots at supersonic speeds. In
Stokes Q and U, a clear signature of a transverse field connecting the two flow
streams is observed. Such an easily detectable spectral signature should allow
for a clear identification of these horizontal field channels in other
spectropolarimetric sunspot data. For the spot analyzed in this paper, a total
of 5 channels with this spectral signature have been unambiguously found.
