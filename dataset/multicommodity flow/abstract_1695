We show effects of granular structure of the initial conditions (IC) of
hydrodynamic description of high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions on some
observables, especially on the elliptic-flow parameter v2. Such a structure
enhances production of isotropically distributed high-pT particles, making v2
smaller there. Also, it reduces v2 in the forward and backward regions where
the global matter density is smaller, so where such effects become more
efficacious.
