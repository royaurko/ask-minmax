A multiporosity extension of classical double and triple porosity fractured
rock flow models for slightly compressible fluids is presented. The
multiporosity model is an adaptation of the multirate solute transport model of
Haggerty and Gorelick (1995) to viscous flow in fractured rock reservoirs. It
is a generalization of both pseudo-steady-state and transient interporosity
flow double porosity models. The model includes a fracture continuum and an
overlapping distribution of multiple rock matrix continua, whose
fracture-matrix exchange coefficients are specified through a discrete
probability mass function. Semi-analytical cylindrically symmetric solutions to
the multiporosity mathematical model are developed using the Laplace transform
to illustrate its behavior. The multiporosity model presented here is
conceptually simple, yet flexible enough to simulate common conceptualizations
of double and triple porosity flow. This combination of generality and
simplicity makes the multiporosity model a good choice for flow in
low-permeability fractured rocks.
