The electrostatic perturbations in an unmagnetized, non-isothermal
($T_i{\ll}T_e$) electron-ion plasma shear flow are considered. New physical
effects, arising due to the non-normality of linear dynamics, are described. It
is shown that the velocity shear induces the extraction of the mean flow energy
by the acoustic perturbations (ion-sound waves). The influence of the medium
dispersion, rising due to the violation of quasineutrality for perturbations,
is examined. It is shown that in the course of the evolution ion-sound waves
turn into ion plasma oscillations. New class of nonperiodic, electrostatic
perturbations (with vortical motion of ion component), characterized by the
intense energy exchange with the mean flow, is also described.
