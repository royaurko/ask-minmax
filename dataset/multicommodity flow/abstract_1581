The interrelation of the processes of total disintegration of nuclei with the
processes, characterized by the "centrality" of collisions and a minimum flow
of energy of secondary particles emitted at a zero angle in pC, dC, 4HeC and
12CC interactions, is investigated at 4.2 A GeV/c . The events with total
disintegration of nuclei are characterized by a high degree "centrality" of
collisions and similar to the events having a minimum flow of energy of
particles emitted at a zero angle.
