We report on the simultaneous and localized measurements of the diffusion
coefficient and flow velocity based on the normalized autocorrelation function
using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Our results on a flowing solution of
polystyrene spheres show that the flow velocity and the diffusion coefficient
can be reliably estimated in a regime determined by the sample diffusivity, the
local flow velocity, and the Gaussian beam waist. We experimentally show that a
smaller beam waist results in an improvement of the velocity sensitivity at
cost of the precision and accuracy of the estimation of the diffusion
coefficient. Further, we show that the decay of the OCT autocorrelation due to
flow depends only on the Gaussian beam waist irrespective of the sample
position with respect to the focus position.
