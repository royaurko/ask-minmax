We consider two dimensional maps preserving a foliation which is uniformly
contracting and a one dimensional associated quotient map having exponential
convergence to equilibrium (iterates of Lebesgue measure converge exponentially
fast to physical measure). We prove that these maps have exponential decay of
correlations over a large class of observables. We use this result to deduce
exponential decay of correlations for the Poincare maps of a large class of
singular hyperbolic flows. From this we deduce logarithm laws for these flows.
