The flow equation method has been used to calculate the energy of single
impurity in a superconductor for the Anderson model with $U \neq 0$. We showed
that the energy of the impurity depends only of the $\Delta^{2}_{R}$
(renormalized order parameter) which depends on the renormalized Hubbard
repulsion$U^R$. For a strong Hubbard repulsion $U^R = U$ and $\Delta^R = \Delta
^I$ the effect of the $s-d$ interactions are nonrelevant, a result which is
expected for this model.
