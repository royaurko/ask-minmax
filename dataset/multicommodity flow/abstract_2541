We study the spectral and timing properties of a two component advective flow
(TCAF) around a black hole by numerical simulation. Several cases have been
simulated by varying the Keplerian disk rate and the resulting spectra and
lightcurves have been produced for all the cases. The dependence of the
spectral states and quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) frequencies on the flow
parameters is discussed. We also find the earlier explanation of arising of
QPOs as the resonance between infall time scale and cooling time scale remain
valid even for Compton cooling.
