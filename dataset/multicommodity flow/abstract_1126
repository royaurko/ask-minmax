We prove that each minimal Morse components of a flow $g^t$ of translations
of $G$ into its flag manifolds is normally hyperbolic, where $G$ is a connected
semi-simple real Lie group. Previously, this was only known for flows $g^t$
with no unipotent component and it seemed unknown whether this was true even
for general translations on the projective space. We also give a brief survey
of some previous results.
