A mesoscopic multi-component lattice Boltzmann model with short-range
repulsion between different species and short/mid-ranged attractive/repulsive
interactions between like-molecules is introduced. The interplay between these
composite interactions gives rise to a rich configurational dynamics of the
density field, exhibiting many features of disordered liquid dispersions
(micro-emulsions) and soft-glassy materials, such as long-time relaxation due
to caging effects, anomalous enhanced viscosity, ageing effects under moderate
shear and flow above a critical shear rate.
