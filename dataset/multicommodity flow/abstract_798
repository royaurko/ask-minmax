The Boussinesq equations for Rayleigh-Benard convection are simulated for a
cylindrical container with an aspect ratio near 1.5. The transition from an
axisymmetric stationary flow to time-dependent flows is studied using nonlinear
simulations, linear stability analysis and bifurcation theory. At a Rayleigh
number near 25,000, the axisymmetric flow becomes unstable to standing or
travelling azimuthal waves. The standing waves are slightly unstable to
travelling waves. This scenario is identified as a Hopf bifurcation in a system
with O(2) symmetry.
