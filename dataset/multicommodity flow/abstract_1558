We investigate how the macroscopic spatial structure of broken inversion
symmetry manifests in noncentrosymmetric superconductors, by the microscopic
broken inversion symmetry of the crystal structure. Based on the time-dependent
Ginzburg-Landau theory including the Pauli paramagnetic effect and the Rashba
interaction, we demonstrate that the centrosymmetric structures of the internal
field and the screening current are broken macroscopically. The flow structure
of paramagnetic supercurrent spontaneously induce the flux flow without
applying external currents.
