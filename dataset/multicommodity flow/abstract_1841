We present an example of a limit cycle, i.e., a recurrent flow-line of the
beta-function vector field, in a unitary four-dimensional gauge theory. We thus
prove that beta functions of four-dimensional gauge theories do not produce
gradient flows. The limit cycle is established in perturbation theory with a
three-loop calculation which we describe in detail.
