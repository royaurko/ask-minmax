The paper contains the original mathematical model that describes the
incompressible electrically conducting fluid flows under the influence of the
electromagnetic field - quasi-magneto-hydrodynamic (QMHD) equation system.
Simplified inductionless approximation of QMHD system for the quasi-neutral
liquid is constructed and implemented for numerical simulation of Marangoni
convection in melted semiconductor suppressed by the static external magnetic
field.
