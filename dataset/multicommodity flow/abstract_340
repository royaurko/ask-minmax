In the framework of the isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck
transport model, effect of the momentum dependence of nuclear symmetry
potential on nuclear transverse and elliptic flows in the neutron-rich reaction
$^{132}$Sn+$^{124}$Sn at a beam energy of 400 MeV/nucleon is studied. We find
that the momentum dependence of nuclear symmetry potential affects the rapidity
distribution of the free neutron to proton ratio, the neutron and the proton
transverse flows as a function of rapidity. The momentum dependence of nuclear
symmetry potential affects the neutron-proton differential transverse flow more
evidently than the difference of neutron and proton transverse flows as well as
the difference of proton and neutron elliptic flows. It is thus better to probe
the symmetry energy by using the difference of neutron and proton flows since
the momentum dependence of nuclear symmetry potential is still an open
question. And it is better to probe the momentum dependence of nuclear symmetry
potential by using the neutron-proton differential transverse flow and the
rapidity distribution of the free neutron to proton ratio.
