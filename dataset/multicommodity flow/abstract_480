We investigate the dynamics of very large particles freely advected in a
turbulent von Karman flow. Contrary to other experiments for which the particle
dynamics is generally studied near the geometrical center of the flow, we track
the particles in the whole experiment volume. We observe a strong influence of
the mean structure of the flow that generates an unexpected large-scale
sampling effect for the larger particles studied; contrary to neutrally buoyant
particles of smaller yet finite sizes that exhibit no preferential
concentration in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence (Fiabane et al., Phys.
Rev. E 86(3), 2012). We find that particles whose diameter approaches the flow
integral length scale explore the von Karman flow non-uniformly, with a higher
probability to move in the vicinity of two tori situated near the poloidal
neutral lines. This preferential sampling is quite robust with respect to
changes of any varied parameters: Reynolds number, particle density and
particle surface roughness.
