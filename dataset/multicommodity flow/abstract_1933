In this article we construct L--A representations of geodesic flows on
quadrics and of billiard problems within ellipsoids in the pseudo--Euclidean
spaces. A geometric interpretation of the integrability analogous to the
classical Chasles theorem for symmetric ellipsoids is given. We also consider a
generalization of the billiard within arbitrary quadric allowing virtual
billiard reflections.
