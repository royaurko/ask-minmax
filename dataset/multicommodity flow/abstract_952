In this article the dynamics of pedestrian streams in four different
scenarios are compared empirically to investigate the influence of boundary
conditions on it. The Voronoi method, which allows high resolution and small
fluctuations of measured density in time and space, is used to analyze the
experiments. It is found that pedestrian movement in systems with different
boundary conditions (open, periodic boundary conditions and outflow restrained)
presents various characteristics especially when the density is larger than 2
m-2. In open corridor systems the specific flow increases continuously with
increasing density till 4 m-2. The specific flow keeps constant in systems with
restrained outflow, whereas it decreases from 1 (m.s)-1 to zero in system with
closed periodical condition.
