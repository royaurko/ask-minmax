The magnetic flux penetration into the half-space superconductor sample is
studied in the flux flow regime in parallel geometry assuming that an external
magnetic field increasing with time in accordance with the power law. Assuming
that the flux flow resistivity as a power-law function of the magnetic field
induction we found an exact analytical solution for the nonlinear local
magnetic flux diffusion equation. The obtained solution describes space-time
distribution of the magnetic induction in the sample.
