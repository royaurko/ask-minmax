The paper presents the results of computation of some simple internal flows
of incompressible fluid with the software package CFX-5. In the previous paper
of the contributor, the same flows were used for testing of another CFD software
tool, FlowVision. The model equations used for this research are again the set
of Reynolds and continuity equations and equations of the standard k - e
turbulence model. The results of computation of a number of internal fluid
flows in channels are presented and comparison with known experimental data is
performed. Good correspondence of results was obtained both concerning the flow
pattern and related integral values.
