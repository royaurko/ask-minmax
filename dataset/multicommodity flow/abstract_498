This paper investigates which smooth manifolds arise as quotients (orbit
spaces) of flows of vector fields. Such quotient maps were already known to be
surjective on fundamental groups, but this paper shows that every epimorphism
of countably presented groups is induced by the quotient map of some flow, and
that higher homology can also be controlled. Manifolds of fixed dimension
arising as quotients of flows on Euclidean space realize all even (and some
odd) intersection pairings, and all homotopy spheres of dimension at least 2
arise in this manner. Most Euclidean spaces of dimensions 5 and higher have
families of topologically equivalent but smoothly inequivalent flows with
quotient homeomorphic to a manifold with flexibly chosen homology. For m at
least 2r>2, there is a topological flow on (R^{2r+1}-(8 points))xR^m that is
unsmoothable, although smoothable near each orbit, with quotient an
unsmoothable topological manifold.
