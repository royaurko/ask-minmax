In this lecture note, we present several topics on relativistic hydrodynamics
and its application to relativistic heavy ion collisions. In the first part we
give a brief introduction to relativistic hydrodynamics in the context of heavy
ion collisions. In the second part we present the formalism and some
fundamental aspects of relativistic ideal and viscous hydrodynamics. In the
third part, we start with some basic checks of the fundamental observables
followed by discussion of collective flow, in particular elliptic flow, which
is one of the most exciting phenomenon in heavy ion collisions at relativistic
energies. Next we discuss how to formulate the hydrodynamic model to describe
dynamics of heavy ion collisions. Finally, we conclude the third part of the
lecture note by showing some results from ideal hydrodynamic calculations and
by comparing them with the experimental data.
