We introduce in this work a concept of rough driver that somehow provides a
rough path-like analogue of an enriched object associated with time-dependent
vector fields. We use the machinery of approximate flows to build the
integration theory of rough drivers and prove well-posedness results for rough
differential equations on flows and continuity of the solution flow as a
function of the generating rough driver. We show that the theory of
semi-martingale stochastic flows developed in the 80's and early 90's fits
nicely in this framework, and obtain as a consequence some strong approximation
results for general semimartingale flows and provide a fresh look at large
deviation theorems for 'Gaussian' stochastic flows.
