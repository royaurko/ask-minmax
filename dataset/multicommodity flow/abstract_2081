The coupling of Jupiter's magnetosphere and ionosphere plays a vital role in
creating its auroral emissions. The strength of these emissions is dependent on
the difference in speed of the rotational flows within Jupiter's high-latitude
thermosphere and the planet's magnetodisc. Using an azimuthally symmetric
global circulation model, we have simulated how upstream solar wind conditions
affect the energy and direction of atmospheric flows. In order to simulate the
effect of a varying dynamic pressure in the upstream solar wind, we calculated
three magnetic field profiles representing compressed, averaged and expanded
`middle' magnetospheres. These profiles were then used to solve for the angular
velocity of plasma in the magnetosphere. This angular velocity determines the
strength of currents flowing between the ionosphere and magnetosphere. We
examine the influence of variability in this current system upon the global
winds and energy inputs within the Jovian thermosphere. We find that the power
dissipated by Joule heating and ion drag increases by ~190% and ~185% from our
compressed to expanded model respectively. We investigated the effect of
exterior boundary conditions on our models and found that by reducing the
radial current at the outer edge of the magnetodisc, we also limit the
thermosphere's ability to transmit angular momentum to this region.
