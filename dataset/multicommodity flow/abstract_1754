A new highly accurate algorithm for the solution of the Falkner-Skan equation
of boundary layer theory is presented. The algorithm, based on a Maclaurin
series representation, finds its coefficients from recurrence. In addition,
Wynn-epsilon convergence acceleration and continuous analytical continuation
enable an accurate evaluation. The most accurate skin friction coefficients
(shooting angle) to date are presented along with comparisons to past and
present values found in the literature. The algorithm, coded in FORTRAN, uses
neither enhanced precision arithmetic beyond quadruple precision nor computer
algebra to achieve results in a timely fashion.
