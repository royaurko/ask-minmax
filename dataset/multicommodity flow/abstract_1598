Several new results on the multicritical behavior of rectangular matrix
models are presented. We calculate the free energy in the saddle point
approximation, and show that at the triple-scaling point, the result is the
same as that derived from the recursion formulae. In the triple-scaling limit,
we obtain the string equation and a flow equation for arbitrary multicritical
points. Parametric solutions are also examined for the limit of almost-square
matrix models. This limit is shown to provide an explicit matrix model
realization of the scaling equations proposed to describe open-closed string
theory.
