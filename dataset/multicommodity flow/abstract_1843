We derive a class of energy preserving boundary conditions for incompressible
Newtonian flows and prove local-in-time well-posedness of the resulting initial
boundary value problems, i.e. the Navier-Stokes equations complemented by one
of the derived boundary conditions, in an Lp-setting in domains, which are
either bounded or unbounded with almost flat, sufficiently smooth boundary. The
results are based on maximal regularity properties of the underlying
linearisations, which are also established in the above setting.
