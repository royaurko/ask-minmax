The volume flow rates of Eyring-fluids inside the wavy-rough nanoannulus were
obtained analytically (up to the second order) by using the verified model and
boundary perturbation method. Our results show that the wavy-roughness could
enhance the flow rate especially for smaller forcing due to the larger
surface-to-volume ratio and slip-velocity effect. Meanwhile, the phase shift
between the outer and inner walls of nanoannuli could tune the transport of
Eyring-fluids either forward or backward when the wavy-roughness of a
nanoannulus is larger enough. Our results could be applied to the flow control
in nanofluidics as well as biofluidics.
