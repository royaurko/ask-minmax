The linearity and quietness of the Local ($< 10 Mpc$) Hubble Flow (LHF) in
view of the very clumpy local universe is a long standing puzzle in standard
and in open CDM cosmogony. The question addressed in this paper is whether the
antigravity component of the recently discovered dark energy can cool the
velocity flow enough to provide a solution to this puzzle. We calculate the
growth of matter fluctuations in a flat universe containing a fraction
$\Omega_X(t_0)$ of dark energy obeying the time independent equation of state
$p_X = w \rho_X$. We find that dark energy can indeed cool the LHF. However the
dark energy parameter values required to make the predicted velocity dispersion
consistent with the observed value $v_{rms}\simeq 40km/sec$ have been ruled out
by other observational tests constraining the dark energy parameters $w$ and
$\Omega_X$. Therefore despite the claims of recent qualitative studies dark
energy with time independent equation of state can not by itself explain the
quietness and linearity of the Local Hubble Flow.
