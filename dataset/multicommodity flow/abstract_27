Let $M$ be a closed oriented surface endowed with a Riemannian metric $g$ and
let $\Omega$ be a 2-form. We show that the magnetic flow of the pair
$(g,\Omega)$ has zero asymptotic Maslov index and zero Liouville action if and
only $g$ has constant Gaussian curvature, $\Omega$ is a constant multiple of
the area form of $g$ and the magnetic flow is a horocycle flow.
  This characterization of horocycle flows implies that if the magnetic flow of
a pair $(g,\Omega)$ is $C^1$-conjugate to the horocycle flow of a hyperbolic
metric $\bar{g}$ then there exists a constant $a>0$, such that $ag$ and
$\bar{g}$ are isometric and $a^{-1}\Omega$ is, up to a sign, the area form of
$g$. The characterization also implies that if a magnetic flow is Ma\~n\'e
critical and uniquely ergodic it must be the horocycle flow.
  As a by-product we also obtain results on existence of closed magnetic
geodesics for almost all energy levels in the case weakly exact magnetic fields
on arbitrary manifolds.
