We present a simple, parallel and distributed algorithm for setting up and
partitioning a sparse representation of a regular discretized simulation
domain. This method is scalable for a large number of processes even for
complex geometries and ensures load balance between the domains, reasonable
communication interfaces, and good data locality within the domain. Applying
this scheme to a list-based lattice Boltzmann flow solver can achieve similar
or even higher flow solver performance than widely used standard graph
partition based tools such as METIS and PT-SCOTCH.
