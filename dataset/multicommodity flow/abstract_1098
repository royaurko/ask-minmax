We consider the geodesic flow on a complete connected negatively curved
manifold. We show that the set of invariant borel probability measures contains
a dense $G_\delta$-subset consisting of ergodic measures fully supported on the
non-wandering set. We also trat the case of non-positively curved manifolds and
provide general tools to deal with hyperbolic systems defined on non-compact
spaces.
