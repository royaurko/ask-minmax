The laminar-turbulent boundary S is the set separating initial conditions
which relaminarise uneventfully from those which become turbulent. Phase space
trajectories on this hypersurface in cylindrical pipe flow look to be chaotic
and show recurring evidence of coherent structures. A general numerical
technique is developed for recognising approaches to these structures and then
for identifying the exact coherent solutions themselves. Numerical evidence is
presented which suggests that trajectories on S are organised around only a few
travelling waves and their heteroclinic connections. If the flow is suitably
constrained to a subspace with a discrete rotational symmetry, it is possible
to find locally-attracting travelling waves embedded within S. Four new types
of travelling waves were found using this approach.
