We investigate the attractor mechanism in gauged supergravity in the presence
of higher derivatives terms. In particular, we discuss the attractor behaviour
of static black hole horizons in anti-de Sitter spacetime by using the
effective potential approach as well as Sen's entropy function formalism. We
use the holographic techniques to interpret the moduli flow as an RG flow
towards the IR attractor horizon. We find that the holographic c-function obeys
the expected properties and point out some subtleties in understanding
attractors in AdS.
