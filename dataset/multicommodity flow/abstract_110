The motion of colloids in the flow field of a viscous liquid is investigated.
The small colloid size compare to the macroscopical scale of the flow allow to
calculate their velocity relative to that of the liquid. If the inner colloid
density is larger then the density of the liquid the flow field has the domains
where the colloid velocity is close to the liquid velocity. But in the domains
with a strong braking of the liquid velocity the colloids are accelerated
relative to the liquid. This effect is used for the qualitative explanation of
the drag reduction in the flow around macroscopical bodies and in the pipes.
