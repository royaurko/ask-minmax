We investigate the flow of a strongly coupled anyonic superfluid based on the
holographic D3-D7' probe brane model. By analyzing the spectrum of
fluctuations, we find the critical superfluid velocity, as a function of the
temperature, at which the flow stops being dissipationless when flowing past a
barrier. We find that at a larger velocity the flow becomes unstable even in
the absence of a barrier.
