We discuss RG flows in 5d gauge theories triggered either by VEV's of mesonic
or baryonic operators. As a warm-up, we explicitly discuss the counterpart of
these flows in 4d gauge theories with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry by focusing
on the $A_1$ theory. As opposed to the $\mathcal{N}=1$ case, in cases with 8
supercharges we need to solve a more involved PDE. In the 5d case the boundary
conditions for such equation play a crucial role in order to reproduce the
expected spectrum.
