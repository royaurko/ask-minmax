The decay of large-scale anisotropies in small-scale turbulent flow is
investigated. By introducing two different kinds of estimators we discuss the
relation between the presence of a hierarchy for the isotropic and the
anisotropic scaling exponents and the persistence of anisotropies. Direct
measurements from a channel flow numerical simulation are presented.
