Let X be a toric surface with Delzant polygon P and u(t) be a solution of the
Calabi flow equation on P. Suppose the Calabi flow exists in [0, T). By
studying local estimates of the Riemann curvature and the geodesic distance
under the Calabi flow, we prove a uniform interior estimate of u(t) for t < T.
