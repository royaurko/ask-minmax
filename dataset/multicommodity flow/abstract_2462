An old and apparently persistent problem in numerical lattice QCD is that the
simulations tend to get trapped in a sector of fixed topological charge when
the lattice spacing is taken to zero. The effect sets in very rapidly and may
invalidate the simulation results in certain cases. In this talk, the issue is
discussed using the Wilson flow as a tool. The flow has a simple scaling
behaviour and allows one to understand how exactly the topological sectors
emerge in the continuum limit. Further studies however suggest that the
observed slowdown of the simulations at small lattice spacings is only partly
caused by the emergence of the sectors.
