In this paper, we consider a stationary, constant viscosity, incompressible
Stokes flow with singular forces along one or several interfaces. Assuming only
the jumps of the pressure are present along the interface, we develop a new
numerical scheme for such a problem. By constructing an approximate singular
function and removing it, we can apply a standard finite element method to
solve it. A main advantage of our scheme is that one can use a uniform grid. We
observe optimal $O(h)$ order for the pressure and $O(h^2)$ order for the
velocity.
