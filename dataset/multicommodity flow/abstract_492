As a follow-up of a recent study, we challenge the claim that the flow of
interstellar helium through the solar system has changed substantially over the
last decades. We argue that only the IBEX-Lo 2009-2010 measurements are
discrepant with older consensus values. Then we show that the probability of
the claimed variations of longitude and velocity are highly unlikely (about 1
per cent), in view of the absence of change in latitude and absence of change
in the (flow velocity, flow longitude) relation, while random values would be
expected. Finally, we report other independent studies showing the stability of
Helium flow and the Hydrogen flow over the years 1996-2012, consistent with the
seventies earlier determinations of the interstellar flow.
