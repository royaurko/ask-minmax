Using electrical transport experiments and shot noise thermometry, we
investigate electron-phonon heat transfer rate in a suspended bilayer graphene.
Contrary to monolayer graphene with heat flow via three-body supercollision
scattering, we find that regular electron - optical phonon scattering in
bilayer graphene provides the dominant scattering process at electron energies
$ \gtrsim 0.15$ eV. We determine the strength of these intrinsic heat flow
processes of bilayer graphene and find good agreement with theoretical
estimates when both zone edge and zone center optical phonons are taken into
account.
