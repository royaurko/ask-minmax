We study the impact of wall corrugations in microchannels on the process of
capillary filling by means of three broadly used methods - Computational Fluid
Dynamics (CFD), Lattice-Boltzmann Equations (LBE) and Molecular Dynamics (MD).
The numerical results of these approaches are compared and tested against the
Concus-Finn (CF) criterion, which predicts pinning of the contact line at
rectangular ridges perpendicular to flow for contact angles theta > 45. While
for theta = 30, theta = 40 (no flow) and theta = 60 (flow) all methods are
found to produce data consistent with the CF criterion, at theta = 50 the
numerical experiments provide different results. Whilst pinning of the liquid
front is observed both in the LB and CFD simulations, MD simulations show that
molecular fluctuations allow front propagation even above the critical value
predicted by the deterministic CF criterion, thereby introducing a sensitivity
to the obstacle heigth.
