A 2-D version of the asymmetric exclusion model for granular sheared flows is
presented. The velocity profile exhibits two qualitatively different behaviors,
dependent on control parameters. For low friction, the velocity profile follows
an exponential decay while for large friction the profile is more accurately
represented by a Gaussian law. The phase transition occurring between these two
behavior is identified by the appearance of correlations in the cluster size
distribution. Finally, a mean--field theory gives qualitative and quantitative
good agreement with the numerical results.
