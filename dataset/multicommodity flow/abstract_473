We investigate through non-equilibrium molecular dynamic simulations the flow
of core-softened fluids inside nanotubes. Our results reveal a anomalous
increase of the overall mass flux for nanotubes with sufficiently smaller
radii. This is explained in terms of a transition from a single-file type of
flow to the movement of an ordered-like fluid as the nanotube radius increases.
The occurrence of a global minimum in the mass flux at this transition reflects
the competition between the two characteristics length scales of the
core-softened potential. Moreover, by increasing further the radius, another
substantial change in the flow behavior, which becomes more evident at low
temperatures, leads to a local minimum in the overall mass flux.
Microscopically, this second transition results from the formation of a
double-layer of flowing particles in the confined nanotube space. These special
nano-fluidic features of core-softened particles closely resemble the enhanced
flow behavior observed for liquid water inside carbon nanotubes.
