Traditionally, evaluation studies in information visualization have measured
effectiveness by assessing performance time and accuracy. More recently, there
has been a concerted effort to understand aspects beyond time and errors. In
this paper we study enjoyment, which, while arguably not the primary goal of
visualization, has been shown to impact performance and memorability. Different
models of enjoyment have been proposed in psychology, education and gaming; yet
there is no standard approach to evaluate and measure enjoyment in
visualization. In this paper we relate the flow model of Csikszentmihalyi to
Munzner's nested model of visualization evaluation and previous work in the
area. We suggest that, even though previous papers tackled individual elements
of flow, in order to understand what specifically makes a visualization
enjoyable, it might be necessary to measure all specific elements.
