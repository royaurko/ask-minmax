We obtain the initial phase space distribution after relativistic heavy ion
collision by the CGC shattering method incorporating the uncertainty principle
and solve the semi-classical Boltzmann equation which includes the gluon
radiation processes. We present as a function of time the attenuation rate of
high $p_T$ partons, which have transverse momenta over 6 $GeV/c$, in the medium
which is formed after relativistic heavy ion collision. We calculate the
elliptic flow as a function of an impact parameter, time and transverse
momentum and also present the polar anisotropy, which gives the initial
condition for color filamentation.
