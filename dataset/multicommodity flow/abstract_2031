This paper introduces the new Real-Time Media Flow Protocol (RTMFP)
simulation model for the INET framework for the OMNeT++ simulation environment.
RTMFP is a message orientated protocol with a focus on real time peer-to-peer
communication. After Adobe Inc. released the specifications, we were able to
implement the protocol in INET and compare its performance to the similar
Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) with a focus on congestion control
and flow control mechanisms.
