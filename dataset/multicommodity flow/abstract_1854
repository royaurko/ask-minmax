We construct a consistent closure for the beta functions of the cosmological
and Newton's constants by evaluating the influence of the fluctuating metric
and ghost fields anomalous dimensions on their flow. In this generalized
framework we confirm the presence of a UV attractive non-Gaussian fixed-point.
Our closure method is general and can be applied systematically to more general
truncations of the gravitational effective average action.
