We demonstrate the role of the mass asymmetry in the energy of vanishing flow
by studying asymmetric reactions throughout the periodic table and over entire
colliding geometry. Our results, which are almost independent of the system
size and as well as of the colliding geometries indicate a sizable effect of
the asymmetry of the reaction on the energy of vanishing flow.
