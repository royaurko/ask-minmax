A comprehensive viscous hydrodynamic fit of spectra and elliptic flow for
charged hadrons and identified pions and protons from Au+Au collisions of all
centralities measured at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider is performed and
used as the basis for predicting the analogous observables for Pb+Pb collisions
at the Large Hadron Collider at sqrt(s)=2.76 and 5.5 A TeV. Comparison with
recent measurements of the elliptic flow of charged hadrons by the ALICE
experiment shows that the model slightly over-predicts the data if the same
(constant) specific shear viscosity eta/s is assumed at both collision
energies. In spite of differences in our assumptions for the equation of state,
the freeze-out temperature, the chemical composition at freeze-out, and the
starting time for the hydrodynamic evolution, our results agree remarkably well
with those of Luzum [M. Luzum, Phys. Rev. C 83, 044911 (2011)], indicating
robustness of the hydrodynamic model extrapolations. Future measurements of the
centrality and transverse momentum dependence of spectra and elliptic flow for
identified hadrons predicted here will further test the model and shed light on
possible variations of the quark-gluon transport coefficients between RHIC and
LHC energies.
