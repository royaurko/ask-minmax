Ion-mobility spectrometry (IMS) is an analytical technique used to separate
and identify ionized gas molecules based on their mobility in a carrier buffer
gas. Such methods come in a large variety of versions that currently allow ion
identification at and above the millimeter scale. Here, we present a design for
a cross-flow-IMS method able to generate and detect ions at the sub-millimeter
scale. We propose a novel ion focusing strategy and tested it in a prototype
device using Nitrogen as a sample gas, and also with simulations using four
different sample gases. By introducing an original lobular ion generation
localized to a few ten of microns and substantially simplifying the design, our
device is able to keep constant laminar flow conditions for high flow rates. In
this way, it avoids the turbulences in the gas flow, which would occur in other
ion-focusing cross-flow methods limiting their performance at the
sub-millimeter scale. Scalability of the proposed design can contribute to
improve resolving power and resolution of currently available cross-flow
methods.
