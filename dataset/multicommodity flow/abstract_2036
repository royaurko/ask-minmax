A prediction of the galaxy cluster cooling flow model is that as gas cools
from the ambient cluster temperature, emission lines are produced in gas at
subsequently decreasing temperatures. Gas passing through 10^5.5 K emits in the
lines of OVI 1032,1035, and here we report a FUSE study of these lines in three
cooling flow clusters, Abell 426, Abell 1795, and AWM 7. No emission was
detected from AWM 7, but OVI is detected from the centers of Abell 426 and
Abell 1795, and possibly to the south of the center in Abell 1795, where X-ray
and optical emission line filaments lie. In Abell 426, these line luminosities
imply a cooling rate of 32+/-6 Msolar/yr within the central r = 6.2 kpc region,
while for Abell 1795, the central cooling rate is 26+/-7 Msolar/yr (within r =
22 kpc), and about 42+/-9 Msolar/yr including the southern pointing. Including
other studies, three of six clusters have OVI emission, and they also have star
formation as well as emission lines from 1E4 K gas. These observations are
generally consistent with the cooling flow model but at a rate closer to 30
Msolar/yr than originally suggested values of 100-1000 Msolar/yr.
