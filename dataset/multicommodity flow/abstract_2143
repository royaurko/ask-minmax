We evaluate the coorbital corotation torque on a planet on a fixed circular
orbit embedded in a viscous protoplanetary disk, for the case of a steady flow
in the planet frame. This torque can be evaluated just from the flow properties
at the separatrix between the librating (horseshoe) and circulating
streamlines. A stationary solution is searched for the flow in the librating
region. When used to evaluate the torque exerted by the circulating material of
the outer and inner disk on the trapped material of the librating region, this
solution leads to an expression of the coorbital corotation torque in agreement
with previous estimates. An analytical expression is given for the corotation
torque as a function of viscosity. Lastly, we show that additional terms in the
torque expression can play a crucial role. In particular, they introduce a
coupling with the disk density profile perturbation (the `dip' which surrounds
the planet) and add to the corotation torque a small, positive fraction of the
one-sided Lindblad torque. As a consequence, the migration could well be
directed outwards in very thin disks (aspect ratio smaller than a few percent).
This 2D analysis is especially relevant for mildly embedded protoplanets
(sub-Saturn sized objects).
