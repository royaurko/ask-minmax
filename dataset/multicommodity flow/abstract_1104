We discuss the role of tangential stabilization in a curvature driven flow of
planar curves. The governing system of nonlinear parabolic equations includes a
nontrivial tangential velocity functional yielding a uniform redistribution of
grid points along the evolving family of curves preventing numerically computed
curves from forming various instabilities.
