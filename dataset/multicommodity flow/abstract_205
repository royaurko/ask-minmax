We analyze the dichotomy between {\em sectional-Axiom A flows} (c.f.
\cite{memo}) and flows with points accumulated by periodic orbits of different
indices. Indeed, this is proved for $C^1$ generic flows whose singularities
accumulated by periodic orbits have codimension one. Our result improves
\cite{mp1}.
