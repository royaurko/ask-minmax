The linear response to temperature changes is derived for systems with
overdamped stochastic dynamics. Holding both in transient and steady state
conditions, the results allow to compute nonequilibrium thermal
susceptibilities from unperturbed correlation functions. These correlations
contain a novel form of entropy flow due to temperature unbalances, next to the
standard entropy flow of stochastic energetics and to complementary
time-symmetric dynamical aspects. Our derivation hinges on a time rescaling,
which is a key procedure for comparing apparently incommensurable path weights.
An interesting notion of thermal time emerges from this approach.
