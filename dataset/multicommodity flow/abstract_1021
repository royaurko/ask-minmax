A layer of granular material on a vertically vibrating sawtooth-shaped base
exhibits horizontal flow whose speed and direction depend on the parameters
specifying the system in a complex manner. Discrete-particle simulations reveal
that the induced flow rate varies with height within the granular layer and
oppositely directed flows can occur at different levels. The behavior of the
overall flow is readily understood once this novel feature is taken into
account.
