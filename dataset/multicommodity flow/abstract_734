We show that the properties of Lagrangian mean curvature flow are a special
case of a more general phenomenon, concerning couplings between geometric flows
of the ambient space and of totally real submanifolds. Both flows are driven by
the ambient Ricci curvature or by analogues in non-Kaehler manifolds. The
Streets--Tian symplectic curvature flow is shown to play an important role in
this context, thus emphasizing the possible interest in almost Kaehler
manifolds for geometric analysis. We develop new geometric quantities for
totally real submanifolds using the ambient canonical bundle K_M. In particular
we develop a notion of geodesics, related to pseudo-holomorphic curves, and
prove that our main functional is convex with respect to this notion. This may
have applications to the study of Lagrangian submanifolds and calibrated
geometry.
