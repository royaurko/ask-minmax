Two flows are topologically almost commensurable if, up to removing finitely
many periodic orbits and taking finite coverings, they are topologically
equivalent. We prove that all suspensions of automorphisms of the 2-dimensional
torus and all geodesic flows on unit tangent bundles to hyperbolic 2-orbifolds
are pairwise almost commensurable.
