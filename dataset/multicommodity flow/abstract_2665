We propose a numerical approach to study the mechanics of a flowing bubble in
a constraint micro channel. Using an open source two phase flow solver (Gerris,
gfs.sourceforge.net) we compute solutions of the bubble dynamics (i.e. shape
and terminal velocity) induced by the interaction between the bubble movement,
the Laplace pressure variation, and the lubrication film near the channel wall.
Quantitative and qualitative results are presented and compared against both
theory and experimental data for small Capillary numbers. We discuss the
technical issues of explicit integration methods on small Capillary numbers
computations, and the possibility of adding Van der Walls forces to give a more
precise picture of the Droplet-based microfluidic problem.
