Prediction and control of cancer invasion is a vital problem in medical
science. This paper proposes a modern geometric Ricci-flow and entropy based
model for control of avascular multicellular tumor spheroid growth and decay.
As a tumor growth/decay control tool, a monoclonal antibody therapy is
proposed.
