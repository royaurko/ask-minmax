It is shown that the self-induced transparency equations can be interpreted
as a generating function for as positive so negative flows in the AKNS
hierarchy. Mutual commutativity of these flows leads to other hierarchies of
integrable equations. In particular, it is shown that stimulated Raman
scattering equations generate the hierarchy of flows which include the
Heisenberg model equations. This observation reveals some new relationships
between known integrable equations and permits one to construct their new
physically important combinations. Reductions of the AKNS hierarchy to ones
with complex conjugate and real dependent variables are also discussed and the
corresponding generating functions of positive and negative flows are found.
Generating function of Whitham modulation equations in the AKNS hierarchy is
obtained.
