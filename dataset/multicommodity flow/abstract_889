We study the nonlinear inhomogeneous wave equation in one space dimension:
$v_{tt} - T(v,x)_{xx} = 0$. By constructing some "decoupled" Riccati type
equations for smooth solutions, we provide a singularity formation result
without restrictions on the total variation of unknown, which generalize
earlier singularity results of Lax and the first contributor. These results are
applied to several one-dimensional hyperbolic models, such as compressible
Euler flows with a general pressure law, elasticity in an inhomogeneous medium,
transverse MHD flow, and compressible flow in a variable area duct.
