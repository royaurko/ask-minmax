The paper examines one-dimensional total variation flow equation with
Dirichlet boundary conditions. Thanks to a new concept of "almost classical"
solutions we are able to determine evolution of facets -- flat regions of
solutions. A key element of our approach is the natural regularity determined
by nonlinear elliptic operator, for which $x^2$ is an irregular function. Such
a point of view allows us to construct solutions. We apply this idea to
implement our approach to numerical simulations for typical initial data. Due
to the nature of Dirichlet data any monotone function is an equilibrium. We
prove that each solution reaches such steady state in a finite time.
