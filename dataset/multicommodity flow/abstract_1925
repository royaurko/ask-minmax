We give a general theory of a rotated black string stream into a rotational
horizon in dimension D=5. It is a configuration about one smooth intersection
between these two objects when the spacetime is axisymmetric and in the limit
that the thickness of the black hole is much larger than the thickness of the
black string. Following this configuration we extend to a more general
situation, the rotational charged flows.
