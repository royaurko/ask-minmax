We use the Wilson flow to define the gauge anisotropy at a given physical
scale. We demonstrate the use of the anisotropic flow by performing the tuning
of the bare gauge anisotropy in the tree-level Symanzik action for several
lattice spacings and target anisotropies. We use this method to tune the
anisotropy parameters in full QCD, where we also exploit the diminishing effect
of a well chosen smearing on the renormalization of the fermion anisotropy.
