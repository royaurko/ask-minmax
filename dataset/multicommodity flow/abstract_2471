We investigate a class of pulsar wind nebulae that show synchrotron emission
from a thick toroidal structure. The best studied such object is the small
radio and X-ray nebula around the Vela pulsar, which can be interpreted as the
result of interaction of a mildly supersonic inward flow with the recent pulsar
wind. Such a flow near the center of a supernova remnant can be produced in a
transient phase when the reverse shock reaches the center of the remnant. Other
nebulae with a thick toroidal structure are G106.6+2.9 and G76.9+1.0. Their
structure contrasts with young pulsar nebulae like the Crab Nebula and 3C 38,
which show a more chaotic, filamentary structure in the synchrotron emission.
In both situations, a torus-jet structure is present where the pulsar wind
passes through a termination shock, indicating the flow is initially toroidal.
We suggest that the difference is due to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability that
operates when the outer boundary of the nebula is accelerating into freely
expanding supernova ejecta. The instability gives rise to mixing in the Crab
and related objects, but is not present in the nebulae with thick toroidal
regions.
