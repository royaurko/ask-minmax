Molecular dynamics simulations of dense and rarefied fluids comprising small
chain molecules in chemically patterned nano-channels predict a novel switching
from Poiseuille to plug flow along the channel. We also demonstrate behavior
akin to the lotus effect for a nanodrop on a chemically patterned substrate.
Our results show that one can control and exploit the behavior of fluids at the
nanoscale using chemical patterning.
