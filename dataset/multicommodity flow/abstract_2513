A current goal of relativistic heavy ion collisions experiments is the search
for a Color Glass Condensate as the limiting state of QCD matter at very high
density. In viscous hydrodynamics simulations, a standard Glauber initial
condition leads to estimate $4\pi \eta/s \sim 1$, while a Color Glass
Condensate modeling leads to at least a factor of 2 larger $\eta/s$. Within a
kinetic theory approach based on a relativistic Boltzmann-like transport
simulation, we point out that the out-of-equilibrium initial distribution
proper of a Color Glass Condensate reduces the efficiency in building-up the
elliptic flow. Our main result at RHIC energy is that the available data on
$v_2$ are in agreement with a $4\pi \eta/s \sim 1$ also for Color Glass
Condensate initial conditions, opening the possibility to describe
self-consistently also higher order flow, otherwise significantly
underestimated, and to pursue further the search for signatures of the Color
Glass Condensate.
