The question on expansion of moving volume inside of a smooth flow of the
compressible liquid is under consideration. We find a condition on initial data
such that if it holds, then within a finite time either the boundary of the
moving volume attains a given neighborhood of a certain point (that do not
belong to the volume initially), or some a priori estimate for the pressure on
the boundary of volume fails.
