Drop deformation in uniform electric fields is a classic problem. The
pioneering work of G.I.Taylor demonstrated that for weakly conducting media,
the drop fluid undergoes a toroidal flow and the drop adopts a prolate or
oblate spheroidal shape, the flow and shape being axisymmetrically aligned with
the applied field. However, recent studies have revealed a nonaxisymmetric
rotational mode for drops of lower conductivity than the surrounding medium,
similar to the rotation of solid dielectric particles observed by Quincke in
the 19th century. This fluid dynamics video demonstrates three behavioral
modes. I) toroidal recirculation inside the drop in weak fields II)
nonaxisymmetric fluid rotation in strong fields and III) drop breakup in strong
fields.
