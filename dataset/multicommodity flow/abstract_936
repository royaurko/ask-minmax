In the present paper we show that the geodesic flows of a sub-Riemannian
metric and that of a Riemannian extension commute if and only if the extended
metric is parallel with respect to a certain connection. This helps us to
describe the geodesic flow of sub-Riemannian metrics on totally geodesic
Riemannian submersions. As a consequence we can characterize sub-Riemannian
geodesics as the horizontal lifts of projections of Riemannian geodesics.
