We consider the Cauchy problem to the two-dimensional incompressible liquid
crystal equation and the heat flows of harmonic maps equation. Under a natural
geometric angle condition, we give a new proof of the global well-posedness of
smooth solutions for a class of large initial data in energy space. This result
was originally obtained by Ding-Lin in \cite{DingLin} and Lin-Lin-Wang in
\cite{LinLinWang}. Our main technical tool is a rigidity theorem which gives
the coercivity of the harmonic energy under certain angle condition. Our proof
is based on a frequency localization argument combined with the
concentration-compactness approach which can be of independent interest.
