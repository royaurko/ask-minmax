The vorticity statistics characterises both the direct and the inverse
turbulent cascades of two-dimensional fluid flows. The fluid/gravity
correspondence relates fluid flows to black brane dynamics. We construct the
holographic vorticity for relativistic and non-relativistic fluids in terms of
the gravitational black brane data, and relate it to the horizon vorticity
expressed as a Weyl scalar. We discuss the statistical scaling structure of the
horizon geometry.
