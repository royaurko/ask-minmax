Viscous fluid dynamical calculations require no-slip boundary conditions.
Numerical calculations of turbulence, as well as theoretical turbulence closure
techniques, often depend upon a spectral decomposition of the flow fields.
However, such calculations have been limited to two-dimensional situations.
Here we present a method that yields orthogonal decompositions of
incompressible, three-dimensional flow fields and apply it to periodic
cylindrical and spherical no-slip boundaries.
