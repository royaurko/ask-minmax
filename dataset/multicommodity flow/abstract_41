We prove that there exists an open and dense subset of the incompressible
3-flows of class C^2 such that, if a flow in this set has a positive volume
regular invariant subset with dominated splitting for the linear Poincar\'e
flow, then it must be an Anosov flow. With this result we are able to extend
the dichotomies of Bochi-Ma\~n\'e and of Newhouse for flows with singularities.
That is we obtain for a residual subset of the C^1 incompressible flows on
3-manifolds that: (i) either all Lyapunov exponents are zero or the flow is
Anosov, and (ii) either the flow is Anosov or else the elliptic periodic points
are dense in the manifold.
