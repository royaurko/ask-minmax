We analyze published data from the ALICE Collaboration in order to obtain the
first extraction of the recently-proposed rapidity-even directed flow
observable v1. An accounting of the correlation due to the conservation of
transverse momentum restores the factorization seen by ALICE in all other
Fourier harmonics and thus indicates that the remaining correlation gives a
reliable measurement of directed flow. We then carry out the first viscous
hydrodynamic calculation of directed flow, and show that it is less sensitive
to viscosity than higher harmonics. This allows for a direct extraction of the
dipole asymmetry of the initial state, providing a strict constraint on the
non-equilibrium dynamics of the early-time system. A prediction is then made
for v1 in Au-Au collisions at RHIC.
