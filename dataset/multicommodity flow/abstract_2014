We investigate the shear viscosity of photons in a strongly coupled quark
gluon plasma (QGP). We find that the shear viscosity due to the photon-parton
scattering up to the leading order of electromagnetic coupling is suppressed
when the coupling of the QGP is increased, which stems from the blue-shift of
the thermal-photon spectrum at strong coupling. In addition, the shear
viscosity rapidly increases near the deconfinement transition. We argue that
the suppression of the photon shear viscosity in the QGP phase could lead to an
enhancement of the anisotropic flow of direct photons in heavy ion collisions.
