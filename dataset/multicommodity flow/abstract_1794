A theory of two-dimensional plasma evolution with Beltrami-like flow and
field due to baroclinic effect has been presented. Particular solution of the
nonlinear two-fluid equations is obtained. This simple model can explain the
generation of magnetic field without assuming the presence of a seed in the
system. Coupled field and flow naturally grow together. The theory has been
applied to estimate B-field in laser-induced plasmas and the result is in good
agreement with experimental values.
