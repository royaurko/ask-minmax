We present preliminary results of imaging and spectral analysis of the
cluster A496 with the S3 chip on-board the Chandra satellite. We confirm the
presence of a cooling flow and radial gradients in elemental abundances. The
cluster's core has clear signs of substructures (sharp edges, cavities),
similar to those recently found in other cooling flow clusters. The O/Fe ratio
distribution indicates that the gas in the core of the cluster is significantly
enriched by SN Ia ejecta.
