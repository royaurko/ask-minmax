The purpose of the present work is to trace parallels between the known
inertia forces in fluid dynamics with the inertia forces in electromagnetism
that are known to induce resistance forces on masses both due to acceleration
and at constant velocity. It is shown that the force exerted on a particle by
an ideal fluid produces two effects: i) resistance to acceleration and, ii) an
increase of mass with velocity. These resistance forces arise due to the fluid
dragged by the particle, where the bare mass of the particle at rest changes
when in motion ("dressed" particle). It is demonstrated that the vector
potential created by a charged particle in motion acts as an ideal space flow
that surrounds the particle. The interaction between the particle and the
entrained space flow gives rise to the observed properties of inertia and the
relativistic increase of mass. Parallels are made between the inertia property
of matter, electromagnetism and the hydrodynamic drag in potential flow.
Accordingly, in this framework the non resistance of a particle in uniform
motion through an ideal fluid (D'Alembert's paradox) corresponds to Newton's
first law. The law of inertia suggests that the physical vacuum can be modeled
as an ideal fluid, agreeing with the space-time ideal fluid approach from
general relativity.
