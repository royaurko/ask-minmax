When heavy ions collide at ultra-relativistic energy, thousands of particles
are emitted and it is reasonable to attempt to use hydrodynamic descriptions,
with suitable initial conditions, to describe the time evolution of the
collisons. In the longitudinal direction pions seem to exhibit Landau flow.
This simple model assumes that all the entropy in the collisions is created the
instant the two Lorentz contracted nuclei overlap and that the system then
expands adiabatically. The system also displays radial and elliptic flow.
Radial flow is manifested as a broadening of the pT distributions with respect
to pp collisions. It is typically thought to result from multiple scattering of
partons or hadrons before dynamic freeze-out. Elliptic flow occurs when heavy
ions do not collide exactly head on. The initial geometrical asymetry is
translated into a momentum asymetry via pressure gradiants. Since these
gradients are self quenching, strong elliptic flow is thought to be linked to
early thermalization and a large initial pressure. Using the concept of
limiting fragmentation we attempt to sketch a link between the initial and
final states of relativistic heavy ion collisions using new preliminary data
from the BRAHMS collaboration on elliptic and radial flow.
