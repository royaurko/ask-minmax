A more restrictively general stability criterion of two-dimensional inviscid
parallel flow is obtained analytically. First, a sufficient criterion for
stability is found as either $-\mu_1<\frac{U''}{U-U_s}<0$ or
$0<\frac{U''}{U-U_s}$ in the flow, where $U_s$ is the velocity at inflection
point, $\mu_1$ is the eigenvalue of Poincar\'{e}'s problem. Second, this
criterion is generalized to barotropic geophysical flows in $\beta$ plane.
Based on the criteria, the flows are are divided into different categories of
stable flows, which may simplify the further investigations. And the
connections between present criteria and Arnol'd's nonlinear criteria are
discussed. These results extend the former criteria obtained by Rayleigh,
Tollmien and Fj{\o}rtoft and would intrigue future research on the mechanism of
hydrodynamic instability.
