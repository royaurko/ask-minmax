We suggest an approach to microrheology based on optical traps in order to
measure fluid fluxes around singular points of fluid flows. We experimentally
demonstrate this technique, applying it to the characterization of controlled
flows produced by a set of birefringent spheres spinning due to the transfer of
light angular momentum. Unlike the previous techniques, this method is able to
distinguish between a singular point in a complex flow and the absence of flow
at all; furthermore it permits us to characterize the stability of the singular
point.
