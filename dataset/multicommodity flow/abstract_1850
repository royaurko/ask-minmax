We develop an analytic formalism and derive new exact relations that express
the short-time dispersion of fluid particles via the single-time velocity
correlation functions in homogeneous isotropic and incompressible turbulence.
The formalism establishes a bridge between single-time Eulerian and long-time
Lagrangian pictures of turbulent flows. In particular, we derive an exact
formula for a short-term analog of the long-time Richardson law, and we
identify a conservation law of turbulent dispersion which is true even in
non-stationary turbulence.
