In this paper, we first construct a model for free surface flows that takes
into account the air entrainment by a system of four partial differential
equations. We derive it by taking averaged values of gas and fluid velocities
on the cross surface flow in the Euler equations (incompressible for the fluid
and compressible for the gas). The obtained system is conditionally hyperbolic.
Then, we propose a mathematical kinetic interpretation of this system to
finally construct a two-layer kinetic scheme in which a special treatment for
the "missing" boundary condition is performed. Several numerical tests on
closed water pipes are performed and the impact of the loss of hyperbolicity is
discussed and illustrated. Finally, we make a numerical study of the order of
the kinetic method in the case where the system is mainly non hyperbolic. This
provides a useful stability result when the spatial mesh size goes to zero.
