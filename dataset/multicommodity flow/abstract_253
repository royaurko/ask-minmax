The Nagel-Schreckenberg traffic flow model shows a transition from a free
flow regime to a jammed regime for increasing car density. The measurement of
the dynamical structure factor offers the chance to observe the evolution of
jams without the necessity to define a car to be jammed or not. Above the
jamming transition the dynamical structure factor exhibits for a given k-value
two maxima corresponding to the separation of the system into the free flow
phase and jammed phase. We obtain from a finite-size scaling analysis of the
smallest jam mode that approaching the transition long range correlations of
the jams occur.
