The non-equilibrium structural and dynamical properties of flexible polymers
confined in a square microchannel and exposed to a Poiseuille flow are
investigated by mesoscale simulations. The chain length and the flow strength
are systematically varied. Two transport regimes are identified, corresponding
to weak and strong confinement. For strong confinement, the transport
properties are independent of polymer length. The analysis of the long-time
tumbling dynamics of short polymers yields non-periodic motion with a sublinear
dependence on the flow strength. We find distinct differences for
conformational as well as dynamical properties from results obtained for simple
shear flow.
