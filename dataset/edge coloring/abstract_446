In this note, a novel BCS-type formalism is constructed in the framework of a
schematic QCD inspired quark model, having in mind the description of color
symmetrical superconducting states. The physical properties of the BCS vacuum
(average numbers of quarks of different colors) remain unchanged under an
arbitrary color rotation. In the usual approach to color superconductivity, the
pairing correlations affect only the quasi-particle states of two colors, the
single particle states of the third color remaining unaffected by the pairing
correlations. In the theory of color symmetrical superconductivity here
proposed, the pairing correlations affect symmetrically the quasi-particle
states of the three colors and vanishing net color-charge is automatically
insured. It is found that the groundstate energy of the color symmetrical
sector of the Bonn model is well approximated by the average energy of the
color symmetrical superconducting state proposed here.
