We consider the edge dynamics of a compact, fully spin polarized state at
filling factor $\nu=1$. We show that there are two sets of collective
excitations localized near the edge: the much studied, gapless, edge
magnetoplasmon but also an additional edge spin wave that splits off below the
bulk spin wave continuum. We show that both of these excitations can soften at
finite wave-vectors as the potential confining the system is softened, thereby
leading to edge reconstruction by spin texture or charge density wave
formation. We note that a commonly employed model of the edge confining
potential is non-generic in that it systematically underestimates the texturing
instability.
