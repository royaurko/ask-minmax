We propose three strategies for Presenter in on-line graph coloring games.
The first one constructs bipartite graphs and forces any on-line coloring
algorithm to use $2\log_2 n - 10$ colors, where $n$ is the number of vertices
in the constructed graph. This is best possible up to an additive constant. The
second strategy constructs triangle-free graphs and forces
$\Omega(n^\frac{1}{2})$ colors. The third one constructs graphs that contain
neither $C_3$ nor $C_5$ as a subgraph and forces $\Omega(\frac{n}{\log
n}^\frac{1}{3})$ colors. The existence of an on-line algorithm using $o(n)$
colors on triangle-free graphs remains a tantalizing open problem.
