We utilize density functional theory to calculate the edge energy and edge
stress for monolayer MoS$_{2}$ nanoribbons. In contrast to previous reports for
graphene, for both armchair and zigzag chiralities, the edge stresses for
MoS$_{2}$ nanoribbons are found to be tensile, indicating that their lowest
energy configuration is one of compression in which Mo-S bond lengths are
shorter than those in a bulk, periodic MoS$_{2}$ monolayer. The edge energy and
edge stress is found to converge for both chiralities for nanoribbon widths
larger than about 1 nm.
