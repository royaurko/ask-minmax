The b-chromatic number of a graph G is the largest integer k such that G has
a coloring of the vertices in k color classes such that every color class
contains a vertex that has a neighbour in all other color classes. We
characterize the class of chordal graphs for which the b-chromatic number is
equal to the chromatic number for every induced subgraph.
