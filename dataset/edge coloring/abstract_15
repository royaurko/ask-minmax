Let G be a finite planar connected graph without loops or multiple edges. All
minimal circuits except atmost one - say C* - are triangles. Let k be the
number of vertices of C*. There are at least 2**(k-3) colorings of the vertices
of G with four colors, vertices connected by edges colored differently. These
colorings are different on C*.
