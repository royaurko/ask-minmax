In 2009, Blagojevic, Matschke & Ziegler established the first tight colored
Tverberg theorem, but no lower bounds for the number of colored Tverberg
partitions. We develop a colored version of our previous results (2008), and we
extend our results from the uncolored version: Evenness and non-trivial lower
bounds for the number of colored Tverberg partitions. This follows from similar
results on the number of colored Birch partitions.
