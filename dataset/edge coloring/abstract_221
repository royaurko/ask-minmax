We present a linear-time algorithm for deciding first-order (FO) properties
in classes of graphs with bounded expansion, a notion recently introduced by
Nesetril and Ossona de Mendez. This generalizes several results from the
literature, because many natural classes of graphs have bounded expansion:
graphs of bounded tree-width, all proper minor-closed classes of graphs, graphs
of bounded degree, graphs with no subgraph isomorphic to a subdivision of a
fixed graph, and graphs that can be drawn in a fixed surface in such a way that
each edge crosses at most a constant number of other edges. We deduce that
there is an almost linear-time algorithm for deciding FO properties in classes
of graphs with locally bounded expansion.
  More generally, we design a dynamic data structure for graphs belonging to a
fixed class of graphs of bounded expansion. After a linear-time initialization
the data structure allows us to test an FO property in constant time, and the
data structure can be updated in constant time after addition/deletion of an
edge, provided the list of possible edges to be added is known in advance and
their simultaneous addition results in a graph in the class. All our results
also hold for relational structures and are based on the seminal result of
Nesetril and Ossona de Mendez on the existence of low tree-depth colorings.
