We consider when the universal $C^*$-algebras associated to edge-colored
directed graphs are nuclear. Specifically, we consider first finite graphs and
show that the universal $C^*$-algebra is exact if and only if certain natural
corners in the $C^*$-algebra are exact. We then analyze such corners to
determine when they give rise to exact $C^*$-algebras. Then we use direct
limits to extend these results to the case when the separated graph is
row-finite.
