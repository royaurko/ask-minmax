Magnitude-limited samples of spiral galaxies drawn from the Ursa Major and
Pisces clusters are used to determine their extinction properties as a function
of inclination. Imaging photometry is available for 87 spirals in B,R,I and K'
bands. Extinction causes systematic scatter in color-magnitude plots. A strong
luminosity dependence is found. Relative edge-on to face-on extinction of up to
1.7 mag is found at B for the most luminous galaxies but is unmeasurably small
for faint galaxies. At R the differential absorption with inclination reaches
1.3 mag, at I it reaches 1.0 mag, and at K' the differential absorption can in
the extreme be as great as 0.3 mag.
  The luminosity dependence of reddening can be translated into a dependence on
rotation rate which is a distance-independent observable. Hence, corrections
can be made that are useful for distance measurements. The strong dependence of
the corrections on luminosity act to steepen luminosity-linewidth correlations.
The effect is greatest toward the blue, with the consequence that
luminosity-linewidth slope dependencies are now only weakly a function of
color.
