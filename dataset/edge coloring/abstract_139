We present measurements of reddening due to dust using the colors of stars in
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We measure the color of main sequence
turn-off stars by finding the "blue tip" of the stellar locus: the prominent
blue edge in the distribution of stellar colors. The method is sensitive to
color changes of order 18, 12, 7, and 8 mmag of reddening in the colors u-g,
g-r, r-i, and i-z, respectively, in regions measuring 90' by 14'. We present
maps of the blue tip colors in each of these bands over the entire SDSS
footprint, including the new dusty southern Galactic cap data provided by the
SDSS-III. The results disfavor the best fit O'Donnell (1994) and Cardelli et
al. (1989) reddening laws, but are well described by a Fitzpatrick (1999)
reddening law with R_V = 3.1. The SFD dust map is found to trace the dust well,
but overestimates reddening by factors of 1.4, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4 in u-g, g-r,
r-i, and i-z, largely due to the adopted reddening law. In select dusty regions
of the sky, we find evidence for problems in the SFD temperature correction. A
dust map normalization difference of 15% between the Galactic north and south
sky may be due to these dust temperature errors.
