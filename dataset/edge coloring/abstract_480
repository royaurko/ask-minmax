Polar crown prominences are made of chromospheric plasma partially circling
the Suns poles between 60 and 70 degree latitude. We aim to diagnose the 3D
dynamics of a polar crown prominence using high cadence EUV images from the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/AIA at 304 and 171A and the Ahead spacecraft
of the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO-A)/EUVI at 195A. Using
time series across specific structures we compare flows across the disk in 195A
with the prominence dynamics seen on the limb. The densest prominence material
forms vertical columns which are separated by many tens of Mm and connected by
dynamic bridges of plasma that are clearly visible in 304/171A two-color
images. We also observe intermittent but repetitious flows with velocity 15
km/s in the prominence that appear to be associated with EUV bright points on
the solar disk. The boundary between the prominence and the overlying cavity
appears as a sharp edge. We discuss the structure of the coronal cavity seen
both above and around the prominence. SDO/HMI and GONG magnetograms are used to
infer the underlying magnetic topology. The evolution and structure of the
prominence with respect to the magnetic field seems to agree with the filament
linkage model.
