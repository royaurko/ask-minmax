The well-known Steinberg's conjecture postulates that every planar graph
without 4-cycles and 5-cycles is 3-colorable. The list-coloring version of this
claim is known to be false. However, we prove that excluding cycles of lengths
4 to 8 is sufficient to guarantee 3-choosability of a planar graph, thus
answering a question of Borodin. For the proof, we use a new variant of graph
coloring called correspondence coloring which generalizes list coloring and
allows for reductions previously only possible for ordinary coloring.
