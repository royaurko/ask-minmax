A facial parity edge coloring of a 2-edge connected plane graph is an edge
coloring where no two consecutive edges of a facial walk of any face receive
the same color. Additionally, for every face f and every color c either no edge
or an odd number of edges incident to f are colored by c. Czap, Jendrol',
Kardo\v{s} and Sotak showed that every 2-edge connected plane graph admits a
facial parity edge coloring with at most 20 colors. We improve this bound to 16
colors.
