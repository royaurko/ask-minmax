Recently, a type of GUT models with an extra dimension in AdS space can
successfully solve the doublet-triplet problem, maintain proton stability, and
allow the colored Higgs bosons and colored Higgsinos in the TeV mass region. We
study the hadronic production and detection of these TeV colored Higgsinos and
Higgs bosons. If the colored Higgsino is lighter than the colored Higgs boson,
the colored Higgs boson will decay into a colored Higgsino and a gluino or a
gravitino, and vice versa. The signatures would be stable massive charged
particles with jets or missing energies.
