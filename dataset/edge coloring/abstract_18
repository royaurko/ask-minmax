An edge-coloring of a graph $G$ with colors $1,\ldots,t$ is an interval
$t$-coloring if all colors are used, and the colors of edges incident to each
vertex of $G$ are distinct and form an interval of integers. A graph $G$ is
interval colorable if it has an interval $t$-coloring for some positive integer
$t$. The problem of deciding whether a bipartite graph is interval colorable is
NP-complete. The smallest known examples of interval non-colorable bipartite
graphs have $19$ vertices. On the other hand it is known that the bipartite
graphs on at most $14$ vertices are interval colorable. In this work we observe
that several classes of bipartite graphs of small order have an interval
coloring. In particular, we show that all bipartite graphs on $15$ vertices are
interval colorable.
