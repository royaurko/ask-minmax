We derive the canonical structure and hamiltonian for arbitrary deformations
of a higher-dimensional (quantum Hall) droplet of fermions with spin or color
on a general phase space manifold. Gauge fields are introduced via a
Kaluza-Klein construction on the phase space. The emerging theory is a
nonlinear higher-dimensional generalization of the gauged Kac-Moody algebra. To
leading order in h-bar this reproduces the edge state chiral Wess-Zumino-Witten
action of the droplet.
