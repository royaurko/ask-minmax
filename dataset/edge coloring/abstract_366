We present the preliminary detection of a stellar halo in the nearby, edge-on
galaxy, NGC 4244. Using data from the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera
for Surveys (HST/ACS), we have examined number counts of red giant branch (RGB)
stars along the minor axis of the galaxy out to 10 kpc, with a limiting surface
brightness of mu_R ~ 31 mag/arcsec^2. At distances more than 2.5 kpc above the
disk, a second stellar component is clearly visible. This component is well fit
by either an exponential or a power law. The best-fit exponential scale height
is similar to the scale length of the galaxy disk, suggesting that we are
indeed detecting a halo component. Furthermore, the color of the RGB stars
above 2.5 kpc are significantly bluer than those in the disk, suggesting a more
metal-poor population. Outside the local group, this finding represents one of
the first detections of a resolved stellar halo in a spiral galaxy.
