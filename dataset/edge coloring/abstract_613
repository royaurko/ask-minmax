Given an undirected graph, each of the two end-vertices of an edge can own
the edge. Call a vertex poor, if it owns at most one edge. We give a polynomial
time algorithm for the problem of finding an assignment of owners to the edges
which minimizes the number of poor vertices. In the terminology of graph
orientation, this means finding an orientation for the edges of a graph
minimizing the number of edges with out-degree at most 1, and answers a
question of Asahiro Jansson, Miyano, Ono (2014).
