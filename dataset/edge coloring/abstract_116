For every even positive integer $k\ge 4$ let $f(n,k)$ denote the minimim
number of colors required to color the edges of the $n$-dimensional cube $Q_n$,
so that the edges of every copy of $k$-cycle $C_k$ receive $k$ distinct colors.
Faudree, Gy\'arf\'as, Lesniak and Schelp proved that $f(n,4)=n$ for $n=4$ or
$n>5$. We consider larger $k$ and prove that if $k \equiv 0$ (mod 4), then
there are positive constants $c_1, c_2$ depending only on $k$ such that
$$c_1n^{k/4} < f(n,k) < c_2 n^{k/4}.$$ Our upper bound uses an old construction
of Bose and Chowla of generalized Sidon sets. For $k \equiv 2$ (mod 4), the
situation seems more complicated. For the smallest case k=6 we show that $$n
\le f(n, 6) < n^{1+o(1)}.$$ The upper bound is obtained from Behrend's
construction of a subset of the integers with no three term arithmetic
progression.
