Two aspects of quark matter at high density are addressed: one is color
superconductivity and the other is ferromagnetism. We are mainly concerned with
the latter and its relation to color superconductivity, which we call "color
magnetic superconductivity". The relation of ferromagnetism and chiral symmetry
restoration is also discussed.
