Color distortion can introduce a significant damage in visual quality
perception, however, most of existing reduced-reference quality measures are
designed for grayscale images. In this paper, we consider a basic extension of
well-known image-statistics based quality assessment measures to color images.
In order to evaluate the impact of color information on the measures
efficiency, two color spaces are investigated: RGB and CIELAB. Results of an
extensive evaluation using TID 2013 benchmark demonstrates that significant
improvement can be achieved for a great number of distortion type when the
CIELAB color representation is used.
