Doors are important landmarks for indoor mobile robot navigation and also
assist blind people to independently access unfamiliar buildings. Most existing
algorithms of door detection are limited to work for familiar environments
because of restricted assumptions about color, texture and shape. In this paper
we propose a novel approach which employs feature based classification and uses
the Kohonen Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for the purpose of door detection.
Generic and stable features are used for the training of SOM that increase the
performance significantly: concavity, bottom-edge intensity profile and door
edges. To validate the robustness and generalizability of our method, we
collected a large dataset of real world door images from a variety of
environments and different lighting conditions. The algorithm achieves more
than 95% detection which demonstrates that our door detection method is generic
and robust with variations of color, texture, occlusions, lighting condition,
scales, and viewpoints.
