Analytical studies of the effect of edge decoration on the energy spectrum of
semi-infinite one-dimensional (1D) lattice chain with Peierls phase transition
and zigzag edged graphene (ZEG) are presented by means of transfer matrix
method, in the frame of which the sufficient and necessary conditions for the
existence of the edge states are determined. For 1D lattice chain, the
zero-energy edge state exists when Peierls phase transition happens regardless
whether the decoration exists or not, while the non-zero-energy edge states can
be induced and manipulated through adjusting the edge decoration. On the other
hand, the semi-infinite ZEG model with nearest-neighbor interaction can be
mapped into the 1D lattice chain case. The non-zero-energy edge states can be
induced by the decoration as well, and we can obtain the condition of the
decoration on the edge for the existence of the novel edge states.
