Under what conditions is an edge present in a social network at time t likely
to decay or persist by some future time t + Delta(t)? Previous research
addressing this issue suggests that the network range of the people involved in
the edge, the extent to which the edge is embedded in a surrounding structure,
and the age of the edge all play a role in edge decay. This paper uses weighted
data from a large-scale social network built from cell-phone calls in an 8-week
period to determine the importance of edge weight for the decay/persistence
process. In particular, we study the relative predictive power of directed
weight, embeddedness, newness, and range (measured as outdegree) with respect
to edge decay and assess the effectiveness with which a simple decision tree
and logistic regression classifier can accurately predict whether an edge that
was active in one time period continues to be so in a future time period. We
find that directed edge weight, weighted reciprocity and time-dependent
measures of edge longevity are highly predictive of whether we classify an edge
as persistent or decayed, relative to the other types of factors at the dyad
and neighborhood level.
