Using a simple LCAO model by Harrison, we have qualitatively studied the edge
state of bilayer phosphorene, which is a unit structure of the layered crystal
of black phosphorus. This model successfully reproduces the isolated edge state
in the bulk gap in monolayer phosphorene. In bilayer phosphorene, however, it
shows that edge states are almost buried in the valence band and there is no
isolated midgap edge state at the zigzag edge. Since the buried edge state
works as acceptor, holes are doped from the edge state into the bulk. This
gives a possible explanation for p-type conduction in undoped black phosphorus.
Under the vertical electric field, the intrinsic hole doping is reduced because
a part of edge states move into the gap. These features of bilayer phosphorene
might be better suited for device application.
