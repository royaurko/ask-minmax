In this paper, we propose a new generalization of Ramsey numbers which seems
to be untreated in the literature. Instead of requiring the existence of a
monochromatic clique, we consider the existence of a clique which avoids one of
the colors in an edge coloring. These numbers are called complementary Ramsey
numbers, and we derive their basic properties. We also establish their
connections to graph factorizations.
