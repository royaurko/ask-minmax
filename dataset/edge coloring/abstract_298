We use density functional theory to determine the equilibrium shape of
graphene flakes, through the calculation of the edge orientation dependence of
the edge energy and edge stress of graphene nanoribbons. The edge energy is a
nearly linear function of edge orientation angle; increasing from the armchair
orientation to the zigzag orientation. Reconstruction of the zigzag edge lowers
its energy to less than that of the armchair edge. The edge stress for all edge
orientations is compressive, however, reconstruction of the zigzag edge reduces
this edge stress to near zero. Hydrogen adsorption is favorable for all edge
orientations; dramatically lowering all edge energies and all edge stresses. It
also removes the reconstruction of the zigzag edge. Using the new edge energy
data, we determine the equilibrium shape of a graphene sheet (with
unreconstructed edges) to be hexagonal with straight armchair edges in the
presence and absence of hydrogen. However, zigzag edge reconstruction produces
graphene flakes with a six-fold symmetry, but with rounded edges. This shape is
dominated by near zigzag edges. The compressive edge stresses will lead to edge
buckling (out-of-the-plane of the graphene sheet) for all edge orientations, in
the absence of hydrogen. Exposing the graphene flake to hydrogen dramatically
decreases the buckling amplitude.
