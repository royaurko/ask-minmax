This paper presents a new approach for contrast enhancement of spinal cord
medical images based on multirate scheme incorporated into multiscale retinex
algorithm. The proposed work here uses HSV color space, since HSV color space
separates color details from intensity. The enhancement of medical image is
achieved by down sampling the original image into five versions, namely, tiny,
small, medium, fine, and normal scale. This is due to the fact that the each
versions of the image when independently enhanced and reconstructed results in
enormous improvement in the visual quality. Further, the contrast stretching
and MultiScale Retinex (MSR) techniques are exploited in order to enhance each
of the scaled version of the image. Finally, the enhanced image is obtained by
combining each of these scales in an efficient way to obtain the composite
enhanced image. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is validated by using
a wavelet energy metric in the wavelet domain. Reconstructed image using
proposed method highlights the details (edges and tissues), reduces image noise
(Gaussian and Speckle) and improves the overall contrast. The proposed
algorithm also enhances sharp edges of the tissue surrounding the spinal cord
regions which is useful for diagnosis of spinal cord lesions. Elaborated
experiments are conducted on several medical images and results presented show
that the enhanced medical pictures are of good quality and is found to be
better compared with other researcher methods.
