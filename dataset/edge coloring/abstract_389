Falling water drops from a dripping faucet, illuminated from above, exhibit a
row of bright strips of light, a few centimeters apart at a fixed distance
below the faucet. Flash photographs of the drops show that they are oblate in
shape when the flashes occur and the bright flashes of light originate from the
edge of the drop that is on the opposite of the overhead light source. Here we
show that that the spots result from the same internal reflection that gives
rise to the rainbow in a cloud of spherical drops . The periodic flashes
reflect the capillary oscillations of the liquid drop between alternating
prolate and oblate shapes and the dramatic enhancement in the oblate phase
result from a combination of several optical effects. Ray tracing analysis
shows that the flashes occur when the rainbow angle, which is 42 $\deg$ in
spherical drops, but sweeps over a wide range between 35 $\deg$ and 65 $\deg$
for typical ellipsoidal drops and the intensity of the caustic is strongly
enhanced in the oblate phase. This phenomenon can be seen in all brightly lit
water sprays with millimeter size drops and is responsible for their white
color.
