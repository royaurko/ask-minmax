We denote by $\chi$ g (G) the game chromatic number of a graph G, which is
the smallest number of colors Alice needs to win the coloring game on G. We
know from Montassier et al. [M. Montassier, P. Ossona de Mendez, A. Raspaud and
X. Zhu, Decomposing a graph into forests, J. Graph Theory Ser. B, 102(1):38-52,
2012] and, independantly, from Wang and Zhang, [Y. Wang and Q. Zhang.
Decomposing a planar graph with girth at least 8 into a forest and a matching,
Discrete Maths, 311:844-849, 2011] that planar graphs with girth at least 8
have game chromatic number at most 5. One can ask if this bound of 5 can be
improved for a sufficiently large girth. In this paper, we prove that it
cannot. More than that, we prove that there are cactuses CT (i.e. graphs whose
edges only belong to at most one cycle each) having $\chi$ g (CT) = 5 despite
having arbitrary large girth, and even arbitrary large distance between its
cycles.
