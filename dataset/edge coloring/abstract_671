The well-known three distance theorem states that there are at most three
distinct gaps between consecutive elements in the set of the first n multiples
of any real number. We generalise this theorem to higher dimensions under a
suitable formulation.
  The three distance theorem can be thought of as a statement about champions
in a tournament. The players in the tournament are edges between pairs of
multiples of the given real number, two edges play each other if and only if
they overlap, and an edge loses only against edges of shorter length that it
plays against. Defeated edges may play (and defeat) other overlapping edges.
According to the three distance theorem, there are at most three distinct
values for the lengths of undefeated edges. In the plane and in higher
dimensions, we consider fractional parts of multiples of a vector of real
numbers, two edges play if their projections along any axis overlap, and
champions are defined as before. In the plane, there are at most 11 values for
the lengths of undefeated edges.
