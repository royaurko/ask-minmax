I answer an open question left by Gui-Song Li in "On self-intersections of
immersed surfaces" (AMS Proceedings, Volume 126, 1998, pp.3721-3726.)
  The intersection graph $M(i)$ of a generic surface $i:F \to S^3$ is the set
of values which are either singularities or intersections. It is a multigraph
whose edges are transverse intersections of two surfaces and whose vertices are
triple intersections and cross-caps. $M(i)$ has an additional structure which
Li called "a daisy graph." If F is oriented then the orientation further
refines $M(i)$'s structure into what Li called an "arrowed daisy graph."
  Li left the open question "which arrowed daisy graphs can be realized as the
intersection graph of an oriented generic surface?" The main theorem of this
article will answer this. I will also provide some generalizations and
extensions to this theorem in sections 4 and 5.
