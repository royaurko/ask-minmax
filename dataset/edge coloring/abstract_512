Color measurements and albedo distributions introduce non-intuitive
observational biases in size-color relationships among Kuiper Belt Objects
(KBOs) that cannot be disentangled without a well characterized sample
population with systematic photometry. Peixinho et al. report that the form of
the KBO color distribution varies with absolute magnitude, H. However, Tegler
et al. find that KBO color distributions are a property of object
classification. We construct synthetic models of observed KBO colors based on
two B-R color distribution scenarios: color distribution dependent on H
magnitude (H-Model) and color distribution based on object classification
(Class-Model). These synthetic B-R color distributions were modified to account
for observational flux biases. We compare our synthetic B-R distributions to
the observed 'Hot' and 'Cold' detected objects from the Canada-France Ecliptic
Plane Survey and the Meudon Multicolor Survey. For both surveys, the Hot
population color distribution rejects the H-Model, but is well described by the
Class-Model. The Cold objects reject the H-Model, but the Class-Model (while
not statistically rejected) also does not provide a compelling match for data.
Although we formally reject models where the structure of the color
distribution is a strong function of H magnitude, we also do not find that a
simple dependence of color distribution on orbit classification is sufficient
to describe the color distribution of classical KBOs.
