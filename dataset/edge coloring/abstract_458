We present results of an HST survey in Halpha and continuum filters of a
sample of H_2O megamaser galaxies compiled by Braatz et al., all of which
contain AGN. These observations allow us to study the AGN/host-galaxy
connection, e.g. study the relation between the parsec scale masing disk/torus,
bipolar outflows, and large scale properties of the galaxies such as dust
lanes, signs for interaction, and galaxy types. A number of galaxies indeed
show large-scale bi-polar Halpha structures which, however, are more
reminiscent of outflows then excitation cones. Most megamaser galaxies are
found in spiral galaxies. Only one galaxy in the original sample is known to be
an elliptical and one galaxy imaged by us shows clear signs of interactions. In
all cases we see evidence for obscuration of the nucleus (e.g. dust-lanes) in
our color maps and the disk galaxies are preferentially edge on. This suggests
that the nuclear masing disk has some relation to the large scale properties of
the galaxy and the dust distribution.
