We present results from fully general relativistic three-dimensional
numerical studies of thick-disk accretion onto a rapidly-rotating (Kerr) black
hole with a spin axis that is tilted (not aligned) with the angular momentum
vector of the disk. We initialize the problem with the solution for an aligned,
constant angular momentum, accreting thick disk, which is then allowed to
respond to the Lense-Thirring precession of the tilted black hole. The
precession causes the disk to warp, beginning at the inner edge and moving out
on roughly the Lense-Thirring precession timescale. The propagation of the warp
stops at a radius in the disk at which other dynamical timescales, primarily
the azimuthal sound-crossing time, become shorter than the precession time. At
this point, the warp effectively freezes into the disk and the evolution
becomes quasi-static, except in cases where the sound-crossing time in the bulk
of the disk is shorter than the local precession timescale. We see evidence
that such disks undergo near solid-body precession after the initial warping
has frozen in. Simultaneous to the warping of the disk, there is also a
tendency for the midplane to align with the symmetry plane of the black hole
due to the preferential accretion of the most tilted disk gas. This alignment
is not as pronounced, however, as it would be if more efficient angular
momentum transport (e.g. from viscosity or magneto-rotational instability) were
considered.
