We present a sample of 148 candidate RR Lyrae stars selected from Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) commissioning data for about 100 deg2 of sky surveyed
twice with Delta(t) = 1.9946 days. Although the faint magnitude limit of the
SDSS allows us to detect RR Lyrae stars to large galactocentric distances
(about 100 kpc, or r = 21), we find no candidates fainter than r = 20, i.e.
further than about 65 kpc from the Galactic center. On the assumption that all
148 candidates are indeed RR Lyrae stars (contamination by other species of
variable star is probably less than 10%), we find that their volume density has
roughly a power-law dependence on galactocentric radius, 1/R^(2.7+-0.2),
between 10 and 50 kpc, and drops abruptly at R = 50-60 kpc, possibly indicating
a sharp edge to the stellar halo as traced by RR Lyrae stars.
  The Galactic distribution of stars in this sample is very inhomogeneous and
shows a clump of over 70 stars at about 45 kpc from the Galactic center. This
clump is also detected in the distribution of nonvariable objects with RR Lyrae
star colors. When sources in the clump are excluded, the best power-law fit
becomes consistent with the 1/R^3 distribution found from surveys of bright RR
Lyrae stars. These results imply that the halo contains clumpy overdensities
inhomogeneously distributed within a smooth 1/R^3 background, with a possible
cutoff at about 50 kpc.
