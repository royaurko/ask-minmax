This paper surveys current technology and research in the area of digital
color imaging. In order to establish the background and lay down terminology,
fundamental concepts of color perception and measurement are first presented
us-ing vector-space notation and terminology. Present-day color recording and
reproduction systems are reviewed along with the common mathematical models
used for representing these devices. Algorithms for processing color images for
display and communication are surveyed, and a forecast of research trends is
attempted. An extensive bibliography is provided.
