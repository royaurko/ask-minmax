We study the edge magnetization of bilayer graphene ribbons with zigzag
edges. The presence of flat edge-state bands at the Fermi energy of undoped
bilayer, which gives rise to a strong peak in the density of states, makes
bilayer ribbons magnetic at the edges even for very small on-site electronic
repulsion. Working with the Hubbard model in the Hartree Fock approximation we
show that the magnetic structure in bilayer ribbons with zigzag edges is
ferromagnetic along the edge, involving sites of the two layers, and
antiferromagnetic between opposite edges. It is also shown that this magnetic
structure is a consequence of the nature of the edge states present in bilayer
ribbons with zigzag edges. Analogously to the monolayer case, edge site
magnetization as large as $m \approx0.2 \mu_{B}$ (per lattice site) even at
small on-site Hubbard repulsion $U \approx 0.3 {eV}$ is realized in nanometer
wide bilayer ribbons.
