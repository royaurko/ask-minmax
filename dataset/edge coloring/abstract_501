The cross section between a $c \bar c$ pair and a nucleon is small and
sensitive to the $c - \bar c$ separation if the pair is in a color-singlet
state, but very large and insensitive to the separation if it is in a
color-octet state. We use this property in an absorption model involving both
color components to deduce the color structure of $c \bar c$ pairs produced in
$p(B)A \to \psi X$ reactions. Our analysis shows that the NA3, NA38 and E772
data are not inconsistent with the theoretical picture that color-octet and
color-singlet precursors are produced in roughly equal proportions if the
produced color-singlet precursors are pointlike and transparent. However, if
the color-singlet precursors are not transparent but have a cross section of a
few mb, these data do show a definite preference for a larger fraction of
color-singlet precursors. In either case, the color-octet fraction increases
with $x_F$, approaching unity as $x_F$ becomes large.
