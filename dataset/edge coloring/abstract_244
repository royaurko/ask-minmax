An ordered graph is a pair $\mathcal{G}=(G,\prec)$ where $G$ is a graph and
$\prec$ is a total ordering of its vertices. The ordered Ramsey number
$Ro(\mathcal{G};c)$ is the minimum number $N$ such that every ordered complete
graph with $N$ vertices and with edges colored by $c$ colors contains a
monochromatic copy of $\mathcal{G}$.
  In contrast with the case of unordered graphs, we show that there are
arbitrarily large ordered matchings $\mathcal{M}_n$ on $n$ vertices for which
$Ro(\mathcal{M}_n;2)$ is super-polynomial in $n$. This implies that ordered
Ramsey numbers of the same graph can grow super-polynomially in the size of the
graph in one ordering and remain linear in another ordering.
  We also prove that the ordered Ramsey number $R(\mathcal{G};2)$ is polynomial
in the number of vertices of $\mathcal{G}$ if $\mathcal{G}$ has edges of
constant length or if $\mathcal{G}$ is an ordered graph of constant degeneracy
and constant interval chromatic number.
  For a few special classes of ordered paths, stars or matchings, we give
asymptotically tight bounds on their ordered Ramsey numbers. For so called
monotone cycles we compute their ordered Ramsey numbers exactly. This result
implies exact formulas for geometric Ramsey numbers of cycles introduced by
K\'arolyi et al.
