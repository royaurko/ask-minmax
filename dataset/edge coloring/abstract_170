We indicate that Heron's formula (which relates the square of the area of a
triangle to a quartic function of its edge lengths) can be interpreted as a
scissors congruence in 4-dimensional space. In the process of demonstrating
this, we examine a number of decompositions of hypercubes,
hyper-parallelograms, and other elementary 4-dimensional solids.
