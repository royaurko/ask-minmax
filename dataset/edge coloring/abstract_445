A simultaneous embedding with fixed edges (SEFE) of two planar graphs $R$ and
$B$ is a pair of plane drawings of $R$ and $B$ that coincide when restricted to
the common vertices and edges of $R$ and $B$. We show that whenever $R$ and $B$
admit a SEFE, they also admit a SEFE in which every edge is a polygonal curve
with few bends and every pair of edges has few crossings. Specifically: (1) if
$R$ and $B$ are trees then one bend per edge and four crossings per edge pair
suffice (and one bend per edge is sometimes necessary), (2) if $R$ is a planar
graph and $B$ is a tree then six bends per edge and eight crossings per edge
pair suffice, and (3) if $R$ and $B$ are planar graphs then six bends per edge
and sixteen crossings per edge pair suffice. Our results improve on a paper by
Grilli et al. (GD'14), which proves that nine bends per edge suffice, and on a
paper by Chan et al. (GD'14), which proves that twenty-four crossings per edge
pair suffice.
