We report the discovery of two symmetric spiral arms in the near-infrared
(NIR) images of the starburst galaxy M82. The spiral arms are recovered when an
axi-symmetric exponential disk is subtracted from the NIR images. The arms
emerge from the ends of the NIR bar and can be traced up to three disk
scalelengths. The winding of the arms is consistent with an m=2 logarithmic
spiral mode of pitch angle 14 degrees. The arms are bluer than the disk in
spite of their detection on the NIR images. If the northern side of the galaxy
is nearer to us, as is normally assumed, the observed sense of rotation implies
trailing arms. The nearly edge-on orientation, high disk surface brightness,
and the presence of a complex network of dusty filaments in the optical images,
are responsible for the lack of detection of the arms in previous studies.
