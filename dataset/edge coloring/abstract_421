Change of the bonding environment at the free edges of graphene monolayer
leads to excess edge energy and edge force, depending on the edge morphology
(zigzag or armchair). By using a reactive empirical bond-order potential and
atomistic simulations, we show that the excess edge energy in free-standing
graphene nanoribbons can be partially relaxed by both in-plane and out-of-plane
deformation. The excess edge energy and edge force are calculated for graphene
nanoribbons with parallel zigzag or armchair edges. Depending on the
longitudinal constraint, the compressive edge force leads to either in-plane
elongation of the ribbon or out-of-plane buckling deformation. In the former
case, the longitudinal strain is inversely proportional to the ribbon width. In
the latter case, energy minimization predicts an intrinsic wavelength for edge
buckling to be 6.2 nm along the zigzag edge and 8.0 nm along the armchair edge.
For graphene nanoribbons of width less than the intrinsic wavelength,
interaction between the two free edges becomes significant, leading to
anti-phase correlation of the buckling waves.
