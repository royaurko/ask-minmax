We present a series of statistical tests using homogeneous data and
measurements for a sample of Seyfert galaxies. These galaxies were selected
from mostly isotropic properties, their far infrared fluxes and warm infrared
colors, which provide a considerable advantage over the criteria used by most
investigators in the past, like ultraviolet excess. Our results provide strong
support for a Unified Model in which Seyferts 2's contain a torus seen more
edge-on than in Seyferts 1's and show that previous results showing the
opposite were most likely due to selection effects.
