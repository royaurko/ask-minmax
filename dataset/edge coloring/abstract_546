The Color to Gray and Back transformation watermarking with a secrete key is
considered. Color is embedded into the bit planes of the luminosity component
of the YUV color space with the help of a block algorithm that allows using not
only the least significant bits. An application of the problem of distributing
color digital images from a data base among legitimate users is discussed. The
proposed protocol can protect original images from uncontributorized copying.
