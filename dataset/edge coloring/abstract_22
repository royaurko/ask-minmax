Drawings of non-planar graphs always result in edge crossings. When there are
many edges crossing at small angles, it is often difficult to follow these
edges, because of the multiple visual paths resulted from the crossings that
slow down eye movements. In this paper we propose an algorithm that
disambiguates the edges with automatic selection of distinctive colors. Our
proposed algorithm computes a near optimal color assignment of a dual collision
graph, using a novel branch-and-bound procedure applied to a space
decomposition of the color gamut. We give examples demonstrating the
effectiveness of this approach in clarifying drawings of real world graphs and
maps.
