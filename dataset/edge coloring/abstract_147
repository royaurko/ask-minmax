Vector operators based on robust order statistics have proved successful in
digital multichannel imaging applications, particularly color image filtering
and enhancement, in dealing with impulsive noise while preserving edges and
fine image details. These operators often have very high computational
requirements which limits their use in time-critical applications. This paper
introduces techniques to speed up vector filters using the minimax
approximation theory. Extensive experiments on a large and diverse set of color
images show that proposed approximations achieve an excellent balance among
ease of implementation, accuracy, and computational speed.
