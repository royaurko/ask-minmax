A proper edge $t$-coloring of a graph $G$ is a coloring of edges of $G$ with
colors $1,2,...,t$ such that all colors are used, and no two adjacent edges
receive the same color. The set of colors of edges incident with a vertex $x$
is called a spectrum of $x$. An arbitrary nonempty subset of consecutive
integers is called an interval.
  Suppose that all edges of a graph $G$ are colored in the game of Alice and
Bob with asymmetric distribution of roles. Alice determines the number $t$ of
colors in the future proper edge coloring of $G$ and aspires to minimize the
number of vertices with an interval spectrum in it. Bob colors edges of $G$
with $t$ colors and aspires to maximize that number. $\mu_{21}(G)$ is equal to
the number of vertices of $G$ with an interval spectrum at the finish of the
game on the supposition that both players choose their best strategies.
  In this paper, for arbitrary positive integers $m$ and $n$, the exact value
of the parameter $\mu_{21}(K_{m,n})$ is found.
