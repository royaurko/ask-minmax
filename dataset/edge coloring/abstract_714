J/psi production in top quark rare decays is investigated under the framework
of NRQCD factorization formalism. Various production channels are studied, and
we find that the contributions from the color-singlet quark fragmentation and
the color-octet gluon fragmentation are both over 3 orders larger than that
from the leading order color-singlet process. The numerical results show that
the branching ratio B(t -> c + J/psi + X) is about 10^{-14} in the SM, and
10^{-10} in the MSSM.
