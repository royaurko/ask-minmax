We present a software package for combining three monochromatic images of an
astronomical object into a trichromatic color image. We first discuss the
meaning of "true" colors in astronomical images. We then describe the different
steps of our method, choosing the relevant dynamic intensity range in each
filter, inventorying the different colors, optimizing the color map, modifying
the balance of colors, and enhancing contrasts at low intensity levels. While
the first steps are automatic, the last two are interactive.
