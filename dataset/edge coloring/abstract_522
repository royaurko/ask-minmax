We have measured broadband optical BVR photometry of 24 Classical and
Scattered Kuiper belt objects (KBOs), approximately doubling the published
sample of colors for these classes of objects. We find a statistically
significant correlation between object color and inclination in the Classical
Kuiper belt using our data. The color and inclination correlation increases in
significance after the inclusion of additional data points culled from all
published works. Apparently, this color and inclination correlation has not
been more widely reported because the Plutinos show no such correlation, and
thus have been a major contaminant in previous samples. The color and
inclination correlation excludes simple origins of color diversity, such as the
presence of a coloring agent without regard to dynamical effects.
Unfortunately, our current knowledge of the Kuiper belt precludes us from
understanding whether the color and inclination trend is due to environmental
factors, such as collisional resurfacing, or primordial population effects. A
perihelion and color correlation is also evident, although this appears to be a
spurious correlation induced by sampling bias, as perihelion and inclination
are correlated in the observed sample of KBOs.
