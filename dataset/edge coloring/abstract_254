We present an analysis of the \psi\psi production from double parton (DP)
sacttering and single parton (SP) scattering in the large p_T region via
color-octet gluon fragmentation. We find that at the Tevatron the DP \psi\psi
production is at the edge of the detectability at present, and at the LHC the
DP cross section will dominate over the SP cross section in the lower p_T(min)
region (i.e., p_T(min)<7GeV). We also conclude that the color-octet mechanism
is of crucial importance to the double j/psi production at high energy hadron
colliders.
