In this paper we obtain a new sufficient condition for the existence of
directed cycles of length 4 in oriented bipartite graphs. As a corollary, a
conjecture of H. Li is confirmed. As an application, a sufficient condition for
the existence of rainbow cycles of length 4 in bipartite edge-colored graphs is
obtained.
