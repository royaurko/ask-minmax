A graph is called 1-planar if it can be drawn on the plane so that each edge
is crossed by at most one other edge. In this paper, we establish a local
property of 1-planar graphs which describes the structure in the neighborhood
of small vertices (i.e. vertices of degree no more than seven). Meanwhile, some
new classes of light graphs in 1-planar graphs with the bounded degree are
found. Therefore, two open problems presented by Fabrici and Madaras [The
structure of 1-planar graphs, Discrete Mathematics, 307, (2007), 854-865] are
solved. Furthermore, we prove that each 1-planar graph $G$ with maximum degree
$\Delta(G)$ is acyclically edge $L$-choosable where
$L=\max\{2\Delta(G)-2,\Delta(G)+83\}$.
