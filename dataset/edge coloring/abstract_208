High-resolution Chandra images of several clusters of galaxies reveal sharp,
edge-like discontinuities in their gas density. The gas temperature is higher
in front of the edge where the density is low, corresponding to approximately
continuous pressure across the edge. This new phenomenon was called ``cold
fronts'', to contrast it to shock fronts that should look similar in X-ray
images but where the temperature should jump in the opposite direction. The
first cold fronts were discovered in merging clusters, where they appear to
delineate the boundaries of dense cool subcluster remnants moving through and
being stripped by the surrounding shock-heated gas. Later, Chandra revealed
cold fronts in the central regions of several apparently relaxed clusters. To
explain the gas bulk motion in these clusters, we propose either a peculiar
cluster formation history that resulted in an oscillating core, or gas sloshing
(without the involvement of the underlying dark matter peak) caused by past
subcluster infall or central AGN activity. We review these observations and
discuss their implications for the X-ray cluster mass estimates.
