The purpose of this paper is to study quadratic color Hom-Lie algebras. We
present some constructions of quadratic color Hom-Lie algebras which we use to
provide several examples. We describe $T^\ast$-extensions and central
extensions of color Hom-Lie algebras and establish some cohomological
characterizations.
