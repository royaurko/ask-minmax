We present a study of the globular cluster systems of two edge-on spiral
galaxies, NGC4565 and NGC5907, from WFPC2 images in the F450W and F814W
filters. The globular cluster systems of both galaxies appear to be similar to
the Galactic globular cluster system. In particular, we derive total numbers of
globular clusters of N_{GC}(4565)= 204+/-38 {+87}{-53} and
N_{GC}(5907)=170+/-41 {+47}{-72} (where the first are statistical, the second
potential systematic errors) for NGC4565 and NGC5907, respectively. This
determination is based on a comparison to the Milky Way system, for which we
adopt a total number of globular clusters of 180+/-20. The specific frequency
of both galaxies is S_N~0.6: indistinguishable from the value for the Milky
Way. The similarity in the globular cluster systems of the two galaxies is
noteworthy since they have significantly different thick disks and
bulge-to-disk ratios. This would suggest that these two components do not play
a major role in the building up of a globular cluster system around late-type
galaxies.
