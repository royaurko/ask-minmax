We report on the results from two BeppoSAX observations of the Z source GX
349+2 performed in February 2001 and covering the broad energy range 0.12-200
keV. The light curve obtained from these observations shows a large flaring
activity, the count rate varying from ~130 to ~260 counts/s, indicating that
the source was in the flaring branch during these observations. The average
spectrum is well described by a soft blackbody and a Comptonized component. To
well fit the energy spectrum three gaussian lines are needed at 1.2 keV, 2.6
keV, and 6.7 keV with corresponding equivalent widths of 13 eV, 10 eV, and 39
eV, probably associated to L-shell emission of Fe XXIV, Ly-alpha S XVI, and Fe
XXV, respectively. These lines may be produced at different distances from the
neutron star, which increase when the count rate of the source increases. An
absorption edge is also needed at 9 keV with an optical depth of ~3 10^{-2}.
  From the Color-Color Diagram (CD) we selected five zones from which we
extracted the corresponding energy spectra. The temperatures of the blackbody
and of the Comptonized component tend to increase when the intensity of the
source increases. We discuss our results comparing them to those obtained from
a previous BeppoSAX observation, performed in March 2000, during which the
source was a similar position of its Z-track. In particular we find that,
although the source showed similar spectral states in the 2000 and the 2001
observations, a hard tail, that was significantly detected in March 2000, is
not observed in these recent observations.
