Characterizing the surfaces of rocky exoplanets via the scattered light will
be an essential challenge to investigate the existence of life on habitable
exoplanets. We present a simple reconstruction method for fractional areas of
different surface types from photometric variations, or colors, of a second
Earth. We create mock light curves for Earth without clouds using empirical
data. Then these light curves are fitted to the isotropic scattering model
consisting of 4 surface types: ocean, soil, snow and vegetation. In an
idealized situation where the photometric errors are only photon shot noise, we
are able to reproduce the fractional areas of those components fairly well. We
may be even able to detect a signature of vegetation from the distinct feature
of photosynthesis on the Earth, known as the red edge. In our reconstruction
method, Rayleigh scattering due to the atmosphere has an important effect, and
for terrestrial exoplanets with atmosphere similar to our Earth, it is possible
to estimate the presence of oceans and an atmosphere simultaneously.
