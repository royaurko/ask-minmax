We say that a graph $G$ has the Ramsey property w.r.t.\ some graph $F$ and
some integer $r\geq 2$, or $G$ is $(F,r)$-Ramsey for short, if any $r$-coloring
of the edges of $G$ contains a monochromatic copy of $F$. R{\"o}dl and
Ruci{\'n}ski asked how globally sparse $(F,r)$-Ramsey graphs $G$ can possibly
be, where the density of $G$ is measured by the subgraph $H\subseteq G$ with
the highest average degree. So far, this so-called Ramsey density is known only
for cliques and some trivial graphs $F$. In this work we determine the Ramsey
density up to some small error terms for several cases when $F$ is a complete
bipartite graph, a cycle or a path, and $r\geq 2$ colors are available.
