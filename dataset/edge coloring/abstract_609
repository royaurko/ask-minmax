This paper focuses on improved edge model based on Curvelet coefficients
analysis. Curvelet transform is a powerful tool for multiresolution
representation of object with anisotropic edge. Curvelet coefficients
contributions have been analyzed using Scale Invariant Feature Transform
(SIFT), commonly used to study local structure in images. The permutation of
Curvelet coefficients from original image and edges image obtained from
gradient operator is used to improve original edges. Experimental results show
that this method brings out details on edges when the decomposition scale
increases.
