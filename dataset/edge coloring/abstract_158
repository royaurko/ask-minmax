Let $\Delta_s=R(K_3,K_s)-R(K_3,K_{s-1})$, where $R(G,H)$ is the Ramsey number
of graphs $G$ and $H$ defined as the smallest $n$ such that any edge coloring
of $K_n$ with two colors contains $G$ in the first color or $H$ in the second
color. In 1980, Erd\H{o}s and S\'{o}s posed some questions about the growth of
$\Delta_s$. The best known concrete bounds on $\Delta_s$ are $3 \le \Delta_s
\le s$, and they have not improved since the stating of the problem. In this
paper we present some constructions, which imply in particular that $R(K_3,K_s)
\ge R(K_3,K_{s-1}-e) + 4$. This does not improve the lower bound of 3 on
$\Delta_s$, but we still consider it a step towards to understanding its
growth. We discuss some related questions and state two conjectures involving
$\Delta_s$, including the following: for some constant $d$ and all $s$ it holds
that $\Delta_s - \Delta_{s+1} \leq d$. We also prove that if the latter is
true, then $\lim_{s \rightarrow \infty} \Delta_s/s=0$.
