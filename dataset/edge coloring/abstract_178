This paper presents a new color image enhancement technique based on modified
MultiScale Retinex(MSR) algorithm and visual quality of the enhanced images are
evaluated using a new metric, namely, wavelet energy. The color image
enhancement is achieved by down sampling the value component of HSV color space
converted image into three scales (normal, medium and fine) following the
contrast stretching operation. These down sampled value components are enhanced
using the MSR algorithm. The value component is reconstructed by averaging each
pixels of the lower scale image with that of the upper scale image subsequent
to up sampling the lower scale image. This process replaces dark pixel by the
average pixels of both the lower scale and upper scale, while retaining the
bright pixels. The quality of the reconstructed images in the proposed method
is found to be good and far better then the other researchers method. The
performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using new wavelet domain based
assessment criterion, referred as wavelet energy. This scheme computes the
energy of both original and enhanced image in wavelet domain. The number of
edge details as well as wavelet energy is less in a poor quality image compared
with naturally enhanced image. Experimental results presented confirms that the
proposed wavelet energy based color image quality assessment technique
efficiently characterizes both the local and global details of enhanced image.
