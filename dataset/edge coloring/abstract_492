Four-Color Theorem has secret in its logical proof and actual operating. In
this paper we will give a proof of Four-Color Theorem based on Kuratowski's
Theorem using some induction argument and give a description of the most
complicated coloring map, a simple proof of Kuratowski's Theorem using Euler
charateristic is also presented. We also conjecture the higher dimensional
generalization of Four-Color Theorem.
