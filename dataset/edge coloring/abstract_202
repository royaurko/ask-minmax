We introduce the notion of a coloring of a poset, which consists of a
labeling of the edges in its Hasse diagram by elements in a given group $G$. We
use $G$-colorings to describe the covering maps of posets and present a new
method based on colorings to obtain concrete and simple presentations of the
fundamental group of polyhedra.
