Efforts to modulate the electronic properties of atomically thin crystalline
nanoribbons requires precise control over their morphology. Here, we perform
atomistic simulations on freestanding graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) to first
identify the minimal shapes, and then employ a core-edge framework based on
classical plate theory to quantify the width dependence in more general
systems. The elastic edge-edge interactions force ultra-narrow ribbons to be
flat, which then bifurcate to twisted and bent shapes at critical widths that
vary inversely with edge stress. Compressive edge stresses results in twisted
and saddle shapes that are energetically indistinguishable in the vicinity of
the bifurcation. Increasing widths favor the saddle shapes with (longitudinal)
ribbon curvatures that vary non-linearly with width and edge stress. Positive
edge stresses result in a flat-to-curled transition with similar scalings. At
large widths with negligible edge-edge interactions, rippling instabilities set
in, i.e. edge ripples and midline dimples for compressive and tensile edge
stresses. Our results highlight the utility of the core-edge framework in
developing a unified understanding of the interplay between geometry and
mechanics that sets the morphology of crystalline nanoribbons.
