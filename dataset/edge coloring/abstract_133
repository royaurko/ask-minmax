Complex networks are all around us, and they can be generated by simple
mechanisms. Understanding what kinds of networks can be produced by following
simple rules is therefore of great importance. We investigate this issue by
studying the dynamics of extremely simple systems where are `writer' moves
around a network, and modifies it in a way that depends upon the writer's
surroundings. Each vertex in the network has three edges incident upon it,
which are colored red, blue and green. This edge coloring is done to provide a
way for the writer to orient its movement. We explore the dynamics of a space
of 3888 of these `colored trinet automata' systems. We find a large variety of
behaviour, ranging from the very simple to the very complex. We also discover
simple rules that generate forms which are remarkably similar to a wide range
of natural objects. We study our systems using simulations (with appropriate
visualization techniques) and analyze selected rules mathematically. We arrive
at an empirical classification scheme which reveals a lot about the kinds of
dynamics and networks that can be generated by these systems.
