The single region of ongoing star formation in the galaxy IC 1613 has been
observed in order to reveal the nature of compact emission-line objects at the
edges of two shells in the complex, identified earlier in H-alpha line images.
The continuum images show these compact objects to be stars. Detailed
spectroscopic observations of these stars and the surrounding nebulae were
carried out with an integral field spectrograph MPFS mounted on the 6m
telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory. The resulting stellar
spectra were used to determine the spectral types and luminosity classes of the
objects. An Of star we identified is the only object of this spectral type in
IC 1613. The results of optical observations of the multi-shell complex are
compared to 21cm radio observations. The shells harboring the stars at their
boundaries constitute the most active part of the star-forming region. There is
evidence that shocks have played an important role in the formation of the
shells.
