We present B and V CCD photometry for variables in the cluster central
region, adding new data for 32 variables and giving suitable light curves, mean
magnitudes and corrected colors for 17 RR Lyrae. Implementing the data given in
this paper with similar data already appeared in the literature we discuss a
sample of 42 variables, as given by 22 RRab and 20 RRc, to the light of recent
predictions from pulsational theories. We find that the observational evidence
concerning M5 pulsators appears in marginal disagreement with predictions
concerning the color of the First Overtone Blue Edge (FOBE), whereas a clear
disagreement appears between the ZAHB luminosities predicted through
evolutionary or pulsational theories.
