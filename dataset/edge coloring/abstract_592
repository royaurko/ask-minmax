Suppose that the vertices of $Z^d$ are assigned random colors via a finitary
factor of independent identically distributed (iid) vertex-labels. That is, the
color of vertex $v$ is determined by a rule that examines the labels within a
finite (but random and perhaps unbounded) distance $R$ of $v$, and the same
rule applies at all vertices. We investigate the tail behavior of $R$ if the
coloring is required to be proper (that is, if adjacent vertices must receive
different colors). When $d\geq 2$, the optimal tail is given by a power law for
3 colors, and a tower (iterated exponential) function for 4 or more colors (and
also for 3 or more colors when $d=1$). If proper coloring is replaced with any
shift of finite type in dimension 1, then, apart from trivial cases, tower
function behavior also applies.
