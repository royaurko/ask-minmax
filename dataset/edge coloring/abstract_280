We present V and B-band CCD photometry of 35 RR Lyr stars in the southern
hemisphere globular cluster NGC 6362. Fourier decomposition of the light curves
was used to estimate the basic properties of these variables. From the analysis
of the RRc stars we obtain a mean mass of M=0.531+/-0.014 $M_\odot$, luminosity
log L=1.656+/-0.006, effective temperature Teff=7429+/-20, and helium abundance
Y=0.292+/-0.002. The mean values of the absolute magnitude, metallicity (on
Jurcsik's scale) and effective temperature for 14 RRab stars with "regular"
light curves are: M_V=0.86+/-0.01, [Fe/H]=-0.93+/-0.04 and Teff=6555+/-25,
respectively. From the B-V colors, periods and metallicities of the RRab stars
we estimate the color excess for NGC 6362 to be equal to E(B-V)=0.08+/-0.01.
Using this value we derive the colors of the blue and red edges of the
instability strip in NGC 6362 to be $(B-V)^{BE}_0=0.17$ and
$(B-V)^{RE}_0=0.43$. From the relations between the Fourier coefficients of
RRab and RRc stars and their absolute magnitudes we estimate the apparent
distance modulus to NGC 6362 to be (m-M)_V=14.46+/-0.10. From the mean value of
log L of the RRc stars we obtain 14.59+/-0.03. The V-band light curves of three
of the RRc stars exhibit changes in amplitude of over 0.1 mag on the time scale
of around one week. Near the radial 1st overtone frequency we find one or two
peaks, which strongly suggests that these variables belong to the newly
identified group of non-radial pulsating RR Lyr stars.
