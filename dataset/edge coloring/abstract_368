We consider the densities of clusters, at the percolation point of a
two-dimensional system, which are anchored in various ways to an edge. These
quantities are calculated by use of conformal field theory and computer
simulations. We find that they are given by simple functions of the potentials
of 2-D electrostatic dipoles, and that a kind of superposition {\it cum}
factorization applies. Our results broaden this connection, already known from
previous studies, and we present evidence that it is more generally valid. An
exact result similar to the Kirkwood superposition approximation emerges.
