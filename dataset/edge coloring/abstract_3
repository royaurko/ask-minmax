An edge-coloring of a multigraph $G$ with colors $1,\ldots,t$ is called an
interval $t$-coloring if all colors are used, and the colors of edges incident
to any vertex of $G$ are distinct and form an interval of integers. In this
note, we show that all Eulerian multigraphs with an odd number of edges have no
interval coloring. We also give some methods for constructing of interval
non-edge-colorable Eulerian multigraphs.
