In this paper we describe all edge-colored graphs that are fully symmetric
with respect to colors and transitive on every set of edges of the same color.
They correspond to fully symmetric homogeneous factorizations of complete
graphs. Our description completes the work done in our previous paper, where we
have shown, in particular, that there are no such graphs with more than 5
colors. Using some recent results, with a help of computer, we settle all the
cases that was left open in the previous paper.
