We study correlations between the burst properties and the position in the
color-color diagram of the low mass X-ray binary 4U 1728-34 using 21 bursts
found in two data sets obtained with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. Using
spectral fits we analyze the spectral evolution during the bursts and determine
the burst peak flux, temperature, rise time and fluence. Using dynamical power
spectra we study the properties of the ~363 Hz burst oscillations. We find
correlations between fluence, peak flux, the occurrence of radius expansion and
the presence of burst oscillations, and the position of the source in the
color-color diagram. The radius expansion bursts with and without burst
oscillations differ both with respect to where they occur in the color-color
diagram and in how the radius expansion takes place. We compare our results
with those of a similar study by Muno et al. (2000) for KS 1731-26. Both KS
1731-260 and 4U 1728-34 show more or less the same behavior with respect to the
dependence of the presence/absence of the burst oscillations on the position of
the source in the color-color diagram, but the dependence of most of the
spectral burst parameters on the position in the color-color diagram is clearly
different. We find that the systematic absence in 4U 1728-34 of burst
oscillations in the ``island'' state of the color-color diagram is not
explained by the bursts involving mixed H-He burning, as may be the case in KS
1731--260 (Cumming & Bildsten 2000).
