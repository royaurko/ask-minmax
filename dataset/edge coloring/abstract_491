P. Kirchberger proved that, for a finite subset $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ such
that each point in $X$ is painted with one of two colors, if every $d+2$ or
fewer points in $X$ can be separated along the colors, then all the points in
$X$ can be separated along the colors. In this paper, we show a more colorful
theorem.
