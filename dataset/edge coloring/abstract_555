First-principles investigations on the edge energies and edge stresses of
single-layer hexagonal boron-nitride (BN) are presented. The armchair edges of
BN nanoribbons (BNNRs) are more stable in energy than zigzag ones. Armchair
BNNRs are under compressive edge stress while zigzag BNNRs are under tensile
edge stress. The intrinsic spin-polarization and edge saturation play important
roles in modulating the edge stability of BNNRs. The edge energy difference
between BN and graphene could be used to guide the design of the specific
hybrid BNC structures: in an armchair BNC nanoribbon (BNCNR), BN domains are
expected to grow outside of C domains, while the opposite occurs in a zigzag
BNCNR. More importantly, armchair BNCNRs can reproduce unique electronic
properties of armchair graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), which are expected to be
robust against edge functionalization or disorder. Within certain C/BN ratio,
zigzag BNCNRs may exhibit intrinsic half-metallicity without any external
constraints. These unexpected electronic properties of BNCNRs may offer unique
opportunities to develop nanoscale electronics and spintronics beyond
individual graphene and BN. Generally, these principles for designing BNC could
be extended to other hybrid nanostructures.
