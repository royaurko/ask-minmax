Let $G$ be a planar graph with no two 3-cycles sharing an edge. We show that
if $\Delta(G)\geq 9$, then $\chi'_l(G) = \Delta(G)$ and
$\chi''_l(G)=\Delta(G)+1.$ We also show that if $\Delta(G)\geq 6$, then
$\chi'_l(G)\leq\Delta(G)+1$ and if $\Delta(G)\geq 7$, then
$\chi''_l(G)\leq\Delta(G)+2$. All of these results extend to graphs in the
projective plane and when $\Delta(G)\geq 7$ the results also extend to graphs
in the torus and Klein bottle.
  This second edge-choosability result improves on work of Wang and Lih and of
Zhang and Wu. All of our results use the discharging method to prove structural
lemmas about the existence of subgraphs with small degree-sum. For example, we
prove that if $G$ is a planar graph with no two 3-cycles sharing an edge and
with $\Delta(G)\geq 7$, then $G$ has an edge $uv$ with $d(u)\leq 4$ and
$d(u)+d(v)\leq \Delta(G)+2$.
  All of our proofs yield linear-time algorithms that produce the desired
colorings.
