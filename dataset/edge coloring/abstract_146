Vector filters based on order-statistics have proved successful in removing
impulsive noise from color images while preserving edges and fine image
details. Among these filters, the ones that involve the cosine distance
function (directional filters) have particularly high computational
requirements, which limits their use in time critical applications. In this
paper, we introduce two methods to speed up these filters. Experiments on a
diverse set of color images show that the proposed methods provide substantial
computational gains without significant loss of accuracy.
