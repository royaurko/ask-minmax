Let $X=(V,E)$ be a finite simple connected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$
edges. A configuration is an assignment of one of two colors, black or white,
to each edge of $X.$ A move applied to a configuration is to select a black
edge $\epsilon\in E$ and change the colors of all adjacent edges of $\epsilon.$
Given an initial configuration and a final configuration, try to find a
sequence of moves that transforms the initial configuration into the final
configuration. This is the edge-flipping puzzle on $X,$ and it corresponds to a
group action. This group is called the edge-flipping group $\mathbf{W}_E(X)$ of
$X.$ This paper shows that if $X$ has at least three vertices,
$\mathbf{W}_E(X)$ is isomorphic to a semidirect product of
$(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^k$ and the symmetric group $S_n$ of degree $n,$ where
$k=(n-1)(m-n+1)$ if $n$ is odd, $k=(n-2)(m-n+1)$ if $n$ is even, and
$\mathbb{Z}$ is the additive group of integers.
