Given a set of $k$-colored points in the plane, we consider the problem of
finding $k$ trees such that each tree connects all points of one color class,
no two trees cross, and the total edge length of the trees is minimized. For
$k=1$, this is the well-known Euclidean Steiner tree problem. For general $k$,
a $k\rho$-approximation algorithm is known, where $\rho \le 1.21$ is the
Steiner ratio.
  We present a PTAS for $k=2$, a $(5/3+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm
for $k=3$, and two approximation algorithms for general~$k$, with ratios
$O(\sqrt n \log k)$ and $k+\varepsilon$.
