Edge states in biased bilayer graphene in a magnetic field are studied within
the four-band continuum model. The analysis is done for the semi-infinite
graphene plane and for the graphene ribbon of a finite width, in the cases of
zigzag and armchair edges. Exact dispersion equations for the edge states and
analytic expressions for their wave functions are written in terms of the
parabolic cylinder functions. The spectrum of edge states for each type of the
boundary conditions is found by numerically solving the corresponding
dispersion equations. The low-energy modes localized at zigzag edges are
explored in detail.
