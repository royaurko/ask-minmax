In this paper, we propose a gradient difference based approach to text
localization in videos and scene images. The input video frame/ image is first
compressed using multilevel 2-D wavelet transform. The edge information of the
reconstructed image is found which is further used for finding the maximum
gradient difference between the pixels and then the boundaries of the detected
text blocks are computed using zero crossing technique. We perform logical AND
operation of the text blocks obtained by gradient difference and the zero
crossing technique followed by connected component analysis to eliminate the
false positives. Finally, the morphological dilation operation is employed on
the detected text blocks for scene text localization. The experimental results
obtained on publicly available standard datasets illustrate that the proposed
method can detect and localize the texts of various sizes, fonts and colors.
