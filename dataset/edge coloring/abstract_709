We present results on dijet production via hard color-singlet exchange in
proton-antiproton collisions at root-s = 630 GeV and 1800 GeV using the DZero
detector. The fraction of dijet events produced via color-singlet exchange is
measured as a function of jet transverse energy, separation in pseudorapidity
between the two highest transverse energy jets, and proton-antiproton
center-of-mass energy. The results are consistent with a color-singlet fraction
that increases with an increasing fraction of quark-initiated processes and
inconsistent with two-gluon models for the hard color-singlet.
