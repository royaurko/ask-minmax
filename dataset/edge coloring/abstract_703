Multiple color stripes have been employed for structured light-based rapid
range imaging to increase the number of uniquely identifiable stripes. The use
of multiple color stripes poses two problems: (1) object surface color may
disturb the stripe color and (2) the number of adjacent stripes required for
identifying a stripe may not be maintained near surface discontinuities such as
occluding boundaries. In this paper, we present methods to alleviate those
problems. Log-gradient filters are employed to reduce the influence of object
colors, and color stripes in two and three directions are used to increase the
chance of identifying correct stripes near surface discontinuities.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.
