I describe the NRQCD factorization approach to the inclusive production of
heavy quarkonium, contrasting it with the color-singlet and color evaporation
models. These approaches differ dramatically in their assumptions about the
roles played by color and spin in the production process. They also differ
dramatically in their predictions for the production of charmonium at large
transverse momentum.
