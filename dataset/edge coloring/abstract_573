In popular event generators of high energy reaction, the large Nc, the number
of color approximation is implied, which reduces the possible interference
effects, and the probability of color singlet chain reaches to about 100%. In
$Nc=3$ real world, we show that not only the color interference decreases this
probability to 83%, 77%, 72%, $...$, respectively to $n=2$, 3, 4, $...$, {in
the process of}$e^+e^-{\longrightarrow}q\bar {q}+ng$ final state, but also the
accompanying kinematic interference exists, which decreases this probability to
about 67%, 58%, $...$, further. In the meanwhile, we fin d that the kinematic
interference makes the probability of color separate singlet states increases
synchronously. Combing and analyzing above facts, we infer that the probability
of color singlet chain states in high energy ${e^+e^-}{\longrightarrow}{h's}$
reaction would be much smaller than 100%, which is commonly accepted. And the
fraction of other color connec tion states, $e.g.$, color separate singlet
states should be significant.
