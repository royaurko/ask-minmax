A coloring of the edges of a graph $G$ is strong if each color class is an
induced matching of $G$. The strong chromatic index of $G$, denoted by
$\chi_{s}^{\prime}(G)$, is the least number of colors in a strong edge coloring
of $G$. In this note we prove that $\chi_{s}^{\prime}(G)\leq (4k-1)\Delta
(G)-k(2k+1)+1$ for every $k$-degenerate graph $G$. This confirms the strong
version of conjecture stated recently by Chang and Narayanan [3]. Our approach
allows also to improve the upper bound from [3] for chordless graphs. We get
that $% \chi_{s}^{\prime}(G)\leq 4\Delta -3$ for any chordless graph $G$. Both
bounds remain valid for the list version of the strong edge coloring of these
graphs.
