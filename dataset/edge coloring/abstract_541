In the presence of nonzero strange quark mass $m_s$, we investigate color
neutrality in the $K^0$ condensed phase of color-flavor locked quark matter. By
treating the $m_s$ effects on both kaon condensate and Fermi-surface phenomenon
self-consistently, we develop a new treatment to evaluate color neutral
solutions within the model-independent framework. It is pointed out that, in
the general sense, the expectation values of gluon fields obtained from
dynamics of Goldstone bosons solely are not identified with the factual color
chemical potentials.
