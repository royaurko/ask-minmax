A new shortest proof of Kotzig's Theorem about graphs with unique perfect
matching is presented in this paper. It is well known that Kotzig's theorem is
a consequence of Yeo's Theorem about edge-colored graph without alternating
cycle. We present a proof of Yeo's Theorem based on the same ideas as our proof
of Kotzig's theorem.
