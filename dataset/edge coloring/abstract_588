We explore the possibility that color symmetry SU(3) was not an exact
symmetry at all times in the early universe, using minimal extensions of the
standard model that contain a color triplet scalar field and perhaps other
fields. We show that, for a range of temperatures, there can exist a phase in
which the free energy is minimized when the color triplet scalar has a
non-vanishing vacuum expectation value, spontaneously breaking color. At very
high temperatures and at lower temperatures color symmetry is restored. The
breaking of color in this phase is accompanied by the spontaneous breaking of
B-L if the color triplet scalar Yukawa couples to quarks and/or leptons. We
discuss the requirements on the minimal extensions needed for consistency of
this scenario with present collider bounds on new colored scalar particles.
