We extend two well-known results in Ramsey theory from from $K_n$ to
arbitrary $n$-chromatic graphs. The first is a note of Erd\H os and Rado
stating that in every 2-coloring of the edges of $K_n$ there is a monochromatic
tree on $n$ vertices. The second is the theorem of Cockayne and Lorimer stating
that for positive integers satisfying $n_1=\max\{n_1,n_2,\dots,n_t\}$ and with
$n=n_1+1+\sum_{i=1}^t (n_i-1)$, the following holds. In every coloring of the
edges of $K_n$ with colors $1,2\dots,t$ there is a monochromatic matching of
size $n_i$ for some $i\in \{1,2,\dots,t\}$.
