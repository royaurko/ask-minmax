The spiral edge-on galaxies from the "Revised Flat Galaxy Catalog" (RFGC) are
identified with the Extended Source Catalog of the Two Micron All Sky Survey
(2MASS). A relative number of the 2MASS detected galaxies is 2996/4236 = 0.71.
We consider the statistical properties of the Tully-Fisher relations for the
edge-on galaxies in the B, I, J, H, and K_s bands. The slope of derived TF
relations increases steadily from 4.9 in the B band to 9.3 in the K one. The
effect is mainly due to the internal extinction which is different in dwarf and
giant spiral galaxies seen edge-on that leads to the tight correlation between
galaxy color and luminosity. The moderate scatter of the RFGC galaxies in the
`color-luminosity' diagram, 0.86 mag., provides us with a new "cheap" method of
mass measurements of distances to galaxies on the basis of modern photometric
sky surveys.
