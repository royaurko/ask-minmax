We present B- and R-band imaging and photometry, H-alpha narrow-band imaging,
NIR H-band imaging, and HI 21-cm spectroscopy of the nearby Sd spiral galaxy
UGC7321. UGC7321 exhibits a remarkably thin stellar disk with no bulge
component. The galaxy has a very diffuse, low surface brightness disk, which
appears to suffer little internal extinction in spite of its edge-on geometry.
The UGC7321 disk shows significant B-R color gradients in both the radial and
vertical directions. These color gradients cannot be explained solely by dust
and are indicative of changes in the mix of stellar ages and/or metallicity as
a function of both radius and height above the galaxy plane. The outer regions
of the UGC7321 disk are too blue to be explained by low metallicity alone
(B-R<0.6), and must be relatively young. However, the galaxy also contains
stellar populations with B-R>1.1, indicating it is not a young or
recently-formed galaxy. The disk of UGC7321 is not a simple exponential, but
exhibits a light excess at small radii, as well as distinct surface brightness
zones. Together the properties of UGC7321 imply that it is an under-evolved
galaxy in both a dynamical and in a star-formation sense. (Abridged)
