We construct an edge-coloring of $K_{N}$ (for $N = 3432$) in colors red, dark
blue, and light blue, such that there are no monochromatic blue triangles and
such that the coloring satisfies a certain strong universal-existential
property. The edge-coloring of $K_{N}$ depends on a cyclic coloring of $K_{17}$
whose two color classes are $K_{4}$-, $K_{4,3}$-, and $K_{5,2}$-free. This
construction yields the smallest known representation of the relation algebra
$32_{65}$, reducing the upper bound from 8192 to 3432.
