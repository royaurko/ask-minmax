We have mosaiced 2MASS images to derive surface brightness profiles in JHK
for 104 Galactic globular clusters. We fit these with King profiles, and show
that the core radii are identical to within the errors for each of these IR
colors, and are identical to the core radii at V in essentially all cases. We
derive integrated light colors V-J, V-H, V-K_s, J-H and J-K_s for these
globular clusters. Each color shows a reasonably tight relation between the
dereddened colors and metallicity. Fits to these are given for each color. The
IR--IR colors have very small errors due largely to the all-sky photometric
calibration of the 2MASS survey, while the V-IR colors have substantially
larger uncertainties. We find fairly good agreement with measurements of
integrated light colors for a smaller sample of Galactic globular clusters by
Aaronson, Malkan & Kleinmann from 1977. Our results provide a calibration for
the integrated light of distant single burst old stellar populations from very
low to Solar metallicities. A comparison of our dereddened measured colors with
predictions from several models of the integrated light of single burst old
populations shows good agreement in the low metallicity domain for V-K_s
colors, but an offset at a fixed [Fe/H] of ~0.1 mag in J-K_s, which we ascribe
to photometric system transformation issues. Some of the models fail to
reproduce the behavior of the integrated light colors of the Galactic globular
clusters near Solar metallicity.
