In this paper, a reliable method for detecting human faces in color images is
proposed. This system firstly detects skin color in YCgCr and YIQ color space,
then filters binary texture and the result is morphological processed, finally
converts skin tone to the preferred skin color configured by users in YIQ color
space. The real-time adjusting circuit is implemented and some of simulation
results are given out. Experimental results demonstrate that the method has
achieved high rates and low false positives, another advantage is its
simplicity and minor computational costs.
