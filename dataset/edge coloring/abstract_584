When the phase transition from the hadronic matter to the deconfined
quark-gluon plasma or quark-gluon liquid is reached, the color degrees of
freedom become important and appear explicitly in the equation of state. Under
the extreme conditions, the color degrees of freedom can not decouple from the
other degrees of freedom. The conservation of color charges is maintained by
introducing the color chemical potentials and their fugacities. We demonstrate
the explicit role of color degrees of freedom in the hot and dense matter of
the weakly interacting quarks and gluons. In order to illustrate our approach,
we calculate the effective colored quark and gluon propagators as well as the
hard thermal colored quark and gluon loops. The calculations are preformed
under the assumption of the hard thermal loop approximation. Finally, we
present the decay rate for the hard thermal colored quark. The present
calculation is relevant to the quarks and gluons which are not truly deconfined
quark-gluon plasma and behave as a fluid in the RHIC energy. The model can be
explored in the LHC energy.
