The regular graph of ideals of the commutative ring $R$, denoted by
$\Gamma_{reg}(R)$, is a graph whose vertex set is the set of all non-trivial
ideals of $R$ and two distinct vertices $I$ and $J$ are adjacent if and only if
either $I$ contains a $J$-regular element or $J$ contains an $I$-regular
element. In this paper, it is shown that for every Artinian ring $R$, the edge
chromatic number of $\Gamma_{reg}(R)$ equals its maximum degree. Then a formula
for the clique number of $\Gamma_{reg}(R)$ is given. Also, it is proved that
for every reduced ring $R$ with $n(\geq3)$ minimal prime ideals, the edge
chromatic number of $\Gamma_{reg}(R)$ is $2^{n-1}-2$. Moreover, we show that
both of the clique number and vertex chromatic number of $\Gamma_{reg}(R)$ are
$n-1$, for every reduced ring $R$ with $n$ minimal prime ideals.
