Let kappa be an uncountable cardinal and the edges of a complete graph with
kappa vertices be colored with aleph_0 colors. For kappa >2^{aleph_0} the
Erd\H{o}s-Rado theorem implies that there is an infinite monochromatic
subgraph. However, if kappa <= 2^{aleph_0}, then it may be impossible to find
a monochromatic triangle. This paper is concerned with the latter situation.
We consider the types of colorings of finite subgraphs that must occur when
kappa <= 2^{aleph_0}. In particular, we are concerned with the case aleph_1 <=
kappa <= aleph_omega
