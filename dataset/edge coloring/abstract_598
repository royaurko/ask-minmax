By considering the continuous model for graphene, we analytically study a
special gauge field for the edge state. The gauge field explains the properties
of the edge state such as the existence only on the zigzag edge, the partial
appearance in the $k$-space, and the energy position around the Fermi energy.
It is demonstrated utilizing the gauge field that the edge state is robust for
surface reconstruction, and the next nearest-neighbor interaction which breaks
the particle-hole symmetry stabilizes the edge state.
