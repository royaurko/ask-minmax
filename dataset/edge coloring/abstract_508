A Mathematica package for color summed calculations in QCD (SU(Nc)) is
presented. Color contractions of any color amplitude appearing in QCD may be
performed, and the package uses a syntax which is very similar to how color
structure is written on paper. It also supports the definition of color vectors
and bases, and special functions such as scalar products are defined for such
color tensors.
