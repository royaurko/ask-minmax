We utilize for the first time HST ACS imaging to examine the structural
properties of galaxies in the rest-frame U-V versus V-J diagram (i.e., the UVJ
diagram) using a sample at 0.6<z<0.9 that reaches a low stellar mass limit (log
M/Msun>10.25). The use of the UVJ diagram as a tool to distinguish quiescent
galaxies from star forming galaxies (SFGs) is becoming more common due to its
ability to separate red quiescent galaxies from reddened SFGs. Quiescent
galaxies occupy a small and distinct region of UVJ color space and we find most
of them to have concentrated profiles with high Sersic indices (n>2.5) and
smooth structure characteristic of early-type systems. SFGs populate a broad,
but well-defined sequence of UVJ colors and are comprised of objects with a mix
of Sersic indices. Interestingly, most UVJ-selected SFGs with high Sersic
indices also display structure due to dust and star formation typical of the
n<2.5 SFGs and late-type systems. Finally, we find that the position of a SFG
on the sequence of UVJ colors is determined to a large degree by the mass of
the galaxy and its inclination. Systems that are closer to edge-on generally
display redder colors and lower [OII]3727 luminosity per unit mass as a
consequence of the reddening due to dust within the disks. We conclude that the
two main features seen in UVJ color space correspond closely to the traditional
morphological classes of early and late-type galaxies.
