This paper presents an algorithm that transforms color visual images, like
photographs or paintings, into tactile graphics. In the algorithm, the edges of
objects are detected and colors of the objects are estimated. Then, the edges
and the colors are encoded into lines and textures in the output tactile image.
Design of the method is substantiated by various qualities of haptic
recognizing of images. Also, means of presentation of the tactile images in
printouts are discussed. Example translated images are shown.
