A simple but empirically efficient heuristic algorithm for the edge-coloring
of graphs is presented. Its basic idea is the displacement of "conflicts"
(repeated colors in the edges incident to a vertex) along paths of adjacent
vertices whose incident edges are recolored by swapping alternating colors
(that is, doing a Kempe interchange). The results of performance tests on
random cubic and $\Delta$-regular graphs are presented, and a full
implementation of the algorithm is given to facilitate its use and the
reproducibility of results.
