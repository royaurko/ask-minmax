In a graph whose edges are colored, a parity walk is a walk that uses each
color an even number of times. The parity edge chromatic number p(G) of a graph
G is the least k so that there is a coloring of E(G) using k colors that does
not contain a parity path. The strong parity edge chromatic number p'(G) of G
is the least k so that there is a coloring of E(G) using k colors with the
property that every parity walk is closed.
  Our main result is to determine p'(K_n). Specifically, if m is the least
power of two that is as large as n, then p'(K_n) has value m - 1. As a
corollary, we strengthen a special case of an old result of Daykin and Lovasz.
Other results include determining p(G) and p'(G) whenever G is a path, cycle,
or of the form K_{2,n}, and an upper bound on p'(G) for the case that G is a
complete bipartite graph. We conclude with a sample of open problems.
