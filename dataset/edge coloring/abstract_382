I briefly review early and recent progress concerning the dynamical
properties of bulges. I also show results from a study on the kinematics of
bulges and disks in edge-on galaxies, where the bulge rotation curve is
obtained with little contamination from the disk. I show that a proper
structural analysis is crucial to understand such measurements. The results
suggest that exponential bulges have a higher degree of rotational support than
bulges with higher Sersic indexes, giving support to the concept that
photometric bulges include different categories of stellar systems.
