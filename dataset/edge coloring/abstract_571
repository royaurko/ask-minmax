Color superconductivity in quark matter is studied for electrically charge
neutral neutron star matter in $\beta$-equilibrium. Both bulk quark matter and
mixed phases of quark and nuclear matter are treated. The electron chemical
potential and strange quark mass affect the various quark chemical potentials
and therefore also the color superconductivity due to dicolor pairing or
color-flavor locking.
