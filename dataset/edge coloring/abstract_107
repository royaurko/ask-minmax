An edge colored graph $G$ is rainbow edge connected if any two vertices are
connected by a path whose edges have distinct colors. The rainbow connection of
a connected graph $G$, denoted by $rc(G)$, is the smallest number of colors
that are needed in order to make $G$ rainbow connected.
  In this work we study the rainbow connection of the random $r$-regular graph
$G=G(n,r)$ of order $n$, where $r\ge 4$ is a constant. We prove that with
probability tending to one as $n$ goes to infinity the rainbow connection of
$G$ satisfies $rc(G)=O(\log n)$, which is best possible up to a hidden
constant.
