In a spectroscopic follow-up to the VLA FIRST survey, the FIRST Bright Quasar
Survey (FBQS) has found 29 radio-selected broad absorption line (BAL) quasars.
This sample provides the first opportunity to study the properties of
radio-selected BAL quasars. Contrary to most previous studies, we establish
that a significant population of radio-loud BAL quasars exists. Radio-selected
BAL quasars display compact radio morphologies and possess both steep and flat
radio spectra. Quasars with low-ionization BALs have a color distribution
redder than that of the FBQS sample as a whole. The frequency of BAL quasars in
the FBQS is significantly greater, perhaps by as much as a factor of two, than
that inferred from optically selected samples. The frequency of BAL quasars
appears to have a complex dependence on radio-loudness. The properties of this
sample appear inconsistent with simple unified models in which BAL quasars
constitute a subset of quasars seen edge-on.
