Helical edge modes are characteristic of topological insulators in two
dimensions. This paper demonstrates that helical edge modes remain across
transitions to ordinary insulators or to semimetals under certain condition.
Straight and zigzag edges are considered in a tight-binding model on square
lattice. We focus on the case of indirect gap in bulk topological insulators,
and obtain the spectrum of edge modes on both sides of transitions. For
straight edge, the helical edge mode in topological insulators with strong
particle-hole asymmetry has a reentrant region in momentum space. Edge modes
show up even in ordinary insulators, but are absent in semimetals. In zigzag
edge, the helical edge mode survives in both semimetals and ordinary
insulators. However, the edge modes are absent inside the energy gap of
ordinary insulators. All results are obtained analytically.
