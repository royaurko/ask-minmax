By considering the features of the airport runway image filtering, an
improved bilateral filtering method was proposed which can remove noise with
edge preserving. Firstly the steerable filtering decomposition is used to
calculate the sub-band parameters of 4 orients, and the texture feature matrix
is then obtained from the sub-band local median energy. The texture similar,
the spatial closer and the color similar functions are used to filter the
image.The effect of the weighting function parameters is qualitatively analyzed
also. In contrast with the standard bilateral filter and the simulation results
for the real airport runway image show that the multilateral filtering is more
effective than the standard bilateral filtering.
