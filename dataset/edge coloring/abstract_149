In this paper, we present the efficient content based image retrieval systems
which employ the color, texture and shape information of images to facilitate
the retrieval process. For efficient feature extraction, we extract the color,
texture and shape feature of images automatically using edge detection which is
widely used in signal processing and image compression. For facilitated the
speedy retrieval we are implements the antipole-tree algorithm for indexing the
images.
