A subgraph in an edge-colored graph is multicolored if all its edges receive
distinct colors. In this paper, we study the proper edge-colorings of the
complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$ which forbid multicolored cycles. Mainly, we
prove that (1) for any integer $k\geq 2$, if $n\geq 5k-6$, then any properly
$n$-edge-colored $K_{k,n}$ contains a multicolored $C_{2k}$, and (2) determine
the order of the properly edge-colored complete bipartite graphs which forbid
multicolored $C_6$.
