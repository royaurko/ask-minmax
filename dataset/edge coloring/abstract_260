An incidence in a graph $G$ is a pair $(v,e)$ with $v \in V(G)$ and $e \in
E(G)$, such that $v$ and $e$ are incident. Two incidences $(v,e)$ and $(w,f)$
are adjacent if $v=w$, or $e=f$, or the edge $vw$ equals $e$ or $f$. The
incidence chromatic number of $G$ is the smallest $k$ for which there exists a
mapping from the set of incidences of $G$ to a set of $k$ colors that assigns
distinct colors to adjacent incidences. In this paper, we prove that the
incidence chromatic number of the toroidal grid $T_{m,n}=C_m\Box C_n$ equals 5
when $m,n \equiv 0 \pmod 5$ and 6 otherwise.
