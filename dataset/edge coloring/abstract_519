The edges of nanoscopic objects determine most of their properties. For this
reason the edges of honeycomb carbon--always considered either zigzag- or
armchair-like--need special attention. In this report we provide experimental
evidence confirming a previous unexpected prediction: zigzag is a metastable
edge, as its planar reconstruction lowers energy and forms the most stable
graphene edge. Our evidence is based on re-analyzing a recent experiment. Since
the reconstructed edge, along with other unconventional edges we discuss, has
distinct chemical properties, this discovery urges for care in experiments and
theory--we must enter the realm beyond zigzag and armchair.
