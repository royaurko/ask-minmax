Let $G$ be a bridgeless cubic graph. Consider a list of $k$ 1-factors of $G$.
Let $E_i$ be the set of edges contained in precisely $i$ members of the $k$
1-factors. Let $\mu_k(G)$ be the smallest $|E_0|$ over all lists of $k$
1-factors of $G$. If $G$ is not 3-edge-colorable, then $\mu_3(G) \geq 3$. In
[E. Steffen, 1-factor and cycle covers of cubic graphs, J. Graph Theory (2014)
DOI 10.1002/jgt.21798] it is shown that if $\mu_3(G) \not = 0$, then $2
\mu_3(G)$ is an upper bound for the girth of $G$. We show that $\mu_3(G)$
bounds the oddness $\omega(G)$ of $G$ as well. We prove that $\omega(G)\leq
\frac{2}{3}\mu_3(G)$. If $\mu_3(G) = \frac{2}{3} \mu_3(G)$, then every
$\mu_3(G)$-core has a very specific structure. We call these cores Petersen
cores. We show that for any given oddness there is a cyclically
4-edge-connected cubic graph $G$ with $\omega(G) = \frac{2}{3}\mu_3(G)$. On the
other hand, the difference between $\omega(G)$ and $\frac{2}{3}\mu_3(G)$ can be
arbitrarily big. This is true even if we additionally fix the oddness.
Furthermore, for every integer $k\geq 3$, there exists a bridgeless cubic graph
$G$ such that $\mu_3(G)=k$.
