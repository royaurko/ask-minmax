Generalizing Reiner's notion of set partitions of type $B_n$, we define
colored $B_n$-partitions by coloring the elements in and not in the zero-block
respectively. Considering the generating function of colored $B_n$-partitions,
we get the exact formulas for the expectation and variance of the number of
non-zero-blocks in a random colored $B_n$-partition. We find an asymptotic
expression of the total number of colored $B_n$-partitions up to an error of
$O(n^{-1/2}\log^{7/2}{n})$, and prove that the centralized and normalized
number of non-zero-blocks is asymptotic normal over colored $B_n$-partitions.
