The success of nonviscous hydrodynamics in describing the collective flow
properties of bulk low $p_\perp$ observables at RHIC has led to the claim that
a novel form of {\it strongly coupled} Quark Gluon Plasma (sQGP) is created in
200 AGeV Au+Au collisions. This success depends strongly, however, on the
initial conditions assumed in the calculations. In particular, agreement with
data is only obtained assuming Glauber nuclear reaction plane (participant)
geometry. The KLN model of Color Glass Condenstate (CGC) initial conditions
require the existence of nonvanishing viscous effects. We develop an improved
model of CGC that is more internally consistent between the central and diffuse
edge regions. The improved model is shown to describe bulk rapidity
distributions for a wide assortment of system sizes, geometries and energies.
The self consistency forces a specific $\sqrt{s}$ dependence of the
multiplicity which leads to surprisingly low particle production predictions
for Pb+Pb collisions at LHC COM energies. These predictions are similar to
those made using simple linear extrapolations of multiplicity attempted by the
PHOBOS collaboration.
