This survey article discusses three aspects of knot colorings. Fox colorings
are assignments of labels to arcs, Dehn colorings are assignments of labels to
regions, and Alexander-Briggs colorings assign labels to vertices. The labels
are found among the integers modulo n. The choice of n depends upon the knot.
Each type of coloring rules has an associated rule that must hold at each
crossing. For the Alexander Briggs colorings, the rules hold around regions.
The relationships among the colorings is explained.
