One of the important requirements in image retrieval, indexing,
classification, clustering and etc. is extracting efficient features from
images. The color feature is one of the most widely used visual features. Use
of color histogram is the most common way for representing color feature. One
of disadvantage of the color histogram is that it does not take the color
spatial distribution into consideration. In this paper dynamic color
distribution entropy of neighborhoods method based on color distribution
entropy is presented, which effectively describes the spatial information of
colors. The image retrieval results in compare to improved color distribution
entropy show the acceptable efficiency of this approach.
