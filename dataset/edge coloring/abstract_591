We present empirical color transformations between Sloan Digital Sky Survey
ugri and Johnson-Cousins UBVRc photometry for nearby galaxies (D < 11 Mpc). We
use the Local Volume Legacy (LVL) galaxy sample where there are 90 galaxies
with overlapping observational coverage for these two filter sets. The LVL
galaxy sample consists of normal, non-starbursting galaxies. We also examine
how well the LVL galaxy colors are described by previous transformations
derived from standard calibration stars and model-based galaxy templates. We
find significant galaxy color scatter around most of the previous
transformation relationships. In addition, the previous transformations show
systematic offsets between transformed and observed galaxy colors which are
visible in observed color-color trends. The LVL-based $galaxy$ transformations
show no systematic color offsets and reproduce the observed color-color galaxy
trends.
