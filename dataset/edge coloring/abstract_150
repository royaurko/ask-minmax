We study isospectrality for mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions, and
extend the previously derived graph-theoretic formulation of the
transplantation method. Led by the theory of Brownian motion, we introduce
vertex-colored and edge-colored line graphs that give rise to block diagonal
transplantation matrices. In particular, we rephrase the transplantation method
in terms of representations of free semigroups, and provide a method for
generating adjacency cospectral weighted directed graphs.
