We study the effect of the edge disorder on the conductance of the graphene
nanoribbons (GNRs). We find that only very modest edge disorder is sufficient
to induce the conduction energy gap in the otherwise metallic GNRs and to lift
any difference in the conductance between nanoribbons of different edge
geometry. We relate the formation of the conduction gap to the pronounced edge
disorder induced Anderson-type localization which leads to the strongly
enhanced density of states at the edges, formation of surface-like states and
to blocking of conductive paths through the ribbons.
