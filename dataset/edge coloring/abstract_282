At ~ 400 pc, the Horsehead Nebula (B33) is the closest radiatively-sculpted
pillar to the Sun, but the state and extent of star formation in this structure
is not well understood. We present deep near-infrared (IRSF/SIRIUS JHKs) and
mid-infrared (Spitzer/IRAC) observations of the Horsehead Nebula in order to
characterize the star forming properties of this region and to assess the
likelihood of triggered star formation. Infrared color-color and
color-magnitude diagrams are used to identify young stars based on infrared
excess emission and positions to the right of the Zero-Age Main Sequence,
respectively. Of the 45 sources detected at both near- and mid-infrared
wavelengths, three bona fide and five candidate young stars are identified in
this 7' by 7' region. Two bona fide young stars have flat infrared SEDs and are
located at the western irradiated tip of the pillar. The spatial coincidence of
the protostars at the leading edge of this elephant trunk is consistent with
the Radiation-Driven Implosion (RDI) model of triggered star formation. There
is no evidence, however, for sequential star formation within the immediate ~
1.5' (0.17 pc) region from the cloud/H II region interface.
