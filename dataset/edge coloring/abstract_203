The Bollobas-Riordan polynomial [Math. Ann. 323, 81 (2002)] is a universal
polynomial invariant for ribbon graphs. We find an extension of this polynomial
for a particular family of graphs called rank 3 weakly-colored stranded graphs.
These graphs live in a 3D space and appear as the gluing stranded vertices with
stranded edges according to a definite rule (ordinary graphs and ribbon graphs
can be understood in terms of stranded graphs as well). They also possess a
color structure in a specific sense [Gurau, Commun. Math. Phys. 304, 69
(2011)]. The polynomial constructed is a seven indeterminate polynomial
invariant of these graphs which responds to a similar contraction/deletion
recurrence relation as obeyed by the Tutte and Bollobas-Riordan polynomials. It
is however new due to the particular cellular structure of the graphs on which
it relies. The present polynomial encodes therefore additional data that
neither the Tutte nor the Bollobas-Riordan polynomials can capture for the type
of graphs described in the present work.
