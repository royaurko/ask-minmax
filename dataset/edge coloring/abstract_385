We investigate the three-dimensional structure of the nearby edge-on spiral
galaxy NGC 891 using 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer models, with realistic
spiral structure and fractally clumped dust. Using the spiral and clumpiness
parameters found from recently completed scattered light models we produce
lower resolution SED models which reproduce the global UV-to-FIR SED of NGC
891. Our models contain a color gradient across the major axis of the galaxy -
similar to what is seen in images of the NGC 891. With minor adjustment our SED
models are able to match the majority of M51's SED, a similar galaxy at a near
face-on different inclination.
