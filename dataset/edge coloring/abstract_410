Colors play a particularly important role in both designing and accessing Web
pages. A well-designed color scheme improves Web pages' visual aesthetic and
facilitates user interactions. As far as we know, existing color assessment
studies focus on images; studies on color assessment and editing for Web pages
are rare. This paper investigates color assessment for Web pages based on
existing online color theme-rating data sets and applies this assessment to Web
color edit. This study consists of three parts. First, we study the extraction
of a Web page's color theme. Second, we construct color assessment models that
score the color compatibility of a Web page by leveraging machine learning
techniques. Third, we incorporate the learned color assessment model into a new
application, namely, color transfer for Web pages. Our study combines
techniques from computer graphics, Web mining, computer vision, and machine
learning. Experimental results suggest that our constructed color assessment
models are effective, and useful in the color transfer for Web pages, which has
received little attention in both Web mining and computer graphics communities.
