We report a Chandra ACIS-I observation of the dense globular cluster Terzan
5. The previously known transient low-mass x-ray binary (LMXB) EXO 1745-248 in
the cluster entered a rare high state during our August 2000 observation,
complicating the analysis. Nevertheless nine additional sources clearly
associated with the cluster are also detected, ranging from L_X(0.5-2.5
keV)=5.6*10^{32} down to 8.6*10^{31} ergs/s. Their X-ray colors and
luminosities, and spectral fitting, indicate that five of them are probably
cataclysmic variables, and four are likely quiescent LMXBs containing neutron
stars. We estimate the total number of sources between L_X(0.5-2.5 keV)=10^{32}
and 10^{33} ergs/s as 11.4^{+4.7}_{-1.8} by the use of artificial point source
tests, and note that the numbers of X-ray sources are similar to those detected
in NGC 6440. The improved X-ray position allowed us to identify a plausible
infrared counterpart to EXO 1745-248 on our 1998 Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS
images. This blue star (F110W=18.48, F187W=17.30) lies within 0.2'' of the
boresighted LMXB position. Simultaneous Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE)
spectra, combined with the Chandra spectrum, indicate that EXO 1745-248 is an
ultracompact binary system, and show a strong broad 6.55 keV iron line and an 8
keV smeared reflection edge.
