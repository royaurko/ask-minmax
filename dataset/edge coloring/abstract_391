The crystal structure of potassium doped picene with an exact stoichiometry
(K3C22H14, K3picene from here onwards) has been theoretically determined within
Density Functional Theory allowing complete variational freedom of the crystal
structure parameters and the molecular atomic positions. A modified herringbone
lattice is obtained in which potassium atoms are intercalated between two
paired picene molecules displaying the two possible orientations in the
crystal.Along the c-axis, organic molecules alternate with chains formed by
three potassium atoms. The electronic structureof the doped material resembles
pristine picene, except that now the bottom of the conduction band is occupied
by six electrons coming from the ionized K atoms (six per unit cell).
Wavefunctions remain based mainly on picene molecular orbitals getting their
dispersion from intralayer edge to face CH/pi bonding, while eigenenergies have
been modified by the change in the electrostatic potential. The small
dispersion along the c-axis is assigned to small H-H overlap. From the
calculated electronic density of states we expect metallic behavior for
potassium doped picene.
