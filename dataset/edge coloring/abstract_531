We present a novel calculation of color triplet excitations in two
dimensional QCD with SU(2) colors. It is found that the lowest energy of the
color triplet excitations is proportional to the box length $L$, and can be
written as ${\cal M}_C={L\over{2\pi}}{g^2\over{\pi}} $. Therefore, the color
triplet excited states go to infinity when the system size becomes infinity.
The properties of the color triplet states such as the wave functions are
studied for the finite box length.
