Thermal infrared photometry in the $L$- and $M'$-band and $L - M'$ colors of
type-1 and type-2 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are presented. After combining
our observations with photometric data at similar wavelengths taken from the
literature, we find that the excess of $L - M'$ colors of type-2 AGNs (37
sources, 50 data points) relative to type-1 AGNs (27 sources, 36 data points),
due to dust extinction, is statistically detectable, but very small. We next
investigate the $L - M'$ colors of type-2 AGNs by separating less dust-obscured
type-2 AGNs and highly dust-obscured type-2 AGNs. In both cases, the $L - M'$
colors are similar to the intrinsic $L - M'$ color of unobscured AGNs, and the
$L - M'$ color excess of the latter highly dust-obscured type-2 AGNs due to
dust extinction is much smaller than that expected from the Galactic dust
extinction curve. Contamination from starbursts and the time lag of flux
variation are unlikely to explain this small $L - M'$ color excess, which is
best explained if the dust extinction curve in the close vicinity of AGNs is
fairly flat at 3--5 $\mu$m as a result of a size increase of the absorbing dust
grains through coagulation.
