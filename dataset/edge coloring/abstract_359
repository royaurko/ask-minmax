We study the contribution of projection effects to the intrinsic thickness of
the Fundamental Plane (FP) of elliptical galaxies. The Monte-Carlo mapping
technique between model properties and observed quantities, introduced by
Bertin, Ciotti, and Del Principe (2002), is extended to oblate, two-integrals
galaxy models, with non-homologous density profiles, adjustable flattening,
variable amount of ordered rotational support, and for which all the relevant
projected dynamical quantities can be expressed in fully analytical way. In
agreement with previous works, it is found that projection effects move models
not exactly parallel to the edge-on FP, by an amount that can be as large as
the observed FP thickness. The statistical contribution of projection effects
to the FP thickness is however marginal, and the estimated physical FP rms
thickness is ~90% of the observed one (when corrected for measurement errors).
