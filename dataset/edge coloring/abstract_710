Gluon jets with a large gap in the rapidity distribution of particles within
the jet are very sensitive to color reconnection effects. Gluon jets of this
type, selected from hadronic Z0 decay events produced in e+e- annihilations at
LEP, are used to test three QCD models which include a simulation of color
reconnection: one in the Ariadne Monte Carlo, one in the
 Herwig Monte Carlo, and the other by Rathsman in the Pythia Monte Carlo. We
conclude that color reconnection as implemented by the Rathsman and Ariadne
models is disfavored. We don't obtain a definite conclusion concerning the
Herwig color reconnection model.
