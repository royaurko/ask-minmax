We analyze Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) Proportional Counter Array
(PCA) data of the transient low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) system 1A 1744-361. We
explore the X-ray intensity and spectral evolution of the source, perform
timing analysis, and find that 1A 1744-361 shows `atoll' behavior during the
outbursts. The color-color diagram indicates that this LMXB was observed in a
low intensity spectrally hard (low-hard) state and in a high intensity `banana'
state. The low-hard state shows a horizontal pattern in the color-color
diagram, and the previously reported `dipper QPO' appears only during this
state. We also perform energy spectral analyses, and report the first detection
of broad iron emission line and iron absorption edge from 1A 1744-361.
