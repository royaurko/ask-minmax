The main contributions of this paper are three-fold. First, we use a dynamic
approach based on Reiter's pioneering work on Karp-Miller computation graphs to
give a new and short proof of Mohar's Minty-type Theorem. Second, we bridge
circular colorings and discrete event dynamic systems to show that the Barbosa
and Gafni's results on circular chromatic number can be generalized to
edge-weighted symmetric directed graphs. Third, we use the above-mentioned
dynamic view of circular colorings to construct new improved lower bounds on
the circular chromatic number of a graph. We show as an example that the
circular chromatic number of the line graph of the Petersen graph can be
determined very easily by using these bounds.
