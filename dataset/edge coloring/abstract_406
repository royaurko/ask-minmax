A graph G is a homomorphic preimage of another graph H, or equivalently G is
H-colorable, if there exists a graph homomorphism from G to H. A classic
problem is to characterize the family of homomorphic preimages of a given graph
H. A geometric graph is a simple graph G together with a straight line drawing
of G in the plane with the vertices in general position. A geometric
homomorphism (resp. isomorphism) is a graph homomorphism (resp. isomorphism)
that preserves edge crossings (resp. and non-crossings). The homomorphism
posetof a graph G is the set of isomorphism classes of geometric realizations
of G partially ordered by the existence of injective geometric homomorphisms. A
geometric graph G is H-colorable if there is a geometric homomorphism from G to
some element of the homomorphism poset of H. We provide necessary and
sufficient conditions for a geometric graph to be C_n-colorable for n less than
6.
