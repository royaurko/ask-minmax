An Adinkra is a class of graphs with certain signs marking its vertices and
edges, which encodes off-shell representations of the super Poincar\'e algebra.
The markings on the vertices and edges of an Adinkra are cochains for cubical
cohomology. This article explores the cubical cohomology of Adinkras, treating
these markings analogously to characteristic classes on smooth manifolds.
