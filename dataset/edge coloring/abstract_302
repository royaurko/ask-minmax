We have obtained V and I-band photometry for about 700 stars in the field of
the dwarf irregular galaxy IC 5152, previously considered a possible member of
the Local Group. Deep VI color-magnitude diagrams are presented of the main
body of this galaxy and of a nearby field. We infer a distance by comparison
with the VI color-magnitude diagrams of similar galaxies and with theoretical
isochrones. The distance modulus to IC 5152 is found to be m-Mo = 26.15 +/-
0.2, adopting E(V-I) = 0. This distance of D=1.7 Mpc implies that IC 5152 is
not a certain member of the Local Group. We also construct a deep optical
luminosity function. By comparison with theoretical isochrones, we find a
metallicity Z of approximately 0.002, which is lower than previous estimates.
Using this metallicity and distance, IC 5152 now fits the
metallicity-luminosity relation for dwarf galaxies. The youngest stars in the
field studied have an age of ~10^7 Gyr, and there is a substantial population
of stars with log t>7.8-8 yr. The central region of IC 5152 is an active site
of star formation, as found by comparing our optical photometry with Hubble
Space Telescope ultraviolet images. Several candidate globular clusters are
found, as well as a candidate for a potential nucleus.
