Tunneling from a two-dimensional contact into quantum-Hall edges is
considered theoretically for a case where the barrier is extended, uniform, and
parallel to the edge. In contrast to previously realized tunneling geometries,
details of the microscopic edge structure are exhibited directly in the voltage
and magnetic-field dependence of the differential tunneling conductance. In
particular, it is possible to measure the dispersion of the edge-magnetoplasmon
mode, and the existence of additional, sometimes counterpropagating,
edge-excitation branches could be detected.
