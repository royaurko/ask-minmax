Edge on systems reveal the properties of disk galaxies as a function of
height, z, above the plane. Four local edge-on galaxies, that are close enough
to have been resolved into stars by the Hubble Space Telescope, show thick
disks, composed of a red stellar population, which is old and relatively metal
rich. Color gradients, d(V-I)/dz, are zero or slightly positive. Favored models
may have an explicit thick disk formation phase.
