We present the initial results of a Hubble Space Telescope/ACS snapshot
survey of 16 nearby, edge-on, late-type galaxies covering a range in distance
from 2 to 19 Mpc. The images of these galaxies show significant resolved
stellar populations. We derive F606W and F814W photometry for >1.2 million
stars, and present color-magnitude diagrams which show a mixture of young,
intermediate, and old stars in each galaxy. In one of the fields we
serendipitously detect stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud. We also identify
a candidate young dwarf galaxy lying ~2 kpc above the plane of NGC 4631. For
the nearest six galaxies, we derive tip of the red giant branch distances and
demonstrate that these galaxies fall on the K-band Tully-Fisher relation
established in clusters. From the color of the red giant branch, we also find
evidence that these galaxies possess a metal-poor thick disk or halo
population.
