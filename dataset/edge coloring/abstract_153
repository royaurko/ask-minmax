Sudoku grids can be thought of as graphs where the vertices are the squares
of the grid, and edges join vertices in the same row, column, or sub-grid. A
Sudoku puzzle corresponds to a partial proper coloring of the Sudoku graph. We
provide a new and simpler proof of the theorem which states that the number of
completions of partial colorings of a graph is a polynomial in the number of
colors (originally due to Herzberg and Murty). Moreover, we construct Sudoku
squares of arbitrary size with distinct entries on both diagonals (a similar
proof was first published by Keedwell, unknown to the contributor).
