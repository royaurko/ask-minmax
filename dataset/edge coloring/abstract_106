An edge colored graph $G$ is rainbow edge connected if any two vertices are
connected by a path whose edges have distinct colors. The rainbow connectivity
of a connected graph $G$, denoted by $rc(G)$, is the smallest number of colors
that are needed in order to make $G$ rainbow connected.
  In this work we study the rainbow connectivity of binomial random graphs at
the connectivity threshold $p=\frac{\log n+\om}{n}$ where $\om=\om(n)\to\infty$
and ${\om}=o(\log{n})$ and of random $r$-regular graphs where $r \geq 3$ is a
fixed integer. Specifically, we prove that the rainbow connectivity $rc(G)$ of
$G=G(n,p)$ satisfies $rc(G) \sim \max\set{Z_1,diameter(G)}$ with high
probability (\whp). Here $Z_1$ is the number of vertices in $G$ whose degree
equals 1 and the diameter of $G$ is asymptotically equal to $\diam$ \whp.
Finally, we prove that the rainbow connectivity $rc(G)$ of the random
$r$-regular graph $G=G(n,r)$ satisfies $rc(G) =O(\log^2{n})$ \whp.
