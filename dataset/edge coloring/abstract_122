If r(s, t) = p, we shall call Kp a Ramsey Minimal Example. We prove that if
r{s,t) = p, and one edge is deleted from the Ramsey Minimal Example, Kp, the
resulting graph no longer has the Ramsey property, that is, its edges can be
colored red or blue so that the "red" subgraph does not contain Ks and the
"blue" subgraph does not contain Kt. The paper is written in an accessible
style explaining the process that led us to make the conjecture and then prove
this result.
