We develop a color bosonization approach to treatment of QCD gauge field
(''gluons'') at low energies in order to derive an effective color action of
QCD taking into account the quark chiral anomaly in the case of SU(2) color..
We have found that there exists such a region in the chiral sector of color
space, where a gauge field coincides with of chirally rotated vector field,
while an induced axial vector field disappears. In this region, the unit color
vector of chiral field plays a defining role, and a gauge field is parametrized
in terms of chiral parameters, so that no additional degrees of freedom are
introduced by the chiral field. A QCD gauge field decomposition in color
bosonization is a sum of a chirally rotated gauge field and an induced
axial-vector field expressed in terms of gluonic variables. An induced
axial-vector field defines the chiral color anomaly and an effective color
action of QCD. This action admits existence of a gauge invariant d=2 condensate
of induced axial-vector field and mass.
