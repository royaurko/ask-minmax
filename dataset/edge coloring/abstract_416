In this paper, a color transfer framework to evoke different emotions for
images based on color combinations is proposed. The purpose of this color
transfer is to change the "look and feel" of images, i.e., evoking different
emotions. Colors are confirmed as the most attractive factor in images. In
addition, various studies in both art and science areas have concluded that
other than single color, color combinations are necessary to evoke specific
emotions. Therefore, we propose a novel framework to transfer color of images
based on color combinations, using a predefined color emotion model. The
contribution of this new framework is three-fold. First, users do not need to
provide reference images as used in traditional color transfer algorithms. In
most situations, users may not have enough aesthetic knowledge or path to
choose desired reference images. Second, because of the usage of color
combinations instead of single color for emotions, a new color transfer
algorithm that does not require an image library is proposed. Third, again
because of the usage of color combinations, artifacts that are normally seen in
traditional frameworks using single color are avoided. We present encouraging
results generated from this new framework and its potential in several possible
applications including color transfer of photos and paintings.
