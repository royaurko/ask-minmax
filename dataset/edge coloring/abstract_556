In this work, the tridiagonal method is used to distinguish between edges
modes and area modes to study the edge sites properties effect on edge
localized states of semi-infinite zigzag 2D honeycomb graphene sheet. The
results show a realistic behavior for the dependance of edge localized states
of zigzag graphene on the edge sites properties which explaining the
experimental results of measured local density of states at the edge of
graphene, while at the same time removing the inconsistence between the
semiconductor behavior found in the experimental data for fabricated GNRs and
the expected theoretical semi-metallic behavior calculated without considering
the edge properties effect on the edge localized states.
