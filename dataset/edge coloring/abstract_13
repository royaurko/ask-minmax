The theory of colorful graphs can be developed by working in Galois field
modulo (p), p > 2 and a prime number. The paper proposes a program of possible
conversion of graph theory into a pleasant colorful appearance. We propose to
paint the usual black (indicating presence of an edge) and white (indicating
absence of an edge) edges of graphs using multitude of colors and study their
properties. All colorful graphs considered here are simple, i.e. not having any
multiple edges or self-loops. This paper is an invitation to the program of
generalizing usual graph theory in this direction.
