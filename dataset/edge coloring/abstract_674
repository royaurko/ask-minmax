It is shown that in the Love-Kirchhoff plate theory, an edge wave can travel
in a circular thin disk made of an isotropic elastic material. This disk edge
wave turns out to be faster than the classic flexural acoustic wave in a
straight-edged, semi-infinite, thin plate, a wave which it mimics when the
curvature radius becomes very large compared to the wavelength.
