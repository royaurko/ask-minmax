Using long exposures taken in the V and I bands with a 4096$\times$4096 pixel
CCD array at the prime focus of the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope, we have
confirmed the discovery by Sackett et al. (1994) of a flat, faint luminous halo
around the edge-on Sc galaxy NGC$\thinspace$5907. This halo is redder than the
disk. Its nature is still an observational challenge. We suggest however that
its color can only be accounted for by stars less massive than 0.8 $M_{\odot}$.
Their total mass in NGC$\thinspace$5907 is very uncertain, but it might
possibly account for the excess dynamical mass in this galaxy. Alternatively
their distribution might trace the dark potential without contributing signifi-
cantly to the mass. We give upper limits to the extinction by an hypothetical
dust in the halo.
