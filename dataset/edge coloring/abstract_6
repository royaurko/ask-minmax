A graph is properly edge-colored if no two adjacent edges have the same
color. The smallest number of edges in a graph any of whose proper edge
colorings contains a totally multicolored copy of a graph H is the size
anti-Ramsey number AR_s(H) of H. This number in offline and online setting is
investigated here.
