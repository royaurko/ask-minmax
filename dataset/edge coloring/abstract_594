Color image segmentation is a very emerging topic for image processing
research. Since it has the ability to present the result in a way that is much
more close to the human yes perceive, so todays more research is going on this
area. Choosing a proper color space is a very important issue for color image
segmentation process. Generally LAB and HSV are the two frequently chosen color
spaces. In this paper a comparative analysis is performed between these two
color spaces with respect to color image segmentation. For measuring their
performance, we consider the parameters: mse and psnr . It is found that HSV
color space is performing better than LAB.
