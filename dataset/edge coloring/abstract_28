In this letter we propose to denoise digital color images via an improved
geometric diffusion scheme. By introducing edges detected from all three color
channels into the diffusion the proposed scheme avoids color smearing
artifacts. Vector valued diffusion is used to control the smoothing and the
geometry of color images are taken into consideration. Color edge strength
function computed from different planes is introduced and it stops the
diffusion spread across chromatic edges. Experimental results indicate that the
scheme achieves good denoising with edge preservation when compared to other
related schemes.
