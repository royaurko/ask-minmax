We study the initial state radiation process $e^+ e^-\to{J/\psi}+X+\gamma$
for $J/\psi$ production at B factory, and find the cross section is 61% larger
than it's Born one for color octet part and is about half as it's Born one for
color singlet part. Furthermore, the color singlet and color octet signal are
very clearly separated in it's $E_\gamma$ spectra due to kinematics difference.
We suggest to measure this $E_\gamma$ spectra at B factory to determine the
color octet effect.
