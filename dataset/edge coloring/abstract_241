We show that correlators of the hermitian one-Matrix model with a general
potential can be mapped to the counting of certain triples of permutations and
hence to counting of holomorphic maps from world-sheet to sphere target with
three branch points on the target. This allows the use of old matrix model
results to derive new explicit formulae for a class of Hurwitz numbers.
Holomorphic maps with three branch points are related, by Belyi's theorem, to
curves and maps defined over algebraic numbers $\bmQ$. This shows that the
string theory dual of the one-matrix model at generic couplings has worldsheets
defined over the algebraic numbers and a target space $ \mP^1 (\bmQ)$. The
absolute Galois group $ Gal (\bmQ / \mQ) $ acts on the Feynman diagrams of the
1-matrix model, which are related to Grothendieck's Dessins d'Enfants.
Correlators of multi-matrix models are mapped to the counting of triples of
permutations subject to equivalences defined by subgroups of the permutation
groups. This is related to colorings of the edges of the Grothendieck Dessins.
The colored-edge Dessins are useful as a tool for describing some known
invariants of the $ Gal (\bmQ / \mQ) $ action on Grothendieck Dessins and for
defining new invariants.
