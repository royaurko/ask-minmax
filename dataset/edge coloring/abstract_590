Di-jet resonance searches are simple, yet powerful and model-independent,
probes for discovering new particles at hadron colliders. Once such a resonance
has been discovered it is important to determine the mass, spin, couplings,
chiral behavior and color properties to determine the underlying theoretical
structure. We propose a new variable which, in the absence of decays of the
resonance into new non-standard states, distinguishes between color-octet and
color-singlet resonances. To keep our study widely applicable we study
phenomenological models of color-octet and color-singlet resonances in flavor
universal as well as flavor non-universal scenarios. We present our analysis
for a wide range of mass (2.5 - 6 TeV), couplings and flavor scenarios for the
LHC with center of mass energy of 14 TeV and varying integrated luminosities of
30, 100, 300 and 1000 ${\rm fb}^{-1}$. We find encouraging results to
distinguish color-octet and color-singlet resonances for different flavor
scenarios at the LHC.
