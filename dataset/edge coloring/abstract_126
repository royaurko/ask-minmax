Let G be a plane graph with exactly one triangle T and all other cycles of
length at least 5, and let C be a facial cycle of G of length at most six. We
prove that a 3-coloring of C does not extend to a 3-coloring of G if and only
if C has length exactly six and there is a color x such that either G has an
edge joining two vertices of C colored x, or T is disjoint from C and every
vertex of T is adjacent to a vertex of C colored x. This is a lemma to be used
in a future paper of this series.
