Let $S$ be a subset of the cyclic group $\Z_n$. The cyclic Haar graph
$H(\Z_n,S)$ is the bipartite graph with color classes $\Z_n^+$ and $\Z_n^-,$
and edges $\{x^+,y^-\},$ where $x,y \in \Z_n$ and $y - x \in S$. In this paper
we give sufficient and necessary conditions for the isomorphism of two
connected cyclic Haar graphs of valency 4.
