By the Road Coloring Theorem (Trahtman, 2008), the edges of any aperiodic
directed multigraph with a constant out-degree can be colored such that the
resulting automaton admits a reset word. There may also be a need for a
particular reset word to be admitted. For certain words it is NP-complete to
decide whether there is a suitable coloring of a given multigraph. We present a
classification of all words over the binary alphabet that separates such words
from those that make the problem solvable in polynomial time. We show that the
classification becomes different if we consider only strongly connected
multigraphs. In this restricted setting the classification remains incomplete.
