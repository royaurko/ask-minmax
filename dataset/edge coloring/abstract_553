We study edge state magnetism in graphene nanostructures using a mean field
theory of the Hubbard model. We investigate how the magnetism of the zigzag
edges of graphene is affected by the presence of other types of terminating
edges and defects. By a detailed study of both regular shapes, such as
polygonal nanodots and nanoribbons, and irregular shapes, we conclude that the
magnetism in zigzag edges is very robust. Our calculations show that the zigzag
edges that are longer than three to four repeat units are always magnetic,
irrespective of other edges, regular or irregular. We, therefore, clearly
demonstrate that the edge irregularities and defects of the bounding edges of
graphene nanostructures does not destroy the edge state magnetism.
