We present optical and X-ray observations of the afterglow and host galaxy of
the short-hard GRB 060121. The faint R-band afterglow is seen to decline as
t^(-0.66) while the X-ray falls as t^-1.18, indicating the presence of the
cooling break between the two frequencies. However, the R-band afterglow is
very faint compared to the predicted extrapolation of the X-ray afterglow to
the optical regime (specifically, beta_OX ~ 0.2), while the K-band is
consistent with this extrapolation (beta_KX ~ 0.6), demonstrating suppression
of the optical flux. Late time {\it HST} observations place stringent limits on
the afterglow R-band flux implying a break in the R-band lightcurve. They also
show that the burst occurred at the edge of a faint red galaxy which most
likely lies at a significantly higher redshift than the previous optically
identified short-duration bursts. Several neighboring galaxies also have very
red colors that are similarly suggestive of higher redshift. We consider
possible explanations for the faintness and color of the burst. Our preferred
model is that the burst occurred at moderately high redshift and was
significantly obscured; however, it is also possible that the burst lies at z >
4.5 in which case the faintness of the R-band afterglow could be attributed to
the Lyman-break. We discuss the implications that either scenario would have
for the nature of the progenitors of short bursts.
