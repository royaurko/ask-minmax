Fr\'ed\'eric Meunier's question about a multicolored Sperner lemma is
addressed, leaving the question of connectivity for the color hypergraphs of
such a multicolored simplex. Sperner's lemma asserts the existence of a simplex
using all the colors for any vertex coloring of a subdivision of a large
simplex with appropriate boundary conditions. Meunier's questions generalizes
this to the situation of having several such colorings and asserts the
existence of a simplex using enough different colors from each coloring.
