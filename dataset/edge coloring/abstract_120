The growth of spiral mounds containing a screw dislocation is compared to the
growth of wedding cakes by two-dimensional nucleation. Using phase field
simulations and homoepitaxial growth experiments on the Pt(111) surface we show
that both structures attain the same characteristic large scale shape when a
significant step edge barrier suppresses interlayer transport. The higher
vertical growth rate observed for the spiral mounds on Pt(111) reflects the
different incorporation mechanisms for atoms in the top region and can be
formally represented by an enhanced apparent step edge barrier.
