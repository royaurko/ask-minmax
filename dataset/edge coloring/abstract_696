This work proposes a wavelet based Steganographic technique for the color
image. The true color cover image and the true color secret image both are
decomposed into three separate color planes namely R, G and B. Each plane of
the images is decomposed into four sub bands using DWT. Each color plane of the
secret image is hidden by alpha blending technique in the corresponding sub
bands of the respective color planes of the original image. During embedding,
secret image is dispersed within the original image depending upon the alpha
value. Extraction of the secret image varies according to the alpha value. In
this approach the stego image generated is of acceptable level of
imperceptibility and distortion compared to the cover image and the overall
security is high.
