An edge-colored graph $G$, where adjacent edges may be colored the same, is
rainbow connected if any two vertices of $G$ are connected by a path whose
edges have distinct colors. The rainbow connection number $rc(G)$ of a
connected graph $G$ is the smallest number of colors that are needed in order
to make $G$ rainbow connected. In this paper, we give a sharp upper bound that
$rc(G)\leq\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$ for any 2-connected graph $G$ of order $n$,
which improves the results of Caro et al. to best possible.
