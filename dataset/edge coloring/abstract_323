We present new optical imaging and spectroscopy of the peculiar, edge-on Sbc
galaxy UGC10043. B & R imaging reveals that the inner bulge of UGC10043 is
elongated perpendicular to the major axis. At larger r, the bulge isophotes
twist to become oblate and nearly circular, suggesting the bulge is triaxial.
Based on stellar and ionized gas kinematics, the bulge shows no clear evidence
for rotation about either its major or minor axis. The southwestern quadrant of
the bulge is girdled by a narrow dust lane parallel to the minor axis that may
be part of an inner polar ring. The stellar disk of UGC10043 has a low optical
surface brightness, a small scale height, a mild integral sign warp, and a
dusty, inner region that appears tilted relative to the outlying disk. The HA
and [NII] emission lines in UGC10043 resolve into multiple velocity components,
indicating the presence of a large-scale galactic wind with an outflow velocity
of ~104 km/s. HA+[NII] imaging reaffirms this picture by revealing ionized gas
extended to |z|~3.5kpc in a biconical structure. The [NII]/HA line intensity
ratio increases with increasing distance from the plane, reaching values as
high as 1.7. Unlike most galaxies with large-scale winds, UGC10043 has only a
modest global star formation rate (~1M_sun/yr), implying the wind is powered by
a rather feeble central starburst. We discuss evolutionary scenarios that could
account for both the structural complexities of UGC10043 and its large-scale
wind. [Abridged]
