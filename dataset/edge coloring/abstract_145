Reduced ordering based vector filters have proved successful in removing
long-tailed noise from color images while preserving edges and fine image
details. These filters commonly utilize variants of the Minkowski distance to
order the color vectors with the aim of distinguishing between noisy and
noise-free vectors. In this paper, we review various alternative distance
measures and evaluate their performance on a large and diverse set of images
using several effectiveness and efficiency criteria. The results demonstrate
that there are in fact strong alternatives to the popular Minkowski metrics.
