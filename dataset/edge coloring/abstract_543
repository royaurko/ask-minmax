Quarks are color charged particles. Due to their motion there is a strong
possibility of generation of color magnetic field. It is shown that however
hadrons are color singlet particles they may have non-zero color magnetic
moment. Due to this color magnetic moment hadrons can show color interaction.
In this paper we have studied the chromomagnetic properties of nuclear matter.
