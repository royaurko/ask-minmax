In this paper, we construct a theory of the NJL-type where superconductivity
is present, and yet the super-conducting state remains, in the average, color
symmetric. This shows that the present approach to color superconductivity is
consistent with color singlet-ness. Indeed, quarks are free in the deconfined
phase, but the deconfined phase itself is believed to be a color singlet. The
usual description of the color superconducting state violates color
singlet-ness. On the other hand, the color superconducting state here proposed,
is color symmetric in the sense that an arbitrary color rotation leads to an
equivalent state, with precisely the same physical properties.
