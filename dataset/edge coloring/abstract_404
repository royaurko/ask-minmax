In this paper, a robust vehicle local position estimation with the help of
single camera sensor and GPS is presented. A modified Inverse Perspective
Mapping, illuminant Invariant techniques and object detection based approach is
used to localize the vehicle in the road. Vehicles current lane, its position
from road boundary and other cars are used to define its local position. For
this purpose Lane markings are detected using a Laplacian edge feature, robust
to shadowing. Effect of shadowing and extra sun light are removed using Lab
color space and illuminant invariant techniques. Lanes are assumed to be as
parabolic model and fitted using robust RANSAC. This method can reliably detect
all lanes of the road, estimate lane departure angle and local position of
vehicle relative to lanes, road boundary and other cars. Different type of
obstacle like pedestrians, vehicles are detected using HOG feature based
deformable part model.
