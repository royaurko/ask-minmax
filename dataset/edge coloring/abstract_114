Murakami-Ohtsuki-Yamada introduced an evaluation of certain oriented planar
trivalent graphs with colored edges. This evaluation plays a key role in the
evaluation of the colored HOMFLY polynomial of a link in 3-space and its
Khovanov-Rozansky categorification. Our goal is is to give a generating series
formula for the evaluation of MOY graphs, which may be useful in
categorification, and in the study of q-holonomicity of the colored HOMFLY
polynomial.
