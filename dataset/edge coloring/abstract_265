A framework of demosaicing and superresolution for color filter array (CFA)
via residual image reconstruction and sparse representation is presented.Given
the intermediate image produced by certain demosaicing and interpolation
technique, a residual image between the final reconstruction image and the
intermediate image is reconstructed using sparse representation.The final
reconstruction image has richer edges and details than that of the intermediate
image. Specifically, a generic dictionary is learned from a large set of
composite training data composed of intermediate data and residual data. The
learned dictionary implies a mapping between the two data. A specific
dictionary adaptive to the input CFA is learned thereafter. Using the adaptive
dictionary, the sparse coefficients of intermediate data are computed and
transformed to predict residual image. The residual image is added back into
the intermediate image to obtain the final reconstruction image. Experimental
results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance in terms of PSNR and
subjective visual perception.
