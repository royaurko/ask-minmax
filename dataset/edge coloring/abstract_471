Transient Lunar Phenomena (TLP) observed on the surface of the moon, are of
high rarity, low repetition rate and very short observation times, resulting in
that there is little information about this topic. This necessitates the
importance of studying them in detail. They have been observed as very bright
clouds of gases of past geological lunar activity. According its duration,
there have been registered in different colors (yellow, orange, red). Its size
can vary from a few to hundreds of kilometers. The TLP Usually occur in certain
locations as in some craters (Aristarchus, Plato, Kepler, etc.) and at the
edges of lunar maria (Sea of Fecundity, Alps hills area, etc.). The exposure
time of a TLP can vary from a few seconds to a little more than one hour.
  In this paper, a literature review of the TLP is made to build a theory from
the existing reports and scientific hypotheses, trying to unify and synthesize
data and concepts that are scattered by different lunar research lines. The TLP
need to be explained from celestial mechanics and planetary astrophysics to
explain the possible causes from phenomena such as outgassing moon, moonquakes
and the gravitational interaction. Extrapolating these hypothetical physical
knowledge, arguments are exposed for Lunar degassing theory showing this as the
most consistent. It is build also a the theory of how to observe, describe,
explain and predict the TLP.
