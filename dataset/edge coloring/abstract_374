Single trajectories of magnetic line motion indicate the persistence of a
central protected plasma core, surrounded by a chaotic shell enclosed in a
double-sided transport barrier : the latter is identified as being composed of
two Cantori located on two successive "most-noble" numbers values of the
perturbed safety factor, and forming an internal transport barrier (ITB).
Magnetic lines which succeed to escape across this barrier begin to wander in a
wide chaotic sea extending up to a very robust barrier (as long as L<1) which
is identified mathematically as a robust KAM surface at the plasma edge. In
this case the motion is shown to be intermittent, with long stages of
pseudo-trapping in the chaotic shell, or of sticking around island remnants, as
expected for a continuous time random walk.
