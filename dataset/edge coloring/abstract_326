We have carried out detailed analysis on the black hole candidate (BHC) X-
ray transient Swift J1753.5-0127 observed by the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer
(RXTE) during its outburst in 2005 {2006. The spectral analysis shows that the
emissions are dominated by the hard X-rays, thus revealing the low/hard state
of the source during the outburst. The peak luminosity is found lower than the
typical value of balancing the mass flow and evaporation of the inner edge of
disk (Meyer-Hofmeister 2004). As a result, the disk is prevented from extending
inward to produce strong soft X-rays, corresponding to the so-called high/soft
state. These are the typical characteristics for a small subset of BHCs, i.e.
those soft X-ray transients stay at the low/hard state during the outburst. In
most observational time, the QPO frequencies are found to vary roughly linearly
with the fluxes and the spectral indices, while the deviation from this
relationship at the peak luminosity might provide the first observational
evidence of a partially evaporated inner edge of the accretion disk. The
anti-correlation between the QPO frequency and spectral color suggests that the
global disk oscillation model proposed by Titarchuk & Osherovich (2000) is not
likely at work.
