Molecular interactions are key to many chemical and biological processes like
protein function. In many signaling processes they occur in sub-cellular areas
displaying nanoscale organizations and involving molecular assemblies. The
nanometric dimensions and the dynamic nature of the interactions make their
investigations complex in live cells. While super-resolution fluorescence
microscopies offer live-cell molecular imaging with sub-wavelength resolutions,
they lack specificity for distinguishing interacting molecule populations. Here
we combine super-resolution microscopy and single-molecule F\"orster Resonance
Energy Transfer (FRET) to identify dimers of receptors induced by ligand
binding and provide super-resolved images of their membrane distribution in
live cells. By developing a two-color
universal-Point-Accumulation-In-the-Nanoscale-Topography (uPAINT) method,
dimers of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) activated by EGF are studied
at ultra-high densities, revealing preferential cell-edge sub-localization.
This methodology which is specifically devoted to the study of molecules in
interaction, may find other applications in biological systems where
understanding of molecular organization is crucial.
