We have obtained FUSE and HST STIS spectra of HR 4796A, a nearby 8 Myr old
main sequence star that possesses a dusty circumstellar disk whose inclination
has been constrained from high resolution near-infrared observations to be ~17
deg from edge-on. We searched for circumstellar absorption in the ground states
of C II at 1036.3 A, O I at 1039.2 A, Zn II at 2026.1 A, Lyman series H2, and
CO (A-X) and failed to detect any of these species. We place upper limits on
the column densities and infer upper limits on the gas masses assuming that the
gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium, is well-mixed, and has a temperature, Tgas ~
65 K. Our measurements suggest that this system possesses very little molecular
gas. Therefore, we infer an upper limit for the gas:dust ratio (<4.0) assuming
that the gas is atomic. We measure less gas in this system than is required to
form the envelope of Jupiter.
