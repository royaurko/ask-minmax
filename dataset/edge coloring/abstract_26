A proper edge-coloring of a graph $G$ with colors $1,\ldots,t$ is called an
\emph{interval cyclic $t$-coloring} if all colors are used, and the edges
incident to each vertex $v\in V(G)$ are colored by $d_{G}(v)$ consecutive
colors modulo $t$, where $d_{G}(v)$ is the degree of a vertex $v$ in $G$. A
graph $G$ is \emph{interval cyclically colorable} if it has an interval cyclic
$t$-coloring for some positive integer $t$. The set of all interval cyclically
colorable graphs is denoted by $\mathfrak{N}_{c}$. For a graph $G\in
\mathfrak{N}_{c}$, the least and the greatest values of $t$ for which it has an
interval cyclic $t$-coloring are denoted by $w_{c}(G)$ and $W_{c}(G)$,
respectively. In this paper we investigate some properties of interval cyclic
colorings. In particular, we prove that if $G$ is a triangle-free graph with at
least two vertices and $G\in \mathfrak{N}_{c}$, then $W_{c}(G)\leq \vert
V(G)\vert +\Delta(G)-2$. We also obtain bounds on $w_{c}(G)$ and $W_{c}(G)$ for
various classes of graphs. Finally, we give some methods for constructing of
interval cyclically non-colorable graphs.
