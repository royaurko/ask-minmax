We have performed mid-IR photometry of the young open cluster NGC 2264 using
the images obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope IRAC and MIPS instruments
and present a normalized classification scheme of young stellar objects in
various color-color diagrams to make full use of the information from
multicolor photometry. These results are compared with the classification
scheme based on the slope of the spectral energy distribution (SED).
  From the spatial distributions of Class I and II stars, we have identified
two subclusterings of Class I objects in the CONE region of Sung et al. The
disked stars in the other star forming region S MON are mostly Class II
objects. These three regions show a distinct difference in the fractional
distribution of SED slopes as well as the mean value of SED slopes. The
fraction of stars with primordial disks is nearly flat between log m = 0.2 --
-0.5, and that of transition disks is very high for solar mass stars. In
addition, we have derived a somewhat higher value of the primordial disk
fraction for NGC 2264 members located below the main pre-main sequence locus
(so-called BMS stars). This result supports the idea that BMS stars are young
stars with nearly edge-on disks. We have also found that the fraction of
primordial disks is very low near the most massive star S Mon and increases
with distance from S Mon.
