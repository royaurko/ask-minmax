We describe simple linear time algorithms for coloring the squares of
balanced and unbalanced quadtrees so that no two adjacent squares are given the
same color. If squares sharing sides are defined as adjacent, we color balanced
quadtrees with three colors, and unbalanced quadtrees with four colors; these
results are both tight, as some quadtrees require this many colors. If squares
sharing corners are defined as adjacent, we color balanced or unbalanced
quadtrees with six colors; for some quadtrees, at least five colors are
required.
