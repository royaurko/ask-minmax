Two edge colorings of a graph are {\em edge-Kempe equivalent} if one can be
obtained from the other by a series of edge-Kempe switches. This work gives
some results for the number of edge-Kempe equivalence classes for cubic graphs.
In particular we show every 2-connected planar bipartite cubic graph has
exactly one edge-Kempe equivalence class. Additionally, we exhibit infinite
families of nonplanar bipartite cubic graphs with a range of numbers of
edge-Kempe equivalence classes. Techniques are developed that will be useful
for analyzing other classes of graphs as well.
