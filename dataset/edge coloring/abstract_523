Image colorization adds color to grayscale images. It not only increases the
visual appeal of grayscale images, but also enriches the information contained
in scientific images that lack color information. Most existing methods of
colorization require laborious user interaction for scribbles or image
segmentation. To eliminate the need for human labor, we develop an automatic
image colorization method using epitome. Built upon a generative graphical
model, epitome is a condensed image appearance and shape model which also
proves to be an effective summary of color information for the colorization
task. We train the epitome from the reference images and perform inference in
the epitome to colorize grayscale images, rendering better colorization results
than previous method in our experiments.
