We study heterostructures where a two-dimensional topological insulator (TI)
is attached to two normal metal (NM) electrodes while an island of a
ferromagnetic insulator (FI) with precessing magnetization covers a portion of
its lateral edges to induce time-dependent exchange field underneath via the
magnetic proximity effect. When the FI island covers both lateral edges, such
device pumps pure spin current in the absence of any bias voltage, thereby
acting as an efficient spin battery with giant output current even at very
small microwave power input driving the precession. When only one lateral edge
is covered by the FI island, both charge and spin current are pumped into the
NM electrodes. We delineate conditions for the corresponding conductances
(current-to-microwave-frequency ratio) to be quantized in a wide interval of
precession cone angles, which is robust with respect to weak disorder and can
be further extended by changes in device geometry.
