Suppose you can color $n$ \emph{biased} coins with $n$ colors, all coins
having the same bias. It is forbidden to color both sides of a coin with the
same color, but all other colors are allowed. Let $X$ be the number of
different colors after a toss of the coins. We present a method to obtain an
upper bound on a median of $X$. Our method is based on the analysis of the
probability distribution of the number of vertices with even in-degree in
graphs whose edges are given random orientations. Our analysis applies to the
distribution of the number of vertices with odd degree in random sub-graphs of
fixed graphs. It turns out that there are parity restrictions on the random
variables that are under consideration. Hence, in order to present our result,
we introduce a class of Bernoulli random variables whose total number of
successes is of fixed parity and are closely related to Poisson trials
conditional on the event that their outcomes have fixed parity.
