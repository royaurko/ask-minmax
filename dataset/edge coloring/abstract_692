We report on studies of Bose-Einstein correlations and color reconnection in
hadronic W pair production at LEP.
 Bose-Einstein correlations between identical particles from the decay of
different W's are studied by comparing the particle correlation in hadronic W
pair decays to those in events which are constructed from the combination of
the hadronic parts of two events where one of the Ws decays leptonicaly. The
LEP combined result of the strength of the effect is consistent with zero and
can be used to limit the systematic uncertainty due to Bose-Einstein
correlations on the W mass measurements.
 Color reconnection is expected to affect the production of particles in
hadronic decays of W pairs. Measurements of inclusive charged particle
multiplicities, and of their angular distribution with respect to the four jet
axes of the events, are used to test models of color reconnection.
 The results are both consistent with models without color reconnection and
models with moderate color reconnection. They can be used to exclude more
extreme models of color reconnection and thereby limit the uncertainty due to
color reconnection on the W mass measurement.
