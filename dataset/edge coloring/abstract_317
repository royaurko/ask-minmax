A new design and novel architecture suitable for FPGA/ASIC implementation of
a 2D Gaussian surround function for image processing application is presented
in this paper. The proposed scheme results in enormous savings of memory
normally required for 2D Gaussian function implementation. In the present work,
the Gaussian symmetric characteristics which quickly falls off toward
plus/minus infinity has been used in order to save the memory. The 2D Gaussian
function implementation is presented for use in applications such as image
enhancement, smoothing, edge detection and filtering etc. The FPGA
implementation of the proposed 2D Gaussian function is capable of processing
(blurring, smoothing, and convolution) high resolution color pictures of size
up to $1600\times1200$ pixels at the real time video rate of 30 frames/sec. The
Gaussian design exploited here has been used in the core part of retinex based
color image enhancement. Therefore, the design presented produces Gaussian
output with three different scales, namely, 16, 64 and 128. The design was
coded in Verilog, a popular hardware design language used in industries,
conforming to RTL coding guidelines and fits onto a single chip with a gate
count utilization of 89,213 gates. Experimental results presented confirms that
the proposed method offers a new approach for development of large sized
Gaussian pyramid while reducing the on-chip memory utilization.
