We have used the ROSAT All-Sky Survey to detect a known supercluster at
z=0.087 in the North Ecliptic Pole region. The X-ray data greatly improve our
understanding of this supercluster's characteristics, approximately doubling
our knowledge of the structure's spatial extent and tripling the cluster/group
membership compared to the optical discovery data. The supercluster is a rich
structure consisting of at least 21 galaxy clusters and groups, 12 AGN, 61 IRAS
galaxies, and various other objects. A majority of these components were
discovered with the X-ray data, but the supercluster is also robustly detected
in optical, IR, and UV wavebands. Extending 129 x 102 x 67 (1/h50 Mpc)^3, the
North Ecliptic Pole Supercluster has a flattened shape oriented nearly edge-on
to our line-of-sight. Owing to the softness of the ROSAT X-ray passband and the
deep exposure over a large solid angle, we have detected for the first time a
significant population of X-ray emitting galaxy groups in a supercluster. These
results demonstrate the effectiveness of X-ray observations with contiguous
coverage for studying structure in the Universe.
