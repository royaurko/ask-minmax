We have calculated the structures and the emergent spectra of stationary,
geometrically thin accretion disks around 100 and 1000 M_sun black holes in
both the Schwarzschild and extreme Kerr metrics. Equations of radiative
transfer, hydrostatic equilibrium, energy balance, ionization equilibrium, and
statistical equilibrium are solved simultaneously and consistently. The six
most astrophysically abundant elements (H, He, C, N, O, and Fe) are included,
as well as energy transfer by Comptonization. The observed spectrum as a
function of viewing angle is computed incorporating all general relativistic
effects. We find that, in contrast with the predictions of the commonly-used
multi-color disk (MCD) model, opacity associated with photoionization of heavy
elements can significantly alter the spectrum near its peak. These ionization
edges can create spectral breaks visible in the spectra of slowly-spinning
black holes viewed from almost all angles and in the spectra of
rapidly-spinning black holes seen approximately pole-on. For fixed mass and
accretion rate relative to Eddington, both the black hole spin and the viewing
angle can significantly shift the observed peak energy of the spectrum,
particularly for rapid spin viewed obliquely or edge-on. We present a detailed
test of the approximations made in various forms of the MCD model. Linear
limb-darkening is confirmed to be a reasonable approximation for the integrated
flux, but not for many specific frequencies of interest.
