The orbital evolution and stability of planetary systems with interaction
from the belts is studied using the standard phase-plane analysis. In addition
to the fixed point which corresponds to the Keplerian orbit, there are other
fixed points around the inner and outer edges of the belt. Our results show
that for the planets, the probability to move stably around the inner edge is
larger than the one to move around the outer edge. It is also interesting that
there is a limit cycle of semi-attractor for a particular case. Applying our
results to the Solar System, we find that our results could provide a natural
mechanism to do the orbit rearrangement for the larger Kuiper Belt Objects and
thus successfully explain the absence of these objects beyond 50 AU.
