We construct a family of explicit rotational solutions to the nonlinear
governing equations for water waves, describing edge waves propagating over a
plane-sloping beach. A detailed analysis of the edge wave dynamics and of the
run-up pattern is made possible by the use of the Lagrangian approach to the
water motion. A graphical representation of the edge wave is also presented.
