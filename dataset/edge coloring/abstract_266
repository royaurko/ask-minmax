We recall several known results about minimally 2-connected graphs, and show
that they all follow from a decomposition theorem. Starting from an analogy
with critically 2-connected graphs, we give structural characterizations of the
classes of graphs that do not contain as a subgraph and as an induced subgraph,
a cycle with a node that has at least two neighbors on the cycle. From these
characterizations we get polynomial time recognition algorithms for these
classes, as well as polynomial time algorithms for vertex-coloring and
edge-coloring.
