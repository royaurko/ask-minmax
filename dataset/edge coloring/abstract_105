This paper presents the performance of different blockbased discrete cosine
transform (DCT) algorithms for compressing color image. In this RGB component
of color image are converted to YCbCr before DCT transform is applied. Y is
luminance component;Cb and Cr are chrominance components of the image. The
modification of the image data is done based on the classification of image
blocks to edge blocks and non-edge blocks, then the edge block of the image is
compressed with low compression and the nonedge blocks is compressed with high
compression. The analysis results have indicated that the performance of the
suggested method is much better, where the constructed images are less
distorted and compressed with higher factor.
