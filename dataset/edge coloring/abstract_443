In the framework of constituent quark model, the effect of hidden color
channels on the nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) interaction is studied. By adjusting the
color confinement strength between the hidden color channels and color singlet
channels and/or between the hidden color channels and hidden color channels,
the experimental data of $S$ to $I$ partial-wave phase shifts of $NN$
scattering can be fitted well. The results show that the hidden color channel
coupling might be important in producing the intermediate-range attraction of
$NN$ interaction. The deuteron properties and dibaryon candidates have also
been studied with this model.
