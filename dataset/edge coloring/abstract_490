A fall k-coloring of a graph G is a proper k-coloring of G such that each
vertex of G sees all k colors on its closed neighborhood. In this note, we
characterize all fall colorings of Kneser graphs of type KG(n,2) for n\geq2 and
study some fall colorings of KG(n,m) in some special cases and introduce some
bounds for fall colorings of Kneser graphs.
