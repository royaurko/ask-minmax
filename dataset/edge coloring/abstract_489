Let G be an n-vertex graph with list-chromatic number $\chi_\ell$. Suppose
each vertex of G is assigned a list of t colors. Albertson, Grossman, and Haas
conjecture that at least $t n / {\chi_\ell}$ vertices can be colored from these
lists. We prove a lower bound for the number of colorable vertices. As a
corollary, we show that at least 6/7 of the conjectured number can be colored.
