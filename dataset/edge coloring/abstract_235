For graphs $F$ and $G$, let $F\to (G,G)$ signify that any red/blue edge
coloring of $F$ contains a monochromatic $G$. Define Folkman number $f(G;p)$ to
be the smallest order of a graph $F$ such that $F\to (G,G)$ and $\omega(F) \le
p$. It is shown that $f(G;p)\le cn$ for graphs $G$ of order $n$ with
$\Delta(G)\le \Delta$, where $\Delta\ge 3$, $c=c(\Delta)$ and $p=p(\Delta)$ are
positive constants.
