We present near-infrared observations of the low-mass deeply-embedded Class
0/I system 2MASS J17112318-2724315 (2M171123) in the B59 molecular cloud.
Bright scattered light nebulosity is observed towards this source in the Ks
images, that seems to trace the edges of an outflow cavity. We report the
detection of a low-luminosity protostar 2M17112255-27243448 (2M17112255) that
lies 8" (~1000 AU) from 2M171123. This is a Class I system, as indicated by its
2-8 micron slope and IRAC colors, with an estimated internal luminosity of
~0.3Lsun. We estimate a mass of ~0.12-0.25 Msun for this source, at an age of
0.1-1Myr. Also presented is detailed modeling of the 2M171123 system. The
best-fit parameters indicate a large envelope density of the order of ~10^(-13)
g cm^(-3), and an intermediate inclination between 53 and 59deg. The observed
Ks-band variability for this system could be explained by slight variability in
the mass infall rate between 2.5E-5 and 1.8E-5 Msun/yr. The protostar 2M171123
exhibits a rarely observed absorption feature near 11.3 micron within its 10
micron silicate band. We find a strong correlation between the strength in this
11.3 micron 'edge' and the H2O-ice column density, indicating the origin of
this feature in the thickness of the ice mantle over the silicate grains.
