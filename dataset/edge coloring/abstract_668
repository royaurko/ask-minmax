Constant electric charge $e$ satisfies the continuity equation $\partial_\mu
j^{\mu}(x)= 0$ where $j^\mu(x)$ is the current density of the electron.
However, the Yang-Mills color current density $j^{\mu a}(x)$ of the quark
satisfies the equation $D_\mu[A] j^{\mu a}(x)= 0$ which is not a continuity
equation ($\partial_\mu j^{\mu a}(x)\neq 0$) which implies that a color charge
$q^a(t)$ of the quark is not constant but it is time dependent where
$a=1,2,...8$ are color indices. In this paper we derive general form of color
potential produced by color charges of the quark. We find that the general form
of the color potential produced by the color charges of the quark at rest is
given by $\Phi^a(x) =A_0^a(t,{\bf x}) =\frac{q^b(t-\frac{r}{c})}{r}\[\frac{{\rm
exp}[g\int dr \frac{Q(t-\frac{r}{c})}{r}] -1}{g \int dr
\frac{Q(t-\frac{r}{c})}{r}}\]_{ab}$ where $dr$ integration is an indefinite
integration, ~~ $Q_{ab}(\tau_0)=f^{abd}q^d(\tau_0)$, ~~$r=|{\vec x}-{\vec
X}(\tau_0)|$, ~~$\tau_0=t-\frac{r}{c}$ is the retarded time, ~~$c$ is the speed
of light, ~~${\vec X}(\tau_0)$ is the position of the quark at the retarded
time and the repeated color indices $b,d$(=1,2,...8) are summed. For constant
color charge $q^a$ we reproduce the Coulomb-like potential
$\Phi^a(x)=\frac{q^a}{r}$ which is consistent with the Maxwell theory where
constant electric charge $e$ produces the Coulomb potential
$\Phi(x)=\frac{e}{r}$.
