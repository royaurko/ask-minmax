It is known that zigzag graphene edge is able to support edge states: there
is a non-dispersive single-electron band localized near the zigzag edge.
However, it is generally believed that no edge states exist near the armchair
edge. In this paper we re-examine this notion. It is demonstrated that while,
indeed, the pristine armchair edge does not support any localized states, they
do appear if the edge is subjected to suitable modifications (e.g. chemical
functionalization). We explicitly present two types of the edge modification
which support the localized states. Unlike zigzag edge states, which have zero
energy and show no dispersion, properties of the armchair localized states
depend sensitively on the type of edge modification. Under suitable conditions
they demonstrate pronounced dispersion. While the zigzag edge state
wavefunction decays monotonously when we move away from the edge, the armchair
edge state wavefunction shows non-monotonous decay. Such states may be observed
in scanning tunneling spectroscopy experimentally.
