Multifractal analysis techniques are applied to patterns in several abstract
expressionist artworks, paintined by various artists. The analysis is carried
out on two distinct types of structures: the physical patterns formed by a
specific color (``blobs''), as well as patterns formed by the luminance
gradient between adjacent colors (``edges''). It is found that the analysis
method applied to ``blobs'' cannot distinguish between artists of the same
movement, yielding a multifractal spectrum of dimensions between about 1.5-1.8.
The method can distinguish between different types of images, however, as
demonstrated by studying a radically different type of art. The data suggests
that the ``edge'' method can distinguish between artists in the same movement,
and is proposed to represent a toy model of visual discrimination. A ``fractal
reconstruction'' analysis technique is also applied to the images, in order to
determine whether or not a specific signature can be extracted which might
serve as a type of fingerprint for the movement. However, these results are
vague and no direct conclusions may be drawn.
