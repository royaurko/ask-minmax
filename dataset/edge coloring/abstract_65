A decomposition of a simple graph $G$ is a pair $(G,D)$ where $D$ is a set of
subgraphs of $G$, which partitions the edges of $G$ in the sense that every
edge of $G$ belongs to exactly one subgraph in $D$. If the elements of $D$ are
induced subgraphs then the decomposition is denoted by $[G,D]$.
  A $k$-$D$-coloring of a decomposition $(G,D)$ is a surjective function that
assigns to the edges of $G$ a color from a $k$-set of colors, such that all
edges of $H\in D$ have the same color, and if $H_1,H_2\in D$ with $V(H_1)\cap
V(H_2)\neq\emptyset$, then $E(H_1)$ and $E(H_2)$ have different colors. The
chromatic index $\chi'((G,D))$ of a decomposition $(G,D)$ is the smallest
number $k$ for which there exists a $k$-$D$-coloring of $(G,D)$.
  The well-known Erdos-Faber-Lov\'asz Conjecture states that any decomposition
$[K_n,D]$ satisfies $\chi'([K_n,D])\leq n$. We use commutative quasigroups to
give a new family of decompositions that satisfy the conjecture.
