We study the properties of surface solitons generated at the edge of a
semi-infinite photonic lattice in nonlinear quadratic media, namely two-color
surface lattice solitons. We analyze the impact of phase mismatch on existence
and stability of surface modes, and find novel classes of two-color twisted
surface solitons which are stable in a large domain of their existence.
