Suppose that red and blue points occur in $\mathbb{R}^d$ according to two
simple point process with finite intensities $\lambda_{\mathcal{R}}$ and
$\lambda_{\mathcal{B}}$, respectively. Furthermore, let $\nu$ and $\mu$ be two
probability distributions on the strictly positive integers. Assign
independently a random number of stubs (half-edges) to each red and blue point
with laws $\nu$ and $\mu$, respectively. We are interested in
translation-invariant schemes to match stubs between points of different colors
in order to obtain random bipartite graphs in which each point has a prescribed
degree distribution with law $\nu$ or $\mu$ depending on its color. Let $X$ and
$Y$ be random variables with law $\nu$ and $\mu$, respectively. For a large
class of point processes we show that we can obtain such translation-invariant
schemes matching a.s. all stubs if and only if \[ \lambda_{\mathcal{R}}
\mathbb{E}(X)= \lambda_{\mathcal{B}} \mathbb{E}(Y), \] allowing $\infty$ in
both sides, when both laws have infinite mean. Furthermore, we study a
particular scheme based on the Gale-Shapley stable marriage. For this scheme we
give sufficient conditions on $X$ and $Y$ for the presence and absence of
infinite components. These results are two-color versions of those obtained by
Deijfen, H\"aggstr\"om and Holroyd.
