Let $G$ be an edge-colored graph. The color degree of a vertex $v$ of $G$, is
defined as the number of colors of the edges incident to $v$. The color number
of $G$ is defined as the number of colors of the edges in $G$. A rainbow
triangle is one in which every pair of edges have distinct colors. In this
paper we give some sufficient conditions for the existence of rainbow triangles
in edge-colored graphs in terms of color degree, color number and edge number.
As a corollary, a conjecture proposed by Li and Wang (Color degree and
heterochromatic cycles in edge-colored graphs, European J. Combin. 33 (2012)
1958--1964) is confirmed.
