We develop a method to predict the existence of edge states in graphene
ribbons for a large class of boundaries. This approach is based on the
bulk-edge correspondence between the quantized value of the Zak phase Z(k),
which is a Berry phase across an appropriately chosen one-dimensional Brillouin
zone, and the existence of a localized state of momentum k at the boundary of
the ribbon. This bulk-edge correspondence is rigorously demonstrated for a one
dimensional toy model as well as for graphene ribbons with zigzag edges. The
range of k for which edge states exist in a graphene ribbon is then calculated
for arbitrary orientations of the edges. Finally, we show that the introduction
of an anisotropy leads to a topological transition in terms of the Zak phase,
which modifies the localization properties at the edges. Our approach gives a
new geometrical understanding of edge states, it con?firms and generalizes the
results of several previous works.
