The reconstruction conjecture has remained open for simple undirected graphs
since it was suggested in 1941 by Kelly and Ulam. In an attempt to prove the
conjecture, many graph invariants have been shown to be reconstructible from
the vertex-deleted deck, and in particular, some prominent graph polynomials.
Among these are the Tutte polynomial, the chromatic polynomial and the
characteristic polynomial. We show that the interlace polynomial, the U
-polynomial, the universal edge elimination polynomial xi and the colored
versions of the latter two are reconstructible.
