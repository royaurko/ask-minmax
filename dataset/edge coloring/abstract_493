We generalize the results of Leger and Luks about generalized derivations of
Lie algebras to the case of color $n$-ary $\Omega$-algebras. Particularly, we
prove some properties of generalized derivations of color $n$-ary algebras;
prove that a quasiderivation algebra of a color $n$-ary $\Omega$-algebra can be
embedded into the derivation algebra of a larger color $n$-ary
$\Omega$-algebra, and describe (anti)commutative $n$-ary algebras satisfying
the condition $QDer = End.$
