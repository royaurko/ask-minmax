An atlas of gas temperature maps is presented for a flux limited catalog of
galaxy clusters. The sample of clusters is based on the Edge et al. (1990)
sample, with the inclusion of five additional clusters, all with fluxes
f_X(2-10 keV)>= 1.7x10**-11 ergs sec**-1 cm**-2, drawn from a variety of other
sources. The temperature maps are derived from ASCA GIS observations using a
common methodology to correct for the Point-Spread Function and calculate the
local projected gas temperature in such a way so as to make each cluster
directly comparable to all others in the sample. Variations in the temperature
distribution, when present at > 90% confidence, are characterized by their
severity and extent. We find that 70% of the clusters in our sample have
significant variations in the projected gas temperature. The presence of these
variations increases with increasing luminosity, as does the spatial scope and
severity within a cluster. For a more limited sample we find that one third of
clusters with temperature structure have radio halos. The high rate of
occurance of structure emphasizes the need for caution when using clusters to
measure cosmological parameters.
