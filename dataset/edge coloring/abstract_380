Homunculus Nebula is surrounding the star system Eta Carinae. The nebula is
embedded within a much larger ionized hydrogen region, which is the Carina
Nebula. Homunculus is believed to have been ejected in a huge outburst from Eta
Carinae in 1841, so brightly to be visible from Earth. This massive explosion
produced two polar lobes and an equatorial disc, moving outwards. Though Eta
Carinae is quite away, approximately 7,500 light-years, it is possible to
distinguish in the nebula, many structures with the size of about the diameter
of our solar system. Knots, dust lanes and radial streaks appear quite clearly
in many images. In this paper, we compare the imaging of Homunculus Nebula has
obtained by HST and Gemini South Telescope research teams. We use some
processing methods, to enhance some features of the structure, such as the
color gradient, and knots and filaments in the central part of the nebula.
