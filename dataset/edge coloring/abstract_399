Due to the extensive use of information technology and the recent
developments in multimedia systems, the amount of multimedia data available to
users has increased exponentially. Video is an example of multimedia data as it
contains several kinds of data such as text, image, meta-data, visual and
audio. Content based video retrieval is an approach for facilitating the
searching and browsing of large multimedia collections over WWW. In order to
create an effective video retrieval system, visual perception must be taken
into account. We conjectured that a technique which employs multiple features
for indexing and retrieval would be more effective in the discrimination and
search tasks of videos. In order to validate this, content based indexing and
retrieval systems were implemented using color histogram, Texture feature
(GLCM), edge density and motion..
