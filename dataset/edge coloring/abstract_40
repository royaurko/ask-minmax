Let G = (V, E) be a multigraph without loops and for any x {\in}V let E(x) be
the set of edges of G incident to x. A homogeneous edge-coloring of G is an
assignment of an integer m >= 2 and a coloring c:E {\to} S of the edges of
Gsuchthat|S| = mandforanyx{\in}V,if|E(x)| = mqx+rx with0 <= rx <m, there exists
a partition of E(x) in rx color classes of cardinality qx + 1 and other m-rx
color classes of cardinality qx. The homogeneous chromatic index \c{hi}(G) is
the least m for which there exists such a coloring. We determine \c{hi}(G) in
the case that G is a complete multigraph, a tree or a complete bipartite
multigraph.
