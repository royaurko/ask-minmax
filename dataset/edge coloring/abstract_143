We consider the class A of graphs that contain no odd hole, no antihole, and
no ``prism'' (a graph consisting of two disjoint triangles with three disjoint
paths between them). We show that the coloring algorithm found by the second
and fourth contributor can be implemented in time O(n^2m) for any graph in A with n
vertices and m edges, thereby improving on the complexity proposed in the
original paper.
