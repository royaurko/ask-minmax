This paper discusses reformulations of the problem of coloring plane maps
with four colors. The context is the edge-coloring with three colors of cubic
graphs such that three distinct colors occur at each vertex. We include
discussion of the Eliahou-Kryuchkov conjecture, the Penrose formula, the vector
cross product formulation and the reformulations in terms of formations and
factorizations due to G. Spencer-Brown. The latter includes a proof of the
Spencer-Brown parity lemma and discussion of the parity-pass algorithm.
