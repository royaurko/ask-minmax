In this work, a theory of color symmetry is presented that extends the ideas
of traditional theories of color symmetry for periodic crystals to apply to
non-periodic crystals. The color symmetries are associated to each of the
crystalline sites and may correspond to different chemical species, various
orientations of magnetic moments and colorings of a non-periodic tiling. In
particular, we study the color symmetries of periodic and non-periodic
structures via Bravais colorings of planar modules that emerge as the ring of
integers in cyclotomic fields with class number one. Using an approach
involving matrices, we arrive at necessary and sufficient conditions for
determining the color symmetry groups and color fixing groups of the Bravais
colorings associated with the modules M_n = Z[exp(2{\pi}i/n)], and list the
findings for M_{15} = Z[exp(2{\pi}i/15)] and M_{16} = Z[exp({\pi}i/8)]. In the
second part of the paper, we discuss magnetic point groups of crystal and
quasicrystal structures and give some examples of structures whose magnetic
point group symmetries are described by Bravais colorings of planar modules.
