From observations of edge-on, late-type galaxies, we present morphological
evidence that some nuclear star clusters have experienced in situ star
formation. We find three nuclear clusters that, viewed from the edge-on
perspective, have both a compact disk-like component and a spheroidal
component. In each cluster, the disk components are closely aligned with the
major axis of the host galaxy and have bluer colors than the spheroidal
components. We spectroscopically verify that one of the observed multiple
component clusters has multiple generations of stars. These observations lead
us to suggest a formation mechanism for nuclear star clusters, in which stars
episodically form in compact nuclear disks, and then lose angular momentum,
eventually forming an older spheroid.
