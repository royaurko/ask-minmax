Nodal superconductors without inversion symmetry exhibit nontrivial
topological properties, manifested by topologically protected flat-band edge
states. Here we study the effects of breaking translational symmetry, crucial
to the definition of the topological invariant. We show using large-scale
numerical simulations that bulk-edge correspondence remains valid in the
presence of edge roughness and strong edge disorder. Moderately strong
nonmagnetic disorder shifts some of the edge states away from zero energy, but
does not change their total number. Strong spin-independent edge disorder, on
the other hand, leads to the appearance of new weakly disordered midgap states
in the layers adjacent to the disordered edge, i.e., at the interface between
the bulk topological superconductor and the one-dimensional Anderson insulator
formed by the strongly disordered edge layers. Furthermore, we show that
magnetic impurities, which lift the time-reversal symmetry protection of the
flat-band states, lead to a rapid decrease of the number of edge states with
increasing disorder strength.
