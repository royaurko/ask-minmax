We study two-color surface solitons in two-dimensional photonic lattices with
quadratic nonlinear response. We demonstrate that such parametrically coupled
optical localized modes can exist in the corners or at the edges of a square
photonic lattice, and we analyze the impact of the phase mismatch on their
properties, stability, and the threshold power for their generation.
