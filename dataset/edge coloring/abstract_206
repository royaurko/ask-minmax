We identify the RR Lyrae and delta Scuti (DSCT) stars in three catalogs of
GALEX variable sources. The NUV amplitude of RR Lyrae stars is about twice that
in V-band, so we find a larger percentage of low amplitude variables than
catalogs such as Abbas et al (2014). Interestingly, the (NUV-V)_0 color is
sensitive to metallicity and can be used to distinguish between variables of
the same period but differing [Fe/H]. This color is also more sensitive to
T_eff than optical colors and can be used to identify the red edge of the
instability gap. We find 8 DSCT stars, 17 RRc stars, 1 RRd star and 84 RRab
stars in the GALEX variable catalogs of Welsh et al (2005) and Wheatley et al
(2008). We also classify 6 DSCT stars, 5 RRc stars and 18 RRab stars among the
55 variable GALEX sources identified as "stars" or RR Lyraes in the catalog of
Gezari et al (2013). We provide ephemerides and light curves for the 26
variables that were not previously known.
