A vertex coloring of a simplicial complex $\Delta$ is called a linear
coloring if it satisfies the property that for every pair of facets $(F_1,
F_2)$ of $\Delta$, there exists no pair of vertices $(v_1, v_2)$ with the same
color such that $v_1\in F_1\backslash F_2$ and $v_2\in F_2\backslash F_1$. We
show that every simplicial complex $\Delta$ which is linearly colored with $k$
colors includes a subcomplex $\Delta'$ with $k$ vertices such that $\Delta'$ is
a strong deformation retract of $\Delta$. We also prove that this deformation
is a nonevasive reduction, in particular, a collapsing.
