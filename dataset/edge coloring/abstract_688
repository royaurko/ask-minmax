We show that for the hard edge ensemble with power potential, the limiting
law of the spectral radius with a proper rescaling follows an exponential
distribution and prove this edge universality for radially symmetric
subharmonic potentials. We also obtain the order statistics of the moduli of
eigenvalues.
