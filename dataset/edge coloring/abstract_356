We estimate the distribution of apparent axis ratios $q$ for galaxies in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Early Data Release. We divide the galaxies by
profile type (de Vaucouleurs versus exponential) as well as by color ($u^* -
r^* \leq 2.22$ versus $u^* - r^* > 2.22$). The axis ratios found by fitting
models to the surface photometry are generally smaller than those found by
taking the second moments of the surface brightness distribution. Using the
axis ratios found from fitting models, we find that galaxies with de
Vaucouleurs profiles have axis ratio distributions which are inconsistent, at
the 99% confidence level, with their being a population of randomly oriented
oblate spheroids. Red de Vaucouleurs galaxies are slightly rounder, on average,
than blue de Vaucouleurs galaxies. By contrast, blue galaxies with exponential
profiles appear very much flatter, on average, than red galaxies with
exponential profiles. The red exponential galaxies are primarily disk galaxies
seen nearly edge-on, with reddening due to the presence of dust, rather than to
an intrinsically red stellar population.
