We consider circular version of the famous Nelson-Hadwiger problem. It is
know that 4 colors are necessary and 7 colors suffice to color the euclidean
plane in such a way that points at distance one get different colors. In
$r$-circular coloring we assign arcs of length one of a circle with a perimeter
$r$ in such a way that points at distance one get disjoint arcs. In this paper
we show the existence of $r$-circular coloring for
$r=4+\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}\approx 6.30$. It is the first result with $r$-circular
coloring of the plane with $r$ smaller than 7. We also show $r$-circular
coloring of the plane with $r<7$ in the case when we require disjoint arcs for
points at distance belonging to the internal $[\frac{10}{11}, \frac{12}{11}]$.
