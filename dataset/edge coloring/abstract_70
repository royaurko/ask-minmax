An edge-colored graph $G$ is rainbow connected if any two vertices are
connected by a path whose edges have distinct colors. The rainbow connection
number of a connected graph $G$, denoted $rc(G)$, is the smallest number of
colors that are needed in order to make $G$ rainbow connected. We prove if $G$
is a connected strongly $r$-regular graph and $r\geq 600$, then $rc(G)\leq3$.
Specially, there is a constant $c$ such that $rc(G)\leq c$ for any connected
strongly regular graph $G$.
