We have observed in the mid-infrared (4-18 micron) the counterpart of the
compact object GRS 1915+105, and the western jet of SS433. The images were
carried out with the ISOCAM infrared camera on board of the Infrared Space
Observatory (ISO). The mid-infrared photometry of GRS 1915+105 shows the
presence of an additional contribution besides the synchrotron emission. The 15
micron images of the large-scale western lobe of the SS433/W50 nebula are
compared to the radio and X-ray ones. They show infrared synchrotron emission
on the western edge of SS433/W50 lobe.
