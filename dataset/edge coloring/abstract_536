The transmission amplitude of a color dipole through a random external color
field is computed in the eikonal approximation in order to study the absorption
of high energy quarkonium by nuclear target. It is shown that the internal
color state of the dipole becomes randomized and all possible color states are
eventually equi-partitioned, while the probability of finding a color singlet
bound state attenuates not exponentially, but inversely proportional to the
distance L of the random field zone which the dipole has traveled.
