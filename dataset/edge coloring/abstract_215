The text detection and localization plays a major role in video analysis and
understanding. The scene text embedded in video consist of high-level semantics
and hence contributes significantly to visual content analysis and retrieval.
This paper proposes a novel method to robustly localize the texts in natural
scene images and videos based on sobel edge emphasizing approach. The input
image is preprocessed and edge emphasis is done to detect the text clusters.
Further, a set of rules have been devised using morphological operators for
false positive elimination and connected component analysis is performed to
detect the text regions and hence text localization is performed. The
experimental results obtained on publicly available standard datasets
illustrate that the proposed method can detect and localize the texts of
various sizes, fonts and colors.
