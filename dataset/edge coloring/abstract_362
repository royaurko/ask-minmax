We present the near-infrared and optical properties of the peculiar galaxy
ESO 235-G58, which resembles a late-type ringed barred spiral seen close to
face-on. However, the apparent bar of ESO 235-G58 is in reality an edge-on disk
galaxy of relatively low luminosity. We have analyzed the light and color
distributions of ESO 235-G58 in the NIR and optical bands and compared them
with the typical properties observed for other morphological galaxy types,
including polar ring galaxies. Similar properties are observed for ESO 235-G58,
polar ring galaxies, and spiral galaxies, which leads us to conclude that this
peculiar system is a polar-ring-related galaxy, characterized by a low inclined
ring/disk structure, as pointed out by Buta & Crocker in an earlier study,
rather than a barred galaxy.
