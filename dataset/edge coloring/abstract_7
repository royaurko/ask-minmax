A proper edge $t$-coloring of a graph is a coloring of its edges with colors
$1,2,...,t$ such that all colors are used, and no two adjacent edges receive
the same color. For any integer $n\geq 3$, all possible values of $t$ are
found, for which there exists such a proper edge $t$-coloring of the simple
cycle C(n), which uses for each pair of adjacent edges either consecutive
colors or the first and the last ones.
