A path in an edge-colored graph $G$, where adjacent edges may be colored the
same, is called a rainbow path if no two edges of it are colored the same. A
nontrivial connected graph $G$ is rainbow connected if for any two vertices of
$G$ there is a rainbow path connecting them. The rainbow connection number of
$G$, denoted by $rc(G)$, is defined as the smallest number of colors by using
which there is a coloring such that $G$ is rainbow connected. In this paper, we
mainly study the rainbow connection number of the line graph of a graph which
contains triangles and get two sharp upper bounds for $rc(L(G))$, in terms of
the number of edge-disjoint triangles of $G$ where $L(G)$ is the line graph of
$G$. We also give results on the iterated line graphs.
