We study contributions from color-octet quarkonium formation mechanisms to
$p_\perp$-integrated $\psi'$ production cross sections in pion-nucleon
reactions. The observed polarization of the $\psi'$ is not reproduced by the
lowest-order leading-twist color-singlet and color-octet mechanisms. This
suggests that there are important quarkonium production mechanisms beyond
leading twist.
