Motivated by the problem of Gallai on $(1-1)$-transversals of $2$-intervals,
it was proved by the contributors in 1969 that if the edges of a complete graph $K$
are colored with red and blue (both colors can appear on an edge) so that there
is no monochromatic induced $C_4$ and $C_5$ then the vertices of $K$ can be
partitioned into a red and a blue clique. Aharoni, Berger, Chudnovsky and Ziani
recently strengthened this by showing that it is enough to assume that there is
no induced monochromatic $C_4$ and there is no induced $C_5$ in {\em one of the
colors}. Here this is strengthened further, it is enough to assume that there
is no monochromatic induced $C_4$ and there is no $K_5$ on which both color
classes induce a $C_5$.
  We also answer a question of Kaiser and Rabinovich, giving an example of six
$2$-convex sets in the plane such that any three intersect but there is no
$(1-1)$-transversal for them.
