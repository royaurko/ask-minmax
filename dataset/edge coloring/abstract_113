In this paper I study a variant of the general vertex coloring problem called
precoloring. Specifically, I study graph precolorings, by developing new
theory, for characterizing the minimal non-extensible precolorings. It is
interesting per se that, for graphs of arbitrarily large chromatic number, the
minimal number of colored vertices, in a non-extensible precoloring, remains
constant; only two vertices $u,v$ suffice. Here, the relation between such
$u,v$ is called an implicit-relation, distinguishing two cases: (i)
implicit-edges where $u,v$ are precolored with the same color and (ii)
implicit-identities where $u,v$ are precolored distinct.
