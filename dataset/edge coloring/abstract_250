Using Monte Carlo radiative transfer techniques, we model the dust content of
the edge-on low surface brightness (LSB) galaxy UGC 7321 and explore the
effects of dust on its disk color gradients. Dust alone cannot explain the
large radial disk color gradients observed in this galaxy and we find that a
significant fraction (~50%) of the dust in UGC 7321 appears to be contained in
a clumped medium, indicating that at least some LSB galaxies can support a
modest multi-phase ISM structure. In addition, we report some of the first
direct detections of molecular gas (CO) in LSB galaxies.
