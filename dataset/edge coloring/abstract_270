The friction between concentric carbon nanotubes sliding one inside the other
has been widely studied and simulated, but not so far using external force as
the driving variable. Our molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that as the
pulling force grows, the sliding velocity increases by jumps and plateaus
rather than continuously as expected. Dramatic friction peaks (similar to that
recently noted by Tangney {\it et al.} in Phys. Rev. Lett. 97 (2006) 195901)
which develop around some preferential sliding velocities, are at the origin of
this phenomenon. The (stable) rising edge of the peak produces a velocity
plateau; the (unstable) dropping edge produces a jump to the nearest stable
branch. The outcome is reminiscent of conduction in ionized gases, the plateau
correspon ding to a current stabilization against voltage variations, the jump
corresponding to a discharge or breakdown.
