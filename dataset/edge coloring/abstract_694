In this paper we have investigated some old issues concerning four color map
problem. We have given a general method for constructing counter-examples to
Kempe's proof of the four color theorem and then show that all counterexamples
can be rule out by re-constructing special 2-colored two paths decomposition in
the form of a double-spiral chain of the maximal planar graph. In the second
part of the paper we have given an algorithmic proof of the four color theorem
which is based only on the coloring faces (regions) of a cubic planar maps. Our
algorithmic proof has been given in three steps. The first two steps are the
maximal mono-chromatic and then maximal dichromatic coloring of the faces in
such a way that the resulting uncolored (white) regions of the incomplete
two-colored map induce no odd-cycles so that in the (final) third step four
coloring of the map has been obtained almost trivially.
