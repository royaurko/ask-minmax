The quark production in classical color fields is investigated with a focus
on the induction of an electromagnetic current by produced quarks. We show that
the SU(2) and the SU(3) theories lead significantly different results for the
electromagnetic current. In uniform SU(2) color fields, the net electromagnetic
current is not generated, while for SU(3) the net current is induced depending
on the color direction of background fields. Also the numerical study of the
quark production in inhomogeneous color fields is done. Motivated by gauge
field configurations provided by the color glass condensate framework, we
introduce an ensemble of randomly distributed color electric fluxtubes. The
spectrum of photons emitted from the quarks by a classical process is shown.
