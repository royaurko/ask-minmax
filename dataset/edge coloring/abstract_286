We report the cumulative results of five surveys for water maser emission at
1.35 cm wavelength in 131 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and star-forming
galaxies, conducted at the Parkes Observatory between 1993 and 1998. We
detected one new maser, in the edge-on galaxy IRASF01063-8034, which exhibits a
single, about 0.1 Jy spectral feature at 4282+/-6 km/s (heliocentric) with an
unusually large 54+/-16 km/s half-power full width. The centroid velocity of
the emission increased to 4319.6+/-0.6 km/s (38+/-2 km/s width) over the 13
days between discovery and confirmation of the detection. A similarly broad
linewidth and large change in velocity has been noted for the maser in NGC1052,
wherein jet activity excites the emission. Neither optical spectroscopy,
radio-infrared correlations, nor infrared colors provide compelling evidence of
unusual activity in the nucleus of IRASF01063-8034. Since the galaxy appears to
be outwardly normal at optical and infrared wavelengths, detection of a water
maser therein is unique. The maser emission is evidence that the galaxy harbors
an AGN that is probably obscured by the edge-on galactic disk. The detection
highlights the possibility that undetected AGNs could be hidden in other
relatively nearby galaxies. No other maser emission features have been
identified at velocities between 3084 km/s and 6181 km/s.
