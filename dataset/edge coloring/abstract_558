The mean-field Hubbard model is used to investigate the formation of the
antiferromagnetic phase in hexagonal graphene rings with inner zigzag edges.
The outer edge of the ring was taken to be either zigzag or armchair, and we
found that both types of structures can have a larger antiferromagnetic
interaction as compared with hexagonal dots. This difference could be partially
ascribed to the larger number of zigzag edges per unit area in rings than in
dots. Furthermore, edge states localized on the inner ring edge are found to
hybridize differently than the edge states of dots, which results in important
differences in the magnetism of graphene rings and dots. The largest staggered
magnetization is found when the outer edge has a zigzag shape. However, narrow
rings with armchair outer edge are found to have larger staggered magnetization
than zigzag hexagons. The edge defects are shown to have the least effect on
magnetization when the outer ring edge is armchair shaped.
