The 600 cell S has exactly 10 5-colorings. From these colorings we can
construct the space of colorings $B(S)$. This complex has 1344 colorings, and
is isomorphic to the space of 5 by 5 Latin Squares. These simplices split into
4 copies of a quotient of S by an involution, and two copies of a space made up
of even Latin Squares.
