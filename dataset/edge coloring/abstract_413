The honeycomb lattice in the cylinder geometry with zigzag edges, bearded
edges, zigzag and bearded edges (zigzag-bearded), and armchair edges are
studied. The tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor hoppings is used. Edge
states are obtained analytically for these edges except the armchair edges. It
is shown, however, that edge states for the armchair edges exist when the the
system is anisotropic. These states have not been known previously. We also
find strictly localized states, uniformly extended states and states with
macroscopic degeneracy.
