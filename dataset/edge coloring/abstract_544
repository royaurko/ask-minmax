We report the feasibility of artificial color perception under microwave
illumination using a standard microwave source and an antenna. We have sensed
transmitted microwave power through color objects and have distinguished the
colors by analyzing the sensed transmitted power. Experiments are carried out
using a Gunn diode as the microwave source, some colored liquids as the objects
and a microwave diode as the detector. Results are presented which open up an
unusual but new way of perceiving colors using microwaves.
