We study the edge states in graphene in the presence of a magnetic field
perpendicular to the plane of the lattice. Most of the works done so far
discuss the edge states in either zigzag or armchair edge graphene considering
an isotropic electron hopping. In practice, graphene can have mixture of
armchair and zigzag edges and the electron hopping can be anisotropic, which is
the subject of this article. We predict that the mixed edges smear the enhanced
local density of states (LDOS) at E=0 of the zigzag edge and, on the other
hand, the anisotropic hopping gives rise to the enhanced LDOS at E=0 in the
armchair edge. The behavior of the LDOS can be studied using scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) experiments. We suggest that care must be taken while
interpreting the STM data. It is because the clear distinction between the
zigzag edge (enhanced LDOS at E=0) and armchair edge (suppressed LDOS at E=0)
can be lost if the hopping is not isotropic and if the edges are mixed.
