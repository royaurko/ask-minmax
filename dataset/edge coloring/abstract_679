The edges of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have attracted much interest due to
their potentially strong influence on GNR electronic and magnetic properties.
Here we report the ability to engineer the microscopic edge termination of high
quality GNRs via hydrogen plasma etching. Using a combination of
high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and first-principles
calculations, we have determined the exact atomic structure of plasma-etched
GNR edges and established the chemical nature of terminating functional groups
for zigzag, armchair and chiral edge orientations. We find that the edges of
hydrogen-plasma-etched GNRs are generally flat, free of structural
reconstructions and are terminated by hydrogen atoms with no rehybridization of
the outermost carbon edge atoms. Both zigzag and chiral edges show the presence
of edge states.
