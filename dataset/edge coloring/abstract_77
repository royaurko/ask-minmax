The Quality of image fusion is an essential determinant of the value of
processing images fusion for many applications. Spatial and spectral qualities
are the two important indexes that used to evaluate the quality of any fused
image. However, the jury is still out of fused image's benefits if it compared
with its original images. In addition, there is a lack of measures for
assessing the objective quality of the spatial resolution for the fusion
methods. Therefore, an objective quality of the spatial resolution assessment
for fusion images is required. Most important details of the image are in edges
regions, but most standards of image estimation do not depend upon specifying
the edges in the image and measuring their edges. However, they depend upon the
general estimation or estimating the uniform region, so this study deals with
new method proposed to estimate the spatial resolution by Contrast Statistical
Analysis (CSA) depending upon calculating the contrast of the edge, non edge
regions and the rate for the edges regions. Specifying the edges in the image
is made by using Soble operator with different threshold values. In addition,
estimating the color distortion added by image fusion based on Histogram
Analysis of the edge brightness values of all RGB-color bands and Lcomponent.
