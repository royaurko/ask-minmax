We study graphs where each edge adjacent to a vertex of small degree (7 and
9, respectively) belongs to many triangles (4 and 5, respectively) and show
that these graphs contain a complete graph (K_6 and K_7, respectively) as a
minor. The second case settles a problem of Nevo (Nevo, 2007). Morevover if
each edge of a graph belongs to 6 triangles then the graph contains a K_8-minor
or contains K_{2,2,2,2,2} as an induced subgraph. We then show applications of
these structural properties to stress freeness and coloration of graphs. In
particular, motivated by Hadwiger's conjecture, we prove that every K_7-minor
free graph is 8-colorable and every K_8-minor free graph is 10-colorable.
