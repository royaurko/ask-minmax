We have successfully constructed a catalog of HI-rich galaxies selected from
the Minnesota Automated Plate Scanner Catalog of the Palomar Observatory Sky
Survey (POSS I) based solely on optical criteria. We identify HI-rich
candidates by selecting the bluest galaxies at a given apparent magnitude,
those galaxies on the "blue edge" of POSS I color-magnitude parameter space.
Subsequent 21-cm observations on the upgraded Arecibo 305m dish detected over
50% of the observed candidates. The detected galaxies are HI-rich with HI
masses comparable to "normal" high surface brightness disk galaxies and they
have gas mass-to-light ratios ranging from 0.1 to 4.8 (in solar units).
Comparison of our candidate galaxies with known low surface brightness galaxies
(hereafter LSBs) shows that they exhibit similar optical and HI properties to
that population. We also show that previously identified LSBs, including
several LSBs with red B-V colors, preferentially occupy the "blue edge" of POSS
I color-magnitude parameter space. Their presence on the "blue edge" appears to
be a selection effect due to differing plate limits in the two POSS I
bandpasses. This suggests the POSS I is a good filter for separating galaxies
on the higher surface brightness end of the LSB population from the general
population of galaxies in the night sky.
