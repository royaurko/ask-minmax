Structural coloration is an interference phenomenon where colors emerge when
visible light interacts with nanoscopically structured material, and has
recently become a most interesting scientific and engineering topic. However,
current structural color generation mechanisms either require thick (compared
to the wavelength) structures or lack dynamic tunability. This report proposes
a new structural color generation mechanism, that produces colors by the Fano
resonance effect on thin photonic crystal slab. We experimentally realize the
proposed idea by fabricating the samples that show resonance-induced colors
with weak dependence on the viewing angle. Finally, we show that the
resonance-induced colors can be dynamically tuned by stretching the photonic
crystal slab fabricated on an elastic substrate.
