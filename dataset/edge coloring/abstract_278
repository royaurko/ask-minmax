We study the class of graphs $\mathcal{G}^*$ for which every pair of distinct
odd cycles intersects in at most one edge. This class of graphs contains the
previously-studied class $\mathcal{G}(1)$ of graphs with no odd cycle of length
greater than $3$. We give a structural characterization of the graphs in
$\mathcal{G}^*$, analogous to the structural characterization of
$\mathcal{G}(1)$ given by Hsu, Ikura, and Nemhauser and by Maffray. We prove
that $\chi'_{l}(G) \leq \Delta(G)+1$ for $G \in \mathcal{G}^*$, thereby
extending a theorem of McDonald proving the same inequality for $G \in
\mathcal{G}(1)$.
