We propose color magnetism as a generalization of the ordinary Heisenberg
(anti-)ferro magnets on a triangular lattice. Vortex matter consisting of an
Abrikosov lattice of non-Abelian vortices with color magnetic fluxes shows a
color ferro or anti-ferro magnetism, depending on the interaction among the
vortex sites. A prime example is a non-Abelian vortex lattice in rotating dense
quark matter, showing a color ferromagnetism. We show that the low-energy
effective theory for the vortex lattice system in the color ferromagnetic phase
is described by a 3+1 dimensional $CP^{N-1}$ nonlinear sigma model with
spatially anisotropic couplings. We identify gapless excitations independent
from Tkachenko modes as color magnons, that is, Nambu-Goldstone modes
propagating in the vortex lattice with an anisotropic linear dispersion
relation $\omega_p^2 = c_{xy}^2(p_x^2+p_y^2) + c_z^2 p_z^2$. We calculate the
transition temperature between the ordered and disordered phases, and apply it
to dense quark matter. We also identify the order parameter spaces for color
anti-ferromagnets.
