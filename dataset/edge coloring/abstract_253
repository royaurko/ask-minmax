It has been proposed that the large cross sections for prompt $\psi$,
$\psi'$, and $\chi_c$ production at the Fermilab Tevatron $p\bar p$ collider
can be explained by a dominant color-octet term in the fragmentation function
for a gluon to split into quarkonium. We show that this mechanism makes
testable predictions for double-quarkonium $\psi\psi$, $\psi\psi'$,
$\psi\chi_c$, $\psi\Upsilon$ and $\psi\chi_b$ production, as well as for $W
\psi$ production, using color-octet matrix elements previously determined from
charmonium production data. The $\psi\psi$ signal would already be measurable
at the Tevatron, while the $\psi\chi_c$ and $W\psi$ signals would be on the
edge of present detectability.
