Gy{\'a}rf{\'a}s et al. and Zaker have proven that the Grundy number of a
graph $G$ satisfies $\Gamma(G)\ge t$ if and only if $G$ contains an induced
subgraph called a $t$-atom. The family of $t$-atoms has bounded order and
contains a finite number of graphs. In this article, we introduce equivalents
of $t$-atoms for b-coloring and partial Grundy coloring. This concept is used
to prove that determining if $\varphi(G)\ge t$ and $\partial\Gamma(G)\ge t$
(under conditions for the b-coloring), for a graph $G$, is in XP with parameter
$t$. We illustrate the utility of the concept of $t$-atoms by giving results on
b-critical vertices and edges, on b-perfect graphs and on graphs of girth at
least $7$.
