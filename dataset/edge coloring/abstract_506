A strict method to calculate the color rearrangement probability at partonic
level in hadronic $W^+W^-$ decays is proposed. The color effective Hamiltonian
$H_c$ is constructed from invariant amplitude for the process $e^+e^- \to
W^+W^- \to q_1\bar{q}_2 q_3\bar{q}_4+ng$ (n=0, 1, 2, ...) and is used to
calculate the cross sections of various color singlets and the color
rearrangement probability. The true meaning of the color rearrangement is
clarified and its difference from color interference is discussed.
