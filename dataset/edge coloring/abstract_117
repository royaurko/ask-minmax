If $G$ and $H$ are two cubic graphs, then we write $H\prec G$, if $G$ admits
a proper edge-coloring $f$ with edges of $H$, such that for each vertex $x$ of
$G$, there is a vertex $y$ of $H$ with $f(\partial_G(x))=\partial_H(y)$. Let
$P$ and $S$ be the Petersen graph and the Sylvester graph, respectively. In
this paper, we introduce the Sylvester coloring conjecture. Moreover, we show
that if $G$ is a connected bridgeless cubic graph with $G\prec P$, then $G=P$.
Finally, if $G$ is a connected cubic graph with $G\prec S$, then $G=S$.
