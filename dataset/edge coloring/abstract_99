We demonstrate that certain Johnson-type bounds are asymptotically exact for
a variety of classes of codes, namely, constant-composition codes, nonbinary
constant-weight codes and multiply constant-weight codes. This was achieved via
an interesting application of the theory of decomposition of edge-colored
digraphs.
