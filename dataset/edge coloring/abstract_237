We explore the vertical light distribution as a function of galactocentric
radius in the edge-on (i=88) Sd `superthin' galaxy UGC7321. UGC7321 is a
low-luminosity spiral (M_B,i=-17.0) with a diffuse, low surface brightness
stellar disk and no discernible bulge component. Within 0.25' (725 pc) of the
disk center the global luminosity profile of UGC7321 can be reasonably
characterized by an exponential function with a scale height h_z=2.9" (140 pc)
in H and h_z=3.1" (150 pc) in R, making this among the thinnest galaxy disks
know. Near the disk center we derive a ratio of disk scale length to global
disk scale height h_r/h_z=14 in both H and R; near the edge of the disk,
h_r/h_z=10. At intermediate galactocentric radii (0.25'<r<1.5'), the disk of
UGC7321 becomes less peaked than an exponential near the galactic plane. At
these radii the vertical luminosity profiles can be well reproduced by a linear
combination of two isothermal disk components of differing scale heights. These
fits, together with the strong disk color gradients by Matthews, Gallagher, &
van Driel (1999), suggest that UGC7321 has multiple disk subcomponents
comprised of stellar populations with different ages and velocity dispersions.
Thus even examples of the thinnest pure disk galaxies exhibit complex structure
and signatures of dynamical heating.
