Dipole and higher moments are physical quantities used to describe a charge
distribution. In analogy with electromagnetism, it is possible to define the
dipole moments for a gray-scale image, according to the single aspect of a
gray-tone map. In this paper we define the color dipole moments for color
images. For color maps in fact, we have three aspects, the three primary
colors, to consider. Associating three color charges to each pixel, color
dipole moments can be easily defined and used for edge detection.
