If each edge (u,v) of a graph G=(V,E) is decorated with a permutation
pi_{u,v} of k objects, we say that it has a permuted k-coloring if there is a
coloring sigma from V to {1,...,k} such that sigma(v) is different from
pi_{u,v}(sigma(u)) for all (u,v) in E. Based on arguments from statistical
physics, we conjecture that the threshold d_k for permuted k-colorability in
random graphs G(n,m=dn/2), where the permutations on the edges are uniformly
random, is equal to the threshold for standard graph k-colorability. The
additional symmetry provided by random permutations makes it easier to prove
bounds on d_k. By applying the second moment method with these additional
symmetries, and applying the first moment method to a random variable that
depends on the number of available colors at each vertex, we bound the
threshold within an additive constant. Specifically, we show that for any
constant epsilon > 0, for sufficiently large k we have
  2 k ln k - ln k - 2 - epsilon < d_k < 2 k ln k - ln k - 1 + epsilon.
  In contrast, the best known bounds on d_k for standard k-colorability leave
an additive gap of about ln k between the upper and lower bounds.
