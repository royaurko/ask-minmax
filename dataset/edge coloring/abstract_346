We consider the problem of finding a color scale which performs well when
converted to a grayscale. We assume that each color is converted to a shade of
gray with the same intensity as the color. We also assume that the color scales
have a linear variation of intensity and hue, and find scales which maximize
the average chroma (or "colorfulness") of the colors. We find two classes of
solutions, which traverse the color wheel in opposite directions. The two
classes of scales start with hues near cyan and red. The average chroma of the
scales are 65-77% those of the pure colors.
