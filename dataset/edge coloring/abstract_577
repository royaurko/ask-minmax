We develop the cohomology theory of color Lie superalgebras due to
Scheunert--Zhang in a framework of nonhomogeneous quadratic Koszul algebras. In
this approach, the Chevalley--Eilenberg complex of a color Lie algebra becomes
a standard Koszul complex for its universal enveloping algebra. As an
application, we calculate cohomologies with trivial coefficients of
3-dimensional color Lie superalgebras.
