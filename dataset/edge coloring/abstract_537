Considering cold, dense quark matter with two massless quark flavors, we
demonstrate how, in a self-consistent calculation in the framework of QCD, the
condensation of Cooper pairs induces a non-vanishing background color field.
This background color field has precisely the right magnitude to cancel tadpole
contributions and thus ensures overall color neutrality of the two-flavor color
superconductor.
