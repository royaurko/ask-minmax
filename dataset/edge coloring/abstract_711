High density YM-theory is addressed by means of an effective theory where a
Higgs type field corresponds to the diquark order parameter. The effective
Higgs theory mimics the Cooper instability at the Fermi surface. After Landau
gauge fixing, the theory possesses a global color degree of freedom. Color
superconductivity corresponds to a spontaneous breakdown of the residual global
color symmetry. Numerical simulations illustrate this mechanism of
spontaneously broken global color for the case of the standard electro-weak
phase transition and for the case of the transition between the confinement and
the Higgs phase, respectively. The latter transition is relevant for the study
of diquark condensation.
