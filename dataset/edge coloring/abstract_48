By means of color chord diagrams we establish a necessary and sufficient
condition for $O$-topological equivalence of functions with one essentially
critical point on oriented surfaces with edge. We also calculate the number of
$O$-topologically non-equivalent functions with one essentially critical point
on oriented surfaces with edge.
