First-principles spin-polarized calculations have been performed on
passivated Boron-Nitride Nanoribbons (BNNRs) with pentagon-heptagon
line-defects (PHLDs) (also called as Stone-Wales line-defects). Two kinds of
PHLDs, namely, even-line and odd-line PHLDs, have been added either at one edge
or at both edges of BNNRs. Single-edge (with all its different possibilities,
for example, for a BNNR with 2-line PHLD at single-edge there are 8
possibilities) as well as both-edge passivations have been considered for all
the ribbons in this study by passivating each edge atom with hydrogen atom.
Density of states (DOS) and projected-DOS (pDOS) analysis have been
accomplished to understand the underlying reason for various properties. We
find that passivation lead to different effects on the electronic and magnetic
properties of a system, and the effects are mainly based on the line-defect
introduced and/or on the atoms which are present at the passivated edge. In
general, we find that, passivation can play a key role in tuning the properties
of a system only when it has a zigzag edge.
