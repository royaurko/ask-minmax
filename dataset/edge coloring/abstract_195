Recent cosmological N-body simulations suggest that current empirical
estimates of tidal radii in dSphs might be underestimated by at least one order
of magnitude. To constrain the plausibility of this theoretical framework, we
undertook a multiband (U,B,V,I) survey of the Carina dSph. Deep B,V data of
several fields located at radial distances from the Carina center ranging from
0.5 to 4.5 degrees show a sizable sample of faint blue objects with the same
magnitudes and colors of old, Turn-Off stars detected across the center. We
found that the (U-V,B-I) color-color plane is a robust diagnostic to split
stars from background galaxies. Unfortunately, current U,I-band data are too
shallow to firmly constrain the real extent of Carina.
