After a review of some of the main results about hyperfinite equivalence
relations and their cocycles in the measured setting, we give a definition of a
topological AF-equivalence relation. We show that every cocycle is cohomologous
to a quasi-product cocycle. We then study the problem of determining the
quasi-invariant probability measures admitting a given cocycle as their
Radon-Nikodym derivative.
