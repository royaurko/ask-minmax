In the classical quickest detection problem, one must detect as quickly as
possible when a Brownian motion without drift "changes" into a Brownian motion
with positive drift. The change occurs at an unknown "disorder" time with
exponential distribution. There is a penalty for declaring too early that the
change has occurred, and a cost for late detection proportional to the time
between occurrence of the change and the time when the change is declared.
Here, we consider the case where there is also a cost for observing the
process. This stochastic control problem can be formulated using either the
notion of strong solution or of weak solution of the s.d.e. that defines the
observation process. We show that the value function is the same in both cases,
even though no optimal strategy exists in the strong formulation. We determine
the optimal strategy in the weak formulation and show, using a form of the
"principle of smooth fit" and under natural hypotheses on the parameters of the
problem, that the optimal strategy takes the form of a two-threshold policy:
observe only when the posterior probability that the change has already
occurred, given the observations, is larger than a threshold $A\geq0$, and
declare that the disorder time has occurred when this posterior probability
exceeds a threshold $B\geq A$. The constants $A$ and $B$ are determined
explicitly from the parameters of the problem.
