In the bidirected minimum Manhattan network problem, given a set T of n
terminals in the plane, we need to construct a network N(T) of minimum total
length with the property that the edges of N(T) are axis-parallel and oriented
in a such a way that every ordered pair of terminals is connected in N(T) by a
directed Manhattan path. In this paper, we present a polynomial factor 2
approximation algorithm for the bidirected minimum Manhattan network problem.
