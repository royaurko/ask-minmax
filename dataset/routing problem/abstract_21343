We characterize infinitesimal generators on complete hyperbolic complex
manifolds without any regularity assumption on the Kobayashi distance. This
allows to prove a general Loewner type equation with regularity of any order
$d\in [1,+\infty ]$. Finally, based on these results, we focus on some open
problems naturally arising.
