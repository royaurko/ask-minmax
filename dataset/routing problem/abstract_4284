The problems of hazardous radiation and collisions with matter on a warp
driven ship pose considerable obstacles to this possibility for interstellar
travel. A solution to these problems lies in the Broeck metric. It is
demonstrated that both threats to the ship will be greatly reduced. It is also
shown that the horizon problem no longer exists.
