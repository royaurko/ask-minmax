In 1993, Y.-G. Oh proposed a problem whether standard Lagrangian tori in C^n
are volume minimizing under Hamiltonian isotopies of C^n. In this article, we
prove that most of them do not have such property if the dimension n is greater
than two. We also discuss the existence of Hamiltonian non-volume minimizing
Lagrangian torus orbits of compact toric Kahler manifolds.
