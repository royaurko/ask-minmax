Multiagent negotiation mechanisms advise original solutions to several
problems for which usual problem solving methods are inappropriate. Mainly
negotiation models are based on agents' interactions through messages. Agents
interact in order to reach an agreement for solving a specific problem. In this
work, we study a new variant of negotiations, which has not yet been addressed
in existing works. This negotiation form is denoted extensible negotiation. In
contrast with current negotiation models, this form of negotiation allows the
agents to dynamically extend the set of items under negotiation. This facility
gives more acceptable solutions for the agents in their negotiation. The
advantage of enlarging the negotiation space is to certainly offer more
facilities for the agents for reaching new agreements which would not have been
obtained using usual negotiation methods. This paper presents the protocol and
the strategies used by the agents to deal with such negotiations.
