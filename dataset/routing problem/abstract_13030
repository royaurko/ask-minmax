This paper discusses improvements to the numerical robustness of the
algorithm described in Kasper Fauerby's "Improved Collision Detection and
Response." The algorithm addresses a common collision detection query: a moving
sphere or ellipsoid vs. a set of motionless triangles. In its current form, the
algorithm allows the sphere to penetrate the triangles. The sphere also
displays "jittering" behavior when colliding with certain geometry. Most of
these problems are the product of insufficient attention to numerical
robustness, the focus of this paper. Motivated by the importance of numerical
robustness in collision detection code, this paper addresses these problems in
detail and proposes efficient solutions to them.
