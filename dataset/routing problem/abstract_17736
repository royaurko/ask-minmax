In many classification problems unlabelled data is abundant and a subset can
be chosen for labelling. This defines the context of active learning (AL),
where methods systematically select that subset, to improve a classifier by
retraining. Given a classification problem, and a classifier trained on a small
number of labelled examples, consider the selection of a single further
example. This example will be labelled by the oracle and then used to retrain
the classifier. This example selection raises a central question: given a fully
specified stochastic description of the classification problem, which example
is the optimal selection? If optimality is defined in terms of loss, this
definition directly produces expected loss reduction (ELR), a central quantity
whose maximum yields the optimal example selection. This work presents a new
theoretical approach to AL, example quality, which defines optimal AL behaviour
in terms of ELR. Once optimal AL behaviour is defined mathematically, reasoning
about this abstraction provides insights into AL. In a theoretical context the
optimal selection is compared to existing AL methods, showing that heuristics
can make sub-optimal selections. Algorithms are constructed to estimate example
quality directly. A large-scale experimental study shows these algorithms to be
competitive with standard AL methods.
