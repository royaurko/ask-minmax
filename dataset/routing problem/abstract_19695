We study a two-dimensional dilaton gravity model related by a conformal
transformation of the metric to the Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger model. We
find that most of the features and problems of the latter can be simply
understood in terms of the classical and semiclassical dynamics of accelerated
observers in two-dimensional Minkowski space.
