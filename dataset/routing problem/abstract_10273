The problem of the existence and uniqueness of the motion of the system of an
arbitrary number linear oscillators under a generalized dry-friction type
control is studied. This type of control arises in the problem of steering the
system to equilibrium. The problem of existence and uniqueness of motion under
the suggested control is resolved within the framework of the DiPerna--Lions
theory of singular ordinary differential equations.
