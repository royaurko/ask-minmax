In this brief note, we consider a wave equation that has both trapping and a
complex potential. For this problem, we prove a uniform bound on the energy and
a Morawetz (or integrated local energy decay) estimate. The equation is a model
problem for certain scalar equations appearing in the Maxwell and linearised
Einstein systems on the exterior of a rotating black hole.
