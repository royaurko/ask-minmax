We show that there is no $(1+\eps)$-approximation algorithm for the problem
of covering points in the plane by minimum number of fat triangles of similar
size (with the minimum angle of the triangles being close to 45 degrees). Here,
the available triangles are prespecified in advance. Since a constant factor
approximation algorithm is known for this problem \cite{cv-iaags-07}, this
settles the approximability of this problem.
  We also investigate some related problems, including cover by friendly fat
shapes, and independent set of triangles in three dimensions.
