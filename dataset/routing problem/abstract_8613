Solving for the minimum time bounded acceleration trajectory with prescribed
position and velocity at endpoints is a highly nonlinear problem. The methods
and bounds developed in this paper distinguish when there is a continuous
acceleration solution and reduce the problem of computing the optimal
trajectory to a search over two parameters, planar rotation
$-\pi/2<\theta<\pi/2$ and spatiotemporal dilation $0<\alpha<\Lambda(\theta)$.
