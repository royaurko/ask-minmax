In dense clusters a bewildering variety of interactions between stars can be
observed, ranging from simple encounters to collisions and other mass-transfer
encounters. With faster and special-purpose computers like GRAPE, the amount of
data per simulation is now exceeding 1TB. Visualization of such data has now
become a complex 4D data-mining problem, combining space and time, and finding
interesting events in these large datasets. We have recently starting using the
virtual reality simulator, installed in the Hayden Planetarium in the American
Museum for Natural History, to tackle some of these problem. This work
(http://www.astro.umd.edu/nemo/amnh/) reports on our first ``observations'',
modifications needed for our specific experiments, and perhaps field ideas for
other fields in science which can benefit from such immersion. We also discuss
how our normal analysis programs can be interfaced with this kind of
visualization.
