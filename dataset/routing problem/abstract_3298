We present results concerning when the joint distribution of an exchangeable
sequence is determined by the marginal distributions of its partial sums. The
question of whether or not this determination occurs was posed by David Aldous.
We then consider related uniqueness problems, including a continuous time
analog to the Aldous problem and a randomized univariate moment problem.
