We propose a new non-perturbative method to compute derivatives of gauge
coupling constants with respect to anisotropic lattice spacings (anisotropy
coefficients). Our method is based on a precise measurement of the finite
temperature deconfining transition curve in the lattice coupling parameter
space extended to anisotropic lattices by applying the spectral density method.
We determine the anisotropy coefficients for the cases of SU(2) and SU(3) gauge
theories. A longstanding problem, when one uses the perturbative anisotropy
coefficients, is a non-vanishing pressure gap at the deconfining transition
point in the SU(3) gauge theory. Using our non-perturbative anisotropy
coefficients, we find that this problem is completely resolved.
