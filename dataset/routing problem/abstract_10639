We consider the problem of assessing goodness of fit of a single Bayesian
model to the observed data in the inverse problem context. A novel procedure of
goodness of fit test is proposed, based on construction of reference
distributions using the `inverse' part of the given model. This is motivated by
an example from palaeoclimatology in which it is of interest to reconstruct
past climates using information obtained from fossils deposited in lake
sediment.
  Technically, given a model $f(Y\mid X,\theta)$, where $Y$ is the observed
data and $X$ is a set of (non-random) covariates, we obtain reference
distributions based on the posterior $\pi(\tilde X\mid Y)$, where $\tilde X$
must be interpreted as the {\it unobserved} random vector corresponding to the
{\it observed} covariates $X$. Put simply, if the posterior distribution
$\pi(\tilde X\mid Y)$ gives high density to the observed covariates $X$, or
equivalently, if the posterior distribution of $T(\tilde X)$ gives high density
to $T(X)$, where $T$ is any appropriate statistic, then we say that the model
fits the data. Otherwise the model in question is not adequate. We provide
decision-theoretic justification of our proposed approach and discuss other
theoretical and computational advantages. We demonstrate our methodology with
many simulated examples and three complex, high-dimensional, realistic
palaeoclimate problems, including the motivating palaeoclimate problem.
