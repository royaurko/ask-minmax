We construct a model which provides maximal mixing between a pseudo-Dirac
$\nu_{\mu}/\nu_{\tau}$ pair, based on a local $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$
symmetry. Its strengths, weaknesses and phenomenological consequences are
examined. The mass gap necessitated by the pseudo-Dirac structure is most
naturally associated with the LSND anomaly. The solar neutrino problem then
requires a light mirror or sterile neutrino. By paying a fine-tuning price to
nullify the mass gap, one can also invoke $\nu_e \to \nu_{\mu,\tau}$ for the
solar problem. The model predicts a new intermediate range force mediated by
the light gauge boson of $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$. Through the mixing of
$\mu$, $\tau$ and $e$, this force couples to electrons and thus may be searched
for in precision ``gravity'' experiments.
