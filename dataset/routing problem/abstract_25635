In this paper, we propose a new adaptation of the D-iteration algorithm to
numerically solve the differential equations. This problem can be reinterpreted
in 2D or 3D (or higher dimensions) as a limit of a diffusion process where the
boundary or initial conditions are replaced by fluid catalysts. It has been
shown that pre-computing the diffusion process for an elementary catalyst case
as a fundamental block of a class of differential equations, the computation
efficiency can be greatly improved. Here, we explain how the diffusion point of
view can be applied to decompose the fluid diffusion process per direction and
how to handle non-symmetric discrete equations. The method can be applied on
the class of problems that can be addressed by the Gauss-Seidel iteration,
based on the linear approximation of the differential equations.
