We show that the motion of a single hole in the infinite $U$ Hubbard model
with frustrated hopping leads to weak metallic antiferromagnetism of kinetic
origin. An intimate relationship is demonstrated between the simplest versions
of this problem in 1 and 2 dimensions, and two of the most subtle many body
problems, namely the Heisenberg Bethe ring in 1-d and the 2-dimensional
triangular lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet.
