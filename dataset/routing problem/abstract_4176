This paper describes an exact algorithm for the Equitable Coloring Problem,
based on the well known DSatur algorithm for the classic Coloring Problem with
new pruning rules specifically derived from the equity constraint.
Computational experiences show that our algorithm is competitive with those
known in literature.
