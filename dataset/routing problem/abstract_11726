In this paper we solve an arbitrary matrix Riemann-Hilbert (inverse
monodromy) problem with quasi-permutation monodromy representations outside of
a divisor in the space of monodromy data. This divisor is characterized in
terms of the theta-divisor on the Jacobi manifold of an auxiliary compact
Riemann surface realized as an appropriate branched covering of $\CP1$ . The
solution is given in terms of a generalization of Szeg\"o kernel on the Riemann
surface. In particular, our construction provides a new class of solutions of
the Schlesinger system. The isomonodromy tau-function of these solutions is
computed up to a nowhere vanishing factor independent of the elements of
monodromy matrices.
