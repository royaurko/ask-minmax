Motivated by recent works on the role of the Holographic principle in
cosmology, we relate a class of second order Ricci invariants to the IR cutoff
characterizing the holographic Dark Energy density. The choice of second order
invariants provides an invariant way to account the problem of causality for
the correct cosmological cutoff, since the presence of event horizons is not an
\emph{a priori} assumption. We find that these models work fairly well, by
fitting the observational data, through a combined cosmological test with the
use of SNeIa, BAO and CMB. This class of models is also able to overcome the
fine-tuning and coincidence problems. Finally, to make a comparison with other
recent models, we adopt the statistical tests AIC and BIC.
