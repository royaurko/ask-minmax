The areas under workload process and under queuing process in a single server
queue over the busy period have many applications not only in queuing theory
but also in risk theory or percolation theory. We focus here on the tail
behaviour of distribution of these two integrals. We present various open
problems and conjectures, which are supported by partial results for some
special cases.
