We review the statistical mechanics approach to the study of the emerging
collective behavior of systems of heterogeneous interacting agents. The general
framework is presented through examples is such contexts as ecosystem dynamics
and traffic modeling. We then focus on the analysis of the optimal properties
of large random resource-allocation problems and on Minority Games and related
models of speculative trading in financial markets, discussing a number of
extensions including multi-asset models, Majority Games and models with
asymmetric information. Finally, we summarize the main conclusions and outline
the major open problems and limitations of the approach.
