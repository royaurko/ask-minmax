By doing a slight change to a beautiful and widely unknown argument by E. L.
Stark [E. L. Stark, Application of a Mean Value Theorem for Integrals to Series
Summation, Amer. Math. Monthly 85 (1978) 481--483.] we get a candidate to be
considered as one of the shortest and most elementary proofs of the celebrated
Basel Problem. Furthermore, we give a comprehensive list of references on this
topic, displayed in chronological order from Euler to present.
