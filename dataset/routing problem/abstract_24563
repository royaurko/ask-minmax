In this paper, we discuss the computation of weighted max-min rate allocation
using joint TDM/FDM strategies under a PSD mask constraint. We show that the
weighted max-min solution allocates the rates according to a predetermined rate
ratio defined by the weights, a fact that is very valuable for
telecommunication service providers. Furthermore, we show that the problem can
be efficiently solved using linear programming. We also discuss the resource
allocation problem in the mixed services scenario where certain users have a
required rate, while the others have flexible rate requirements. The solution
is relevant to many communication systems that are limited by a power spectral
density mask constraint such as WiMax, Wi-Fi and UWB.
