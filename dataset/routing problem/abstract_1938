Deposition of clusters from the gas phase is becoming an enabling technology
for the production of nanostructured devices. Supersonic clusters beam
deposition (SCBD) has been shown as a viable route for the production of
nanostructured thin films. By using SCBD and by exploiting aerodynamical
effects typical of supersonic beams it is possible to obtain very high
deposition rates with a control on neutral cluster mass distribution, allowing
the deposition of thin films with tailored nanostructure. Due to high
deposition rates, high lateral resolution, low temperature processing, SCBD can
be used for the integration of cluster-assembled films on micro- and
nanofabricated platforms with limited or no post-growth processing. Here we
present the industrial opportunities for batch fabrication of gas sensor
microarrays based on transition metal oxide nanoparticles deposited on
microfabricated substrates.
