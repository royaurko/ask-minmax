It is well known that a direct Lagrangian description of radiation damping is
still missing. In this paper we will use a specific approach of this problem
which is the standard way to treat the radiation damping problem. The
objectives here are to construct: a N=2 supersymmetric extension for the model
describing the radiation damping on the noncommutative plane with electric and
magnetic interactions; a dualization analysis of the original action; the
supercharge algebra and the total Hamiltonian for the system.
