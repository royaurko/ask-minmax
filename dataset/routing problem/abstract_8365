We prove new global H\"older-logarithmic stability estimates for the
near-field inverse scattering problem in dimension $d\geq 3$. Our estimates are
given in uniform norm for coefficient difference and related stability
efficiently increases with increasing energy and/or coefficient regularity. In
addition, a global logarithmic stability estimate for this inverse problem in
dimension $d=2$ is also given.
