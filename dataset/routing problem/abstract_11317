We investigate the solar neutrino problem assuming simultaneous presence of
MSW transitions in the sun and neutrino decay on the way from sun to earth. We
do a global $\chi^2$-analysis of the data on total rates in Cl, Ga and
Superkamiokande (SK) experiments and the SK day-night spectrum data and
determine the changes in the allowed region in the $\dm - \tan^2\theta$ plane
in presence of decay. We also discuss the implications for unstable neutrinos
in the SNO experiment.
