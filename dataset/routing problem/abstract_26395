A minimal solution to the flavor problem of warped extra-dimension models,
i.e. the excessive mixed-chirality contribution to CP violation in K-Kbar
mixing arising from Kaluza-Klein (KK) gluon exchange, is proposed. Extending
the strong-interaction gauge group in the bulk by an additional SU(3), and
breaking this symmetry to QCD via boundary conditions, the constraints arising
from the epsilon_K parameter are significantly relaxed. As a result, KK scales
M_KK ~ 2 TeV are consistent with all flavor observables without significant
fine-tuning. The model predicts the existence of an extended Higgs sector
featuring massive color-octet scalars and a tower of KK pseudo-axial gluon
resonances, whose existence is not in conflict with recent LHC dijet bounds.
