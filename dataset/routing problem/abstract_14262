Starting with valise supermultiplets obtained from 0-branes plus field
redefinitions, valise adinkra networks, and the "Garden Algebra," we discuss an
architecture for algorithms that (starting from on-shell theories and, through
a well-defined computation procedure), search for off-shell completions. We
show in one dimension how to directly attack the notorious "off-shell auxiliary
field" problem of supersymmetry with algorithms in the adinkra network-world
formulation.
