We analyze Einstein's vacuum field equations in generalized harmonic
coordinates on a compact spatial domain with boundaries. We specify a class of
boundary conditions which is constraint-preserving and sufficiently general to
include recent proposals for reducing the amount of spurious reflections of
gravitational radiation. In particular, our class comprises the boundary
conditions recently proposed by Kreiss and Winicour, a geometric modification
thereof, the freezing-Psi0 boundary condition and the hierarchy of absorbing
boundary conditions introduced by Buchman and Sarbach. Using the recent
technique developed by Kreiss and Winicour based on an appropriate reduction to
a pseudo-differential first order system, we prove well posedness of the
resulting initial-boundary value problem in the frozen coefficient
approximation. In view of the theory of pseudo-differential operators it is
expected that the full nonlinear problem is also well posed. Furthermore, we
implement some of our boundary conditions numerically and study their
effectiveness in a test problem consisting of a perturbed Schwarzschild black
hole.
