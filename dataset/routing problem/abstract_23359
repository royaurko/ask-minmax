Using the particle content of the fundamental {27} supermultiplet of E_6,
naturally small Dirac neutrino masses are obtained in the context of SU(3)_C
times SU(2)_L times U(1)_Y times U(1)_{chi}, where U(1)_{chi} comes from the
decomposition E_6 to SO(10) times U(1)_{psi}, then SO(10) to SU(5) times
U(1)_{chi}. New observable consequences are predicted at the TeV scale. An
axionic solution of the strong CP problem may be included at no extra cost.
