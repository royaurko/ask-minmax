Cold neutron spectroscopy was performed on CeNi_{1-x}Cu_xSn to investigate
how the magnetic gap in the 'Kondo insulator' CeNiSn is destroyed by
temperature (T), chemical substitution (x), and external magnetic field. Upon
doping, the spin gap collapses and magnetic Bragg peaks occur initially (x =
0.13) at the commensurate wave vectors Q = (0,m/2,l) (m,l integer) where the
higher-energy (4.1 meV) gap is located for x = 0. A magnetic field smooths the
sharp spin gap structure in both momentum and energy, while leaving the
associated static susceptibility unchanged, as does raising T.
