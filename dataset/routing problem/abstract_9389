A tournament T=(V,A) is a directed graph in which there is exactly one arc
between every pair of distinct vertices. Given a digraph on n vertices and an
integer parameter k, the Feedback Arc Set problem asks whether the given
digraph has a set of k arcs whose removal results in an acyclic digraph. The
Feedback Arc Set problem restricted to tournaments is known as the k-Feedback
Arc Set in Tournaments (k-FAST) problem. In this paper we obtain a linear
vertex kernel for k-FAST. That is, we give a polynomial time algorithm which
given an input instance T to k-FAST obtains an equivalent instance T' on O(k)
vertices. In fact, given any fixed e>0, the kernelized instance has at most
(2+e)k vertices. Our result improves the previous known bound of O(k^2) on the
kernel size for k-FAST. Our kernelization algorithm solves the problem on a
subclass of tournaments in polynomial time and uses a known polynomial time
approximation scheme for k-FAST.
