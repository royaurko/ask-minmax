The Standard Model has some intrinsic beauty in the sector of fermions and
gauge bosons. Its scalar sector, though minimal, is however haunted by the
hierarchy problem. The fermionic spectrum also have two major problems, the
flavor problem with its fundamental notion about why there are three families,
and the phenomenological limitation of massless neutrinos. We present here a
completed chiral fermionic sector model, based on a little Higgs model, that
has the plausible potential of addressing all these problems of the SM at an
accessible energy scale, and comment briefly on its phenomenology. The focus
here is not on the little Higgs part, but rather on the electroweak quarks and
leptons from the model, which of course from an important part of the full
model.
