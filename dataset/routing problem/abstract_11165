We study functional determinants for Dirac operators on manifolds with
boundary and discuss the ellipticity of boundary problems by using the
Calder\'on projector. We give, for local boundary conditions, an explicit
formula relating these determinants to the corresponding Green functions. We
finally apply this result to the case of a bidimensional disk under bag-like
conditions.
