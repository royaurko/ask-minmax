We study models with contributions of similar size to the soft masses from
anomaly- and gravity mediation, thereby curing the tachyonic slepton problem of
anomaly mediation. A possible origin of this hybrid setup in a 5-dimensional
brane world is briefly discussed. The absence of excessive flavor violation is
explained by alignment. The gravitino can be heavy enough so that the gravitino
problem of supersymmetric theories with leptogenesis is avoided. The model has
a characteristic signature: It predicts the distinctive gaugino mass pattern of
anomaly mediation and, at the same time, O(1) slepton mass splittings.
