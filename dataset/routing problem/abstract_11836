The collision of a plane parallel shock wave with a plane parallel cloud of
uniform density is analysed for the case in which magnetic fields and radiative
losses are not considered. General analytic solutions are discussed for the
case in which the density of the cloud is greater than that of the surrounding
environment. This problem generalises one of the classical problems in gas
dynamics: the collision between a shock wave and a solid wall.
