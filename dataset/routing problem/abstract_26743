This paper develops analityc methods for investigating uniform hypergraphs.
Its starting point is the spectral theory of 2-graphs, in particular, the
largest and the smallest eigenvalues of 2-graphs. On the one hand, this simple
setup is extended to weighted r-graphs, and on the other, the
eigenvalues-numbers are generalized to eigenvalues-functions, which encompass
also other graph parameters like Lagrangians and number of edges. The resulting
theory is new even for 2-graphs, where well-settled topics become challenges
again. The paper covers a multitude of topics, with more than a hundred
concrete statements to underpin an analytic theory for hypergraphs. Essential
among these topics are a Perron-Frobenius type theory and methods for extremal
hypergraph problems. Many open problems are raised and directions for possible
further research are outlined.
