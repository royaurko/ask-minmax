The square peg problem asks whether every continuous curve in the plane that
starts and ends at the same point without self-intersecting contains four
distinct corners of some square. Toeplitz conjectured in 1911 that this is
indeed the case. Hundred years later we only have partial results for curves
with additional smoothness properties.
  The contribution of this thesis is an algebraic variant of the square peg
problem. By casting the set of squares inscribed on an algebraic plane curve as
a variety and applying Bernshtein's Theorem we are able to count the number of
such squares. An algebraic plane curve defined by a polynomial of degree m
inscribes either an infinite amount of squares, or at most (m^4 - 5m^2 + 4m)/4
squares. Computations using computer algebra software lend evidence to the
claim that this upper bound is sharp for generic curves.
