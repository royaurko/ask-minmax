A variational approach to finite connectivity spin-glass-like models is
developed and applied to describe the structure of optimal solutions in random
satisfiability problems. Our variational scheme accurately reproduces the known
replica symmetric results and also allows for the inclusion of replica symmetry
breaking effects. For the 3-SAT problem, we find two transitions as the ratio
$\alpha$ of logical clauses per Boolean variables increases. At the first one
$\alpha_s \simeq 3.96$, a non-trivial organization of the solution space in
geometrically separated clusters emerges. The multiplicity of these clusters as
well as the typical distances between different solutions are calculated. At
the second threshold $\alpha_c \simeq 4.48$, satisfying assignments disappear
and a finite fraction $B_0 \simeq 0.13$ of variables are overconstrained and
take the same values in all optimal (though unsatisfying) assignments. These
values have to be compared to $\alpha_c \simeq 4.27, B_0 \simeq 0.4$ obtained
from numerical experiments on small instances. Within the present variational
approach, the SAT-UNSAT transition naturally appears as a mixture of a first
and a second order transition. For the mixed $2+p$-SAT with $p<2/5$, the
behavior is as expected much simpler: a unique smooth transition from SAT to
UNSAT takes place at $\alpha_c=1/(1-p)$.
