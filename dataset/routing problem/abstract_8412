Initial-boundary value problems for the linear Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation
posed on bounded rectangles are considered. Spectral properties of a stationary
operator are studied in order to show that the evolution problem posed on a
bounded rectangle has no critical restrictions on its size. Exponential decay
of regular solutions is established.
