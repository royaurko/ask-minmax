We investigate a compressive sensing framework in which the sensors introduce
a distortion to the measurements in the form of unknown gains. We focus on
blind calibration, using measures performed on multiple unknown (but sparse)
signals and formulate the joint recovery of the gains and the sparse signals as
a convex optimization problem. We divide this problem in 3 subproblems with
different conditions on the gains, specifially (i) gains with different
amplitude and the same phase, (ii) gains with the same amplitude and different
phase and (iii) gains with different amplitude and phase. In order to solve the
first case, we propose an extension to the basis pursuit optimization which can
estimate the unknown gains along with the unknown sparse signals. For the
second case, we formulate a quadratic approach that eliminates the unknown
phase shifts and retrieves the unknown sparse signals. An alternative form of
this approach is also formulated to reduce complexity and memory requirements
and provide scalability with respect to the number of input signals. Finally
for the third case, we propose a formulation that combines the earlier two
approaches to solve the problem. The performance of the proposed algorithms is
investigated extensively through numerical simulations, which demonstrates that
simultaneous signal recovery and calibration is possible with convex methods
when sufficiently many (unknown, but sparse) calibrating signals are provided.
