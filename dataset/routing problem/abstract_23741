Slowly convergent series and sequences as well as divergent series occur
quite frequently in the mathematical treatment of scientific problems. In this
report, a large number of mainly nonlinear sequence transformations for the
acceleration of convergence and the summation of divergent series are
discussed. Some of the sequence transformations of this report as for instance
Wynn's $\epsilon$ algorithm or Levin's sequence transformation are well
established in the literature on convergence acceleration, but the majority of
them is new. Efficient algorithms for the evaluation of these transformations
are derived. The theoretical properties of the sequence transformations in
convergence acceleration and summation processes are analyzed. Finally, the
performance of the sequence transformations of this report are tested by
applying them to certain slowly convergent and divergent series, which are
hopefully realistic models for a large part of the slowly convergent or
divergent series that can occur in scientific problems and in applied
mathematics.
