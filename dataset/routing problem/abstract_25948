In this paper, we address the inverse problem of reconstructing a scene as
well as the camera motion from the image sequence taken by an omni-directional
camera. Our structure from motion results give sharp conditions under which the
reconstruction is unique. For example, if there are three points in general
position and three omni-directional cameras in general position, a unique
reconstruction is possible up to a similarity. We then look at the
reconstruction problem with m cameras and n points, where n and m can be large
and the over-determined system is solved by least square methods. The
reconstruction is robust and generalizes to the case of a dynamic environment
where landmarks can move during the movie capture. Possible applications of the
result are computer assisted scene reconstruction, 3D scanning, autonomous
robot navigation, medical tomography and city reconstructions.
