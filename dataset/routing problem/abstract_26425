We present detailed arguments and calculations in support of our recent
proposal to identify the axion arising in the solution of the strong CP problem
with the Majoron, the (pseudo-)Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken lepton
number symmetry. At low energies, the associated $U(1)_L$ becomes, via
electroweak parity violation and neutrino mediation, indistinguishable from an
axial Peccei-Quinn symmetry in relation to the strong interactions. The axionic
couplings are then fully computable in terms of known SM parameters and the
Majorana mass scales. The determination of these couplings involves certain
three-loop diagrams, with a UV finite neutrino triangle taking over the role of
the usual triangle anomaly. A main novelty of our proposal is thus to solve the
strong CP problem by a non-local term that produces an anomaly-like term in the
IR limit.
