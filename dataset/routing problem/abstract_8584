In this paper we consider the heat flow associated to the classical Plateau
problem for surfaces of prescribed mean curvature. We show that an
isoperimetric condition on H ensures the existence of a global weak solution.
Moreover, we establish that these global solutions sub-converge, as time tends
to infinity, to a conformal solution of the classical Plateau problem for
surfaces of prescribed mean curvature.
