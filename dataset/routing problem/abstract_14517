This paper considers the problem of estimating the delays of a weighted
superposition of pulses, called stream of pulses, in a noisy environment. We
show that the delays can be estimated using a tractable convex optimization
problem with a localization error proportional to the square root of the noise
level. Furthermore, all false detections produced by the algorithm have small
amplitudes. Numerical and in-vitro ultrasound experiments corroborate the
theoretical results and demonstrate their applicability for the ultrasound
imaging signal processing.
