The experimental observation of neutron - antineutron oscillations is one of
the oldest problems of elementary-particle physics. However, the search for
these processes in the laboratories on the Earth have thus far yielded no
results. In this paper, we consider the possibility of finding $n - \tilde n$
oscillations in the solar cosmic rays at flare increases. There are two
arguments in favour of such an approach to this problem: a long distance for a
neutron run and a weak magnetic field in the solar cosmic-ray environment.
Therefore, the presence of antinucleons in solar cosmic rays may be a evidence
of the existence of $n - \tilde n$ oscillations. The intensities expected of
the $\tilde n$ and $\tilde p$ fluxes near the Earth are found.
