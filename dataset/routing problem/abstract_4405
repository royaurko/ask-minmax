Memorizing the user commands has been a problem since long. In this study we
try to propose solutions to overcome two problems - the problem of selecting
appropriate commands names during application development and the problem of
memorizing these command names. The proposed solution includes a framework in
which the applications can plug into, to get their application commands and
corresponding tags in to the new command execution application.We also propose
a mechanism where user can generate her own set of tags for a command and share
those with peers.
