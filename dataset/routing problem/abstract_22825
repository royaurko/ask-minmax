We solve several problems that involve imposing metrics on surfaces.
  The problem of a strip with a linear metric gradient is formulated in terms
of a Lagrangean similar to those used for spin systems. We are able to show
that the low energy state of long strips is a twisted helical state like a
telephone cord. We then extend the techniques used in this solution to
two--dimensional sheets with more general metrics. We find evolution equations
and show that when they are not singular, a surface is determined by knowledge
of its metric, and the shape of the surface along one line. Finally, we provide
numerical evidence that once these evolution equations become singular, either
the surface is not differentiable, or else the metric deviates from the target
metric as a result of minimization of a suitable energy functional .
