We work in the context of Markovian rough paths associated to a class of
uniformly subelliptic Dirichlet forms [25] and prove a better-than-exponential
tail estimate for the accummulated local p-variation functional, which has been
introduced and studied in [17]. We comment on the significance of these
estimates to a range of currently-studied problems, including the recent
results of Chevyrev and Lyons in [18].
