A generic method for dynamic assignment used with microsimulation of
pedestrian dynamics is introduced. As pedestrians - unlike vehicles - do not
move on a network, but on areas they in principle can choose among an infinite
number of routes. To apply assignment algorithms one has to select for each OD
pair a finite (realistically a small) number of relevant representatives from
these routes. This geometric task is the main focus of this contribution. The
main task is to find for an OD pair the relevant routes to be used with common
assignment methods. The method is demonstrated for one single OD pair and
exemplified with an example.
