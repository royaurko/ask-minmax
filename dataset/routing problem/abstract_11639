We prove a non-commutative version of the Hilbert's 17th problem, giving a
characterization of the class of non-commutative polynomials in
n-undeterminates that have positive trace when evaluated in n-selfadjoint
elements in arbitrary II1 von Neumann algebra. As a corollary we prove that
Connes's embedding conjecture is equivalent to a statement that can be
formulated entirely in the context of finite matrices.
