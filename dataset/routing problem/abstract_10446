The purpose of this bulletin board is to collect problems in higher
dimensional complex analysis. We are interested both in basic research
questions as well as interactive questions with other fields and sciences. We
encourage everybody to submit problems to the list. This includes not only
those coming up in your own work, but also others- maybe well known and
classical- that you see missing, but that you think workers in the field should
be aware of. Not only are we searching for basic research type questions in
several complex variables, we also solicit questions exploring relations to
other mathematical fields, one complex variable, partial differential
equations, differential geometry, dynamics, etc. and to other sciences such as
physics, engineering, biology etc. While some questions fall rather naturally
into one of the subject areas in this problem list and may lead to a
publishable paper, other questions may be non- specific or of a transient or
technical quality. Thus we have a section called ``Scratchpad'' for
conversational questions, vaguely formulated questions, or questions to which
you may hope to get a quick answer. In the ``open prize problems'' section, you
are welcome to offer a nice little prize to whoever does it. The miscellaneous
section is for announcements of conferences, jokes, remarks on the general
state of the field, etc.
