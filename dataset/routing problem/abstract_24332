A variational approach is presented to calculate the stress field generated
by a system of dislocations. It is shown that in the simplest case, when the
material containing the dislocations obeys Hooke's law the variational
framework gives the same field equations as Kr\"oner's theory. However, the
variational method proposed allows to study many other problems like
dislocation core regularisation, role of elastic anharmonicity and
dislocation--solute atom interaction. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate
that these problems can be handled on a systematic manner.
