The paper is devoted to a problem inspired by the "Minesweeper" computer
game. It is shown that certain configurations of open cells guarantee the
existence and the uniqueness of solution. Mathematically the problem is reduced
to some spectral properties of discrete differential operators. It is shown how
the uniqueness can be used to create a new game which preserves the spirit of
"Minesweeper" but does not require a computer.
