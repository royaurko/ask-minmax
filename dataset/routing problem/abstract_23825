We present some new ideas on important problems related to primes. The topics
of our discussion are: simple formulae for primes, twin primes, Sophie Germain
primes, prime tuples less than or equal to a predefined number, and their
infinitude; establishment of a kind of similarity between natural numbers and
numbers that appear in an arithmetic progression, similar formulae for primes
and the so called generalized twin primes in an arithmetic progression and
their infinitude; generalization of Bertrand postulate and a Bertrand like
postulate for twin primes; some elementary implications of a simple primality
test, the use of Chinese remainder theorem in a possible proof of the Goldbach
conjecture; Schinzel Sierpinski conjecture; and lastly the Mersenne primes and
composites, Fermat primes, and their infinitude.
