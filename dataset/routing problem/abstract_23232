We find an exact analytic solution for the time evolution of a three Dirac
neutrino system adiabatically oscillating in matter, constructing explicitly
the relevant $3\times 3$ mixing matrix in matter. Using this result we
investigate the solar neutrino data in a scenario where the neutrino masses are
such that $m_1\alt m_2\ll m_3$, taking into account several phenomenological
constraints on neutrino mixing angles and masses. A solution of the solar
neutrino problem for large values of the parameter $\delta m^2=m_2^2-m_1^2$
which are not usually associated with a resonance is found. This is an
essentially three-generation effect.
