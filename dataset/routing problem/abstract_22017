A deterministic finite automaton is said to be synchronizing if it has a
reset word, i.e. a word that brings all states of the automaton to a particular
one. We prove that it is a PSPACE-complete problem to check whether the
language of reset words for a given automaton coincides with the language of
reset words for some particular automaton.
