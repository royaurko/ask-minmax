We obtain Calder\'on-Zygmund estimates for some degenerate equations of
Kolmogorov type with inhomogeneous coefficients. We then derive the
well-posedness of the martingale problem associated to related degenerate
operators, and therefore uniqueness in law for the corresponding stochastic
differential equations. Some density estimates are established as well.
