In this paper the problem of finding a normal form of triangles and plane
quadrilaterals up to similarity is considered. Several normal forms for
triangles and a normal form for quadrilaterals of special case are described.
Normal forms of simple plane objects such as triangles can be used in
mathematics teaching.
