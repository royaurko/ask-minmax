Let $\Diffeo=\Diffeo(\R)$ denote the group of infinitely-differentiable
diffeomorphisms of the real line $\R$, under the operation of composition, and
let $\Diffeo^+$ be the subgroup of diffeomorphisms of degree +1, i.e.
orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms. We show how to reduce the problem of
determining whether or not two given elements $f,g\in \Diffeo$ are conjugate in
$\Diffeo$ to associated conjugacy problems in the subgroup $\Diffeo^+$. The
main result concerns the case when $f$ and $g$ have degree -1, and specifies
(in an explicit and verifiable way) precisely what must be added to the
assumption that their (compositional) squares are conjugate in $\Diffeo^+$, in
order to ensure that $f$ is conjugated to $g$ by an element of $\Diffeo^+$. The
methods involve formal power series, and results of Kopell on centralisers in
the diffeomorphism group of a half-open interval.
