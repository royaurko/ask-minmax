We explore an (unpublished) approach to the famous Jacobian Conjecture by
means of identities of algebras, discovered by the brilliant deceased
mathematician, Alexander Vladimirovich Yagzhev (1951{2001). This approach also
indicates some very close connections between mathematical physics, universal
algebra and au- tomorphisms of polynomial algebras
