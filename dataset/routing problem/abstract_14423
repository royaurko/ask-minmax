We present and analyze a non-conforming domain decomposition approximation
for a hypersingular operator governed by the Helmholtz equation in three
dimensions. This operator appears when considering the corresponding Neumann
problem in unbounded domains exterior to open surfaces. We consider small wave
numbers and low-order approximations with Nitsche coupling across interfaces.
Under appropriate assumptions on mapping properties of the weakly singular and
hypersingular operators with Helmholtz kernel, we prove that this method
converges almost quasi-optimally. Numerical experiments confirm our error
estimate.
