We present a new algorithm for exactly solving decision making problems
represented as influence diagrams. We do not require the usual assumptions of
no forgetting and regularity; this allows us to solve problems with
simultaneous decisions and limited information. The algorithm is empirically
shown to outperform a state-of-the-art algorithm on randomly generated problems
of up to 150 variables and $10^{64}$ solutions. We show that the problem is
NP-hard even if the underlying graph structure of the problem has small
treewidth and the variables take on a bounded number of states, but that a
fully polynomial time approximation scheme exists for these cases. Moreover, we
show that the bound on the number of states is a necessary condition for any
efficient approximation scheme.
