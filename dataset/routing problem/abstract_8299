Elementary decision-theoretic analysis of the Monty Hall dilemma shows that
the problem has dominance. This makes possible to discard nonswitching
strategies, without making any assumptions on the prior distribution of factors
out of control of the decision maker. A path to the Bayesian and the minimax
decision-making environments is then straightforward.
