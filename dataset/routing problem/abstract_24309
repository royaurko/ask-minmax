The relation between limit cycles of planar differential systems and the
inverse integrating factor was first shown in an article of Giacomini, Llibre
and Viano appeared in 1996. From that moment on, many research articles are
devoted to the study of the properties of the inverse integrating factor and
its relation with limit cycles and their bifurcations. This paper is a summary
of all the results about this topic. We include a list of references together
with the corresponding related results aiming at being as much exhaustive as
possible. The paper is, nonetheless, self-contained in such a way that all the
main results on the inverse integrating factor are stated and a complete
overview of the subject is given. Each section contains a different issue to
which the inverse integrating factor plays a role: the integrability problem,
relation with Lie symmetries, the center problem, vanishing set of an inverse
integrating factor, bifurcation of limit cycles from either a period annulus or
from a monodromic $\omega$-limit set and some generalizations.
