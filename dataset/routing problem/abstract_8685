The uniqueness problems on transcendental meromorphic or entire functions
sharing at least two values with their derivatives or linear differential
polynomials have been studied and many results have been obtained. In this
paper, we study a transcendental entire function f that shares a non-zero
polynomial a with f', together with its linear differential polynomials of the
form with rational function coefficients.
