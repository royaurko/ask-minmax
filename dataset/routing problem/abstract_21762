We consider the entire characteristic functions of order 2 and we prove some
decomposition theorems in a multidimensional case. We show that the lack of
zeros of the density function is a necessary but not a sufficient (as in the
one-dimensional case) condition for a characteristic function to be
decomposable. We also find some simple sufficient conditions.
