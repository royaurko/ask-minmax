We shall investigate randomized algorithms for solving large-scale linear
inverse problems with general regularizations. We first present some techniques
to transform inverse problems of general form into the ones of standard form,
then apply randomized algorithms to reduce large-scale systems of standard form
to much smaller-scale systems and seek their regularized solutions in
combination with some popular choice rules for regularization parameters. Then
we will propose a second approach to solve large-scale ill-posed systems with
general regularizations. This involves a new randomized generalized SVD
algorithm that can essentially reduce the size of the original large-scale
ill-posed systems. The reduced systems can provide approximate regularized
solutions with about the same accuracy as the ones by the classical generalized
SVD, and more importantly, the new approach gains obvious robustness, stability
and computational time as it needs only to work on problems of much smaller
size. Numerical results are given to demonstrated the efficiency of the
algorithms.
