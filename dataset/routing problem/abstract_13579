We show that in an SU(3)_c\times [SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y]\times [SU(2)'_R\times
U(1)'_Y] framework, the parity symmetry motivated by solving the strong CP
problem without resorting to an axion can predict a dark matter particle with a
mass around 302 GeV. This dark matter candidate can be directly detected in the
presence of a U(1)_Y\times U(1)'_Y kinetic mixing. Furthermore, our model can
accommodate a natural way to simultaneously realize an inverse-linear seesaw
for neutrino masses and a resonant leptogenesis for baryon asymmetry.
