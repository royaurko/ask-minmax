In this paper the chaos persistence in a class of discontinuous dynamical
systems of fractional-order is analyzed. To that end, the Initial Value Problem
is first transformed, by using the Filippov regularization [1], into a
set-valued problem of fractional-order, then by Cellina's approximate selection
theorem [2, 3], the problem is approximated into a single-valued
fractional-order problem, which is numerically solved by using a numerical
scheme proposed by Diethelm, Ford and Freed [4]. Two typical examples of
systems belonging to this class are analyzed and simulated.
