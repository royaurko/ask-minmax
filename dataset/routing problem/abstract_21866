We incorporate signaling scheme into Ad Auction setting, to achieve better
welfare and revenue while protect users' privacy. We propose a new
\emph{$K$-anonymous signaling scheme setting}, prove the hardness of the
corresponding welfare/revenue maximization problem, and finally propose the
algorithms to approximate the optimal revenue or welfare.
