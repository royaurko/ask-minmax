Globally, there are so much information security threats on Internet that
even when data is encrypted, there is no guarantee that copy would not be
available to third-party, and eventually be decrypted. Thus, trusted routing
mechanism that inhibits availability of (encrypted or not) data being
transferred to third-party is proposed in this paper. Algorithmization,
requirements analysis and architectural challenges for its development are
presented.
