This paper is concerned with the analysis of the Cauchy problem of a general
class of two-dimensional nonlinear nonlocal wave equations governing anti-plane
shear motions in nonlocal elasticity. The nonlocal nature of the problem is
reflected by a convolution integral in the space variables. The Fourier
transform of the convolution kernel is nonnegative and satisfies a certain
growth condition at infinity. For initial data in $L^{2}$ Sobolev spaces,
conditions for global existence or finite time blow-up of the solutions of the
Cauchy problem are established.
