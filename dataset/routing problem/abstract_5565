The classical solution of bosonic d-brane in (d+1,1) space-time is studied.
We work with light-cone gauge and reduce the problem into Chaplygin gas
problem. The static equation is equivalent to vanishing of extrinsic mean
curvature, which is similar to Einstein equation in vacuum. We show that the
d-brane problem in this gauge is closely related to Plateau problem, and we
give some non-trivial solutions from minimal surfaces. The solutions of
d-1,d,d+1 spatial dimensions are obtained from d-dimensional minimal surfaces
as solutions of Plateau problem. In addition we discuss on the relation to
Hamiltonian-BRST formalism for d-branes.
