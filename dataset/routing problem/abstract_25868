This work presents a new methodology for computing ground states of
Bose-Einstein condensates based on finite element discretizations on two
different scales of numerical resolution. In a pre-processing step, a
low-dimensional (coarse) generalized finite element space is constructed. It is
based on a local orthogonal decomposition and exhibits high approximation
properties. The non-linear eigenvalue problem that characterizes the ground
state is solved by some suitable iterative solver exclusively in this
low-dimensional space, without loss of accuracy when compared with the solution
of the full fine scale problem. The pre-processing step is independent of the
types and numbers of bosons. A post-processing step further improves the
accuracy of the method. We present rigorous a priori error estimates that
predict convergence rates H^3 for the ground state eigenfunction and H^4 for
the corresponding eigenvalue without pre-asymptotic effects; H being the coarse
scale discretization parameter. Numerical experiments indicate that these high
rates may still be pessimistic.
