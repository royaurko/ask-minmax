Subject of this paper is an implementation of a well-known Motzkin-Burger
algorithm, which solves the problem of finding the full set of solutions of a
system of linear homogeneous inequalities. There exist a number of
implementations of this algorithm, but there was no one in Maple, to the best
of the contributor's knowledge.
