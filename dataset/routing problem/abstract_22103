In this paper, we provide a new means of establishing solvability of the
Dirichlet problem on Lipschitz domains, with measurable data, for second order
elliptic, non-symmetric divergence form operators. We show that a certain
optimal Carleson measure estimate for bounded solutions of such operators
implies a regularity result for the associated elliptic measure.
