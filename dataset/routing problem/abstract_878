A major source of delays in public transportation is the clustering
instability, which causes late buses to become progressively later while the
buses trailing it become progressively earlier. In this paper, we study this
instability and how to neutralize it using the common practices of holding and
schedule slack. Starting with an on-time route, we delay one or more buses at a
single stop, and determine how these delays grow over time. We compare the
effects of two different types of holding on the stability of the system, and
briefly investigate how our results change with the use of timepoints.
