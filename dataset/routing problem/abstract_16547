We present a detailed analysis of the Landau-Zener problem for an interacting
Bose-Einstein condensate in a time-varying double-well trap, especially
focussing on the relation between the full many-particle problem and the
mean-field approximation. Due to the nonlinear self-interaction a dynamical
instability occurs, which leads to a breakdown of adiabaticity condition and
thus fundamentally alters the dynamics. It is shown that essentially all
features of the Landau-Zener problem including the depletion of the condensate
mode can be already understood within a semiclassical phase space picture. In
particular, this treatment resolves the formerly imputed incommutability of the
adiabatic and semiclassical limits. The possibility to exploit Landau-Zener
sweeps to generate squeezed states for spectroscopic tasks is analysed in
detail. Moreover, we study the influence of phase noise and propose a
Landau-Zener sweep as a sensitive, yet readily implementable probe for
decoherence, since this has a significant effect on the transition rate for
slow parameter variations.
