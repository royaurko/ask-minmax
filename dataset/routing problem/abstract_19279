Multi-label learning deals with the classification problems where each
instance can be assigned with multiple labels simultaneously. Conventional
multi-label learning approaches mainly focus on exploiting label correlations.
It is usually assumed, explicitly or implicitly, that the label sets for
training instances are fully labeled without any missing labels. However, in
many real-world multi-label datasets, the label assignments for training
instances can be incomplete. Some ground-truth labels can be missed by the
labeler from the label set. This problem is especially typical when the number
instances is very large, and the labeling cost is very high, which makes it
almost impossible to get a fully labeled training set. In this paper, we study
the problem of large-scale multi-label learning with incomplete label
assignments. We propose an approach, called MPU, based upon positive and
unlabeled stochastic gradient descent and stacked models. Unlike prior works,
our method can effectively and efficiently consider missing labels and label
correlations simultaneously, and is very scalable, that has linear time
complexities over the size of the data. Extensive experiments on two real-world
multi-label datasets show that our MPU model consistently outperform other
commonly-used baselines.
