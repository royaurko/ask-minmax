The problem of chemical and dynamical evolution of galaxies is one of the
most attracting and complex problems of modern astrophysics. Within the
framework of the given work the standard dynamic Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics (SPH) code (Monaghan J.J. 1992, ARAA, 30, 543) is noticeably
expanded. Our investigation concernes with the changes and incorporation of new
ideas into the algorithmic inclusion of Star Formation (SF) and Super Novae
(SN) explosions in SPH (Berczik P. & Kravchuk S.G., 1996, ApSpSci, 245, 27).
The proposed energy criterion for definition of a place and efficiency of SF
results in the successfully explain Star Formation History (SFH) in isolated
galaxies of different types. On the base of original ideas we expand a code in
a more realistic way of the description of effects of return of a hot, chemical
enriched gas in Interstellar Matter (ISM). In addition to the account of SNII,
we offer the self-agreed account of SNIa and PN. This allows to describe not
only the ISM content of $ O^{16} $ but also the content of $ Fe^{56} $. This
model will allow to investigate adequately also a well known $ G - dwarf $
problem. In the frame of this approach we are able to reproduce the presently
observed kinematics of star and gaseous components as well as their
distributions and heavy element abundances. The developed model provide the
realistic description of dynamics and chemical evolution of typical disk --
like galaxies over the Hubble timescale.
