The observation and modeling of natural Complex Systems (CSs) like the human
nervous system, the evolution or the weather, allows the definition of special
abilities and models reusable to solve other problems. For instance, Genetic
Algorithms or Ant Colony Optimizations are inspired from natural CSs to solve
optimization problems. This paper proposes the use of ant-based systems to
solve various problems with a non assessing approach. This means that solutions
to some problem are not evaluated. They appear as resultant structures from the
activity of the system. Problems are modeled with graphs and such structures
are observed directly on these graphs. Problems of Multiple Sequences Alignment
and Natural Language Processing are addressed with this approach.
