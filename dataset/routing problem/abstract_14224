We consider the non-preemptive task scheduling problem with release times and
deadlines on a single machine parameterized by the set of task lengths the
tasks can have. The identical task lengths case is known to be solvable in
polynomial time. We prove that the problem with two task lengths is
NP-complete, except for the case in which the short jobs have unit task length,
which was already known to be efficiently solvable.
