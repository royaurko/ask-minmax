Calculating the microscopic dissociation rate of a bound state, such as a
classical diatomic molecule, has been difficult so far. The problem was that
standard theories require an energy barrier over which the bound particle (or
state) escapes into the preferred low-energy state. This is not the case when
the long-range repulsion responsible for the barrier is either absent or
screened (as in Cooper pairs, ionized plasma, or biomolecular complexes). We
solve this classical problem by accounting for entropic memory at the
microscopic level. The theory predicts dissociation rates for arbitrary
potentials and is successfully tested on the example of plasma, where it yields
an estimate of ionization in the core of Sun in excellent agreement with
experiments. In biology, the new theory accounts for crowding in
receptor-ligand kinetics and protein aggregation.
