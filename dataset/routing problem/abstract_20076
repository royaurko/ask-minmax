In this paper we answer the question posed by M.~Atiyah and give an explicit
formula for Floer homology of Brieskorn homology spheres in terms of their
branching sets over the 3--sphere. We further show how Floer homology is
related to other invariants of knots and 3--manifolds, among which are the
$\bar\mu$--invariant of W.~Neumann and L.~Siebenmann and the Jones polynomial.
Essential progress is made in proving the homology cobordism invariance of our
own $\nu$--invariant.
