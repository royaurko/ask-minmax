This paper focuses on the coordination of a population of thermostatically
controlled loads (TCLs) with unknown parameters to achieve group objectives.
The problem involves designing the device bidding and market clearing
strategies to motivate self-interested users to realize efficient energy
allocation subject to a peak energy constraint. This coordination problem is
formulated as a mechanism design problem, and we propose a mechanism to
implement the social choice function in dominant strategy equilibrium. The
proposed mechanism consists of a novel bidding and clearing strategy that
incorporates the internal dynamics of TCLs in the market mechanism design, and
we show it can realize the team optimal solution. A learning scheme is proposed
to address the unknown load model parameters. Numerical simulations are
performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed coordination framework.
