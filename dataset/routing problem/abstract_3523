In this paper, a new type of multi-level correction scheme is proposed for
solving eigenvalue problems by finite element method. With this new scheme, the
accuracy of eigenpair approximations can be improved after each correction step
which only needs to solve a source problem on finer finite element space and an
eigenvalue problem on the coarsest finite element space. This correction scheme
can improve the efficiency of solving eigenvalue problems by finite element
method.
