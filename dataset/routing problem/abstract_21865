The Markov modulated (switching) state space is an important model paradigm
in applied statistics. In this article, we specifically consider Markov
modulated nonlinear state-space models and address the online Bayesian
inference problem for such models. In particular, we propose a new
Rao-Blackwellized particle filter for the inference task which is our main
contribution here. The detailed descriptions including an algorithmic summary
are subsequently presented.
