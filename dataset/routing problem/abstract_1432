We propose a detailed description of the structure of the layer formed by
polyelectrolyte chains adsorbed onto an oppositely charged surface in the
semi-dilute regime. We combine the mean-field Poisson-Boltzmann-Edwards theory
and the scaling functional theory to describe the variations of the monomer
concentration, the electrostatic potential, and the local grafting density with
the distance to the surface. For long polymers, we find that the effective
charge of the decorated surface (surface plus adsorbed polyelectrolytes) can be
much larger than the bare charge of the surface at low salt concentration, thus
providing an experimental route to a "supercharging" type of effect.
