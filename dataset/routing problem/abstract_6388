In the present paper we investigate the transmission and reflection band
behavior for a plane electromagnetic wave falling obliquely on an ideal layered
structure. The dependence of this behavior on the problem parameters and wave
incident angle is considered. It is shown, that in general case the band width
is a non-monotonous function of the problem parameters. A condition is found,
which defines the possibility of the contact of the transmission bands. This
condition has the same form for s and p waves. It is also shown that
irrespective of the wave polarization, the transmission coefficient equals to
the unit at the contact points.
