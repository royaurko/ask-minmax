Formulate the problem as follows. Split a file into n pieces so that it can
be restored without any m parts (1<=m<=n). Such problems are called problems
secret sharing. There exists a set of methods for solving such problems, but
they all require a fairly large number of calculations applied to the problem
posed above. The proposed method does not require calculations, and requires
only the operations of the division of the file into equal (nearly equal) parts
and gluing them in a certain order in one or more files.
