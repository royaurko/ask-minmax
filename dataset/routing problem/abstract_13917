We present R package mnlogit for training multinomial logistic regression
models, particularly those involving a large number of classes and features.
Compared to existing software, mnlogit offers speedups of 10x-50x for modestly
sized problems and more than 100x for larger problems. Running mnlogit in
parallel mode on a multicore machine gives an additional 2x-4x speedup on up to
8 processor cores. Computational efficiency is achieved by drastically speeding
up calculation of the log-likelihood function's Hessian matrix by exploiting
structure in matrices that arise in intermediate calculations.
