The stochastic Boolean satisfiability (SSAT) problem has been introduced by
Papadimitriou in 1985 when adding a probabilistic model of uncertainty to
propositional satisfiability through randomized quantification. SSAT has many
applications, among them probabilistic bounded model checking (PBMC) of
symbolically represented Markov decision processes. This article identifies a
notion of Craig interpolant for the SSAT framework and develops an algorithm
for computing such interpolants based on a resolution calculus for SSAT. As a
potential application area of this novel concept of Craig interpolation, we
address the symbolic analysis of probabilistic systems. We first investigate
the use of interpolation in probabilistic state reachability analysis, turning
the falsification procedure employing PBMC into a verification technique for
probabilistic safety properties. We furthermore propose an interpolation-based
approach to probabilistic region stability, being able to verify that the
probability of stabilizing within some region is sufficiently large.
