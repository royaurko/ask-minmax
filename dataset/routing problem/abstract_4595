The main computational steps in algebraic soft-decoding, as well as
Sudan-type list-decoding, of Reed-Solomon codes are bivariate polynomial
interpolation and factorization. We introduce a computational technique, based
upon re-encoding and coordinate transformation, that significantly reduces the
complexity of the bivariate interpolation procedure. This re-encoding and
coordinate transformation converts the original interpolation problem into
another reduced interpolation problem, which is orders of magnitude smaller
than the original one. A rigorous proof is presented to show that the two
interpolation problems are indeed equivalent. An efficient factorization
procedure that applies directly to the reduced interpolation problem is also
given.
