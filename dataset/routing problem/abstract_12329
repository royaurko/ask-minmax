Linearization of the Hamiltonian is being performed around the triangular
equilibrium points in the generalized photogravitational Chermnykh's problem.
The bigger primary is being considered as a source of radiation and small
primary as an oblate spheroid. We have found the normal form of the second
order part of the Hamiltonian. For this we have solved the aforesaid set of
equations. . The effect of radiation pressure, gravitational potential from the
belt on the linear stability have been examined analytically and numerically.
