We propose a distributed positioning algorithm to estimate the unknown
positions of a number of target nodes, given distance measurements between
target nodes and between target nodes and a number of reference nodes at known
positions. Based on a geometric interpretation, we formulate the positioning
problem as an implicit convex feasibility problem in which some of the sets
depend on the unknown target positions, and apply a parallel projection onto
convex sets approach to estimate the unknown target node positions. The
proposed technique is suitable for parallel implementation in which every
target node in parallel can update its position and share the estimate of its
location with other targets. We mathematically prove convergence of the
proposed algorithm. Simulation results reveal enhanced performance for the
proposed approach compared to available techniques based on projections,
especially for sparse networks.
