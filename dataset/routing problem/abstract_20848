Wilson line on a non-simply connected manifold is a nice way to break SU(5)
unified symmetry, and to solve the doublet--triplet splitting problem. This
mechanism also requires, however, that the two Higgs doublets are strictly
vector-like under all underlying gauge symmetries, and consequently there is a
limit in a class of modes and their phenomenology for which the Wilson line can
be used. An alternative is to turn on a non-flat line bundle in the U(1)_Y
direction on an internal manifold, which does not have to be non-simply
connected. The U(1)_Y gauge field has to remain in the massless spectrum, and
its coupling has to satisfy the GUT relation. In string theory
compactifications, however, it is not that easy to satisfy these conditions in
a natural way; we call it U(1)_Y problem. In this article, we explain how the
problem is solved in some parts of moduli space of string theory
compactifications. Two major ingredients are an extra strongly coupled U(1)
gauge field and parametrically large volume for compactification that is also
essential in accounting for the hierarchy between the Planck scale and the GUT
scale. Heterotic-M theory vacua and F-theory vacua are discussed. This article
also shows that the toroidal orbifold GUT approach using discrete Wilson lines
corresponds to the non-flat line-bundle breaking above when orbifold
singularities are blown up. Thus, the orbifold GUT approach also suffers from
the U(1)_Y problem, and this article shows how to fix it.
