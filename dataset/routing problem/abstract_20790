Let G be a simple, noncompact, connected, real Lie group with finite center,
and K a maximal compact subgroup of G. We assume that G/K is Hermitian. Using
GIT methods derived from the generalized eigenvalue problem, we compute a set
of affine equations describing the moment polyhedron of the projection on k* of
holomorphic coadjoint orbits of G.
