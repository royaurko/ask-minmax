In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem of the magnetic type Zakharov
system which describes the pondermotive force and magnetic field generation
effects resulting from the non-linear interaction between plasma-wave and
particles. By using the energy method to derive a priori bounds and an
approximation argument for the construction of solutions, we obtain local
existence and uniqueness results for the magnetic Zakharov system in the case
of $d=2,3$.
