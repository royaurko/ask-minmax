The main purpose of this article is to describe the taxonomy of computer
languages according to the levels of abstraction. There exists so many computer
languages because of so many reasons like the evolution of better computer
languages over the time; the socio-economic factors as the proprietary
interests, commercial advantages; expressive power; ease of use of novice;
orientation toward special purposes; orientation toward special hardware; and
diverse ideas about most suitability. Moreover, the important common properties
of most of these languages are discussed here. No programming language is
designed in a vacuity, but it solves some specific kinds of problems. There is
a different framework for each problem and best suitable framework for each
problem. A single framework is not best for all types of problems. So, it is
important to select vigilantly the frameworks supported by the language. The
five generation of the computer programming languages are explored in this
paper to some extent.
