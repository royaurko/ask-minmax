In this paper, we propose a heuristic for the graph isomorphism problem that
is based on the eigendecomposition of the adjacency matrices. It is well known,
that the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices of isomorphic graphs need to be
identical. However, two graphs $ G_A $ and $ G_B $ can be isospectral but
non-isomorphic. If the graphs possess repeated eigenvalues, which typically
correspond to graph symmetries, finding isomorphisms is much harder. By
repeatedly perturbing the adjacency matrices, it is possible to break
symmetries of the graphs without changing the isomorphism and to assign
vertices of $ G_A $ to vertices of $ G_B $, provided that an admissible
assignment exists. This heuristic approach can be used to construct a
permutation which transforms $ G_A $ into $ G_B $ if the graphs are isomorphic,
or to show that no isomorphism exists.
