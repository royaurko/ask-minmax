We present two novel approaches for the computation of the exact distribution
of a pattern in a long sequence. Both approaches take into account the sparse
structure of the problem and are two-part algorithms. The first approach relies
on a partial recursion after a fast computation of the second largest
eigenvalue of the transition matrix of a Markov chain embedding. The second
approach uses fast Taylor expansions of an exact bivariate rational
reconstruction of the distribution. We illustrate the interest of both
approaches on a simple toy-example and two biological applications: the
transcription factors of the Human Chromosome 5 and the PROSITE signatures of
functional motifs in proteins. On these example our methods demonstrate their
complementarity and their hability to extend the domain of feasibility for
exact computations in pattern problems to a new level.
