The allocation problem for multivariate stratified random sampling as a
problem of stochastic matrix integer mathematical programming is considered.
With these aims the asymptotic normality of sample covariance matrices for each
strata is established. Some alternative approaches are suggested for its
solution. An example is solved by applying the proposed techniques.
