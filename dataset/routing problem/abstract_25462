Annotation A carbon nanotubes (CNT) filled polymer nanocomposites with their
unique physical, mechanical and electro-optical properties has repeatedly
discussed in the literature. The main part of this problem is to obtain high
quality dispersion of CNTs. If for water-soluble polymers this problem can be
considered as solved, it is not so for hydrophobic polymers, and PVC is an
important example of this kind. This paper describes the methods of dispersion
of SWNTs bundles in PVC, both by the use of specially synthesized surfactants,
and by means of chemical surface modification of CNTs. The main criterion for
an obtaining of a high degree of dispersion in our experiments is considered
the sedimentation stability of non-aqueous organic colloidal solutions, which
is essentially necessary for the polymer composites films preparation by
solution casting method.
