Bit retrieval, the problem of determining a binary sequence from its cyclic
autocorrelation, is a special case of the phase retrieval problem. Algorithms
for phase retrieval are extensively used in several scientific disciplines, and
yet, very little is known about the complexity of these algorithms or phase
retrieval in general. Here we show that bit retrieval, in particular, is
closely related to computations that arise in algebraic number theory and can
also be formulated as an integer program. We find that general purpose
algorithms from these fields, when applied to bit retrieval, are outperformed
by a particular iterative phase retrieval algorithm. This algorithm still has
exponential complexity and motivates us to propose a new public key signature
scheme based on the intractability of bit retrieval, and image watermarking as
a possible application.
