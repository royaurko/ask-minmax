We develop the Inverse Scattering Transform (IST) method for the
Degasperis-Procesi equation. The spectral problem is an $\mathfrak{sl}(3)$
Zakharov-Shabat problem with constant boundary conditions and finite reduction
group. The basic aspects of the IST such as the construction of fundamental
analytic solutions, the formulation of a Riemann-Hilbert problem, and the
implementation of the dressing method are presented.
