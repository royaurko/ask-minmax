Given two genomes with duplicate genes, \textsc{Zero Exemplar Distance} is
the problem of deciding whether the two genomes can be reduced to the same
genome without duplicate genes by deleting all but one copy of each gene in
each genome. Blin, Fertin, Sikora, and Vialette recently proved that
\textsc{Zero Exemplar Distance} for monochromosomal genomes is NP-hard even if
each gene appears at most two times in each genome, thereby settling an
important open question on genome rearrangement in the exemplar model. In this
paper, we give a very simple alternative proof of this result. We also study
the problem \textsc{Zero Exemplar Distance} for multichromosomal genomes
without gene order, and prove the analogous result that it is also NP-hard even
if each gene appears at most two times in each genome. For the positive
direction, we show that both variants of \textsc{Zero Exemplar Distance} admit
polynomial-time algorithms if each gene appears exactly once in one genome and
at least once in the other genome. In addition, we present a polynomial-time
algorithm for the related problem \textsc{Exemplar Longest Common Subsequence}
in the special case that each mandatory symbol appears exactly once in one
input sequence and at least once in the other input sequence. This answers an
open question of Bonizzoni et al. We also show that \textsc{Zero Exemplar
Distance} for multichromosomal genomes without gene order is fixed-parameter
tractable if the parameter is the maximum number of chromosomes in each genome.
