The convergence properties of two perturbative schemes to sum the so-called
folded diagrams are critically reviewed, with an emphasis on the intruder state
problem. The methods we study are the approaches of Kuo and co-workers and Lee
and Suzuki. The suitability of the two schemes for shell-model calculations are
discussed.
