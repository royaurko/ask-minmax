The characteristic property of the $Z_2\times Z_2$ orbifold is its cyclic
permutation symmetry. It is argued that this property may be instrumental in
explaining simultaneously the fermion mass hierarchy and the squark mass
degeneracy. Detailed studies in free fermionic models that preserve the cyclic
permutation symmetry of anomalous U(1) charges of the three generations are
discussed.
