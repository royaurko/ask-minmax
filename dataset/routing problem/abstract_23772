This paper proves a theorem about bounding orbits of a time dependent
dynamical system. The maps that are involved are examples in convex dynamics,
by which we mean the dynamics of piecewise isometries where the pieces are
convex. The theorem came to the attention of the contributors in connection with the
problem of digital halftoning. \textit{Digital halftoning} is a family of
printing technologies for getting full color images from only a few different
colors deposited at dots all of the same size. The simplest version consist in
obtaining grey scale images from only black and white dots. A corollary of the
theorem is that for \textit{error diffusion}, one of the methods of digital
halftoning, averages of colors of the printed dots converge to averages of the
colors taken from the same dots of the actual images. Digital printing is a
special case of a much wider class of scheduling problems to which the theorem
applies. Convex dynamics has roots in classical areas of mathematics such as
symbolic dynamics, Diophantine approximation, and the theory of uniform
distributions.
