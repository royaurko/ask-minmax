We study a one-dimensional free-boundary problem describing the penetration
of carbonation fronts (free reaction-triggered interfaces) in concrete. A
couple of decades ago, it was observed experimentally that the penetration
depth versus time curve (say $s(t)$ vs. $t$) behaves like $s(t)=C\sqrt{t}$ for
sufficiently large times $t > 0$ (with $C$ a positive constant). Consequently,
many fitting arguments solely based on this experimental law were used to
predict the large-time behavior of carbonation fronts in real structures, a
theoretical justification of the $\sqrt{t}$-law being lacking until now. %This
is the place where our paper contributes:
  The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by justifying rigorously the
experimentally guessed asymptotic behavior. We have previously proven the upper
bound $s(t)\leq C'\sqrt{t}$ for some constant $C'$; now we show the optimality
of the rate by proving the right nontrivial lower estimate, i.e. there exists
$C">0$ such that $s(t)\geq C"\sqrt{t}$. Additionally, we obtain weak solutions
to the free-boundary problem for the case when the measure of the initial
domain vanishes. In this way, our mathematical model is now allowing for the
appearance of a moving carbonation front -- a scenario that until was hard to
handle from the analysis point of view.
