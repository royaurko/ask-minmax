A catadioptric sensor induces a projection between a given object surface and
an image plane. The prescribed projection problem is the problem of finding a
catadioptric sensor that realizes a given projection. Here we present a
functional that describes the image error induced by a given mirror when
compared with a given projection. This expression can be minimized to find
solutions to the prescribed projection problem. We present an example of this
approach, by finding the optimum spherical mirror that serves as a passenger
side mirror on a motor vehicle.
