The problem of asymptotic expansions of Green functions in perturbative QFT
is studied for the class of Euclidean asymptotic regimes. Phenomenological
applications are analyzed to obtain a meaningful mathematical formulation of
the problem. It is shown that the problem reduces to studying asymptotic
expansions of products of a class of singular functions in the sense of the
distribution theory. Existence, uniqueness and explicit expressions for such
expansions ("asymptotic operation for products of singular functions") in
dimensionally regularized form are obtained using the so-called extension
principle.
