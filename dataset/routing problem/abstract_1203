We demonstrate the first quasi-CW (ms-long pulses, pump duty cycle of 10%)
end-diode pumped solid state laser generating eye-safe radiation via
intracavity Raman conversion. The output power at the first Stokes wavelength
(1524 nm) was 250 mW. A theoretical model was applied to analyze the laser
system and provide routes for optimization. The possibility of true CW
operation was discussed.
