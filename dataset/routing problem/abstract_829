Employing a rigorous theoretical method for the construction of exact
many-electron ground states we prove that interactions can be employed to tune
a bare dispersive band structure such that it develops a flat band. Thereby we
show that pentagon chain polymers with electron densities above half filling
may be designed to become ferromagnetic or half metallic.
