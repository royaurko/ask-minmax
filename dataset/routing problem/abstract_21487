We investigate the high resolution coding problem for solutions of stochastic
differential equations in the L^p[0,1]- and the C[0,1]-space. Tight asymptotic
estimates are found under weak regularity assumptions. The main technical tool
is a decoupling method which allows us to relate the complexity of the
diffusion process to that of the Wiener process under certain random
distortions.
