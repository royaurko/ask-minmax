Quantum Mechanics of the Early Universe is considered as deformation of a
well-known Quantum Mechanics. Similar to previous works of the contributor, the
principal approach is based on deformation of the density matrix with
concurrent development of the wave function deformation in the respective
Schr{\"o}dinger picture, the associated deformation parameter being interpreted
as a new small parameter. It is demonstrated that the existence of black holes
in the suggested approach in the end twice causes nonunitary transitions
resulting in the unitarity. In parallel this problem is considered in other
terms: entropy density, Heisenberg algebra deformation terms, respective
deformations of Statistical Mechanics, - all showing the identity of the basic
results. From this an explicit solution for Hawking's informaion paradox has
been derived.
