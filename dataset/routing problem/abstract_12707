We study the limit as $\e\to 0$ of the entropy solutions of the equation
$\p_t \ue + \dv_x[A(\frac{x}{\e},\ue)] =0$. We prove that the sequence $\ue$
two-scale converges towards a function $u(t,x,y)$, and $u$ is the unique
solution of a limit evolution problem. The remarkable point is that the limit
problem is not a scalar conservation law, but rather a kinetic equation in
which the macroscopic and microscopic variables are mixed. We also prove a
strong convergence result in $L^1_{\text{loc}}$.
