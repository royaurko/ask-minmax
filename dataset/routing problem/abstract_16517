We revisit the question of whether fluctuations in hydrodynamical,
adiabatical matter could explain the observed structures in our Universe. We
consider matter with variable equation of state $w=p_0/\ep_0$ and a concomitant
(under the adiabatic assumption) density dependent speed of sound, $c_s$. We
find a limited range of possibilities for a set up when modes start inside the
Hubble radius, then leaving it and freezing out. For expanding Universes,
power-law $w(\ep_0)$ models are ruled out (except when $c_s^2\propto w \ll 1$,
requiring post-stretching the seeded fluctuations); but sharper profiles in
$c_s$ do solve the horizon problem. Among these, a phase transition in $c_s$ is
notable for leading to scale-invariant fluctuations if the initial conditions
are thermal. For contracting Universes all power-law $w(\ep_0)$ solve the
horizon problem, but only one leads to scale-invariance: $w\propto \ep_0^2$ and
$c_s\propto \ep_0$. This model bypasses a number of problems with single scalar
field cyclic models (for which $w$ is large but constant).
