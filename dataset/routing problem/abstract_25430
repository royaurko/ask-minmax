We study a Helmholtz-type spectral problem in a two-dimensional medium
consisting of a fully periodic background structure and a perturbation in form
of a line defect. The defect is aligned along one of the coordinate axes,
periodic in that direction (with the same periodicity as the background), and
bounded in the other direction. This setting models a so-called "soft-wall"
waveguide problem. We show that there are no bound states, i.e., the spectrum
of the operator under study contains no point spectrum.
