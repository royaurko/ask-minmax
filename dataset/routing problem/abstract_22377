Multiplicity codes are algebraic error-correcting codes generalizing
classical polynomial evaluation codes, and are based on evaluating polynomials
and their derivatives. This small augmentation confers upon them better local
decoding, list-decoding and local list-decoding algorithms than their classical
counterparts. We survey what is known about these codes, present some
variations and improvements, and finally list some interesting open problems.
