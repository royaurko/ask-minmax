We show that a first order perturbation $A(x)\cdot D+q(x)$ of the
polyharmonic operator $(-\Delta)^m$, $m\ge 2$, can be determined uniquely from
the set of the Cauchy data for the perturbed polyharmonic operator on a bounded
domain in $R^n$, $n\ge 3$. Notice that the corresponding result does not hold
in general when $m=1$.
