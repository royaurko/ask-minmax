The Orr-Sommerfeld equation is a spectral problem which is known to play an
important role in hydrodynamic stability. For an appropriate operator
theoretical realization of the equation, we will determine the essential
spectrum, and calculate an enclosure of the set of all eigenvalues by
elementary analytical means.
