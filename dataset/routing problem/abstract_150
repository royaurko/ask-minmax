The current paper introduces a new parallel computing technique based on ant
colony optimization for a dynamic routing problem. In the dynamic traveling
salesman problem the distances between cities as travel times are no longer
fixed. The new technique uses a parallel model for a problem variant that
allows a slight movement of nodes within their Neighborhoods. The algorithm is
tested with success on several large data sets.
