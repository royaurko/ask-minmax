In this paper, we use (bi)semicosimplicial language to study the classical
problem of infinitesimal deformations of a closed subscheme in a fixed smooth
variety, defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. In
particular, we give an explicit description of the differential graded Lie
algebra controlling this problem.
