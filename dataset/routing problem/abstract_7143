We consider the problem of integration of d-variate analytic functions
defined on the unit cube with directional derivatives of all orders bounded by
1. We prove that the Clenshaw Curtis Smolyak algorithm leads to weak
tractability of the problem. This seems to be the first positive tractability
result for the Smolyak algorithm for a normalized and unweighted problem. The
space of integrands is not a tensor product space and therefore we have to
develop a different proof technique. We use the polynomial exactness of the
algorithm as well as an explicit bound on the operator norm of the algorithm.
