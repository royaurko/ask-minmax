Collage systems are a general framework for representing outputs of various
text compression algorithms. We consider the all $q$-gram frequency problem on
compressed string represented as a collage system, and present an $O((q+h\log
n)n)$-time $O(qn)$-space algorithm for calculating the frequencies for all
$q$-grams that occur in the string. Here, $n$ and $h$ are respectively the size
and height of the collage system.
