We investigate the initial value problem for a defocusing nonlinear
Schr\"odingerequation with exponential nonlinearity. We identify subcritical,
critical and supercritical regimes in the energy space. We establish global
well-posedness in the subcritical and critical regimes. Well-posedness fails to
hold in the supercritical case.
