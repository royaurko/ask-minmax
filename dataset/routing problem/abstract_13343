The purpose of this article is to describe a reduction of the slicing problem
to the study of the parameter I_1(K,Z_q^o(K))=\int_K ||< :, x> ||_{L_q(K)}dx.
We show that an upper bound of the form I_1(K,Z_q^o(K))\leq
C_1q^s\sqrt{n}L_K^2, with 1/2\leq s\leq 1, leads to the estimate L_n\leq
\frac{C_2\sqrt[4]{n}log(n)} {q^{(1-s)/2}}, where L_n:= max {L_K : K is an
isotropic convex body in R^n}.
