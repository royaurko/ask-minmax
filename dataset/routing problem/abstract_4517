In this paper, the stabilized finite element method based on local projection
is applied to discretize the Stokes eigenvalue problems and the corresponding
convergence analysis is given. Furthermore, we also use a method to improve the
convergence rate for the eigenpair approximations of the Stokes eigenvalue
problem. It is based on a postprocessing strategy that contains solving an
additional Stokes source problem on an augmented finite element space which can
be constructed either by refining the mesh or by using the same mesh but
increasing the order of mixed finite element space. Numerical examples are
given to confirm the theoretical analysis.
