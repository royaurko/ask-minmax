We consider the problem of multiclass road sign detection using a
classification function with multiplicative kernel comprised from two kernels.
We show that problems of detection and within-foreground classification can be
jointly solved by using one kernel to measure object-background differences and
another one to account for within-class variations. The main idea behind this
approach is that road signs from different foreground variations can share
features that discriminate them from backgrounds. The classification function
training is accomplished using SVM, thus feature sharing is obtained through
support vector sharing. Training yields a family of linear detectors, where
each detector corresponds to a specific foreground training sample. The
redundancy among detectors is alleviated using k-medoids clustering. Finally,
we report detection and classification results on a set of road sign images
obtained from a camera on a moving vehicle.
