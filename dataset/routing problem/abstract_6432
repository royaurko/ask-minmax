Poincar\'e gauge theory of gravity offers opportunities to solve some
principal problems of general relativity theory and modern cosmology. In the
frame of this theory the gravitational interaction can have the repulsion
character in the case of usual gravitating matter with positive values of
energy density and pressure satisfying energy dominance condition. Cosmological
consequences of gravitational repulsion are considered in the case of
homogeneous isotropic models in connection with the problem of cosmological
singularity and dark energy problem of general relativity theory. Regular Big
Bang inflationary scenario with accelerating stage of cosmological expansion at
asymptotics and the principal role of space-time torsion in this scenario are
discussed.
