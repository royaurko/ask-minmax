Electrodynamic spherical harmonic is a second rank tensor in
three-dimensional space. It allows to separate the radial and angle variables
in vector solutions of Maxwell's equations. Using the orthonormalization for
electrodynamic spherical harmonic, a boundary problem on a sphere can be easily
solved.
