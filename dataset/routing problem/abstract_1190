We show that the interplay between charging effects and the non-equilibrium
spin accumulation has a dramatic effect in the current through an array of
nanostructures attached to ferromagnetic electrodes. Large oscillations in the
current as a function of bias voltage show up for parallel orientation of the
electrodes' magnetizations. These oscillations originate in the inhomogeneity
of the spin potentials through the array and correlate with oscillations in the
spin accumulation. For antiparallel orientation the spin potential is
homogeneous and the oscillations do not show up.This sensitivity results in a
huge enhancement of the tunneling magnetoresistance as compared to the
single-island case, and open new routes for improving the spintronic response
of nanodevices.
