We consider the question of existence of ramified covers over P_1 matching
certain prescribed ramification conditions. This problem has already been faced
in a number of papers, but we discuss alternative approaches for an existence
proof, involving elliptic curves and universal ramified covers with signature.
We also relate the geometric problem with finite permutation groups and with
the Fermat-Euler Theorem on the representation of a prime as a sum of two
squares.
