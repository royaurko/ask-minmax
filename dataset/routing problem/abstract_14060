We consider variants of the following multi-covering problem with disks. We
are given two point sets $Y$ (servers) and $X$ (clients) in the plane, a
coverage function $\kappa :X \rightarrow \mathcal{N}$, and a constant $\alpha
\geq 1$. Centered at each server is a single disk whose radius we are free to
set. The requirement is that each client $x \in X$ be covered by at least
$\kappa(x)$ of the server disks. The objective function we wish to minimize is
the sum of the $\alpha$-th powers of the disk radii. We present a polynomial
time algorithm for this problem achieving an $O(1)$ approximation.
