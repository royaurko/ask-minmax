The multi-armed bandit problem is a popular model for studying
exploration/exploitation trade-off in sequential decision problems. Many
algorithms are now available for this well-studied problem. One of the earliest
algorithms, given by W. R. Thompson, dates back to 1933. This algorithm,
referred to as Thompson Sampling, is a natural Bayesian algorithm. The basic
idea is to choose an arm to play according to its probability of being the best
arm. Thompson Sampling algorithm has experimentally been shown to be close to
optimal. In addition, it is efficient to implement and exhibits several
desirable properties such as small regret for delayed feedback. However,
theoretical understanding of this algorithm was quite limited. In this paper,
for the first time, we show that Thompson Sampling algorithm achieves
logarithmic expected regret for the multi-armed bandit problem. More precisely,
for the two-armed bandit problem, the expected regret in time $T$ is
$O(\frac{\ln T}{\Delta} + \frac{1}{\Delta^3})$. And, for the $N$-armed bandit
problem, the expected regret in time $T$ is $O([(\sum_{i=2}^N
\frac{1}{\Delta_i^2})^2] \ln T)$. Our bounds are optimal but for the dependence
on $\Delta_i$ and the constant factors in big-Oh.
