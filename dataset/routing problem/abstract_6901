We consider a class of finite Markov moment problems with arbitrary number of
positive and negative branches. We show criteria for the existence and
uniqueness of solutions, and we characterize in detail the non-unique solution
families. Moreover, we present a constructive algorithm to solve the moment
problems numerically and prove that the algorithm computes the right solution.
