In this paper we present a rare combination of abstract results on the
spectral properties of slanted matrices and some of their very specific
applications to frame theory and sampling problems. We show that for a large
class of slanted matrices boundedness below of the corresponding operator in
$\ell^p$ for some $p$ implies boundedness below in $\ell^p$ for all $p$. We use
the established resultto enrich our understanding of Banach frames and obtain
new results for irregular sampling problems. We also present a version of a
non-commutative Wiener's lemma for slanted matrices.
