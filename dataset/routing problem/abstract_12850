We introduce a new class of graphs which we call P-transitive graphs, lying
between transitive and 3-transitive graphs. First we show that the analogue of
de Jongh-Sambin Theorem is false for wellfounded P-transitive graphs; then we
show that the mu-calculus fixpoint hierarchy is infinite for P-transitive
graphs. Both results contrast with the case of transitive graphs. We give also
an undecidability result for an enriched mu-calculus on P-transitive graphs.
Finally, we consider a polynomial time reduction from the model checking
problem on arbitrary graphs to the model checking problem on P-transitive
graphs. All these results carry over to 3-transitive graphs.
