We study the following boundary value problem with a concave-convex
nonlinearity: \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{r c l l} -\Delta_p u & =
& \Lambda\,u^{q-1}+ u^{r-1} & \textrm{in }\Omega, \\ u & = & 0 & \textrm{on
}\partial\Omega. \end{array}\right. \end{equation*} Here $\Omega \subset
\mathbb{R}^n$ is a bounded domain and $1<q<p<r<p^*$. It is well known that
there exists a number $\Lambda_{q,r}>0$ such that the problem admits at least
two positive solutions for $0<\Lambda<\Lambda_{q,r}$, at least one positive
solution for $\Lambda=\Lambda_{q,r}$, and no positive solution for $\Lambda >
\Lambda_{q,r}$. We show that \[ \lim_{q \to p} \Lambda_{q,r} = \lambda_1(p), \]
where $\lambda_1(p)$ is the first eigenvalue of the p-laplacian. It is worth
noticing that $\lambda_1(p)$ is the threshold for existence/nonexistence of
positive solutions to the above problem in the limit case $q=p$.
