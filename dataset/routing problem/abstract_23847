In this paper we have performed second order normalization in the generalised
photogravitaional restricted three body problem with Poynting-Robertson drag.
We have performed Birkhoff's normalization of the Hamiltonian. For this we have
utilised Henrard's method and expanded the coordinates of the third body in
Double d'Alembert series. We have found the values of first and second order
components. The second order components are obtained as solutions of the two
partial differential equations. We have employed the first condition of KAM
theorem in solving these equations. The first and second order components are
affected by radiation pressure, oblateness and P-R drag. Finaly we obtained the
third order part $H_3$ of the Hamiltonian in $I_1^{1/2}I_2^{1/2}$ zero.
