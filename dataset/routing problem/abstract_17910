We devise a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the classical geometric
problem of finding an approximate short path amid weighted regions. In this
problem, a triangulated region P comprising of n vertices, a positive weight
associated with each triangle, and two points s and t that belong to P are
given as the input. The objective is to find a path whose cost is at most
(1+\epsilon)OPT where OPT is the cost of an optimal path between s and t. Our
algorithm initiates a discretized-Dijkstra wavefront from source s and
progresses the wavefront till it strikes t. This result is about a cubic factor
(in $n$) improvement over the Mitchell and Papadimitriou '91 result, which is
the only known polynomial time algorithm for this problem to date.
