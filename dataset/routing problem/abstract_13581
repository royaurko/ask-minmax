The problem of advancing coordinatization of mathematics is considered. The
need to develop a theory for measuring value and complexity of mathematical
implications and proofs is discussed including motivations, benefits and
implementation problems. Examples of mathematical considerations for such a
theory are given. Arguments supporting such an advance related to applications
in mathematical research guidance, publication standards and education are
given.
