Complex orthogonal designs (CODs) are used to construct space-time block
codes. COD $\mathcal{O}_z$ with parameter $[p, n, k]$ is a $p\times n$ matrix,
where nonzero entries are filled by $\pm z_i$ or $\pm z^*_i$, $i = 1, 2,...,
k$, such that $\mathcal{O}^H_z \mathcal{O}_z =
(|z_1|^2+|z_2|^2+...+|z_k|^2)I_{n \times n}$. Adams et al. in "The final case
of the decoding delay problem for maximum rate complex orthogonal designs,"
IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 56, no. 1, pp. 103-122, Jan. 2010, first proved
the nonexistence of $[\binom{2m}{m-1}, 2m, \binom{2m-1}{m-1}]$, $m$ odd, COD.
Combining with the previous result that decoding delay should be an integer
multiple of $\binom{2m}{m-1}$, they solved the final case $n \equiv 2 \pmod 4$
of the decoding delay problem for maximum rate complex orthogonal designs.
  In this paper, we give another proof of the nonexistence of COD with
parameter $[\binom{2m}{m-1}, 2m, \binom{2m-1}{m-1}]$, $m$ odd. Our new proof is
based on the uniqueness of $[\binom{2m}{m-1}, 2m-1, \binom{2m-1}{m-1}]$ under
equivalence operation, where an explicit-form representation is proposed to
help the proof. Then, by proving it's impossible to add an extra orthogonal
column on COD $[\binom{2m}{m-1}, 2m-1, \binom{2m-1}{m-1}]$ when $m$ is odd, we
complete the proof of the nonexistence of COD $[\binom{2m}{m-1}, 2m,
\binom{2m-1}{m-1}]$.
