Given a set of n balls each colored with a color, a ball is said to be
majority, k-majority, plurality if its color class has size larger than half of
the number of balls, has size at least k, has size larger than any other color
class; respectively. We address the problem of finding the minimum number of
queries (a comparison of a pair of balls if they have the same color or not)
that is needed to decide whether a majority, k-majority or plurality ball
exists and if so then show one such ball. We consider both adaptive and
non-adaptive strategies and in certain cases, we also address weighted versions
of the problems.
