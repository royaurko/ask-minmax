The Vertex Separator Problem (VSP) on a graph is the problem of finding the
smallest collection of vertices whose removal separates the graph into two
disjoint subsets of roughly equal size. Recently, Hager and Hungerford [1]
developed a continuous bilinear programming formulation of the VSP. In this
paper, we reinforce the bilinear programming approach with a multilevel scheme
for learning the structure of the graph.
