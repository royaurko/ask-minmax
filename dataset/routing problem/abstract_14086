In the "Game about Squares" the task is to push unit squares on an integer
lattice onto corresponding dots. A square can only be moved into one given
direction. When a square is pushed onto a lattice point with an arrow the
direction of the square adopts the direction of the arrow. Moreover, squares
can push other squares. In this paper we study the decision problem, whether
all squares can be moved onto their corresponding dots by a finite number of
pushes. We prove that this problem is NP-hard.
