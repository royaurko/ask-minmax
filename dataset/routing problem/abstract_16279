This thesis deals with the averaging problem in cosmology, which has gained
considerable interest in recent years, and is concerned with correction terms
(after averaging inhomogeneities) that appear in the Einstein equations when
working on the large scales appropriate for cosmology. It has been claimed in
the literature that these terms may account for the phenomenon of dark energy
which causes the late time universe to accelerate. We investigate the nature of
these terms by using averaging schemes available in the literature and further
developed to be applicable to the problem at hand. We show that the effect of
these terms when calculated carefully, remains negligible and cannot explain
the late time acceleration.
