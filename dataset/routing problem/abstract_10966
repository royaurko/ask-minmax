The N-vortex solutions to the two-dimensional Ginzburg - Landau equations for
the kappa=1/\sqrt(2) parameter are built. The exact solutions are derived for
the vortices with large numbers of the magnetic flux quanta. The size of vortex
core is supposed to be much greater than the magnetic field penetration depth.
In this limiting case the problem is reduced to the determination of vortex
core shape. The corresponding nonlinear boundary problem is solved by means of
the methods of the theory of analytic functions.
