We consider the following search problem. Given a graph $G$ with a vertex $s$
there is an unknown path starting from $s$. In one query we ask a vertex $v$
and the answer is the set of edges of the path incident to $v$. We want to
determine what is the minimal number of queries needed to find the other
endvertex of the path. We consider different variants of this problem and
examine their relations. We prove a strong connection between this problem and
the theory of graph separators. Finally, we consider the case when the graph
$G$ is a grid graph, in which case using the connection with separators, we
give asymptotically tight bounds (as a function of the size of the grid $n$, in
case the dimension of the grid $d$ is considered to be fixed) for variants of
the above search problem. For this we prove a separator theorem about grid
graphs. This search problem is a discrete variant of a problem of Hirsch,
Papadimitriou and Vavasis about finding Brouwer fixed points, in particular in
the discrete setting our results improve their results.
