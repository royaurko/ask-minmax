We solve the Picard number problem for complex quintic surfaces by proving
that every number between 1 and 45 occurs as Picard number of a quintic surface
over the rationals. Our main technique consists in arithmetic deformations of
Delsarte surfaces, but we also use K3 surfaces and wild automorphisms.
