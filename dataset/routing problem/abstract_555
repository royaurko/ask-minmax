In-network caching is one of the fundamental operations of
Information-centric networks (ICN). The default caching strategy taken by most
of the current ICN proposals is caching along--default--path, which makes
popular objects to be cached redundantly across the network, resulting in a low
utilization of available cache space. On the other hand, efficient use of
network-wide cache space requires possible cooperation among caching routers
without the use of excessive signaling burden. While most of the cache
optimization efforts strive to improve the latency and the overall traffic
efficiency, we have taken a different path in this work and improved the
storage efficiency of the cache space so that it is utilized to its most.
  In this work we discuss the ICN caching problem, and propose a novel
distributed architecture to efficiently use the network-wide cache storage
space based on distributed caching. The proposal achieves cache retention
efficiency by means of controlled traffic redirection and selective caching. We
utilize the ICN mechanisms and routing protocol messages for decision making,
thus reducing the overall signaling need. Our proposal achieves almost 9-fold
increase in cache storage efficiency, and around 20% increase in server load
reduction when compared to the classic caching methods used in contemporary ICN
proposals.
