This paper introduces a new recovery-based a posteriori error estimator for
the lowest order Nedelec finite element approximation to the H(curl) interface
problem. The error estimator is analyzed by establishing both the reliability
and the efficiency bounds and is supported by numerical results. Under certain
assumptions, it is proved that the reliability and efficiency constants are
independent of the jumps of the coefficients.
