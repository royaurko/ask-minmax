In this note, we consider the truncated Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion for
approximating solutions to infinite dimensional inverse problems. We show that,
under certain conditions, the bound of the error between a solution and its
finite-dimensional approximation can be estimated without the knowledge of the
solution.
