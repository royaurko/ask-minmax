We present evidence of the existence of a 1D, N = 16 SUSY hologram that can
be used to understand representation theory aspects of a 4D, N = 4
supersymmetrical vector multiplet. In this context, the long-standing off-shell
"SUSY problem" for the 4D, N = 4 Maxwell supermultiplet is precisely formulated
as a problem in linear algebra.
