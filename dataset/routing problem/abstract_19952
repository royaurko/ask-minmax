General issues concerning the regularization of supersymmetric theories using
dimensional regularization and dimensional reduction are reviewed. Recent
progress on problems of dimensional reduction related to factorization,
supersymmetry, Higgs boson mass calculations, and mathematical consistency is
discussed.
