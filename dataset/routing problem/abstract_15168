We investigate uniqueness in the inverse problem of reconstructing
simultaneously a spacewise conductivity function and a heat source in the
parabolic heat equation from the usual conditions of the direct problem and
additional information from a supplementary temperature measurement at a given
single instant of time. In the multi-dimensional case, we use Carleman
estimates for parabolic equations to obtain a uniqueness result. The given data
and the solution domain are sufficiently smooth such that the required norms
and the derivatives of the conductivity, the source and the solution of the
parabolic heat equation exist and are continuous throughout the solution
domain. These assumptions can be further relaxed using more involved estimates
and techniques but these lengthy details are not included. Instead, in the
special case of the one-dimensional heat equation, we give an alternative and
rather straightforward proof of uniqueness of the inverse problem, based on
integral representations of the solution together with density results for
solutions of the corresponding adjoint problem. In this case, the required
regularity conditions on the conductivity, source and the solution of the
parabolic heat equation are weakened to classes of integrable functions.
