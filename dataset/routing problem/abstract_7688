A critical review of the very long-standing problem of the diffuse
interstellar bands is presented with emphasis on spectroscopic aspects of
observational, modelling and laboratory-based research. Some research themes
and ideas that could be explored theoretically and experimentally are
discussed. The article is based on the Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy Review
Lecture presented at the 60th Ohio State University International Symposium on
Molecular Spectroscopy, June 2005.
