We provide a detailed treatment of relativistic Lotka-Volterra hierarchy and
a kind of initial value problem with special emphasis on its the theta function
representation of all algebro-geometric solutions. The basic tools involve
hyperelliptic curve $\mathcal{K}_n$ associated with the Burchnall-Chaundy
polynomial, Dubrovin-type equations for auxiliary divisors and associated trace
formulas. With the help of a foundamental meromorphic function $\tilde{\phi}$
on $\mathcal{K}_p$ and trace formulas, the complex-valued algebro-geometric
solutions of of RLV hierarchy are derived.
