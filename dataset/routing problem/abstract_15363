Mumford-Shah and Potts functionals are powerful variational models for
regularization which are widely used in signal and image processing; typical
applications are edge-preserving denoising and segmentation. Being both
non-smooth and non-convex, they are computationally challenging even for scalar
data. For manifold-valued data, the problem becomes even more involved since
typical features of vector spaces are not available. In this paper, we propose
algorithms for Mumford-Shah and for Potts regularization of manifold-valued
signals and images. For the univariate problems, we derive solvers based on
dynamic programming combined with (convex) optimization techniques for
manifold-valued data. For the class of Cartan-Hadamard manifolds (which
includes the data space in diffusion tensor imaging), we show that our
algorithms compute global minimizers for any starting point. For the
multivariate Mumford-Shah and Potts problems (for image regularization) we
propose a splitting into suitable subproblems which we can solve exactly using
the techniques developed for the corresponding univariate problems. Our method
does not require any a priori restrictions on the edge set and we do not have
to discretize the data space. We apply our method to diffusion tensor imaging
(DTI) as well as Q-ball imaging. Using the DTI model, we obtain a segmentation
of the corpus callosum.
