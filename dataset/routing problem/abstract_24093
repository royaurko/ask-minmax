A comparison is made between bispectral systems and dual isomonodromic
deformation equations. A number of examples are given, showing how bispectral
systems may be embedded into isomonodromic ones. Sufficiency conditions are
given for the construction of rational solutions of isomonodromic deformation
equations through the Riemann-Hilbert problem dressing method, and these are
shown, in certain cases, to reduce to bispectral systems.
