We consider the problem of finding commuting self-adjoint extensions of the
partial derivatives {(1/i)(\partial/\partial x_j):j=1,...,d} with domain
C_c^\infty(\Omega) where the self-adjointness is defined relative to
L^2(\Omega), and \Omega is a given open subset of R^d. The measure on \Omega is
Lebesgue measure on R^d restricted to \Omega. The problem originates with I.E.
Segal and B. Fuglede, and is difficult in general. In this paper, we provide a
representation-theoretic answer in the special case when \Omega=I\times\Omega_2
and I is an open interval. We then apply the results to the case when \Omega is
a d-cube, I^d, and we describe possible subsets \Lambda of R^d such that
{e^(i2\pi\lambda \dot x) restricted to I^d:\lambda\in\Lambda} is an orthonormal
basis in L^2(I^d).
