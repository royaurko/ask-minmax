The source of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) is still an unresolved
mystery. Up until recently, sources of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) had been
considered as a suitable source for UHECR. Within the fireball model, the UHECR
produced at GRBs should be accompanied with a neutrino flux detectable at the
neutrino telescope such as IceCube. Recently, IceCube has set an upper bound on
the neutrino flux accompanied by GRBs about 3.7 times below the prediction. We
investigate whether this deficit can be explained by the oscillation of the
active neutrinos to sterile neutrinos en route from the source to the detectors
within the pseudo-Dirac scenario. We then discuss the implication of this
scenario for diffuse supernova relic neutrinos.
