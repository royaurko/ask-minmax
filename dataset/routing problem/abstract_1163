We propose a spin polarized Talbot effect for an electron beam scattered from
a grating of magnetic nanostructures. Existing periodic magnetic nanostructures
can be used in conjunction with electron-beam illumination to create a spin
polarized replica of the transversely periodic exit surface beam a Talbot
length away. Experiments have been proposed to verify the effect in a two
dimensional electron gas and an atomically flat surface by spin polarized
scanning probe microscopy. This effect provides a new route to modulate
electron spin distributions in two dimensional space.
