In this paper the scattering matrix of a scattering system consisting of two
selfadjoint operators with finite dimensional resolvent difference is expressed
in terms of a matrix Nevanlinna function. The problem is embedded into an
extension theoretic framework and the theory of boundary triplets and
associated Weyl functions for (in general nondensely defined) symmetric
operators is applied. The representation results are extended to dissipative
scattering systems and an explicit solution of an inverse scattering problem
for the Lax-Phillips scattering matrix is presented.
