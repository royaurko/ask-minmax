In this review we discuss how the models of neutrino masses can accommodate
solutions to the problem of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe, dark
energy or cosmological constant problem and dark matter candidates. The
matter-antimatter asymmetry is explained by leptogenesis, originating from the
lepton number violation associated with the neutrino masses. The dark energy
problem is correlated with a mass varying neutrinos, which could originate from
a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson. In some radiative models of neutrino masses,
there exists a Higgs doublet that does not acquire any vacuum expectation
value. This field could be inert and the lightest inert particle could then be
a dark matter candidate. We reviewed these scenarios in connection with models
of neutrino masses with right-handed neutrinos and with triplet Higgs scalars.
