The existence problem for holomorphic structures on vector bundles over
non-algebraic surfaces is in general still open. We solve this problem in the
case of rank 2 vector bundles over K3 surfaces and in the case of vector
bundles of arbitrary rank over all known surfaces of class VII. Our methods,
which are based on Donaldson theory and deformation theory, can be used to
solve the existence problem of holomorphic vector bundles on further classes of
non-algebraic surfaces.
