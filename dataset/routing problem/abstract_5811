This article considers the problem of solving a system of $n$ real polynomial
equations in $n+1$ variables. We propose an algorithm based on Newton's method
and subdivision for this problem. Our algorithm is intended only for
nondegenerate cases, in which case the solution is a 1-dimensional curve. Our
first main contribution is a definition of a condition number measuring
reciprocal distance to degeneracy that can distinguish poor and well
conditioned instances of this problem. (Degenerate problems would be infinitely
ill conditioned in our framework.) Our second contribution, which is the main
novelty of our algorithm, is an analysis showing that its running time is
bounded in terms of the condition number of the problem instance as well as $n$
and the polynomial degrees.
