In the paper we consider singular spectral Sturm--Liouville problem
$-(py')'+(q-\lambda r)y=0$, $(U-1)y^{\vee}+i(U+1)y^{\wedge}=0$, where function
$p\in L_{\infty}[0,1]$ is uniformly positive, generalized function $q\in
W_2^{-1}[0,1]$ is real-valued, generalized weight function $r\in W_2^{-1}[0,1]$
is positive and unitary matrix $U\in\mathbb C^{2\times 2}$ is diagonal. The
goal is to prove that well-known (for smooth case) facts about Chebyshev
property of eigenfunctions hold in general case.
