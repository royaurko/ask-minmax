We develop a framework to give upper bounds on the "practical" computational
complexity of stability problems for a wide range of nonlinear continuous and
hybrid systems. To do so, we describe stability properties of dynamical systems
using first-order formulas over the real numbers, and reduce stability problems
to the delta-decision problems of these formulas. The framework allows us to
obtain a precise characterization of the complexity of different notions of
stability for nonlinear continuous and hybrid systems. We prove that bounded
versions of the stability problems are generally decidable, and give upper
bounds on their complexity. The unbounded versions are generally undecidable,
for which we give upper bounds on their degrees of unsolvability.
