A third order parabolic operator L_\epsilon typical of a non linear wave
operator cal L_0 perturbed by viscous terms, is analyzed. Some particular
solutions related to L_0 are explicitly determined and the initial value
problem for L_\epsilon is considered. The parabolic-hyperbolic behaviour is
analyzed and rigorous approximations of the solution are achieved.
