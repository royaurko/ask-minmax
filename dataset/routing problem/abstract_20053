The Dirac method of canonical quantization of theories with second class
constraints has to be modified if the constraints depend on time explicitly. A
solution of the problem was given by Gitman and Tyutin. In the present work we
propose an independent way to derive the rules of quantization for these
systems, starting from physical equivalent theory with trivial
non-stationarity.
