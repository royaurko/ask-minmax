In this article we show that hybrid type-logical grammars are a fragment of
first-order linear logic. This embedding result has several important
consequences: it not only provides a simple new proof theory for the calculus,
thereby clarifying the proof-theoretic foundations of hybrid type-logical
grammars, but, since the translation is simple and direct, it also provides
several new parsing strategies for hybrid type-logical grammars. Second,
NP-completeness of hybrid type-logical grammars follows immediately. The main
embedding result also sheds new light on problems with lambda grammars/abstract
categorial grammars and shows lambda grammars/abstract categorial grammars
suffer from problems of over-generation and from problems at the
syntax-semantics interface unlike any other categorial grammar.
