In this paper, we reformulate a mathematical model for the dynamics of an
idealized electrostatically actuated MEMS device with two elastic membranes as
an initial value problem for an abstract quasilinear evolution equation.
Applying the Contraction Mapping Theorem, it is shown that the model is locally
well-posed in time for any value of the source voltage of the device. In
addition it is proven that the MEMS model considered here possesses global
solutions for small source voltages whereas for large source voltages solutions
of the model have a finite maximal existence time. Furthermore, we comment on
the relationship of our model to its stationary version and to its small aspect
ratio limit by showing that there exists a unique exponentially stable steady
state and by proving convergence towards a solution of the narrow gap model in
the vanishing aspect ratio limit. Our results extend the discussion of the
elliptic-parabolic MEMS model presented in [Martin Kohlmann: On an
elliptic-parabolic MEMS model with two free boundaries, 2014] leading to a
Cauchy problem for a semilinear abstract evolution equation.
