Several important decision problems on conjunctive queries (CQs) are
NP-complete in general but become tractable, and actually highly
parallelizable, if restricted to acyclic or nearly acyclic queries. Examples
are the evaluation of Boolean CQs and query containment. These problems were
shown tractable for conjunctive queries of bounded treewidth and of bounded
degree of cyclicity. The so far most general concept of nearly acyclic queries
was the notion of queries of bounded query-width introduced by Chekuri and
Rajaraman (1997). While CQs of bounded query width are tractable, it remained
unclear whether such queries are efficiently recognizable. Chekuri and
Rajaraman stated as an open problem whether for each constant k it can be
determined in polynomial time if a query has query width less than or equal to
k. We give a negative answer by proving this problem NP-complete (specifically,
for k=4). In order to circumvent this difficulty, we introduce the new concept
of hypertree decomposition of a query and the corresponding notion of hypertree
width. We prove: (a) for each k, the class of queries with query width bounded
by k is properly contained in the class of queries whose hypertree width is
bounded by k; (b) unlike query width, constant hypertree-width is efficiently
recognizable; (c) Boolean queries of constant hypertree width can be
efficiently evaluated.
