A model for crystal field triplet ground states on rare earth or actinide
ions with dipolar and quadrupolar couplings to conduction electrons is studied
for the first time with renormalization group methods. The quadrupolar coupling
leads to a new nontrivial, non-Fermi liquid fixed point, which survives in an
intermediate valence Anderson model. The calculated magnetic susceptibility
displays one parameter scaling, going as $T^{-\alpha}$ ($\alpha \approx 0.4$)
at intermediate temperatures, reminiscent of the non-Fermi liquid alloy
UCu_{5-x}Pd_x.
