After reviewing some of the basic concepts, nomenclatures and
parametrizations of Astronomy, Astrophysics and Cosmology, we introduce a few
central problems in Nuclear Astrophysics, including the hot-CNO cycle, helium
burning in massive stars, and solar neutrino's. We demonstarte that SECONDARY
(RADIOACTIVE) NUCLEAR BEAMS allow for considerable progress on these problems.
