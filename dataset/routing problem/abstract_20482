We consider a symmetric double barrier heterostructure enclosing a well and
propose a solution for the transmission problem using a generalized WKB
approach which accounts for the amplitude suppression and phase shift due to
the barriers. This approach allows us to address both off-resonance and
resonance cases and, in the latter case, verify the coherent destruction of
tunneling.
