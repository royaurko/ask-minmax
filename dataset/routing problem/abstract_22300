The goal of this paper is to solve a long standing open problem, namely, the
asymptotic development of order $2$ by $\Gamma$-convergence of the
mass-constrained Cahn-Hilliard functional. This is achieved by introducing a
novel rearrangement technique, which works without Dirichlet boundary
conditions.
