We investigate the algorithmic problems of the {\it homophyly phenomenon} in
networks. Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ and a vertex coloring $c
\colon V \rightarrow {1, 2, ..., k}$ of $G$, we say that a vertex $v\in V$ is
{\it happy} if $v$ shares the same color with all its neighbors, and {\it
unhappy}, otherwise, and that an edge $e\in E$ is {\it happy}, if its two
endpoints have the same color, and {\it unhappy}, otherwise. Supposing $c$ is a
{\it partial vertex coloring} of $G$, we define the Maximum Happy Vertices
problem (MHV, for short) as to color all the remaining vertices such that the
number of happy vertices is maximized, and the Maximum Happy Edges problem
(MHE, for short) as to color all the remaining vertices such that the number of
happy edges is maximized.
  Let $k$ be the number of colors allowed in the problems. We show that both
MHV and MHE can be solved in polynomial time if $k = 2$, and that both MHV and
MHE are NP-hard if $k \geq 3$. We devise a $\max {1/k,
\Omega(\Delta^{-3})}$-approximation algorithm for the MHV problem, where
$\Delta$ is the maximum degree of vertices in the input graph, and a
1/2-approximation algorithm for the MHE problem. This is the first theoretical
progress of these two natural and fundamental new problems.
