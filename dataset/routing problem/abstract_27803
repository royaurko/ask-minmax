Variational principles are proved for the eigenvalues of a Cauchy problem
given by a second-order linear differential operator equation of the form \[
  \ddot{z}(t)+D\dot{z}(t) + A_0 z(t) = 0 \] in a Hilbert space $H$. Here $A_0$
is a uniformly positive operator and $A^{-1/2}_0 D A^{-1/2}_0$ is a bounded
non-negative operator in $H$. As usual, a scale of spaces $H_s$ is related to
$A_0$ and the inner product $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ in $H$ extends to a
mapping $\langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle_{H_{-\frac{1}{2}}\times
H_{\frac{1}{2}}}: H_{-\frac{1}{2}}\times H_{\frac{1}{2}}\to \mathbb C$. We
associate with the second-order equation the form \[
  \mathfrak{t}(\lambda)[x,y] = \langle \lambda^2 x+ \lambda Dx + A_0x,
y\rangle_{H_{-\frac{1}{2}}\times H_{\frac{1}{2}}} \] with domain
$H_{\frac{1}{2}}$ and a corresponding operator family $T(\lambda)$. Using form
methods a generalized Rayleigh functional is defined and the eigenvalues above
the essential spectrum of the generator associated with the Cauchy problem are
characterized by a min-max and a max-min variational principle. The obtained
results are illustrated with a damped beam equation.
