We study the impact of competing time delays in coupled stochastic
synchronization and coordination problems. We consider two types of delays:
transmission delays between interacting elements and processing, cognitive, or
execution delays at each element. We establish the scaling theory for the phase
boundary of synchronization and for the steady-state fluctuations in the
synchronizable regime. Further, we provide the asymptotic behavior near the
boundary of the synchronizable regime. Our results also imply the potential for
optimization and trade-offs in synchronization problems with time delays.
