In this paper we prove that, for any $n\ge 3$, there exist infinitely many
$r\in \N$ and for each of them a smooth, connected curve $C_r$ in $\P^r$ such
that $C_r$ lies on exactly $n$ irreducible components of the Hilbert scheme
$\hilb(\P^r)$. This is proven by reducing the problem to an analogous statement
for the moduli of surfaces of general type.
