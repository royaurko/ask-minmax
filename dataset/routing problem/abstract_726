In a live and bounded Free Choice Petri net, pick a non-conflicting
transition. Then there exists a unique reachable marking in which no transition
is enabled except the selected one. For a routed live and bounded Free Choice
net, this property is true for any transition of the net. Consider now a live
and bounded stochastic routed Free Choice net, and assume that the routings and
the firing times are independent and identically distributed. Using the above
results, we prove the existence of asymptotic firing throughputs for all
transitions in the net. Furthermore the vector of the throughputs at the
different transitions is explicitly computable up to a multiplicative constant.
