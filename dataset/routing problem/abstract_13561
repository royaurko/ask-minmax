We study a Fermi Hamilton operator $\hat K$ which does not commute with the
number operator $\hat N$. The eigenvalue problem and the Schr\"odinger equation
is solved. Entanglement is also discussed. Furthermore the Lie algebra
generated by the two terms of the Hamilton operator is derived and the Lie
algebra generated by the Hamilton operator and the number operator is also
classified.
