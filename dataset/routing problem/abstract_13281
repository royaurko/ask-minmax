The paper addresses the realization and identification problem or a subclass
of piecewise-affine hybrid systems. The paper provides necessary and sufficient
conditions for existence of a realization, a characterization of minimality,
and an identification algorithm for this subclass of hybrid systems. The
considered system class and the identification problem are motivated by
applications in systems biology.
