We consider the problem of exact learning of parameters of a linear RNA
energy model from secondary structure data. A necessary and sufficient
condition for learnability of parameters is derived, which is based on
computing the convex hull of union of translated Newton polytopes of input
sequences. The set of learned energy parameters is characterized as the convex
cone generated by the normal vectors to those facets of the resulting polytope
that are incident to the origin. In practice, the sufficient condition may not
be satisfied by the entire training data set; hence, computing a maximal subset
of training data for which the sufficient condition is satisfied is often
desired. We show that problem is NP-hard in general for an arbitrary
dimensional feature space. Using a randomized greedy algorithm, we select a
subset of RNA STRAND v2.0 database that satisfies the sufficient condition for
separate A-U, C-G, G-U base pair counting model. The set of learned energy
parameters includes experimentally measured energies of A-U, C-G, and G-U
pairs; hence, our parameter set is in agreement with the Turner parameters.
