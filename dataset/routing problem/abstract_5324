This paper presents a novel extended dynamic programming approach for energy
minimization (EDP) to solve the correspondence problem for stereo and motion. A
significant speedup is achieved using a recursive minimum search strategy
(RMS). The mentioned speedup is particularly important if the disparity space
is 2D as well as 3D. The proposed RMS can also be applied in the well-known
dynamic programming (DP) approach for stereo and motion. In this case, the
general 2D problem of the global discrete energy minimization is reduced to
several mutually independent sub-problems of the one-dimensional minimization.
The EDP method is used when the approximation of the general 2D discrete energy
minimization problem is considered. Then the RMS algorithm is an essential part
of the EDP method. Using the EDP algorithm we obtain a lower energy bound than
the graph cuts (GC) expansion technique on stereo and motion problems. The
proposed calculation scheme possesses natural parallelism and can be realized
on graphics processing unit (GPU) platforms, and can be potentially restricted
further by the number of scanlines in the image plane. Furthermore, the RMS and
EDP methods can be used in any optimization problem where the objective
function meets specific conditions in the smoothness term.
