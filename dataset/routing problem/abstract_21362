We define and study trivial points on towers of curves over number fields,
and we show their finiteness in some cases. We relate these to the unboundeness
of the gonality of the curves, which we show under some hypothesis. The problem
is related to recent results of Cadoret and Tamagawa, and Ellenberg, Hall and
Kowalski.
