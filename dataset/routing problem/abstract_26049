In this paper we present several algorithmic techniques for inferring the
structure of a company when only a limited amount of information is available.
We consider problems with two types of inputs: the number of pairs of employees
with a given property and restricted information about the hierarchical
structure of the company. We provide dynamic programming and greedy algorithms
for these problems.
