Parameterized runtime analysis seeks to understand the influence of problem
structure on algorithmic runtime. In this paper, we contribute to the
theoretical understanding of evolutionary algorithms and carry out a
parameterized analysis of evolutionary algorithms for the Euclidean traveling
salesperson problem (Euclidean TSP).
  We investigate the structural properties in TSP instances that influence the
optimization process of evolutionary algorithms and use this information to
bound the runtime of simple evolutionary algorithms. Our analysis studies the
runtime in dependence of the number of inner points $k$ and shows that $(\mu +
\lambda)$ evolutionary algorithms solve the Euclidean TSP in expected time
$O((\mu/\lambda) \cdot n^3\gamma(\epsilon) + n\gamma(\epsilon) + (\mu/\lambda)
\cdot n^{4k}(2k-1)!)$ where $\gamma$ is a function of the minimum angle
$\epsilon$ between any three points.
  Finally, our analysis provides insights into designing a mutation operator
that improves the upper bound on expected runtime. We show that a mixed
mutation strategy that incorporates both 2-opt moves and permutation jumps
results in an upper bound of $O((\mu/\lambda) \cdot n^3\gamma(\epsilon) +
n\gamma(\epsilon) + (\mu/\lambda) \cdot n^{2k}(k-1)!)$ for the $(\mu+\lambda)$
EA.
