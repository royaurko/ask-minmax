We register a random sequence which has the following properties: it has
three segments being the homogeneous Markov processes. Each segment has his own
one step transition probability law and the length of the segment is unknown
and random. It means that at two random successive moments (they can be equal
also and equal zero too) the source of observations is changed and the first
observation in new segment is chosen according to new transition probability
starting from the last state of the previous segment. In effect the number of
homogeneous segments is random. The transition probabilities of each process
are known and a priori distribution of the disorder moments is given. The
former research on such problem has been devoted to various questions
concerning the distribution changes. The random number of distributional
segments creates new problems in solutions with relation to analysis of the
model with deterministic number of segments. Two cases are presented in
details. In the first one the objectives is to stop on or between the disorder
moments while in the second one our objective is to find the strategy which
immediately detects the distribution changes. Both problems are reformulated to
optimal stopping of the observed sequences. The detailed analysis of the
problem is presented to show the form of optimal decision function.
