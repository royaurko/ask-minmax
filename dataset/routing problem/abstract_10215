In this paper, the contributors devise a new discretization scheme for div-curl
systems defined in connected domains with heterogeneous media by using the weak
Galerkin finite element method. Two types of boundary value problems are
considered in the algorithm development: (1) normal boundary condition, and (2)
tangential boundary condition. A new variational formulation is developed for
the normal boundary value problem by using the Helmholtz decomposition which
avoids the computation of functions in the harmonic fields. Both boundary value
problems are reduced to a general saddle-point problem involving the curl and
divergence operators, for which the weak Galerkin finite element method is
devised and analyzed. The novelty of the technique lies in the discretization
of the divergence operator applied to vector fields with heterogeneous media.
Error estimates of optimal order are established for the corresponding finite
element approximations in various discrete Sobolev norms.
