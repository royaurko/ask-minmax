In this letter, we consider the problem of distributed Bayesian detection in
the presence of data falsifying Byzantines in the network. The problem of
distributed detection is formulated as a binary hypothesis test at the fusion
center (FC) based on 1-bit data sent by the sensors. Adopting Chernoff
information as our performance metric, we study the detection performance of
the system under Byzantine attack in the asymptotic regime. The expression for
minimum attacking power required by the Byzantines to blind the FC is obtained.
More specifically, we show that above a certain fraction of Byzantine attackers
in the network, the detection scheme becomes completely incapable of utilizing
the sensor data for detection. When the fraction of Byzantines is not
sufficient to blind the FC, we also provide closed form expressions for the
optimal attacking strategies for the Byzantines that most degrade the detection
performance.
