In this article we describe the crystallization conjecture. The latter
intends to investigate why interacting particles often place themselves into
periodic configurations, breaking thereby the natural translation-invariance of
the system. This famous problem is still largely open. Mathematically, it
amounts to studying the minima of a real-valued function defined on
$\mathbb{R}^{3N}$ where $N$ is the number of particles, which tends to
infinity. We review the existing literature and mention several related open
problems, of which many have not been thoroughly studied.
