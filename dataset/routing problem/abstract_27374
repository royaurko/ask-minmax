We address the problem of adaptive minimax estimation in white gaussian noise
model under $L_p$--loss, $1\leq p\leq\infty,$ on the anisotropic Nikolskii
classes. We present the estimation procedure based on a new data-driven
selection scheme from the family of kernel estimators with varying bandwidths.
For proposed estimator we establish so-called Lp-norm oracle inequality and use
it for deriving minimax adaptive results. We prove the existence of
rate-adaptive estimators and fully characterize behavior of the minimax risk
for different relationships between regularity parameters and norm indexes in
definitions of the functional class and of the risk. In particular some new
asymptotics of the minimax risk are discovered including necessary and
sufficient conditions for existence a uniformly consistent estimator. We
provide also with detailed overview of existing methods and results and
formulate open problems in adaptive minimax estimation.
