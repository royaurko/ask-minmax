In this brief report we explore the energy landscapes of two spin glass
models using a greedy single-spin flipping process, {\tt Gmax}. The
ground-state energy density of the random maximum two-satisfiability problem is
efficiently approached by {\tt Gmax}. The achieved energy density $e(t)$
decreases with the evolution time $t$ as $e(t)-e(\infty)=h (\log_{10} t)^{-z}$
with a small prefactor $h$ and a scaling coefficient $z > 1$, indicating an
energy landscape with deep and rugged funnel-shape regions. For the $\pm J$
Viana-Bray spin glass model, however, the greedy single-spin dynamics quickly
gets trapped to a local minimal region of the energy landscape.
