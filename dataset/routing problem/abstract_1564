The propagation of electromagnetic waves in the anisotropic medium with a
single-sheeted hyperboloid dispersion relation is investigated. It is found
that in such an anisotropic medium E- and H-polarized waves have the same
dispersion relation, while E- and H-polarized waves exhibit opposite amphoteric
refraction characteristics. E- (or H-) polarized waves are positively refracted
whereas H- (or E-) polarized waves are negatively refracted at the interface
associated with the anisotropic medium. By suitably using the properties of
anomalous refraction in the anisotropic medium it is possible to realize a very
simple and very efficient beam splitter to route the light. It is shown that
the splitting angle and the splitting distance between E- and H- polarized beam
is the function of anisotropic parameters, incident angle and slab thickness.
