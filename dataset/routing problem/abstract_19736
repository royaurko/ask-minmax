Kaluza's mertic with the cylinder condition is considered without the weak
gravitational field approximation. It is shown that these hypoteses lead to a
non-gauge-invariant electromagnetic theory in a curved space-time. The problem
of electro-gravitational unification is considered from this point of view.
