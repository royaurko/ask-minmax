We show that a wide variety of generalized increasing subsequence problems
admit a one parameter family of extensions for which we can exactly compute the
mean length of the longest increasing subsequence. By the nature of the
extension, this gives upper bounds on the mean in the unextended model, which
turn out to be asymptotically tight for all of the models that have so far been
analyzed. A heuristic analysis based on this fact gives not just the asymptotic
mean but also the asymptotic scale factor, again agreeing with all known cases.
