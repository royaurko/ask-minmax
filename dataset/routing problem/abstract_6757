We propose a formal proof of the undecidability of the model checking problem
for alternating- time temporal logic under imperfect information and perfect
recall semantics. This problem was announced to be undecidable according to a
personal communication on multi-player games with imperfect information, but no
formal proof was ever published. Our proof is based on a direct reduction from
the non-halting problem for Turing machines.
