We demonstrate that both kinds of the Hamiltonian intermittency exert an
influence on the disruption statistics in the equal mass three-body problem.
Studying initially-resting triple systems we found a narrow region in the
vicinity of the strong chaos, where the influence of the second kind
Hamiltonian intermittency ($T_d^{-3/2}$) trajectories cause the integral
distribution to distort enough to be detected. We fitted the integral
distribution with both power-laws ($T_d^{-3/2}$ and $T_d^{-2/3}$) taken into
account, and found an excellent agreement between the fit and observed integral
distribution.
