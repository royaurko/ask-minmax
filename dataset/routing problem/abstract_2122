A swift chemical route to synthesize Co-doped SnO$_2$ nanopowders is
described. Pure and highly stable Sn$_{1-x}$Co$_x$O$_{2-\delta}$ (0 $\le$ x
$\le$ 0.15) crystalline nanoparticles were synthesized, with mean grain sizes <
5 nm and the dopant element homogeneously distributed in substitutional sites
of the SnO$_2$ matrix. The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra of the
Sn$_{1-x}$Co$_x$O$_{2-\delta}$ samples reveal red shifts, the optical bandgap
energies decreasing with increasing Co concentration. The Urbach energies of
the samples were calculated and correlated with their bandgap energies. The
photocatalytic activity of the Sn$_{1-x}$Co$_x$O$_{2-\delta}$ samples was
investigated for the 4-hydroxylbenzoic acid (4-HBA) degradation process. A
complete photodegradation of a 10 ppm 4-HBA solution was achieved using 0.02%
(w/w) of Sn$_{0.95}$Co$_{0.05}$O$_{2-\delta}$ nanoparticles in 60 min of
irradiation.
