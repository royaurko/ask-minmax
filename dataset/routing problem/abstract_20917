In this thesis, we study three aspects of theories with massive gravitational
waves. In the first part, we review to problems and issues of theories with
massive gravitons before introducing models where Lorentz invariance is
spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value of four scalar fields. In
the second part, we discuss three aspects of these models: instantaneous
interaction, spherically vacuum solutions and cosmological perturbations.
