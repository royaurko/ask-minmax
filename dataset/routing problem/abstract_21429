In this technical report, certain interesting classification of arithmetical
functions is proposed. The notion of additively decomposable and
multiplicatively decomposable arithmetical functions is proposed. The concepts
of arithmetical polynomials and arithmetical power series are introduced. Using
these concepts, an interesting Theorem relating arithmetical power series and
infinite products has been proved. Also arithmetical polynomials are related to
probabilistic number theory. Furthermore some results related to the Waring
problem are discussed.
