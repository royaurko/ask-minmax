We survey the average-case complexity of problems in NP.
  We discuss various notions of good-on-average algorithms, and present
completeness results due to Impagliazzo and Levin. Such completeness results
establish the fact that if a certain specific (but somewhat artificial) NP
problem is easy-on-average with respect to the uniform distribution, then all
problems in NP are easy-on-average with respect to all samplable distributions.
Applying the theory to natural distributional problems remain an outstanding
open question. We review some natural distributional problems whose
average-case complexity is of particular interest and that do not yet fit into
this theory.
  A major open question whether the existence of hard-on-average problems in NP
can be based on the P$\neq$NP assumption or on related worst-case assumptions.
We review negative results showing that certain proof techniques cannot prove
such a result. While the relation between worst-case and average-case
complexity for general NP problems remains open, there has been progress in
understanding the relation between different ``degrees'' of average-case
complexity. We discuss some of these ``hardness amplification'' results.
