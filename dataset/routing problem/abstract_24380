We prove that P.Mathieu's Open problem on constructing Gardner's deformation
for the N=2 supersymmetric a=4-Korteweg-de Vries equation has no supersymmetry
invariant solutions, whenever it is assumed that they retract to Gardner's
deformation of the scalar KdV equation under the component reduction. At the
same time, we propose a two-step scheme for the recursive production of the
integrals of motion for the N=2, a=4-SKdV. First, we find a new Gardner's
deformation of the Kaup-Boussinesq equation, which is contained in the bosonic
limit of the super-hierarchy. This yields the recurrence relation between the
Hamiltonians of the limit, whence we determine the bosonic super-Hamiltonians
of the full N=2, a=4-SKdV hierarchy. Our method is applicable towards the
solution of Gardner's deformation problems for other supersymmetric KdV-type
systems.
