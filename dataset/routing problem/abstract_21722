In this paper we consider the problem of determining an unknown pair
$\lambda$, $\mu$ of piecewise constant Lam\'{e} parameters inside a three
dimensional body from the Dirichlet to Neumann map. We prove uniqueness and
Lipschitz continuous dependence of $\lambda$ and $\mu$ from the Dirichlet to
Neumann map.
