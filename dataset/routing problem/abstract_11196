Physically admissible choice of the "essential" coordinates identified with
components of the metric tensor and co-moving frame of reference reduced to the
formulation of the stationary axisymmetric GR problem. Such nontraditional
approach allows to obtain new 4-parametric vacuum solution. In special static
case this solution becomes the set well-known GR exact solutions for degenerate
vacuum gravitational fields, in some special stationary case, after
transformations coincides with Kerr solution. In other special stationary case
the founded solution turn into modified NUT solution.
