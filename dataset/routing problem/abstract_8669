We consider a two-dimensional problem in nonlinear elasticity which
corresponds to the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transformation. Our model is frame
invariant and the energy density is given by the squared distance from two
potential wells. We obtain the quasiconvex envelope of the energy density and
therefore the relaxation of the variational problem. Our result includes the
constraint of positive determinant.
