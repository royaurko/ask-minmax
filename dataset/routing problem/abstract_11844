An approximate analytic solution is constructed for the 2-d space charge
limited emission by a cathode surrounded by non emitting conducting ledges of
width Lambda. An essentially exact solution (via conformal mapping) of the
electrostatic problem in vacuum is matched to the solution of a linearized
problem in the space charge region whose boundaries are sharp due to the
presence of a strong magnetic field. The current density growth in a narrow
interval near the edges of the cathode depends strongly on Lambda. We obtain an
empirical formula for the total current as a function of Lambda which extends
to more general cathode geometries.
