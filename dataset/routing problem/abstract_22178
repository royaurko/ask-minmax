We characterize the total positivity in space-time of real strictly stable
semigroups. In the positive case, this solves a problem which had been raised
by Karlin. In the drifted Cauchy case, this concludes a study which we had
initiated in a previous paper. The case of isotropic stable semigroups is also
investigated. We apply these results to the bell-shape and monotone likelihood
properties of certain real stable densities.
