In a previous paper we had proposed a specific route to relating the entropy
of two charge black holes to the degeneracy of elementary string states in N=4
supersymmetric heterotic string theory in four dimensions. For toroidal
compactification this proposal works correctly to all orders in a power series
expansion in inverse charges provided we take into account the corrections to
the black hole entropy formula due to holomorphic anomaly. In this paper we
demonstrate that similar agreement holds also for other N=4 supersymmetric
heterotic string compactifications.
