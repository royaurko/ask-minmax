We present updates to the problems on Hirzebruch's 1954 problem list
focussing on open problems, and on those where substantial progress has been
made in recent years. We discuss some purely topological problems, as well as
geometric problems about (almost) complex structures, both algebraic and
non-algebraic, about contact structures, and about (complementary pairs of)
foliations.
