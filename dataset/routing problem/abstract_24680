There is an overlooked iceberg of problems in end user computing.
Spreadsheets are developed by people who are very skilled in their main job
function, be it finance, procurement, or production planning, but often have
had no formal training in spreadsheet use. IT auditors focus on mainstream
information systems but regard spreadsheets as user problems, outside their
concerns. Internal auditors review processes, but not the tools that support
decision making in these processes.
  This paper highlights the gaps between risk management and end user awareness
in spreadsheet research. In addition the potential benefits of software agent
technologies to the management of risk in spreadsheets are explored. This paper
discusses the current research into end user computing and spreadsheet use
awareness.
