The theory of a massive spin-2 state on the de Sitter space -- with the mass
squared equal to one sixth of the curvature -- is special for two reasons: (i)
it exhibits an enhanced local symmetry; (ii) it emerges as a part of the model
that gives rise to the self-accelerated Universe. The known problems of this
theory are: either it cannot be coupled to a non-conformal conserved
stress-tensor because of the enhanced symmetry, or it propagates a ghost-like
state when the symmetry is constrained by the Lagrange multiplier method. Here
we propose a solution to these problems in the linearized approximation.
