We perform advanced radiation leakage microscopy of routing dielectric-loaded
plasmonic waveguiding structures. By direct plane imaging and momentum-space
spectroscopy, we analyze the energy transfer between coupled waveguides as a
function of gap distance and reveal the momentum distribution of curved
geometries. Specifically, we observed a clear degeneracy lift of the effective
indices for strongly interacting waveguides in agreement with coupled-mode
theory. We use momentum-space representations to discuss the effect of
curvature on dielectric-loaded waveguides. The experimental images are
successfully reproduced by a numerical and an analytical model of the mode
propagating in a curved plasmonic waveguide.
