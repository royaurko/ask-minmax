We study the boundary value problem $-{\rm div}(\log(1+ |\nabla u|^q)|\nabla
u|^{p-2}\nabla u)=f(u)$ in $\Omega$, $u=0$ on $\partial\Omega$, where $\Omega$
is a bounded domain in $\RR^N$ with smooth boundary. We distinguish the cases
where either $f(u)=-\lambda|u|^{p-2}u+|u|^{r-2}u$ or
$f(u)=\lambda|u|^{p-2}u-|u|^{r-2}u$, with $p$, $q>1$, $p+q<\min\{N,r\}$, and
$r<(Np-N+p)/(N-p)$. In the first case we show the existence of infinitely many
weak solutions for any $\lambda>0$. In the second case we prove the existence
of a nontrivial weak solution if $\lambda$ is sufficiently large. Our approach
relies on adequate variational methods in Orlicz-Sobolev spaces.
