The recently published GALFA-HI Compact Cloud Catalogue lists 20 neutral
hydrogen clouds that might pinpoint previously undiscovered high-latitude dwarf
galaxies. Detection of an associated gamma-ray dark matter signal could provide
a route to distinguish unambiguously between truly dark matter dominated
systems that have accumulated neutral hydrogen but have not successfully
ignited star formation and pure gaseous structures devoid of dark matter. We
use 4.3 years of Fermi observations to derive gamma-ray flux upper limits in
the 1-300 GeV energy range for the sample. Limits on gamma rays from pair
annihilation of dark matter are also presented depending on the yet unknown
astrophysical factors.
