In comparative genomics, a transposition is an operation that exchanges two
consecutive sequences of genes in a genome. The transposition distance, that
is, the minimum number of transpositions needed to transform a genome into
another, is, according to numerous studies, a relevant evolutionary distance.
The problem of computing this distance when genomes are represented by
permutations, called the Sorting by Transpositions problem, has been introduced
by Bafna and Pevzner in 1995. It has naturally been the focus of a number of
studies, but the computational complexity of this problem has remained
undetermined for 15 years. In this paper, we answer this long-standing open
question by proving that the Sorting by Transpositions problem is NP-hard. As a
corollary of our result, we also prove that the following problem is NP-hard:
given a permutation pi, is it possible to sort pi using db(pi)/3 permutations,
where db(pi) is the number of breakpoints of pi?
