This report contains both a review of recent approaches to supersymmetric
lattice field theories and some new results on the deconstruction approach. The
essential reason for the complex phase problem of the fermion determinant is
shown to be derivative interactions that are not present in the continuum.
These irrelevant operators violate the self-conjugacy of the fermion action
that is present in the continuum. It is explained why this complex phase
problem does not disappear in the continuum limit. The fermion determinant
suppression of various branches of the classical moduli space is explored, and
found to be supportive of previous claims regarding the continuum limit.
