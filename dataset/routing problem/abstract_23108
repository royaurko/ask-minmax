Extending the study of spherically symmetric metrics satisfying the dominant
energy condition and exhibiting singularities of power-law type initiated in
SI93, we identify two classes of peculiar interest: focusing timelike
singularity solutions with the stress-energy tensor of a radiative perfect
fluid (equation of state: $p={1\over 3} \rho$) and a set of null singularity
classes verifying identical properties. We consider two important applications
of these results: to cosmology, as regards the possibility of solving the
horizon problem with no need to resort to any inflationary scenario, and to the
Strong Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis to which we propose a class of physically
consistent counter-examples.
