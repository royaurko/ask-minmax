The Carath\'{e}odory problem in the $N$-variable non-commutative
Herglotz--Agler class and the Carath\'{e}odory--Fej\'{e}r problem in the
$N$-variable non-commutative Schur--Agler class are posed. It is shown that the
Carath\'{e}odory (resp., Carath\'{e}odory--Fej\'{e}r) problem has a solution if
and only if the non-commutative polynomial with given operator coefficients
(the data of the problem indexed by an admissible set $\Lambda$) takes operator
values with positive semidefinite real part (resp., contractive operator
values) on $N$-tuples of $\Lambda$-jointly nilpotent contractive $n\times n$
matrices, for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
