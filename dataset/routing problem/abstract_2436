Processing methods are described for the development of magnesium diboride
wire using the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to produce long lengths of
suitably doped starting boron fiber. It is found that titanium can be
co-deposited with the boron to make long lengths of doped fiber that contain
both TiB and TiB2. When this fiber is reacted in Mg vapor to transform boron
into MgB2, the resulting conductor has a superconducting critical current
density of about 5 times 10^6 A/cm^2 at 5K and self field. The critical current
density at 25K and 1 Tesla is 10,000 A/cm^2. Using optical methods to define
grain boundaries and energy dispersive X-rays to determine Ti and Mg
concentration, these samples show a fine dispersion of $Ti$ through out the
grains and no conspicuous precipitation of TiB2 on the MgB2 grain boundaries.
This is to be contrasted with the precipitation of TiB2 on MgB2 grain
boundaries observed for samples prepared by solid state reaction of Ti, Mg, and
B powders. Introducing Ti impurities into the B during the CVD deposition of
the B gives a distribution of TiB2 in the resulting MgB2 different from solid
state reaction of powders.
