Any Schur ring is uniquely determined by a partition of the elements of the
group. An open question in the study of Schur rings is determining which
partitions of the group induce a Schur ring. Although a structure theorem is
available for Schur rings over cyclic groups, it is still a difficult problem
to count all the partitions. For example, Kovacs, Liskovets, and Poschel
determine formulas to count the number of wreath-indecomposable Schur rings. In
this paper we solve the problem of counting the number of all Schur rings over
cyclic groups of prime power order and draw some parallels with Higman's PORC
conjecture.
