We study a specific convex maximization problem in n-dimensional space. The
conjectured solution is proved to be a vertex of the polyhedral feasible
region, but only a partial proof of local maximality is known. Integer
sequences with interesting patterns arise in the analysis, owing to the number
theoretic origin of the problem.
