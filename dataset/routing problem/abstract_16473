For a given subspace, the Rayleigh-Ritz method projects the large quadratic
eigenvalue problem (QEP) onto it and produces a small sized dense QEP. Similar
to the Rayleigh-Ritz method for the linear eigenvalue problem, the
Rayleigh-Ritz method defines the Ritz values and the Ritz vectors of the QEP
with respect to the projection subspace. We analyze the convergence of the
method when the angle between the subspace and the desired eigenvector
converges to zero. We prove that there is a Ritz value that converges to the
desired eigenvalue unconditionally but the Ritz vector converges conditionally
and may fail to converge. To remedy the drawback of possible non-convergence of
the Ritz vector, we propose a refined Ritz vector that is mathematically
different from the Ritz vector and is proved to converge unconditionally. We
construct examples to illustrate our theory.
