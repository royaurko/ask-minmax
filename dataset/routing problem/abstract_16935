The averaging problem in cosmology and the approach of macroscopic gravity to
resolve the problem is discussed. The averaged Einstein equations of
macroscopic gravity are modified on cosmological scales by the macroscopic
gravitational correlation tensor terms as compared with the Einstein equations
of general relativity. This correlation tensor satisfies a system of structure
and field equations. An exact cosmological solution to the macroscopic gravity
equations for a constant macroscopic gravitational connection correlation
tensor for a flat spatially homogeneous, isotropic macroscopic space-time is
presented. The correlation tensor term in the macroscopic Einstein equations
has been found to take the form of either a negative or positive spatial
curvature term. Thus, macroscopic gravity provides a cosmological model for a
flat spatially homogeneous, isotropic Universe which obeys the dynamical law
for either an open or closed Universe.
