Ad-hoc networks are independent of any infrastructure. The nodes are
autonomous and make their own decisions. They also have limited energy
resources. Thus, a node tends to behave selfishly when it is asked to forward
the packets of other nodes. Indeed, it would rather choose to reject a
forwarding request in order to save its energy. To overcome this problem, the
nodes need to be motivated to cooperate. To this end, we propose a
self-learning repeated game framework to enforce cooperation between the nodes
of a network. This framework is inspired by the concept of "The Weakest Link"
TV game. Each node has a utility function whose value depends on its
cooperation in forwarding packets on a route as well as the cooperation of all
the nodes that form this same route. The more these nodes cooperate the higher
is their utility value. This would establish a cooperative spirit within the
nodes of the networks. All the nodes will then more or less equally participate
to the forwarding tasks which would then eventually guarantee a more efficient
packets forwarding from sources to respective destinations. Simulations are run
and the results show that the proposed framework efficiently enforces nodes to
cooperate and outperforms two other self-learning repeated game frameworks
which we are interested in.
