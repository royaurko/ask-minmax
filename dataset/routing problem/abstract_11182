We consider Einstein Gravity coupled to dynamical matter consisting of a
gauge field with any compact gauge group and minimally coupled scalar fields.
We investigate the conditions under which a free specification of a spatial
field configuration for the total system and its derivative with respect to
coordinate-time determines a solution to the field equations (generalized
thin-sandwich problem). Sufficient conditions for local solvability (in the
space of fields) are established.
