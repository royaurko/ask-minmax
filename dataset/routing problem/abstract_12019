The existence of some complex geometrical structures on a compact manifold
such as complex structures, Kaehler (pseudo-Kaehler) structures often impose
certain restrictions on its underling topological or differentiable manifold.
In this article we survey recent developments in the study of the existence,
classification and moduli problems of such structures on compact homogeneous
manifolds.
