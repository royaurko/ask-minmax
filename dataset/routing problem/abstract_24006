Magnetic interaction between a weighing sample and an external magnetic field
allows to measure characteristics of magnetic field (a sample with known
magnetic characteristics), as well as the magnetic properties of a sample (a
known magnetic field). Measurement of materials magnetic permeability is a well
known application of this method. In this paper we restrict ourselves to the
measurement of magnetic field spatial distribution, which was achieved by
scanning of samples from known materials along the vertical axis. Field
measurements by Hall detector were done to calibrate obtained data. Such
measurements are of great interest in some branches of physics, in particular,
in accelerator physics, where the quality of magnetic system parts eventually
determine the quality of accelerated bunches. Development of a simple and cheep
device for measurement of magnetic field spatial distribution is an urgent
problem. The developed system for gravimetric measurement of magnetic field
gradients partially solves this problem.
