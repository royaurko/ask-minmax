Instead of solving the fine-tuning problems by some automatic method or by
cancelling the quadratic divergencies in the hierarchy problem by a symmetry
(such as SUSY), we rather propose to look for a unification of the different
fine-tuning problems. Our unified fine-tuning postulate is the so-called
Multiple Point Principle, according to which there exist many vacuum states
with approximately the same energy density (cosmological constant). Our main
point here is to suggest a scenario, using only the pure Standard Model, in
which an exponentially large ratio of the electroweak scale to the Planck scale
results. This huge scale ratio occurs due to the required degeneracy of three
suggested vacuum states. The scenario is built on the hypothesis that a bound
state formed from 6 top and 6 anti-top quarks, held together mainly by Higgs
particle exchange, is so strongly bound that it can become tachyonic and
condense in one of the three suggested vacua. If we live in this vacuum, the
new bound state would be seen via its mixing with the Higgs particle. It would
have essentially the same decay branching ratios as a Higgs particle of the
same mass, but the total lifetime and production rate would deviate from those
of a genuine Higgs particle. Possible effects on the rho parameter are
discussed.
