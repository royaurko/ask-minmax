A drawdown constraint forces the current wealth to remain above a given
function of its maximum to date. We consider the portfolio optimisation problem
of maximising the long-term growth rate of the expected utility of wealth
subject to a drawdown constraint, as in the original setup of Grossman and Zhou
(1993). We work in an abstract semimartingale financial market model with a
general class of utility functions and drawdown constraints. We solve the
problem by showing that it is in fact equivalent to an unconstrained problem
with a suitably modified utility function. Both the value function and the
optimal investment policy for the drawdown problem are given explicitly in
terms of their counterparts in the unconstrained problem.
