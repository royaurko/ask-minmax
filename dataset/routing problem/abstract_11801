Radiative capture reactions are one of the main inputs in stellar modelling.
In numerous situations, the low energies at which these reactions occur in
stars are not accessible with present experimental techniques. Electron
screening is one of the major causes of problems in separating the bare cross
sections from the screened ones. Indirect experimental techniques have been
proposed and are now one of the main tools to obtain these cross sections. I
discuss the electron screening problem and the latest progresses obtained with
indirect methods.
