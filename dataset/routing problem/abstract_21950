We develop reconstruction schemes to determine penetrable obstacles in a
region of \mathbb{R}^{2} or \mathbb{R}^{3} and we consider anisotropic elliptic
equations. This algorithm uses oscillating-decaying solutions to the equation.
We apply the oscillating-decaying solutions and the Runge approximation
property to the inverse problem of identifying an inclusion in an anisotropic
elliptic differential equation.
