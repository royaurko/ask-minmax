In this paper, a full (nested) multigrid scheme is proposed to solve
eigenvalue problems. The idea here is to use the multilevel correction method
to transform the solution of eigenvalue problem to a series of solutions of the
corresponding boundary value problems and eigenvalue problems defined on the
coarsest finite element space. The boundary value problems which are define on
a sequence of multilevel finite element space can be solved by some multigrid
iteration steps. Besides the multigrid iteration, all other efficient iteration
methods for solving boundary value problems can serve as linear problem solver.
The computational work of this new scheme can reach optimal order the same as
solving the corresponding source problem. Therefore, this type of iteration
scheme improves the efficiency of eigenvalue problem solving.
