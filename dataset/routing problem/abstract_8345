In this paper, we study the long-time behaviour of solutions of Cauchy
problem for the parabolic $p$-Laplacian equation with variable coefficients.
Under mild conditions on the coefficient of the principal part and without
upper growth restriction on the source function, we prove that this problem
possesses a compact and invariant global attractor in $L^{2}(R^{n})$.
