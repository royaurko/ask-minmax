A method for generating irreducible polynomials of degree n over the finite
field GF(2) is proposed. The irreducible polynomials are found by solving a
system of equations that brings the information on the internal properties of
the splitting field GF(2^n) . Also, the choice of a primitive normal basis
allows us to build up a natural representation of GF(2^n) in the space of
n-binary sequences. Illustrative examples are given for the lowest orders.
