We perform spectral simulations of dynamo for magnetic Prandtl number of one
with Taylor-Green forcing. We observe dynamo transition through a supercritical
pitchfork bifurcation. Beyond the transition, the numerical simulations reveal
complex dynamo states with windows of constant, periodic, quasiperiodic, and
chaotic magnetic field configurations. For some forcing amplitudes, multiple
attractors were obtained for different initial conditions. We show that one of
the chaotic windows follows the period-doubling route to chaos.
