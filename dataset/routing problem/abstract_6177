Spam, also known as Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE), is the bane of email
communication. Many data mining researchers have addressed the problem of
detecting spam, generally by treating it as a static text classification
problem. True in vivo spam filtering has characteristics that make it a rich
and challenging domain for data mining. Indeed, real-world datasets with these
characteristics are typically difficult to acquire and to share. This paper
demonstrates some of these characteristics and argues that researchers should
pursue in vivo spam filtering as an accessible domain for investigating them.
