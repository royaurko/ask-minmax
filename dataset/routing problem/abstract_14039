In this paper we present a number of fast average-case algorithms for pattern
matching with wildcards. We consider the problems where wildcards are
restricted to either the pattern or the text, however, the results can be
easily adapted to the case where wildcards are allowed in both. We analyse the
algorithms \textit{average-case} complexity and their \textit{expected-case}
complexity and show new lower bounds for the average-case complexity of the
problems. To the best of our knowledge these are the first results on the
average-case complexity of wildcard matching.
