This paper proposes a new method, in the frequency domain, to define
absorbing boundary conditions for general two-dimensional problems. The main
feature of the method is that it can obtain boundary conditions from the
discretized equations without much knowledge of the analytical behavior of the
solutions and is thus very general. It is based on the computation of waves in
periodic structures and needs the dynamic stiffness matrix of only one period
in the medium which can be obtained by standard finite element software.
Boundary conditions at various orders of accuracy can be obtained in a simple
way. This is then applied to study some examples for which analytical or
numerical results are available. Good agreements between the present results
and analytical solutions allow to check the efficiency and the accuracy of the
proposed method.
