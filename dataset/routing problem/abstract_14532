We completely resolve the boundary value problem for differential forms and
conformally Einstein infinity in terms of the dual Hahn polynomials.
Consequently, we produce explicit formulas for the Branson-Gover operators on
Einstein manifolds and prove their representation as a product of second order
operators. This leads to an explicit description of $Q$-curvature and gauge
companion operators on differential forms.
