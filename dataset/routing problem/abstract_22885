This paper proposes an efficient example sampling method for example-based
word sense disambiguation systems. To construct a database of practical size, a
considerable overhead for manual sense disambiguation (overhead for
supervision) is required. In addition, the time complexity of searching a
large-sized database poses a considerable problem (overhead for search). To
counter these problems, our method selectively samples a smaller-sized
effective subset from a given example set for use in word sense disambiguation.
Our method is characterized by the reliance on the notion of training utility:
the degree to which each example is informative for future example sampling
when used for the training of the system. The system progressively collects
examples by selecting those with greatest utility. The paper reports the
effectiveness of our method through experiments on about one thousand
sentences. Compared to experiments with other example sampling methods, our
method reduced both the overhead for supervision and the overhead for search,
without the degeneration of the performance of the system.
