We show analytically that Newtonian iterations, when applied to a polynomial
equation, have a positive topological entropy. In a specific example of an
attempt to ``find'' the real solutions of the equation $x^2+1=0$, we show that
the Newton method is chaotic. We analytically find the invariant density and
show how this problem relates to that of a piecewise linear map.
