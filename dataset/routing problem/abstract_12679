In this paper we design an iterative domain decomposition method for free
boundary problems with nonlinear flux jump condition. Our approach is related
to damped Newton's methods. The proposed scheme requires, in each iteration,
the approximation of the flux on (both sides of) the free interface. We present
a Finite Element implementation of our method. The numerical implementation
uses harmonically deformed triangulations to inexpensively generate finite
element meshes in subdomains. We apply our method to a simplified model for jet
flows in pipes and to a simple magnetohydrodynamics model. Finally, we present
numerical examples studying the convergence of our scheme.
