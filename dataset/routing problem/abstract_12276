Students, after they leave our care, are called to solve the diverse problems
of the world, so we should teach to increase transfer: the ability to apply
fundamental principles to new problems and contexts. This ability is rare. The
following pages are from a workshop for faculty on designing courses that
promote transfer. I discuss two design principles: to name the transferable
ideas and to illustrate them with examples from diverse subjects. The
discussion uses dimensional reasoning as the example of a valuable transferable
idea, illustrating it with three diverse examples.
