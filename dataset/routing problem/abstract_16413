We study the problem of estimating the average of a Lipschitz continuous
function $f$ defined over a metric space, by querying $f$ at only a single
point. More specifically, we explore the role of randomness in drawing this
sample. Our goal is to find a distribution minimizing the expected estimation
error against an adversarially chosen Lipschitz continuous function. Our work
falls into the broad class of estimating aggregate statistics of a function
from a small number of carefully chosen samples. The general problem has a wide
range of practical applications in areas as diverse as sensor networks, social
sciences and numerical analysis. However, traditional work in numerical
analysis has focused on asymptotic bounds, whereas we are interested in the
\emph{best} algorithm. For arbitrary discrete metric spaces of bounded doubling
dimension, we obtain a PTAS for this problem. In the special case when the
points lie on a line, the running time improves to an FPTAS. Both algorithms
are based on approximately solving a linear program with an infinite set of
constraints, by using an approximate separation oracle. For
Lipschitz-continuous functions over $[0,1]$, we calculate the precise
achievable error as $1-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.134$, which improves upon
the \quarter which is best possible for deterministic algorithms.
