Continuing previous work on forward-backward multiplicity correlation
properties in proton-proton collisions in the framework of the weighted
superposition model of two components (each one described by a negative
binomial multiplicity distribution) with the addition of the leakage parameter
which controls clan spreading from one hemisphere to the opposite one, we
examine E735 data on the c.m. energy dependence of the total correlation
strength and of the forward variance at fixed total multiplicity. A comparison
with the Chou-Yang approach to the problem is presented and extrapolations of
the mentioned variables at LHC c.m. energy in possible scenarios in the new
energy domain are discussed.
