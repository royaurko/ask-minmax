MaLeS is an automatic tuning framework for automated theorem provers. It
provides solutions for both the strategy finding as well as the strategy
scheduling problem. This paper describes the tool and the methods used in it,
and evaluates its performance on three automated theorem provers: E, LEO-II and
Satallax. An evaluation on a subset of the TPTP library problems shows that on
average a MaLeS-tuned prover solves 8.67% more problems than the prover with
its default settings.
