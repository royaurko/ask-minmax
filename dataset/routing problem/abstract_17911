Assume we have two bijective functions $U(x)$ and $M(x)$ with $M(x)\neq U(x)$
for all $x$ and $M,N: \N \rightarrow \N$ . Every day and in different
locations, we see the different results of $U$ and $M$ without seeing $x$. We
are not assured about the time stamp nor the order within the day but at least
the location is fully defined. We want to find the matching between $U(x)$ and
$M(x)$ (i.e., we will not know $x$). We formulate this problem as an adaptive
graph mining: we develop the theory, the solution, and the implementation. This
work stems from a practical problem thus our definitions. The solution is
simple, clear, and the implementation parallel and efficient. In our
experience, the problem and the solution are novel and we want to share our
finding.
