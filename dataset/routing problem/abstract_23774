Based on ideas of W. M. Tulczyjew, a geometric framework for a
frame-independent formulation of different problems in analytical mechanics is
developed. In this approach affine bundles replace vector bundles of the
standard description and functions are replaced by sections of certain affine
line bundles called AV-bundles. Categorial constructions for affine and special
affine bundles as well as natural analogs of Lie algebroid structures on affine
bundles (Lie affgebroids) are investigated. One discovers certain Lie
algebroids and Lie affgebroids canonically associated with an AV-bundle which
are closely related to affine analogs of Poisson and Jacobi structures.
Homology and cohomology of the latter are canonically defined. The developed
concepts are applied in solving some problems of frame-independent geometric
description of mechanical systems.
