Representing the massless Dirac Fermions on a spatial lattice poses a
potential problem known as the Fermion Doubling problem. Addition of a
quadratic term to the Dirac Hamiltonian circumvents this problem. We show that
the modified Hamiltonian with the additional term results in an extremely small
Hamiltonian matrix when descritized on a real space square lattice. The
resulting Hamiltonian matrix is drastically more efficient for numerical
simulations without sacrificing the accuracy; several orders of magnitude
faster than the atomistic tight binding model. Using this Hamiltonian and the
nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, we show several transport
phenomena in graphene, such as magnetic focusing, chiral tunneling in ballistic
limit and conductivity calculation in diffusive limit in micron sized graphene
devices. The modified Hamiltonian can be used for any massless Dirac Fermions
such as Toplogical Insulators. This opens up a new simulation domain that is
unavailable otherwise.
