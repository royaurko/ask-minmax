We solve exactly the problem of a finite slab receiving an isotropic
radiation on one side and no radiation on the other side. This problem - to be
more precise the calculation of the source function within the slab - was first
formulated by K. Schwarzschild in 1914. We first solve it for unspecified
albedos and optical thicknesses of the atmosphere, in particular for an albedo
very close to 1 and a very large optical thickness in view of some
astrophysical applications. Then we focus on the conservative case (albedo =
1), which is of great interest for the modeling of grey atmospheres in
radiative equilibrium. Ten-figure tables of the conservative source function
are given. From the analytical expression of this function, we deduce 1) a
simple relation between the effective temperature of a grey atmosphere in
radiative equilibrium and the temperature of the black body that irradiates it,
2) the temperature at any point of the atmosphere when it is in local
thermodynamical equilibrium. This temperature distribution is the counterpart,
for a finite slab, of Hopf's distribution in a half-space. Its graphical
representation is given for various optical thicknesses of the atmosphere.
