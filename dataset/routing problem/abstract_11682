In this article we outline the methods that are used to prove undecidability
of Hilbert's Tenth Problem for function fields of characteristic zero.
Following Denef we show how rank one elliptic curves can be used to prove
undecidability for rational function fields over formally real fields. We also
sketch the undecidability proofs for function fields of varieties over the
complex numbers of dimension at least 2.
