In this paper, we study the initial boundary value problem for the two
dimensional strong damped wave equation with exponentially growing source and
damping terms. We first show the well-posedness of this problem and then prove
the existence of the global attractor in $(H_{0}^{1}(\Omega)\cap
L^{\infty}(\Omega))\times L^{2}(\Omega)$.
