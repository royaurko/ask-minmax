Constraint Programming (CP) solvers typically tackle optimization problems by
repeatedly finding solutions to a problem while placing tighter and tighter
bounds on the solution cost. This approach is somewhat naive, especially for
soft-constraint optimization problems in which the soft constraints are mostly
satisfied. Unsatisfiable-core approaches to solving soft constraint problems in
Boolean Satisfiability (e.g. MAXSAT) force all soft constraints to hold
initially. When solving fails they return an unsatisfiable core, as a set of
soft constraints that cannot hold simultaneously. Using this information the
problem is relaxed to allow certain soft constraint(s) to be violated and
solving continues. Since Lazy Clause Generation (LCG) solvers can also return
unsatisfiable cores we can adapt the MAXSAT unsatisfiable core approach to CP.
We implement the original MAXSAT unsatisfiable core solving algorithms WPM1,
MSU3 in a state-of-the-art LCG solver and show that there exist problems which
benefit from this hybrid approach.
