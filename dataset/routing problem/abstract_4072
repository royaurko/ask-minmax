Let K be the function field of a variety of dimension at least 2 over an
algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Then Hilbert's Tenth Problem
for K is undecidable. This generalizes the result by Kim and Roush from 1992
that Hilbert's Tenth Problem for the purely transcendental function field
C(t_1,t_2) is undecidable.
