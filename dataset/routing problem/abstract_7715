Recently Tsai et.al. (cond-mat/0406174) have used the renormalization group
approach to study strong coupling superconductors without assuming a broken
symmetry phase. We use the hydrodynamic formulation to study the same problem
with the same intention.
 We recast the electron-phonon + electron-electron problem in the hydrodynamic
language and compute the one-particle electron Green function at finite
temperature.
 From this we extract the dynamical density of states at finite temperature and
look for sign of a gap.
