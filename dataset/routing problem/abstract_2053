Ferroelectric polar displacements have recently been observed in conducting
electron-doped BaTiO3. The co-existence of a ferroelectric phase and
conductivity opens the door to new functionalities which may provide a unique
route for novel device applications. Using first-principles methods and
electrostatic modeling we explore the effect that the switchable polarization
of electron-doped BaTiO3 (n-BaTiO3) has on the electronic properties of the
SrRuO3/n-BaTiO3 (001) interface. Ferroelectric polarization controls the
accumulation or depletion of electron charge at the interface, and the
associated bending of the n-BTO conduction band determines the transport regime
across the interface. The interface exhibits a Schottky tunnel barrier for one
polarization orientation, whereas an Ohmic contact is present for the opposite
polarization orientation, leading to a large change in interface resistance
associated with polarization reversal. Calculations reveal a large (five orders
of magnitude) change in the interface resistance as a result of polarization
switching.
