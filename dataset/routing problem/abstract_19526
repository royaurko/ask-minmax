I first comment on some recent advances in computing equipment for
CPU-intensive numerical simulations, and on possible developments in the near
future. I then discuss some particularly important and yet unsolved problems in
dynamics and evolution of galaxies, on which analytical, numerical and
observational effort should be focused.
