Cloaking using complementary media was suggested by Lai et al. in [8]. The
study of this problem faces two difficulties. Firstly, this problem is unstable
since the equations describing the phenomenon have sign changing coefficients,
hence the ellipticity is lost. Secondly, the localized resonance, i.e., the
field explodes in some regions and remains bounded in some others, might
appear. In this paper, we give a proof of cloaking using complementary media
for a class of schemes inspired from [8] in the quasistatic regime. To handle
the localized resonance, we introduce the technique of removing localized
singularity and apply a three spheres inequality. The proof also uses the
reflecting technique in [11]. To our knowledge, this work presents the first
proof on cloaking using complementary media.
