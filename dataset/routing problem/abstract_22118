We consider an inviscid stochastically forced dyadic model, where the
additive noise acts only on the first component. We prove that a strong
solution for this problem exists and is unique by means of uniform energy
estimates. Moreover, we exploit these results to establish strong existence and
uniqueness of the stationary distribution.
