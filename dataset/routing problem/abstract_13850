In this chapter, the contributors present the performance of multi-antenna
selective combining decode-and-forward (SC-DF) relay networks over independent
and identically distributed (i.i.d) Nakagami-m fading channels. The outage
probability, moment generation function, symbol error probability and average
channel capacity are derived in closed-form using the Signal-to-Noise-Ratio
(SNR) statistical characteristics. After that, the contributors formulate the outage
probability problem, optimize it with an approximated problem, and then solve
it analytically. Finally, for comparison with analytical formulas, the contributors
perform some Monte-Carlo simulations.
