In the context of the supersymmetrized seesaw mechanism embedded in the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), complex neutrino Yukawa couplings
can induce Electric Dipole Moments (EDMs) for the charged leptons, providing an
additional route to seesaw parameters. However, the complex neutrino Yukawa
matrix is not the only possible source of CP violation. Even in the framework
of Constrained MSSM (CMSSM), there are additional sources, usually attributed
to the phases of the trilinear soft supersymmetry breaking couplings and the
mu-term, which contribute not only to the electron EDM but also to the EDMs of
neutron and heavy nuclei. In this work, by combining bounds on various EDMs, we
analyze how the sources of CP violation can be discriminated by the present and
planned EDM experiments.
