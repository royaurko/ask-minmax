Bethe's view-point on the global energy problems is presented. Bethe claimed
that the nuclear power is a necessity in future. Nuclear energetic must be
based on breeder reactors. Bethe considered the non-proliferation of nuclear
weapons as the main problem of long-range future of nuclear energetics. The
solution of this problem he saw in heavy water moderated thermal breeders,
using uranium-233, uranium-238 and thorium as a fuel.
