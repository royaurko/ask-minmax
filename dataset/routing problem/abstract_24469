The Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation describes weakly dispersive and
small amplitude waves propagating in a quasi-two dimensional situation.
Recently a large variety of exact soliton solutions of the KP equation has been
found and classified. Those soliton solutions are localized along certain lines
in a two-dimensional plane and decay exponentially everywhere else, and they
are called line-soliton solutions in this paper. The classification is based on
the far-field patterns of the solutions which consist of a finite number of
line-solitons. In this paper, we study the initial value problem of the KP
equation with V- and X-shape initial waves consisting of two distinct
line-solitons by means of the direct numerical simulation. We then show that
the solution converges asymptotically to some of those exact soliton solutions.
The convergence is in a locally defined $L^2$-sense. The initial wave patterns
considered in this paper are related to the rogue waves generated by nonlinear
wave interactions in shallow water wave problem.
