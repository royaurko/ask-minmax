We construct manifolds and orbifolds with quasitoric boundary. We show that
these manifolds and orbifolds with boundary has a stable complex structure.
These induce explicit (orbifold) complex cobordism relations among quasitoric
manifolds and orbifolds. In particular, we show that a quasitoric orbifold is
complex cobordant to some copies of fake weighted projective spaces. The famous
problem of Hirzebruch is that which complex cobordism classes in $\Omega^U$
contain connected nonsingular algebraic varieties? We give some sufficient
conditions to show when a complex cobordism class may contains an almost
complex quasitoric manifold. Andrew Wilfong give some necessary condition of
this problem up to dimension 8.
