We present a novel approach for improving particle filters for multi-target
tracking. The suggested approach is based on drift homotopy for stochastic
differential equations. Drift homotopy is used to design a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo step which is appended to the particle filter and aims to bring the
particle filter samples closer to the observations. Also, we present a simple
Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm for tackling the target-observation
association problem. We have used the proposed approach on the problem of
multi-target tracking for both linear and nonlinear observation models. The
numerical results show that the suggested approach can improve significantly
the performance of a particle filter.
