Based on the three rules developed from the Roe-type scheme, the mechanisms
of the classical and preconditioned Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL) schemes are
analyzed. For the classical HLL scheme, the accuracy problem is attributable to
the extremely large coefficient of the velocity-derivative term of the momentum
equation. For the preconditioned HLL scheme, the global cut-off problem is
attributable to the denominator of the coefficients, whereas the particular
pressure gradient sensor problem results from the loss of the capability to
suppress the checkerboard pressure-velocity decoupling. A new all-speed HLL
scheme, which can overcome these problems by only multiplying the
momentum-derivative term in the momentum equation by a function related to the
local Mach number, is proposed. More importantly, the present study shows the
generality of the three rules, which can be powerful tools for analyzing and
proposing schemes. The second rule involving the checkerboard problem is also
improved by emphasizing that the coefficients of pressure-derivative term in
the continuity and energy equations should be changed simultaneously.
