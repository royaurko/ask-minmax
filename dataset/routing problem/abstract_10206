Space and time discretizations of parabolic differential equations with
dynamic boundary conditions are studied in a weak formulation that fits into
the standard abstract formulation of parabolic problems, just that the usual
L^2(\Omega) inner product is replaced by an L^2(\Omega) \oplus L^2(\Gamma)
inner product. The class of parabolic equations considered includes linear
problems with time- and space-dependent coefficients and semilinear problems
such as reaction-diffusion on a surface coupled to diffusion in the bulk. The
spatial discretization by finite elements is studied in the proposed framework,
with particular attention to the error analysis of the Ritz map for the
elliptic bilinear form in relation to the inner product, both of which contain
boundary integrals. The error analysis is done for both polygonal and smooth
domains. We further consider mass lumping, which enables us to use exponential
integrators and bulk-surface splitting for time integration.
