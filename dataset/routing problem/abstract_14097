In this paper, we propose and analyze a new family of hybridizable
discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods for second order elliptic problems in two
and three dimensions. We use piecewise polynomials of degree $k\geqslant 0$ for
both the flux and numerical trace, and piecewise polynomials of degree $k+1$
for the potential. We show the convergence orders of the flux and the potential
in $L^2$-norm are $k+1$ and $k+2$, respectively. What's more, we construct a
local postprocessing for the flux, which produces a numerical flux with better
conservation. We also study the conditioning of the HDG method. We finally do
numerical experiments in two-space dimensions to verify our theoretical
results.
