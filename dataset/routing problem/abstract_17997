We propose a novel numerical approach for nonlocal diffusion equations [8]
with integrable kernels, based on the relationship between the backward
Kolmogorov equation and backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs)
driven by L\`{e}vy processes with jumps. The nonlocal diffusion problem under
consideration is converted to a BSDE,for which numerical schemes are developed
and applied directly. As a stochastic approach, the proposed method does not
require the solution of linear systems, which allows for embarrassingly
parallel implementations and also enables adaptive approximation techniques to
be incorporated in a straightforward fashion. Moreover, our method is more
accurate than classic stochastic approaches due to the use of high-order
temporal and spatial discretization schemes. In addition, our approach can
handle a broad class of problems with general nonlinear forcing terms as long
as they are globally Lipchitz continuous. Rigorous error analysis of the new
method is provided as several numerical examples that illustrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.
