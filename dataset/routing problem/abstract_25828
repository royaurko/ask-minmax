For large scale distributed storage systems, flash memories are an excellent
choice because flash memories consume less power, take lesser floor space for a
target throughput and provide faster access to data. In a traditional
distributed filesystem, even distribution is required to ensure load-balancing,
balanced space utilisation and failure tolerance. In the presence of flash
memories, in addition, we should also ensure that the number of writes to these
different flash storage nodes are evenly distributed, to ensure even wear of
flash storage nodes, so that unpredictable failures of storage nodes are
avoided. This requires that we distribute updates and do garbage collection,
across the flash storage nodes. We have motivated the distributed wearlevelling
problem considering the replica placement algorithm for HDFS. Viewing the
wearlevelling across flash storage nodes as a distributed co-ordination
problem, we present an alternate design, to reduce the message communication
cost across participating nodes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our design
through simulation
