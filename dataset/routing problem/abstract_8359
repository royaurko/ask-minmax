The inverse problem method is tested for a class of mean field statistical
mechanics models representing a mixture of particles of different species. The
robustness of the inversion is investigated for different values of the
physical parameters, system sizes and independent samples. We show how to
reconstruct the parameter values with a precision of a few percentages.
