The Stable Marriage Problem (SMP) is a well-known matching problem first
introduced and solved by Gale and Shapley (1962). Several variants and
extensions to this problem have since been investigated to cover a wider set of
applications. Each time a new variant is considered, however, a new algorithm
needs to be developed and implemented. As an alternative, in this paper we
propose an encoding of the SMP using Answer Set Programming (ASP). Our encoding
can easily be extended and adapted to the needs of specific applications. As an
illustration we show how stable matchings can be found when individuals may
designate unacceptable partners and ties between preferences are allowed.
Subsequently, we show how our ASP based encoding naturally allows us to select
specific stable matchings which are optimal according to a given criterion.
Each time, we can rely on generic and efficient off-the-shelf answer set
solvers to find (optimal) stable matchings.
