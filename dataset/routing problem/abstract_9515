We show that the two problems of computing the permanent of an $n\times n$
matrix of $\operatorname{poly}(n)$-bit integers and counting the number of
Hamiltonian cycles in a directed $n$-vertex multigraph with
$\operatorname{exp}(\operatorname{poly}(n))$ edges can be reduced to relatively
few smaller instances of themselves. In effect we derive the first
deterministic algorithms for these two problems that run in $o(2^n)$ time in
the worst case. Classic $\operatorname{poly}(n)2^n$ time algorithms for the two
problems have been known since the early 1960's. Our algorithms run in
$2^{n-\Omega(\sqrt{n/\log n})}$ time.
