According to the theory of general relativity, the relative acceleration of
masses generates gravitational radiation. Although gravitational radiation has
not yet been detected, it is believed that extremely violent cosmic events,
such as the collision of black holes, should generate gravity waves of
sufficient amplitude to detect on earth. The massive Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-wave Observatory, or LIGO, is now being constructed to detect
gravity waves. Consequently there is great interest in the computer simulation
of black hole collisions and similar events, based on the numerical solution of
the Einstein field equations. In this note we introduce the scientific,
mathematical, and computational problems and discuss the development of a
computer code to solve the initial data problem for colliding black holes, a
nonlinear elliptic boundary value problem posed in an unbounded three
dimensional domain which is a key step in solving the full field equations. The
code is based on finite elements, adaptive meshes, and a multigrid solution
process. Here we will particularly emphasize the mathematical and algorithmic
issues arising in the generation of adaptive tetrahedral meshes.
