We study the interaction of gauge fields of arbitrary half-integer spins with
the homogeneous electromagnetic field. We reduce the problem of obtaining the
gauge-invariant Lagrangian and transformations of the half-integer spin fields
in the external field to an algebraic problem of search for a set of operators
with certain algebraical features using the representation of the higher-spin
fields as vectors in a pseudo-Hilbert space. We consider such construction at
linear order in the external electromagnetic field and also present an explicit
form of interaction Lagrangians and gauge transformations for the massive
particles of spins 3/2 and 5/2 in terms of symmetric spin-tensor fields. The
obtained result is valid for space-time of arbitrary even dimension.
