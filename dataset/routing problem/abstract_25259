The little hierarchy problem encountered in the constrained minimal
supersymmetric model (CMSSM) can be ameliorated in supersymmetric models based
on the gauge symmetry G_{422} \equiv SU(4)_c x SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R. The standard
assumption in CMSSM (and in SU(5) and SO(10)) of universal gaugino masses can
be relaxed in G_{422}, and this leads to a significant improvement in the
degree of fine tuning required to implement radiative electroweak breaking in
the presence of a characteristic supersymmetry breaking scale of around a TeV.
Examples of Higgs and sparticle mass spectra realized with 10% fine tuning are
presented.
