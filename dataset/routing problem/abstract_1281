The application of solution-processable graphene oxide (GO) as hole injection
layer in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is demonstrated. High luminance
of over 53,000 cd m-2 is obtained at only 10 V. The results will unlock a route
of applying GO in flexible OLEDs and other electrode applications.
