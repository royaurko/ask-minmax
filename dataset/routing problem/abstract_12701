The monograph is concerned with some key problems of the theory of nonlinear
economic dynamics. The contributors' concept consists in analyzing the problem of
structural instability of economic systems within the framework of the
synergetic paradigm. As examples, the classical models of macroeconomics are
considered. The contributors present the results of the study of the phenomenon of
self-organization in open and nonequilibrium economic systems. The generation
of limit cycles, as well as of more complex periodic structures, is discussed;
the character of their stability is examined.
