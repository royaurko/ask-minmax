R. Salem (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 53 (3) (1943) 427-439) asked whether the
Fourier-Stieltjes transform of the Minkowski question mark function ?(x)
vanishes at infinity. In this note we present several possible approaches
towards the solution. For example, we show that this transform satisfies
integral and discrete functional equations. Thus, we expect the affirmative
answer to Salem's problem. In the end of this note we show that recent attempt
to settle this question (S. Yakubovich, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, Ser. I 349
(11-12) (2011) 633-636) is fallacious.
