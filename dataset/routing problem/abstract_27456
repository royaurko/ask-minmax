In this paper, we study the problem of `test-driving' a detector, i.e.
allowing a human user to get a quick sense of how well the detector generalizes
to their specific requirement. To this end, we present the first system that
estimates detector performance interactively without extensive ground truthing
using a human in the loop. We approach this as a problem of estimating
proportions and show that it is possible to make accurate inferences on the
proportion of classes or groups within a large data collection by observing
only $5-10\%$ of samples from the data. In estimating the false detections (for
precision), the samples are chosen carefully such that the overall
characteristics of the data collection are preserved. Next, inspired by its use
in estimating disease propagation we apply pooled testing approaches to
estimate missed detections (for recall) from the dataset. The estimates thus
obtained are close to the ones obtained using ground truth, thus reducing the
need for extensive labeling which is expensive and time consuming.
