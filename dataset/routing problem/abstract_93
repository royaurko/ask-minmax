In the capacitated vehicle routing problem, introduced by Dantzig and Ramser
in 1959, we are given the locations of n customers and a depot, along with a
vehicle of capacity k, and wish to find a minimum length collection of tours,
each starting from the depot and visiting at most k customers, whose union
covers all the customers. We give a quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme
for the setting where the customers and the depot are on the plane, and
distances are given by the Euclidean metric.
