In this paper, we address the problem of dense 3D reconstruction from
multiple view images subject to strong lighting variations. In this regard, a
new piecewise framework is proposed to explicitly take into account the change
of illumination across several wide-baseline images. Unlike multi-view stereo
and multi-view photometric stereo methods, this pipeline deals with
wide-baseline images that are uncalibrated, in terms of both camera parameters
and lighting conditions. Such a scenario is meant to avoid use of any specific
imaging setup and provide a tool for normal users without any expertise. To the
best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first work that deals with such
unconstrained setting. We propose a coarse-to-fine approach, in which a coarse
mesh is first created using a set of geometric constraints and, then, fine
details are recovered by exploiting photometric properties of the scene.
Augmenting the fine details on the coarse mesh is done via a final optimization
step. Note that the method does not provide a generic solution for multi-view
photometric stereo problem but it relaxes several common assumptions of this
problem. The approach scales very well in size given its piecewise nature,
dealing with large scale optimization and with severe missing data. Experiments
on a benchmark dataset Robot data-set show the method performance against 3D
ground truth.
