Kirchberg's Embedding Problem (KEP) asks whether every separable C$^*$
algebra embeds into an ultrapower of the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_2$. In this
paper, we use model theory to show that this conjecture is equivalent to a
local approximate nuclearity condition that we call the existence of good
nuclear witnesses. In order to prove this result, we study general properties
of existentially closed C$^*$ algebras. Along the way, we establish a
connection between existentially closed C$^*$ algebras, the weak expectation
property of Lance, and the local lifting property of Kirchberg. The paper
concludes with a discussion of the model theory of $\mathcal{O}_2$. Several
results in this last section are proven using some technical results concerning
tubular embeddings, a notion first introduced by Jung for studying embeddings
of tracial von Neumann algebras into the ultrapower of the hyperfinite II$_1$
factor.
