In this paper we classify graded reflexive ideals, up to isomorphism and
shift, in certain three dimensional Artin-Schelter regular algebras. This
classification is similar to the classification of right ideals in the first
Weyl algebra, a problem that was completely settled recently. The situation we
consider is substantially more complicated however.
