In this paper we initiate the study of optimization of bandit type problems
in scenarios where the feedback of a play is not immediately known. This arises
naturally in allocation problems which have been studied extensively in the
literature, albeit in the absence of delays in the feedback. We study this
problem in the Bayesian setting. In presence of delays, no solution with
provable guarantees is known to exist with sub-exponential running time.
  We show that bandit problems with delayed feedback that arise in allocation
settings can be forced to have significant structure, with a slight loss in
optimality. This structure gives us the ability to reason about the
relationship of single arm policies to the entangled optimum policy, and
eventually leads to a O(1) approximation for a significantly general class of
priors. The structural insights we develop are of key interest and carry over
to the setting where the feedback of an action is available instantaneously,
and we improve all previous results in this setting as well.
