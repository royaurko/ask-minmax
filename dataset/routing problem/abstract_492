As the scale of electronic devices shrinks, "electronic textiles"
(e-textiles) will make possible a wide variety of novel applications which are
currently unfeasible. Due to the wearability concerns, low-power techniques are
critical for e-textile applications. In this paper, we address the issue of the
energy-aware routing for e-textile platforms and propose an efficient algorithm
to solve it. The platform we consider consists of dedicated components for
e-textiles, including computational modules, dedicated transmission lines and
thin-film batteries on fiber substrates. Furthermore, we derive an analytical
upper bound for the achievable number of jobs completed over all possible
routing strategies. From a practical standpoint, for the Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES) cipher, the routing technique we propose achieves about fifty
percent of this analytical upper bound. Moreover, compared to the
non-energy-aware counterpart, our routing technique increases the number of
encryption jobs completed by one order of magnitude.
