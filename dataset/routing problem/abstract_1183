This paper presents a new key predistribution scheme for sensor networks
based on structured graphs. Structured graphs are advantageous in that they can
be optimized to minimize the parameter of interest. The proposed approach
achieves a balance between the number of keys per node, path lengths, network
diameter and the complexity of routing algorithm.
