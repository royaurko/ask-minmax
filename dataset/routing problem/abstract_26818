In this paper, we study the effects of the interparticle interaction range on
heat flow. We show that, by increasing the interaction range, we may amplify
the thermal conductivity and even change the regime of heat transport. More
importantly, considering a crucial problem of phononics, namely, the search of
a suitable thermal diode, we investigate the range effects in some graded
systems in which thermal rectification is a ubiquitous phenomenon. In such
graded models, we show that long range interactions may significatively
increase the rectification power and may avoid its decay with the system size,
thus solving relevant problems of the usual proposals of rectifiers. Our
results indicate that graded materials are genuine candidates for the actual
fabrication of thermal diodes.
