I consider the problem of the evaluation of the orthopositronium decay rate,
including second order radiative corrections. I present a brief theoretical
discussion of this problem and a review of the results available in literature,
and, then, I analyze some $O(\alpha^2)$ annihilation-type contributions,
recently computed.
