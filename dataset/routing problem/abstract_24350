A graph homomorphism is a vertex map which carries edges from a source graph
to edges in a target graph. The instances of the Weighted Maximum H-Colourable
Subgraph problem (MAX H-COL) are edge-weighted graphs G and the objective is to
find a subgraph of G that has maximal total edge weight, under the condition
that the subgraph has a homomorphism to H; note that for H=K_k this problem is
equivalent to MAX k-CUT. Farnqvist et al. have introduced a parameter on the
space of graphs that allows close study of the approximability properties of
MAX H-COL. Specifically, it can be used to extend previously known
(in)approximability results to larger classes of graphs. Here, we investigate
the properties of this parameter on circular complete graphs K_{p/q}, where 2
<= p/q <= 3. The results are extended to K_4-minor-free graphs and graphs with
bounded maximum average degree. We also consider connections with Samal's work
on fractional covering by cuts: we address, and decide, two conjectures
concerning cubical chromatic numbers.
