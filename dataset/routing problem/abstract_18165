We address the solution of a large class of convex mixed-integer nonlinear
programming problems. The model we are considering generalizes problems that
are commonly considered in portfolio optimization, such as the risk-averse
capital budgeting problem. In our generalization we allow to take into account
integer and continuous variables as well as an arbitrary weighting of the risk.
In order to exactly solve our model, we propose a branch-and-bound method based
on the computation of dual bounds via the solution of the primal relaxation. A
Frank-Wolfe type algorithm is devised for solving the continuous relaxation at
every node of the branch-and-bound tree. A numerical evaluation on real-world
instances, including a comparison with CPLEX 12.6, is presented.
