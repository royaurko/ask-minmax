This is an introduction to small divisors problems. The material treated in
this book was brought together for a PhD course I tought at the University of
Pisa in the spring of 1999. Here is a Table of Contents: Part I One Dimensional
Small Divisors. Yoccoz's Theorems 1. Germs of Analytic Diffeomorphisms.
Linearization 2. Topological Stability vs. Analytic Linearizability 3. The
Quadratic Polynomial: Yoccoz's Proof of the Siegel Theorem 4. Douady-Ghys'
Theorem. Continued Fractions and the Brjuno Function 5. Siegel-Brjuno Theorem,
Yoccoz's Theorem. Some Open Problems 6. Small Divisors and Loss of
Differentiability Part II Implicit Function Theorems and KAM Theory 7.
Hamiltonian Systems and Integrable Systems 8. Quasi-Integrable Hamiltonian
Systems 9. Nash-Moser's Implicit Function Theorem 10. From Nash-Moser's Theorem
to KAM: Normal Form of Vector Fields on the Torus Appendices A1.
Uniformization, Distorsion and Quasi-conformal maps A2. Continued Fractions A3.
Distributions, Hyperfunctions. Hypoellipticity and Diophantine Conditions
