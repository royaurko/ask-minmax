Parameter identification problems are formulated in a probabilistic language,
where the randomness reflects the uncertainty about the knowledge of the true
values. This setting allows conceptually easily to incorporate new information,
e.g. through a measurement, by connecting it to Bayes's theorem. The unknown
quantity is modelled as a (may be high-dimensional) random variable. Such a
description has two constituents, the measurable function and the measure. One
group of methods is identified as updating the measure, the other group changes
the measurable function. We connect both groups with the relatively recent
methods of functional approximation of stochastic problems, and introduce
especially in combination with the second group of methods a new procedure
which does not need any sampling, hence works completely deterministically. It
also seems to be the fastest and more reliable when compared with other
methods. We show by example that it also works for highly nonlinear non-smooth
problems with non-Gaussian measures.
