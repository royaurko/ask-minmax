The "easy" problem of cognitive science is explaining how and why we can do
what we can do. The "hard" problem is explaining how and why we feel. Turing's
methodology for cognitive science (the Turing Test) is based on doing: Design a
model that can do anything a human can do, indistinguishably from a human, to a
human, and you have explained cognition. Searle has shown that the successful
model cannot be solely computational. Sensory-motor robotic capacities are
necessary to ground some, at least, of the model's words, in what the robot can
do with the things in the world that the words are about. But even grounding is
not enough to guarantee that -- nor to explain how and why -- the model feels
(if it does). That problem is much harder to solve (and perhaps insoluble).
