We consider the problem of controller synthesis under imperfect information
in a setting where there is a set of available observable predicates equipped
with a cost function. The problem that we address is the computation of a
subset of predicates sufficient for control and whose cost is minimal. Our
solution avoids a full exploration of all possible subsets of predicates and
reuses some information between different iterations. We apply our approach to
timed systems. We have developed a tool prototype and analyze the performance
of our optimization algorithm on two case studies.
