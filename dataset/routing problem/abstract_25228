The effectiveness of utility-maximization techniques for portfolio management
relies on our ability to estimate correctly the parameters of the dynamics of
the underlying financial assets. In the setting of complete or incomplete
financial markets, we investigate whether small perturbations of the market
coefficient processes lead to small changes in the agent's optimal behavior
derived from the solution of the related utility-maximization problems.
Specifically, we identify the topologies on the parameter process space and the
solution space under which utility-maximization is a continuous operation, and
we provide a counterexample showing that our results are best possible, in a
certain sense. A novel result about the structure of the solution of the
utility-maximization problem where prices are modeled by continuous
semimartingales is established as an offshoot of the proof of our central
theorem.
