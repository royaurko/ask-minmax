We give an induction-free axiom system for diophantine correct open
induction. We relate the problem of whether a finitely generated ring of
Puiseux polynomials is diophantine correct to a problem about the
value-distribution of a tuple of semialgebraic functions with integer
arguments. We use this result, and a theorem of Bergelson and Leibman on
generalized polynomials, to identify a class of diophantine correct subrings of
the field of descending Puiseux series with real coefficients.
