The contribution of the charged right-handed higgsino fields to the chargino
mass spectrum in the context of the Left-Right Supersymmetric Model is studied.
Analytical expressions for the chargino masses assuming arbitrary CP-violating
phases are given. Also, the corresponding inverse parameter problem is studied.
Analytical disentangling of some relevant parameters is presented. A general
inversion algorithm, based on suitable measurement of cross-section type
observables associated to chargino pair production in electron positron
annihilation, is proposed.
