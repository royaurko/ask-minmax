We analyze a class of initial-boundary value problems for the
Degasperis-Procesi equation on the half-line. Assuming that the solution
$u(x,t)$ exists, we show that it can be recovered from its initial and boundary
values via the solution of a Riemann-Hilbert problem formulated in the plane of
the complex spectral parameter $k$.
