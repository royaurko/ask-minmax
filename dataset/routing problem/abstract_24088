We describe structure of the T-matrices, scattering matrices, and Green
functions on unphysical energy sheets in multichannel scattering problems with
binary channels and in the three-body problem. Based on the explicit
representations obtained for the values of T- and S-matrices on the unphysical
sheets, we prove that the resonances belonging to an unphysical sheet are just
those energies where the correspondingly truncated scattering matrix, taken in
the physical sheet, has eigenvalue zero. We show, in addition, that
eigenvectors of the truncated scattering matrix associated with its zero
eigenvalue are formed of the breakup amplitudes for the respective resonant
states.
