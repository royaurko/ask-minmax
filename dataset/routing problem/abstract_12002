This is the second in a series of papers. Here we develop here an
intersection theory for manifolds equipped with an action of a finite group. As
in our previous paper, our approach will be homotopy theoretic, enabling us to
circumvent the specter of equivariant transversality.
  This theory has applications to embedding problems, equivariant fixed point
theory and the problem of enumerating the periodic points of a self map of a
compact smooth manifold.
