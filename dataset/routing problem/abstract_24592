We use p-values as a discrepancy criterion for identifying the threshold
value at which a regression function takes off from its baseline value -- a
problem that is motivated by applications in omics experiments, systems
engineering, pharmacological dose-response studies and astronomy. In this
paper, we study the problem in a controlled sampling setting, where multiple
responses, discrete or continuous, can be obtained at a number of different
covariate-levels. Our procedure involves testing the hypothesis that the
regression function is at its baseline at each covariate value using the
sampled responses at that value and then computing the p-value of the test. An
estimate of the threshold is provided by fitting a stump, i.e., a piecewise
constant function with a single jump discontinuity, to the observed p-values,
since the corresponding p-values behave in markedly different ways on different
sides of the threshold. The estimate is shown to be consistent, as both the
number of covariate values and the number of responses sampled at each value
become large, and its finite sample properties are studied through an extensive
simulation study. Our approach is computationally simple and can also be used
to estimate the baseline value of the regression function. The procedure is
illustrated on two motivating real data applications. Extensions to multiple
thresholds are also briefly investigated.
