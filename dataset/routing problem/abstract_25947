Recently the AAGL (Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld-Lemieux) has been proposed which
can be used for RFID tags. We give algorithms for the problem (we call the
MSCSPv) on which the security of the AAGL protocol is based upon. Hence we give
various attacks for general parameters on the recent AAGL protocol proposed.
One of our attacks is a deterministic algorithm which has space complexity and
time complexity both atleast exponentialin the worst case. In a better case
using a probabilistic algorithm the time complexity canbe
O(|XSS(ui')^L5*(n^(1+e)) and the space complexity can be O(|XSS(ui')|^L6),
where the element ui' is part of a public key, n is the index of braid group,
XSS is a summit type set and e is a constant in a limit. The above shows the
AAGL protocol is potentially not significantly more secure as using key
agreement protocols based on the conjugacy problem such as the AAG
(Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld) protocol because both protocols can be broken with
complexity which do not significantly differ. We think our attacks can be
improved.
