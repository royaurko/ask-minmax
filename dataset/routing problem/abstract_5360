Given a consumer data-set, the axioms of revealed preference proffer a binary
test for rational behaviour. A natural (non-binary) measure of the degree of
rationality exhibited by the consumer is the minimum number of data points
whose removal induces a rationalisable data-set. We study the computational
complexity of the resultant consumer rationality problem in this paper. We
explain how to formulate this problem in terms of a directed revealed
preference graph and show, for markets with a large number of commodities, that
it is equivalent (in terms of approximation) to the directed feedback vertex
set problem. Our main result is to obtain an exact threshold on the number of
commodities that separates easy cases and hard cases. Specifically, for
two-commodity markets the consumer rationality problem is polynomial time
solvable; we prove this via a reduction to the vertex cover problem on perfect
graphs. For three-commodity markets, however, the problem is NP-complete; we
prove this using a reduction from planar 3-sat that is based upon oriented-disc
drawings.
