Self-consistent solutions to the spinor, scalar and BI gravitational field
equations are obtained. The problems of initial singularity and asymptotically
isotropization process of the initially anisotropic space-time are studied. It
is also shown that the introduction of the Cosmological constant
($\Lambda$-term) in the Lagrangian generates oscillations of the BI model,
which is not the case in absence of $\Lambda$ term.
