The traditional Standard Quantum Mechanics is unable to solve the
Spin-Statistics problem, i.e. to justify the utterly important Pauli Exclusion
Principle. We show that this is due to the non completeness of the standard
theory due to an arguable conception of the spin as a vector characterizing the
rotational properties of the elementary particles. The present Article presents
a complete and straightforward solution of the Spin-Statistics problem on the
basis of the Conformal Quantum Geometrodynamics, a theory that has been proved
to reproduce successfully all relevant processes of the Standard Quantum
Mechanics based on the Dirac or Schr\"odinger equations, including Heisenberg
uncertainty relations and nonlocal EPR correlations. When applied to a system
made of many identical particles, an additional property of all elementary
particles enters naturally into play: the intrinsic helicity. This property
determines the correct Spin-Statistics connection observed in Nature.
