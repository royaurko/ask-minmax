We study the discrete nonlinear Schr\"oinger equation with weak disorder,
focusing on the regime when the nonlinearity is, on the one hand, weak enough
for the normal modes of the linear problem to remain well resolved, but on the
other, strong enough for the dynamics of the normal mode amplitudes to be
chaotic for almost all modes. We show that in this regime and in the limit of
high temperature, the macroscopic density $\rho$ satisfies the nonlinear
diffusion equation with a density-dependent diffusion coefficient,
$D(\rho)=D_0\rho^2$. An explicit expression for $D_0$ is obtained in terms of
the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the linear problem, which is then
evaluated numerically. The role of the second conserved quantity (energy) in
the transport is also quantitatively discussed.
