It is found that the statistical level fluctuations of the AQC 3-SAT problem
undergo a transition from a poisson (regular) fluctuation form to a form
consistent with the predictions of Random Matrix Theory. We present data which
suggests this transition correlates with the computational phase transition in
the classical 3-SAT problem. Application to Gaussian Processes and implication
for experiment is discussed.
