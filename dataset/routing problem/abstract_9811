In this work, we introduce bidirectional collision detection --- a new
algorithmic tool that applies to the collision problems that arise in many
isomorphism problems. For the group isomorphism problem, we show that
bidirectional collision detection yields a deterministic n^((1 / 2) log n +
O(1)) time algorithm whereas previously the n^(log n + O(1))
generator-enumeration algorithm was the best result for several decades. For
the hard special case of solvable groups, we combine bidirectional collision
detection with methods from the contributor's previous work to obtain a
deterministic square-root speedup over the best previous algorithm. We also
show a deterministic square-root speedup over the best previous algorithm for
testing isomorphism of rings. We can even apply bidirectional collision
detection to the graph isomorphism problem to obtain a deterministic T^(1 /
sqrt(2)) speedup over the best previous deterministic algorithm. Although the
space requirements for our algorithms are greater than those for previous
deterministic isomorphism tests, we show time-space tradeoffs that interpolate
between the resource requirements of our algorithms and previous work.
