Twin prime number problem is mainly the structure of the twin prime numbers
and whether there are infinitely many prime twins group. In this paper, by
constructing a special cluster number set(see formula(2.3)in the paper), proves
that the number of set number of the first n columns set the intersection of
the minimum number of q is decision of the prime twins (q, q+2), and the
minimum number of series is divergent(see Theorem 2).The main rezults are
Theorem 2,Theorem 3 and Theorem 4.Prime twins so thoroughly proved there must
be infinitely many groups of twin prime conjecture.
