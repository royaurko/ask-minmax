The restricted circular three-body problem is considered for the following
parameter values $C=3.03$, $\mu=0.0009537$ - the values for {\em Oterma} comet
in the Sun-Jupiter system.
 We present a computer assisted proof of an existence of homo- and heteroclinic
cycle between two Lyapunov orbits and an existence of symbolic dynamics on four
symbols built on this cycle.
