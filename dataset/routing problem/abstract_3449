Classical vector analysis is the predominant formalism used by engineers of
computational electromagnetism, despite the fact that manifold as a theoretical
concept has existed for a century. This paper discusses the benefits of
manifolds over the traditional approach in practical problems of modelling.
With a structural approach, it outlines the role and interdependence of
coordinate systems, metric, constitutive equations, and fields, and relates
them to practical problems of quasi-static computational electromagnetics: mesh
generation, open-boundary problems, and electromagnetic-mechanical coupled
problems involving motion and deformation. The proposed procedures also imply
improvements to the flexibility of the modelling software.
