In the uncapacitated facility location problem, given a graph, a set of
demands and opening costs, it is required to find a set of facilities R, so as
to minimize the sum of the cost of opening the facilities in R and the cost of
assigning all node demands to open facilities. This paper concerns the robust
fault-tolerant version of the uncapacitated facility location problem (RFTFL).
In this problem, one or more facilities might fail, and each demand should be
supplied by the closest open facility that did not fail. It is required to find
a set of facilities R, so as to minimize the sum of the cost of opening the
facilities in R and the cost of assigning all node demands to open facilities
that did not fail, after the failure of up to \alpha facilities. We present a
polynomial time algorithm that yields a 6.5-approximation for this problem with
at most one failure and a 1.5 + 7.5\alpha-approximation for the problem with at
most \alpha > 1 failures. We also show that the RFTFL problem is NP-hard even
on trees, and even in the case of a single failure.
