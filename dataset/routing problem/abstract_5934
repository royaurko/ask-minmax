We consider the problem of designing incentive-compatible, ex-post
individually rational (IR) mechanisms for covering problems in the Bayesian
setting, where players' types are drawn from an underlying distribution and may
be correlated, and the goal is to minimize the expected total payment made by
the mechanism. We formulate a notion of incentive compatibility (IC) that we
call {\em robust Bayesian IC} (robust BIC) that is substantially more robust
than BIC, and develop black-box reductions from robust-BIC mechanism design to
algorithm design. For single-dimensional settings, this black-box reduction
applies even when we only have an LP-relative {\em approximation algorithm} for
the algorithmic problem. Thus, we obtain near-optimal mechanisms for various
covering settings including single-dimensional covering problems, multi-item
procurement auctions, and multidimensional facility location.
