This paper aims to propose a direct approach to solve the Plateau's problem
in codimension higher than one. The problem is formulated as the minimization
of the Hausdorff measure among a family of $d$-rectifiable closed subsets of
$\mathbb R^n$: following the previous work \cite{DelGhiMag} the existence
result is obtained by a compactness principle valid under fairly general
assumptions on the class of competitors. Such class is then specified to give
meaning to boundary conditions. We also show that the obtained minimizers are
regular up to a set of dimension less than $(d-1)$.
