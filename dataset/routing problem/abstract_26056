The standard model of cosmology is investigated using time dependent
cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and Newton's gravitational constant $G$. The
total energy content is described by the modified Chaplygin gas equation of
state. It is found that the time dependent constants coupled with the modified
Chaplygin gas interpolate between the earlier matter to the later dark energy
dominated phase of the universe. We also achieve a convergence of parameter
$\omega\to-1$, with minute fluctuations, showing an evolving $\omega$. Thus our
model fairly alleviates the cosmic coincidence problem which demands
$\omega=-1$ at present time.
