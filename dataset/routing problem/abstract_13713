We consider the Editing to a Graph of Given Degrees problem that asks for a
graph G, non-negative integers d,k and a function \delta:V(G)->{1,...,d},
whether it is possible to obtain a graph G' from G such that the degree of v is
\delta(v) for any vertex v by at most k vertex or edge deletions or edge
additions. We construct an FPT-algorithm for Editing to a Graph of Given
Degrees parameterized by d+k. We complement this result by showing that the
problem has no polynomial kernel unless NP\subseteq coNP/poly.
