In this work we review, in the framework of the so-called brick wall model,
the divergence problem arising in the one loop calculations of various
thermodynamical quantities, like entropy, internal energy and heat capacity.
Particularly we find that, if one imposes that entanglement entropy is equal to
the Bekenstein-Hawking one, the model gives problematic results. Then a
proposal of solution to the divergence problem is made following the zeroth law
of black hole mechanics.
