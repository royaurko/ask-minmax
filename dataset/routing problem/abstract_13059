We consider a parabolic problem with degeneracy in the interior of the
spatial domain, and we focus on controllability results through Carleman
estimates for the associated adjoint problem. The novelty of the present paper
is that the degeneracy is also in the interior of the control region, so that
no previous result can be adapted to this situation.
