We discuss recent developments on branching problems of irreducible unitary
representations $\pi$ of real reductive groups when restricted to reductive
subgroups. Highlighting the case where the underlying $(g,K)$-modules of $\pi$
are isomorphic to Zuckerman's derived functor modules $A_q(\lambda)$, we show
various and rich features of branching laws such as infinite multiplicities,
irreducible restrictions, multiplicity-free restrictions, and discrete
decomposable restrictions. We also formulate a number of conjectures.
