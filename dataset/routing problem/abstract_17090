Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies allow new methodologies for
alternative splicing (AS) analysis. Current computational methods for AS from
NGS data are mainly focused on predicting splice site junctions or de novo
assembly of full-length transcripts. These methods are computationally
expensive and produce a huge number of full-length transcripts or splice
junctions, spanning the whole genome of organisms. Thus summarizing such data
into the different gene structures and AS events of the expressed genes is an
hard task.
  To face this issue in this paper we investigate the computational problem of
reconstructing from NGS data, in absence of the genome, a gene structure for
each gene that is represented by the isoform graph: we introduce such graph and
we show that it uniquely summarizes the gene transcripts. We define the
computational problem of reconstructing the isoform graph and provide some
conditions that must be met to allow such reconstruction.
  Finally, we describe an efficient algorithmic approach to solve this problem,
validating our approach with both a theoretical and an experimental analysis.
