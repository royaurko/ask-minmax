This article is devoted to review the known results on global well-posedness
for the Cauchy problem to the Kirchhoff equation and Kirchhoff systems with
small data. Similar results will be obtained for the initial-boundary value
problems in exterior domains with compact boundary. Also, the known results on
large data problems will be reviewed together with open problems.
