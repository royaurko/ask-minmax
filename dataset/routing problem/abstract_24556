In this article we study Foelner sequences for operators and mention their
relation to spectral approximation problems. We construct a canonical Foelner
sequence for the crossed product of a discrete amenable group $\Gamma$ with a
concrete C*-algebra A with a Foelner sequence. We also state a compatibility
condition for the action of $\Gamma$ on A. We illustrate our results with two
examples: the rotation algebra (which contains interesting operators like
almost Mathieu operators or periodic magnetic Schr\"odinger operators on
graphs) and the C*-algebra generated by bounded Jacobi operators. These
examples can be interpreted in the context of crossed products. The crossed
products considered can be also seen as a more general frame that included the
set of generalized band-dominated operators.
