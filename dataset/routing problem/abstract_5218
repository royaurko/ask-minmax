In this paper we present further studies of recurrent configurations of
Chip-firing games on Eulerian directed graphs (simple digraphs), a class on the
way from undirected graphs to general directed graphs. A computational problem
that arises naturally from this model is to find the minimum number of chips of
a recurrent configuration, which we call the minimum recurrent configuration
(MINREC) problem. We point out a close relationship between MINREC and the
minimum feedback arc set (MINFAS) problem on Eulerian directed graphs, and
prove that both problems are NP-hard.
