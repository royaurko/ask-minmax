In this paper we consider stable marriage problem under the Monte Carlo
simulations. We investigate how correlation in lists of preferrences can affect
simulation results such as: relaxation time, time distribution of relaxation
times etc. We took into account attractiveness of individuals and it's
different types as well as personal taste.
