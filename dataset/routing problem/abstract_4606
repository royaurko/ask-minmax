We study the problem of recovery both the attenuation $a$ and the source $f$
in the attenuated X-ray transform in the plane. We study the linearization as
well. It turns out that there are natural Hamiltonian flow that determines
which singularities we can recover. If the perturbations $\delta a$, $\delta f$
are supported in a compact set that is non-trapping for that flow, then the
problem is well posed. Otherwise, it may not be, and least in the case of
radial $a$, $f$, it is not. We present uniqueness and non-uniqueness results
for both the linearized and the non-linear problem; as well as a H\"older
stability estimate.
