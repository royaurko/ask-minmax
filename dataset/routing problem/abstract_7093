In this paper, the proximal Gauss-Newton method for solving penalized
nonlinear least squares problems is studied. A local convergence analysis is
obtained under the assumption that the derivative of the function associated
with the penalized least square problem satisfies a majorant condition. Our
analysis provides a clear relationship between the majorant function and the
function associated with the penalized least squares problem. The convergence
for two important special cases is also derived.
