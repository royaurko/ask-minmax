Security and privacy are the inherent problems in RFID communications. There
are several protocols have been proposed to overcome those problems. Hash chain
is commonly employed by the protocols to improve security and privacy for RFID
authentication. Although the protocols able to provide specific solution for
RFID security and privacy problems, they fail to provide integrated solution.
This article is a survey to closely observe those protocols in terms of its
focus and limitations.
