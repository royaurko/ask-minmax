In this work, we study the problem of power allocation and adaptive
modulation in teams of decision makers. We consider the special case of two
teams with each team consisting of two mobile agents. Agents belonging to the
same team communicate over wireless ad hoc networks, and they try to split
their available power between the tasks of communication and jamming the nodes
of the other team. The agents have constraints on their total energy and
instantaneous power usage. The cost function adopted is the difference between
the rates of erroneously transmitted bits of each team. We model the adaptive
modulation problem as a zero-sum matrix game which in turn gives rise to a a
continuous kernel game to handle power control. Based on the communications
model, we present sufficient conditions on the physical parameters of the
agents for the existence of a pure strategy saddle-point equilibrium (PSSPE).
