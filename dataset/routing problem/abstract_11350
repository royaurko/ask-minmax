Brane inflation can provide a promissing framework for solving the
fine-tuning problem in standard inflationary models. The aim of this paper is
to illustrate the mechanism by which this can be achieved. By considering the
supersymmetric two-stage inflation model it is shown that the initial
fine-tuning of the coupling parameter can be considerably relaxed. SubPlanckian
values of the inflaton during inflation can also be obtained.
