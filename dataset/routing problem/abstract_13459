A perfect cuboid is a rectangular parallelepiped with integer edges, integer
face diagonals, and integer space diagonal. Such cuboids have not yet been
found, but nor has their existence been disproved. Perfect cuboids are
described by a certain system of Diophantine equations possessing an intrinsic
$S_3$ symmetry. Recently these equations were factorized with respect to this
$S_3$ symmetry and the factor equations were transformed into $E$-form. As
appears, the transformed factor equations are explicitly solvable. Based on
this solution, polynomial inverse problems are formulated in the present paper.
