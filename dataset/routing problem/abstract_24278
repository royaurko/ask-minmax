Woodall and Montgomery [35] in a discussion paper, state that multivariate
process control is one of the most rapidly developing sections of statistical
process control. Nowadays, in industry, there are many situations in which the
simultaneous monitoring or control, of two or more related quality - process
characteristics is necessary. Process monitoring problems in which several
related variables are of interest are collectively known as Multivariate
Statistical Process Control (MSPC).This article has three parts. In the first
part, we discuss in brief the basic procedures for the implementation of
multivariate statistical process control via control charting. In the second
part we present the most useful procedures for interpreting the out-of-control
variable when a control charting procedure gives an out-of-control signal in a
multivariate process. Finally, in the third part, we present applications of
multivariate statistical process control in the area of industrial process
control, informatics, and business.
