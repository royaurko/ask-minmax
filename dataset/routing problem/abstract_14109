This work considers the problem of numerically approximating statistical
moments of a Quantity of Interest (QoI) that depends on the solution of a time
dependent linear parabolic partial differential equation. The geometry is
assumed to be random and is parameterized by N random variables. The parabolic
problem is remapped to a fixed deterministic domain with random coefficients
and shown to admit an extension to a well defined region in C^{N} with respect
to the random variables. To compute the stochastic moments of the QoI, a a
Smolyak sparse grid stochastic collocation method is used. To confirm the
convergence rates, a comparison to numerical experiments is performed.
