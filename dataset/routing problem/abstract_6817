A class of evolutionary operator equations is studied. As an application the
equations of linear acoustics are considered with complex material laws. A
dynamic boundary condition is imposed which in the time-harmonic case
corresponds to an impedance or Robin boundary condition. Memory and delay
effects in the interior and also on the boundary are built into the problem
class.
