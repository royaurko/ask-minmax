This paper is concerned with the basic model for compressible and
incompressible two phase flows with phase transitions The flows are separated
by nearly flat interface represented as a graph over the $N-1$ dimensional
Euclidean space ${\Bbb R}^{N-1}$ ($N \geq 2$). The local well-posedness is
proved by the Banach fixed point theorem based on the maximal $L_p$-$L_q$
regularity theorm for the linearized problem.
