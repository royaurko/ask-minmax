The Matrix Torsion Problem (MTP) is: given a square matrix M with rational
entries, decide whether two distinct powers of M are equal. It has been shown
by Cassaigne and the contributor that the MTP reduces to the Matrix Power Problem
(MPP) in polynomial time: given two square matrices A and B with rational
entries, the MTP is to decide whether B is a power of A. Since the MPP is
decidable in polynomial time, it is also the case of the MTP. However, the
algorithm for MPP is highly non-trivial. The aim of this note is to present a
simple, direct, polynomial-time algorithm for the MTP.
