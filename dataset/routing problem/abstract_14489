In this article we study plank type problems for polynomials on a Banach
space $X$. Our aim is to find sufficient conditions on the positive real
numbers $a_1, \ldots, a_n,$ such that for continuous polynomials
$P_1,\ldots,P_n:X\rightarrow \mathbb C$ of degrees $k_1,\ldots,k_n$, there
exists a norm one element $\textbf{z}\in X$ for which $|P_i(\textbf{z})| \ge
a_i^{k_i}$ for $i=1,\ldots,n.$ In order to do this, we prove some new
inequalities for the norm of the product of polynomials, which are of an
independent interest.
