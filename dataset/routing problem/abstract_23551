Recently it has been argued that, because tachyonic matter satisfies the
Strong Energy Condition [SEC], there is little hope of avoiding the
singularities which plague S-Brane spacetimes. Meanwhile, however, Townsend and
Wohlfarth have suggested an ingenious way of circumventing the SEC in such
situations, and other suggestions for actually violating it in the S-Brane
context have recently been proposed. Of course, the natural context for
discussions of [effective or actual] violations of the SEC is the theory of
asymptotically deSitter spacetimes, which tend to be less singular than
ordinary FRW spacetimes. However, while violating or circumventing the SEC is
necessary if singularities are to be avoided, it is not at all clear that it is
sufficient. That is, we can ask: would an asymptotically deSitter S-brane
spacetime be non-singular? We show that this is difficult to achieve; this
result is in the spirit of the recently proved "S-brane singularity theorem".
Essentially our results suggest that circumventing or violating the SEC may not
suffice to solve the S-Brane singularity problem, though we do propose two ways
of avoiding this conclusion.
