The problem of pattern selection arises when the evolution equations have
many solutions, whereas observed patterns constitute a much more restricted
set. An approach is advanced for treating the problem of pattern selection by
defining the probability distribution of patterns. Then the most probable
pattern naturally corresponds to the largest probability weight. This approach
provides the ordering principle for the multiplicity of solutions explaining
why some of them are more preferable than other. The approach is applied to
solving the problem of turbulent photon filamentation in resonant media.
