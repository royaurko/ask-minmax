The method of flow equations is applied to QED on the light front. Requiring
that the partical number conserving terms in the Hamiltonian are considered to
be diagonal and the other terms off-diagonal an effective Hamiltonian is
obtained which reduces the positronium problem to a two-particle problem, since
the particle number violating contributions are eliminated. No infrared
divergencies appear. The ultraviolet renormalization can be performed
simultaneously.
