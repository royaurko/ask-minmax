The Coulomb problem for vector bosons W(+/-) propagating in an attractive
Coulomb field incorporates a known difficulty, i.e. the total charge of the
boson localized on the Coulomb center turns out infinite. This fact contradicts
the renormalizability of the Standard model, which presumes that at small
distances all physical quantities are well defined. The paradox is shown to be
resolved by the QED vacuum polarization, which brings in a strong effective
repulsion and eradicates the infinite charge of the boson on the Coulomb
center. The effect makes the Coulomb problem for vector bosons well defined and
consistent with the Standard Model.
