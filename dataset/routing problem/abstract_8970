A commonly experienced problem with population based optimisation methods is
the gradual decline in population diversity that tends to occur over time. This
can slow a system's progress or even halt it completely if the population
converges on a local optimum from which it cannot escape. In this paper we
present the Fitness Uniform Deletion Scheme (FUDS), a simple but somewhat
unconventional approach to this problem. Under FUDS the deletion operation is
modified to only delete those individuals which are "common" in the sense that
there exist many other individuals of similar fitness in the population. This
makes it impossible for the population to collapse to a collection of highly
related individuals with similar fitness. Our experimental results on a range
of optimisation problems confirm this, in particular for deceptive optimisation
problems the performance is significantly more robust to variation in the
selection intensity.
