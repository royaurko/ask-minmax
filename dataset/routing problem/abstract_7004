We investigate the hardness of establishing as many stable marriages (that
is, marriages that last forever) in a population whose memory is placed in some
arbitrary state with respect to the considered problem, and where traitors try
to jeopardize the whole process by behaving in a harmful manner. On the
negative side, we demonstrate that no solution that is completely insensitive
to traitors can exist, and we propose a protocol for the problem that is
optimal with respect to the traitor containment radius.
