Using a result of M. Hochster and C. Huneke on $F$-rational rings a criterion
for complete intersection rings of characteristic $p>0$ is presented. As an
application, we give a completely different proof for an algebraic result of G.
Faltings that was used by Taylor and Wiles in \cite{TW} for a simplification of
the proof of the minimal deformation problem.
