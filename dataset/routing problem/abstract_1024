A Hubbard model with a single, partially flat band has ferromagnetic ground
states. It is shown that local stability of ferromagnetism implies its global
stability in such a model: The model has only ferromagnetic ground states if
there are no single spin-flip ground states. Since a single-band Hubbard model
away from half filling describes a metal, this result may open a route to
metallic ferromagnetism in single band Hubbard models.
