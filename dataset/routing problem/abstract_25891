A dynamical programming approach is used to deal with the problem of
controlling the directed abelian Dhar-Ramaswamy model on two-dimensional square
lattice. Two strategies are considered to obtain explicit results to this task.
First, the optimal solution of the problem is characterized by the solution of
the Bellman equation obtained by numerical algorithms. Second, the solution is
used as a benchmark to value how far from the optimum other heuristics that can
be applied to larger systems are. This approach is the first attempt on the
direction of schemes for controlling self-organized criticality that are based
on optimization principles that consider explicitly a tradeoff between the size
of the avalanches and the cost of intervention.
