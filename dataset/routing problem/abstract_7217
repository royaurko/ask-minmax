This paper gives an overview of recent research on the performance evaluation
and design of carousel systems. We discuss picking strategies for problems
involving one carousel, consider the throughput of the system for problems
involving two carousels, give an overview of related problems in this area, and
present an extensive literature review. Emphasis has been given on future
research directions in this area.
