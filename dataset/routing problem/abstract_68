A new approach to the static route planning problem, based on a multi-staging
concept and a \emph{scope} notion, is presented. The main goal (besides implied
efficiency of planning) of our approach is to address---with a solid
theoretical foundation---the following two practically motivated aspects: a
\emph{route comfort} and a very \emph{limited storage} space of a small
navigation device, which both do not seem to be among the chief objectives of
many other studies. We show how our novel idea can tackle both these seemingly
unrelated aspects at once, and may also contribute to other established route
planning approaches with which ours can be naturally combined. We provide a
theoretical proof that our approach efficiently computes exact optimal routes
within this concept, as well as we demonstrate with experimental results on
publicly available road networks of the US the good practical performance of
the solution.
