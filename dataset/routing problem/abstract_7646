Hankel tensors arise from signal processing and some other applications. SOS
(sum-of-squares) tensors are positive semi-definite symmetric tensors, but not
vice versa. The problem for determining an even order symmetric tensor is an
SOS tensor or not is equivalent to solving a semi-infinite linear programming
problem, which can be done in polynomial time. On the other hand, the problem
for determining an even order symmetric tensor is positive semi-definite or not
is NP-hard. In this paper, we study SOS-Hankel tensors. Currently, there are
two known positive semi-definite Hankel tensor classes: even order complete
Hankel tensors and even order strong Hankel tensors. We show complete Hankel
tensors are strong Hankel tensors, and even order strong Hankel tensors are
SOS-Hankel tensors. We give several examples of positive semi-definite Hankel
tensors, which are not strong Hankel tensors. However, all of them are still
SOS-Hankel tensors. Does there exist a positive semi-definite non-SOS-Hankel
tensor? The answer to this question remains open. If the answer to this
question is no, then the problem for determining an even order Hankel tensor is
positive semi-definite or not is solvable in polynomial-time. An application of
SOS-Hankel tensors to the positive semi-definite tensor completion problem is
discussed. We present an ADMM algorithm for solving this problem. Some
preliminary numerical results on this algorithm are reported.
