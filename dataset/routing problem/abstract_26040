The paper considers the problem of finding the largest possible set P(n), a
subset of the set N of the natural numbers, with the property that a number is
in P(n) if and only if it is a sum of n distinct naturals all in P(n) or none
in P(n). Here largest is in the set theoretic sense and n is greater than or
equal to 2. We call P(n) a maximal set obeying this property. For small n say 2
or 3, it is possible to develop P(n) intuitively but we strongly felt the
necessity of an algorithm for any n greater than or equal to 2. Now P(n) shall
invariably be a infinite set so we define another set Q(n) such that
Q(n)=N-P(n), prove that Q(n) is finite and, since P(n) is automatically known
if Q(n) is known, design an algorithm of worst case O(1) complexity which
generates Q(n).
