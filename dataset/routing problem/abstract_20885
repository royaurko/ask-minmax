The theory of plasma emission and of electron cyclotron maser emission, and
their applications to solar radio bursts and to Jupiter's DAM and the Earth's
AKR are reviewed, emphasizing the early literature and problems that remain
unresolved. It is pointed out that there are quantitative measures of coherence
in radio astronomy that have yet to be explored either observationally or
theoretically.
