A positive function (conductivity) on the edges of a graph induces the
Dirichlet-to- Neumann map between boundary values of harmonic functions. The
inverse conductivity problem is to find the conductivity from the
Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. We will show that the map from logarithm of
conductivity to the certain logarithms of the determinants of the submatrices
of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map is linear(!) and so the solution of the inverse
problem is reduced to solution of the system of linear equations that arise
from disjoint paths in the graph. We will make a calculation for a simple
tensor product lattice graph and conjecture that it generalizes to planar and
three dimensional graphs and also to the continuous case. Depending on the
graph the algorithm resembles or not the layer-stripping.
