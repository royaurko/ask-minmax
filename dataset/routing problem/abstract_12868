We present a new isogeometric method for the discretization of the
Reissner-Mindlin plate bending problem. The proposed scheme follows a recent
theoretical framework that makes possible to construct a space of smooth
discrete deflections $W_h$ and a space of smooth discrete rotations $\Rots_h$
such that the Kirchhoff contstraint is exactly satisfied at the limit.
Therefore we obtain a formulation which is natural from the
theoretical/mechanical viewpoint and locking free by construction.
