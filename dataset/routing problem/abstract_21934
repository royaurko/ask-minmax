The problem of characterizing weak limits of sequences of solutions for a
non-linear diffusion equation of $p$-laplacian type is addressed. It is
formulated in terms of certain moments of underlying Young measures associated
with main fields corresponding to the non-linear equation. We show two main
results. One is a necessary condition; the other one a sufficient counterpart.
Unlike the linear case, those two conditions do not match.
