In this paper, the oxidation-assisted dealloying (OAD) of Cu0.7Al0.3 films
with different microstructures which were obtained by high vacuum annealing at
different temperatures were studied using powder X-ray diffraction,
field-emission scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray
analysis. It was observed that different microstructures such as eutectic
mixture or solid solution, the grain size of Cu or Al component in
eutectic-mixture Cu0.7Al0.3 films affected the corrosion morphology greatly. It
thus provided a practical route to fabricate flexible CuO porous
nanostructure-films (PNFs) with controllable pore size, porosity, block size
and shape. Further, the underlying OAD mechanisms for the structure-resultant
different corrosion morphologies of Cu0.7Al0.3 films were also explored. In
these senses, the study is suggestive and crucial to both the mechanism
understanding of OAD process and the technical controlling of PNF fabrication.
