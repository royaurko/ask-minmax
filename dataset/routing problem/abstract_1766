It was suggested that the two consecutive metamagnetic transitions and the
large residual resistivity discovered in Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ can be understood
via the nematic order and its domains in a single layer system. However, a
recently reported anisotropy between two longitudinal resistivities induced by
tilting the magnetic field away from the c-axis cannot be explained within the
single layer nematic picture. To fill the gap in our understanding within the
nematic order scenario, we investigate the effects of bilayer coupling and
in-plane magnetic field on the electronic nematic phases in a bilayer system.
We propose that the in-plane magnetic field in the bilayer system modifies the
energetics of the domain formation, since it breaks the degeneracy of two
different nematic orientations. Thus the system reveals a pure nematic phase
with a resistivity anisotropy in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. In
addition to the nematic phase, the bilayer coupling opens a novel route to a
hidden nematic phase that preserves the x-y symmetry of the Fermi surfaces.
