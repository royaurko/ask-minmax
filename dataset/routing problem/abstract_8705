The partition function on the three-sphere of ABJ theory can be rewritten
into a partition function of a non-interacting Fermi gas, with an accompanying
one-particle Hamiltonian. We study the spectral problem defined by this
Hamiltonian. We determine the exact WKB quantization condition, which involves
quantities from refined topological string theory, and test it successfully
against numerical calculations of the spectrum.
