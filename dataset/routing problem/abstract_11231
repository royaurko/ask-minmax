We look at the covariant techniques and the ideas on constraints and
gauge-invariance, which were recently employed in [gr-qc/0702104] to support
earlier work by the same contributors. That work was criticised in [gr-qc/0503042].
Using very simple and well known examples we show that, when adopted, the
methods and views of [gr-qc/0702104] lead to basic-level mathematical problems,
with analogous consequences for the physics. We provide a few simple rules that
should help to avoid similar problems in the future.
