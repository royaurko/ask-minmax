In this paper we address the problem of locating a new facility on a
$d$-dimensional space when the distance measure ($\ell_p$- or polyhedral-norms)
is different at each one of the sides of a given hyperplane $\mathcal{H}$. We
relate this problem with the physical phenomenon of refraction, and extends it
to any finite dimension space and different distances at each one of the sides
of any hyperplane. An application to this problem is the location of a facility
within or outside an urban area where different distance measures must be used.
We provide a new second order cone programming formulation, based on the
$\ell_p$-norm representation given in \cite{BPE2014} that allows to solve,
exactly, the problem in any finite dimension space with semidefinite
programming tools. We also extend the problem to the case where the hyperplane
is considered as a rapid transit media (a different third norm is also
considered over $\mathcal{H}$) that allows the demand to travel faster through
$\mathcal{H}$ to reach the new facility. Extensive computational experiments
run in Gurobi are reported in order to show the effectiveness of the approach.
