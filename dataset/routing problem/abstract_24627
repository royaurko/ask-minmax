We present a new skeletal representation along with a matching framework to
address the deformable shape recognition problem. The disconnectedness arises
as a result of excessive regularization that we use to describe a shape at an
attainably coarse scale. Our motivation is to rely on the stable properties of
the shape instead of inaccurately measured secondary details. The new
representation does not suffer from the common instability problems of
traditional connected skeletons, and the matching process gives quite
successful results on a diverse database of 2D shapes. An important difference
of our approach from the conventional use of the skeleton is that we replace
the local coordinate frame with a global Euclidean frame supported by
additional mechanisms to handle articulations and local boundary deformations.
As a result, we can produce descriptions that are sensitive to any combination
of changes in scale, position, orientation and articulation, as well as
invariant ones.
