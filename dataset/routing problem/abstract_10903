The discrete ordinates method with angular parameters is discussed in light
of the recent extension of its underlying hypothesis. The analysis shows that
the method, although it compares very well with the trajectory of photons
model, it addresses a boundary value problem different from the problem of flow
of energy in the interior of spheres
