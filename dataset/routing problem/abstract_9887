This work discusses the source broadcasting problem, i.e. transmitting a
source to many receivers via a broadcast channel. The optimal rate-distortion
region for this problem is unknown. The separation approach divides the problem
into two complementary problems: source successive refinement and broadcast
channel transmission. We provide bounds on the loss incorporated by applying
time-sharing and separation in source broadcasting. If the broadcast channel is
degraded, it turns out that separation-based time-sharing achieves at least a
factor of the joint source-channel optimal rate, and this factor has a positive
limit even if the number of receivers increases to infinity. For the AWGN
broadcast channel a better bound is introduced, implying that all achievable
joint source-channel schemes have a rate within one bit of the separation-based
achievable rate region for two receivers, or within $\log_2 T$ bits for $T$
receivers.
