Stimulated by the methods applied for the observational determination of
masses in the central regions of the AGNs, we examine the conditions under
which, in the interior of a gravitating perfect fluid source, the geodesic
motions and the general relativistic hydrodynamic flows are dynamically
equivalent to each other. Dynamical equivalence rests on the functional
similarity between the corresponding (covariantly expressed) differential
equations of motion and is obtained by conformal transformations. In this case,
the spaces of the solutions of these two kinds of motion are isomorphic. In
other words, given a solution to the problem "hydrodynamic flow in a perfect
fluid", one can always construct a solution formally equivalent to the problem
"geodesic motion of a fluid element" and vice versa. Accordingly, we show that,
the observationally determined nuclear mass of the AGNs is being overestimated
with respect to the real, physical one. We evaluate the corresponding
mass-excess and show that it is not always negligible with respect to the mass
ofthe central dark object, while, under circumstances, can be even larger than
the rest-mass of the circumnuclear gas involved.
