We consider the problem of representing the value of singular stochastic
control problems of linear diffusions as expected suprema. Setting the value
accrued from following a standard reflection policy equal with the expected
value of a unknown function at the running supremum of the underlying is shown
to result into a functional equation from which the unknown function can be
explicitly derived. We also consider the stopping problem associated with the
considered singular stochastic control problem and present a similar
representation as an expected supremum in terms of characteristics of the
control problem.
