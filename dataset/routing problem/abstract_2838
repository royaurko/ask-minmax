Our theme bases on the classical Hanoi Towers Problem. In this paper we will
define a new problem, permitting some positions, that were not legal in the
classical problem. Our goal is to find an optimal (shortest possible) sequence
of discs' moves. Besides that, we will research all versions of 3-pegs
classical problem with some special constraints, when some types of moves are
disallowed.
