A common problem in astronomy is the determination of the time shift between
two otherwise identical time series of measured flux from a variable source, in
short the determination of a time lag. Two examples of where this problem
occurs are in the determination of the Hubble constant from multiple images of
gravitationally lensed variable quasars and also in the determination of
distances to OH/IR stars. It is shown here that this problem can be seen as a
restricted inversion problem. It therefore can be solved using the subtractive
optimally localized averages (SOLA) method for inversion which has been
described elsewhere (Pijpers & Thompson 1992, 1994 ; Pijpers & Wanders 1994).
