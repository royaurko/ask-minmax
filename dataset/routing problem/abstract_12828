We consider a generalization of the $k$-flow set system auction where the set
to be procured by a customer corresponds to a feasible solution to a linear
programming problem where the coefficient matrix and right-hand-side together
constitute a totally unimodular matrix. Our results generalize and strengthen
bounds identified for several benchmarks, which form a crucial component in the
study of frugality ratios of truthful auction mechanisms.
