A square trisection is a problem of assembling three identical squares from a
larger square, using a minimal number of pieces. This paper presents an
historical overview of the square trisection problem starting with its origins
in the third century. We detail the reasoning behind some of the main known
solutions. Finally, we give a new solution and three ruler-and-compass
constructions. We conclude with a conjecture of optimality of the proposed
solution.
