We study the problem of learning Markov decision processes with finite state
and action spaces when the transition probability distributions and loss
functions are chosen adversarially and are allowed to change with time. We
introduce an algorithm whose regret with respect to any policy in a comparison
class grows as the square root of the number of rounds of the game, provided
the transition probabilities satisfy a uniform mixing condition. Our approach
is efficient as long as the comparison class is polynomial and we can compute
expectations over sample paths for each policy. Designing an efficient
algorithm with small regret for the general case remains an open problem.
