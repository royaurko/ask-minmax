We study a new class of ergodic backward stochastic differential equations
(EBSDEs for short) which is linked with semi-linear Neumann type boundary value
problems related to ergodic phenomenas. The particularity of these problems is
that the ergodic constant appears in Neumann boundary conditions. We study the
existence and uniqueness of solutions to EBSDEs and the link with partial
differential equations. Then we apply these results to optimal ergodic control
problems.
