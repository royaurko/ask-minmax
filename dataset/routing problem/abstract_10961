Nonlinear diffusion is studied in the presence of multiplicative noise. The
nonlinearity can be viewed as a ``wall'' limiting the motion of the diffusing
field. A dynamic phase transition occurs when the system ``unbinds'' from the
wall. Two different universality classes, corresponding to the cases of an
``upper'' and a ``lower'' wall, are identified and their critical properties
are characterized. While the lower wall problem can be understood by applying
the knowledge of linear diffusion with multiplicative noise, the upper wall
problem exhibits an anomaly due to nontrivial dynamics in the vicinity of the
wall. Broad power-law distribution is obtained throughout the bound phase.
