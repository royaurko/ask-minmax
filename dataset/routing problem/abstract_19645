Quantum hydrodynamics of interacting electrons with a parabolic single
particle spectrum is studied using the Calogero-Sutherland model. The effective
action and modulation equations, describing evolution of periodic excitations
in the fluid, are derived. Applications to the problem of a single electron
tunneling into the FQHE edge state are discussed.
