Among the problems still open in the study of stellar structure, we discuss
in particular some issues related to the study of convection. We have recently
built up complete stellar models, adopting a consistent formulation of
convection both in the non gray atmosphere and in the interior, to be used for
non adiabatic pulsational analysis, and discuss in some details two problems
which have been clarified by these models: the physical interpretation of one
of the main sequence "Boehm-Vitense gaps", and the necessity of parametrizing
pre main sequence convection differently from the main sequence convection. We
also report preliminary results of the application to the solar model of the
non--local turbulence equations by Canuto and Dubovikov (1998) in the
down-gradient approximation.
