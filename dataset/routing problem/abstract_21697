We consider a system of PDEs of Monge-Kantorovich type that, in the isotropic
case, describes the stationary configurations of two-layers models in granular
matter theory with a general source and a general boundary data. We propose a
new weak formulation which is consistent with the physical model and permits us
to prove existence and uniqueness results.
