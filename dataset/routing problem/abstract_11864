The Political Districting Problem is mapped to a $q$-state Potts model in
which the constraints can be written as interactions between sites or external
fields acting on the system. Districting into $q$ voter districts is equivalent
to finding the ground state of this $q$-state Potts model. We illustrate this
by districting Taipei city in its 2008 Legislature Election. Statistical
properties of the model are also studied.
