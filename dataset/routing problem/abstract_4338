In this paper, finite-time state consensus problems for continuous-time
multi-agent systems are discussed, and two distributive protocols, which ensure
that the states of agents reach an agreement in a finite time, are presented.
By employing the method of finite-time Lyapunov functions, we derive conditions
that guarantee the two protocols to solve the finite-time consensus problems
respectively. Moreover, one of the two protocols solves the finite-time
weighted-average consensus problem and can be successively applied to the
systems with switching topology. Upper bounds of convergence times are also
established. Simulations are presented to show the effectiveness of our
results.
