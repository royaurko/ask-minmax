We show that isothermic surfaces and S-Willmore surfaces are also the
solutions to the corresponding Blaschke's problem for both spacelike and
timelike surfaces in pseudo-Riemannian space forms. For timelike surfaces both
Willmore and isothermic, we obtain a description by minimal surfaces similar to
the classical results of Thomsen.
