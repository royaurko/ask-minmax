In this short note we give incremental algorithms for the following lattice
problems: finding a basis of a lattice, computing the successive minima, and
determining the orthogonal decomposition. We prove an upper bound for the
number of update steps for every insertion order. For the determination of the
orthogonal decomposition we efficiently implement an argument due to Kneser.
