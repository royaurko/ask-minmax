The sudoku minimum number of clues problem is the following question: what is
the smallest number of clues that a sudoku puzzle can have? For several years
it had been conjectured that the answer is 17. We have performed an exhaustive
computer search for 16-clue sudoku puzzles, and did not find any, thus proving
that the answer is indeed 17. In this article we describe our method and the
actual search. As a part of this project we developed a novel way for
enumerating hitting sets. The hitting set problem is computationally hard; it
is one of Karp's 21 classic NP-complete problems. A standard backtracking
algorithm for finding hitting sets would not be fast enough to search for a
16-clue sudoku puzzle exhaustively, even at today's supercomputer speeds. To
make an exhaustive search possible, we designed an algorithm that allowed us to
efficiently enumerate hitting sets of a suitable size.
