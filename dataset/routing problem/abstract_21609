Arrival directions of ultrahigh energy extensive air showers (EAS) by world
arrays data are analyzed. It is shown that arrival directions of ultrahigh
energy EAS by Yakutsk and P. Auger data are some correlated with pulsars of
Local Arm Orion of Galaxy. It is found large amplitude of first harmony of
Fourier row by data Yakutsk array. The problem of cosmic rays origin is
discussed.
