How best to quantify the information of an object, whether natural or
artifact, is a problem of wide interest. A related problem is the computability
of an object. We present practical examples of a new way to address this
problem. By giving an appropriate representation to our objects, based on a
hierarchical coding of information, we exemplify how it is remarkably easy to
compute complex objects. Our algorithmic complexity is related to the length of
the class of objects, rather than to the length of the object.
