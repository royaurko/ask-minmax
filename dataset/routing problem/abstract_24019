We consider laminar flow of incompressible electrolytes in long, straight
channels driven by pressure and electro-osmosis. We use a Hilbert space
eigenfunction expansion to address the general problem of an arbitrary cross
section and obtain general results in linear-response theory for the hydraulic
and electrical transport coefficients which satisfy Onsager relations. In the
limit of non-overlapping Debye layers the transport coefficients are simply
expressed in terms of parameters of the electrolyte as well as the geometrical
correction factor for the Hagen-Poiseuille part of the problem. In particular,
we consider the limits of thin non-overlapping as well as strongly overlapping
Debye layers, respectively, and calculate the corrections to the hydraulic
resistance due to electro-hydrodynamic interactions.
