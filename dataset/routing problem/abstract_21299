In recent years we've seen the birth of a new field known as hamiltonian
complexity lying at the crossroads between computer science and theoretical
physics. Hamiltonian complexity is directly concerned with the question: how
hard is it to simulate a physical system? Here I review the foundational
results, guiding problems, and future directions of this emergent field.
