Constructing models of inflation and/or baryogenesis in the context of N=1
supergravity is known to be difficult as the finite energy density during
inflation typically generates large (order the Hubble scale) mass terms. This
is the well-known eta problem in inflation. The same effect gives masses along
low energy flat directions of the scalar potential thus potentially preventing
Affleck-Dine baryogenesis to occur. It has been shown that adding a chiral
multiplet S coupled to the inflaton (with a shift symmetry) can serve to
stabilize the inflationary potential and allows one to derive simple
inflationary potentials without an eta problem. Here, we show that by coupling
the same stabilizing field S to the flat direction, may naturally lead to a
negative mass-squared contribution to the flat direction thus generating the
necessarily large vacuum expectation value needed to realize Affleck-Dine
baryogenesis. We trace the evolution of the inflaton, stabilizer, and flat
direction field, as well as a Polonyi-like modulus responsible for soft
supersymmetry breaking.
