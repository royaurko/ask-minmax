This article deals with adaptive nonparametric estimation for L\'evy
processes observed at low frequency. For general linear functionals of the
L\'evy measure, we construct kernel estimators, provide upper risk bounds and
derive rates of convergence under regularity assumptions. Our focus lies on the
adaptive choice of the bandwidth, using model selection techniques. We face
here a non-standard problem of model selection with unknown variance. A new
approach towards this problem is proposed, which also allows a straightforward
generalization to a classical density deconvolution framework.
