A. K. Bousfield's $H\mathbb Z$-localization of groups inverts homologically
two-connected homomorphisms of groups. J. P. Levine's algebraic closure of
groups inverts homomorphisms between finitely generated and finitely presented
groups which are homologically two-connected and for which the image normally
generates. We resolve an old problem concerning Bousfield $H\mathbb
Z$-localization of groups, and answer two questions of Levine regarding
algebraic closure of groups. In particular, we show that the kernel of the
natural homomorphism from a group $G$ to it's Bousfield $H\mathbb
Z$-localization is not always a $G$-perfect subgroup. In the case of algebraic
closure of groups, we prove the analogous result that this kernel is not always
an invisible subgroup.
