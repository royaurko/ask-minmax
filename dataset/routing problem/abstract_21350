We analyze the informal semantic conception of proof and axiomatize the proof
relation and the provability operator. A self referential propositional
calculus which admits provable liar type sentences is introduced and proven
consistent. We also investigate the problem of interpreting arbitrary formal
systems in systems which include a provability operator.
