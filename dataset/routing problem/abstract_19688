Previously unknown estimates of uniform continuity of projection operators in
Banach space have been obtained. They can be used in the investigations of
approximation methods, in particular, the method of quasisolutions, methods of
regularization and penalty functions, for solving nonlinear problems on exact
and peturbed sets.
