The quantified constraint satisfaction problem (QCSP) is the problem of
deciding, given a structure and a first-order prenex sentence whose
quantifier-free part is the conjunction of atoms, whether or not the sentence
holds on the structure. One obtains a family of problems by defining, for each
structure B, the problem QCSP(B) to be the QCSP where the structure is fixed to
be B. In this article, we offer a viewpoint on the research program of
understanding the complexity of the problems QCSP(B) on finite structures. In
particular, we propose and discuss a group of conjectures; throughout, we
attempt to place the conjectures in relation to existing results and to
emphasize open issues and potential research directions.
