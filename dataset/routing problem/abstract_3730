We study decidability and complexity questions related to a continuous
analogue of the Skolem-Pisot problem concerning the zeros and nonnegativity of
a linear recurrent sequence. In particular, we show that the continuous version
of the nonnegativity problem is NP-hard in general and we show that the
presence of a zero is decidable for several subcases, including instances of
depth two or less, although the decidability in general is left open. The
problems may also be stated as reachability problems related to real zeros of
exponential polynomials or solutions to initial value problems of linear
differential equations, which are interesting problems in their own right.
