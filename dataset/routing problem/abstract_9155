We characterize the soliton solutions of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation
on the half line with linearizable boundary conditions. Using an extension of
the solution to the whole line and the corresponding symmetries of the
scattering data, we identify the properties of the discrete spectrum of the
scattering problem. We show that discrete eigenvalues appear in quartets (as
opposed to pairs in the initial value problem), and we obtain explicit
relations for the norming constants associated to symmetric eigenvalues. The
apparent reflection of each soliton at the boundary of the spatial domain is
due to the presence of a "mirror" soliton, with equal amplitude and opposite
velocity, located beyond the boundary. We then calculate the position shift of
the physical solitons as a result of the nonlinear reflection. These results
provide a nonlinear analogue of the method of images that is used to solve
boundary value problems in electrostatics.
