The Reduced Basis Method can be exploited in an efficient way only if the
so-called affine dependence assumption on the operator and right-hand side of
the considered problem with respect to the parameters is satisfied. When it is
not, the Empirical Interpolation Method is usually used to recover this
assumption approximately. In both cases, the Reduced Basis Method requires to
access and modify the assembly routines of the corresponding computational
code, leading to an intrusive procedure. In this work, we derive variants of
the EIM algorithm and explain how they can be used to turn the Reduced Basis
Method into a nonintrusive procedure. We present examples of aeroacoustic
problems solved by integral equations and show how our algorithms can benefit
from the linear algebra tools available in the considered code.
