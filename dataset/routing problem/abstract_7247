A well-known weakness of the probabilistic path planners is the so-called
narrow passage problem, where a region with a relatively low probability of
being sampled must be explored to find a solution path. Many strategies have
been proposed to alleviate this problem, most of them based on biasing the
sampling distribution. When kinematic constraints appear in the problem, the
configuration space typically becomes a non-parametrizable, implicit manifold.
Unfortunately, this invalidates most of the existing sampling bias approaches,
which rely on an explicit parametrization of the space to explore. In this
paper, we propose and evaluate three novel strategies to bias the sampling
under the presence of narrow passages in kinematically-constrained systems.
