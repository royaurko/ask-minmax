Nonlinear interactions in coherent gases are not only at the origin of of
bright and dark solitons and superfluids. At the same time, they give rise to
phenomena such as multistability, which hold great promise for the development
of advanced photonic and spintronic devices. In particular, spinor
multistability in strongly-coupled semiconductor microcavities shows that the
spin of hundreds of exciton-polaritons can be coherently controlled, opening
the route to spin-optronic devices such as ultrafast spin memories, gates or
even neuronal communication schemes. Here, we demonstrate that switching
between the stable spin states of a driven polariton gas can be controlled by
ultrafast optical pulses. While such a long-lived spin memory necessarily
relies on strong and anisotropic spinor interactions within the coherent
polariton gas, we also highlight the crucial role of nonlinear losses and
formation of a non-radiative particle reservoir for ultrafast spin-switching.
