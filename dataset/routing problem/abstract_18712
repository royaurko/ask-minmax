In multi-user communication from one base station (BS) to multiple users, the
problem of minimizing the transmit power to achieve some target guaranteed
performance (rates) at users has been well investigated in the literature.
Similarly various user selection algorithms have been proposed and analyzed
when the BS has to transmit to a subset of the users in the system, mostly for
the objective of the sum rate maximization.
  We study the joint problem of minimizing the transmit power at the BS to
achieve specific signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) targets at users
in conjunction with user scheduling. The general analytical results for the
average transmit power required to meet guaranteed performance at the users'
side are difficult to obtain even without user selection due to joint
optimization required over beamforming vectors and power allocation scalars. We
study the transmit power minimization problem with various user selection
algorithms, namely semi-orthogonal user selection (SUS), norm-based user
selection (NUS) and angle-based user selection (AUS). When the SINR targets to
achieve are relatively large, the average minimum transmit power expressions
are derived for NUS and SUS for any number of users. For the special case when
only two users are selected, similar expressions are further derived for AUS
and a performance upper bound which serves to benchmark the performance of
other selection schemes. Simulation results performed under various settings
indicate that SUS is by far the better user selection criterion.
