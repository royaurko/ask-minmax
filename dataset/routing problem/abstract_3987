We apply a method of Davenport to improve several estimates for slim
exceptional sets associated with the asymptotic formula in Waring's problem. In
particular, we show that the anticipated asymptotic formula in Waring's problem
for sums of seven cubes holds for all but $O(N^{1/3+\epsilon})$ of the natural
numbers not exceeding $N$.
