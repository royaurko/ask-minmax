Within the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence we attempt to formulate the
cosmological constant problem in the dual conformal field theory. The
fine-tuning of the bulk cosmological constant is related to an apparent
fine-tuning in the effective description of the CFT in terms of its light
operators: while the correlators of single particle operators satisfy a large N
expansion, the expansion does not appear to be natural. Individual terms
contributing to correlators have parametrically larger value than the one
dictated by large N counting. The final 1/N suppression of correlators is
achieved via delicate cancellations between such terms. We speculate on the
existence of underlying principles which might make the bulk theory (secretly)
natural.
