The oscillation neutrino problem in the extended standard model with minimal
number of parameters is considered. The dispersion relations with explicit
neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry are discussed and an explanation to the
MINIBooNE and solar neutrino controversy is offered. Bounds for the CPT
violation symmetry are also found.
