We examine a (3+1)-dimensional model of staggered lattice fermions with a
four-fermion interaction and Z(2) chiral symmetry using the Hamiltonian
formulation. This model cannot be simulated with standard fermion algorithms
because those suffer from a very severe sign problem. We use a new fermion
simulation technique - the meron-cluster algorithm - which solves the sign
problem and leads to high-precision numerical data. We investigate the finite
temperature chiral phase transition and verify that it is in the universality
class of the 3-d Ising model using finite-size scaling.
