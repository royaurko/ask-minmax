We derive approximation algorithms for the nonnegative matrix factorization
problem, i.e. the problem of factorizing a matrix as the product of two
matrices with nonnegative coefficients. We form convex approximations of this
problem which can be solved efficiently and test our algorithms on some classic
numerical examples.
