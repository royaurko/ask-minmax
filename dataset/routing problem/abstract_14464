Consider a three-dimensional fluid in a rectangular tank, bounded by a flat
bottom, vertical walls and a free surface evolving under the influence of
gravity. We prove that one can estimate its energy by looking only at the
motion of the points of contact between the free surface and the vertical
walls. The proof relies on the multiplier technique, the Craig-Sulem-Zakharov
formulation of the water-wave problem, a Pohozaev identity for the Dirichlet to
Neumann operator, previous results about the Cauchy problem and computations
inspired by the analysis done by Benjamin and Olver of the conservation laws
for water waves.
