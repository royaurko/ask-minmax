Synchronization of many coupled oscillators is widely found in nature and has
the potential to revolutionize timing technologies. Here we demonstrate
synchronization in arrays of silicon nitride micromechanical oscillators
coupled purely through optical radiation field. We show that the phase noise of
the synchronized oscillators can be improved by almost 10 dB below the phase
noise limit for each individual oscillator. These results open a practical
route towards synchronized oscillator networks.
