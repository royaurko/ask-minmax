Mirsky proved that, for the existence of a complex matrix with given
eigenvalues and diagonal entries, the obvious necessary condition is also
sufficient. We generalize this theorem to matrices over any field and provide a
short proof. Moreover, we show that there is a unique companion-matrix-type
solution for this problem.
