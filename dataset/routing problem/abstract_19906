The origin of quark and lepton masses is one of the outstanding problems of
physics. As the experimental data becomes more and more accurate, testing
theories of fermion masses requires greater care. In this talk we discuss a
theoretical framework for testing those theories with a high energy desert. It
is only with precision tests that we can hope to narrow the set of viable,
beyond the standard model theories.
