It is shown that the quasi-normal modes arise, in a natural way, when
considering the oscillations in unbounded regions by imposing the radiation
condition at spatial infinity with a complex wave vector $k$. Hence
quasi-normal modes are not peculiarities of gravitation problems only (black
holes and relativistic stars). It is proposed to consider the space form of the
quasi-normal modes with allowance for their time dependence. As a result, the
problem of their unbounded increase when $r\to \infty$ is not encountered more.
The properties of quasi-normal modes of a compact dielectric sphere are
discussed in detail. It is argued that the spatial form of these modes
(especially so-called surface modes) should be taken into account, for example,
when estimating the potential health hazards due to the use of portable
telephones.
