We derive and implement symmetry-projected Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB)
equations and apply them to the molecular electronic structure problem. All
symmetries (particle number, spin, spatial, and complex conjugation) are
deliberately broken and restored in a self-consistent
variation-after-projection approach. We show that the resulting method yields a
comprehensive black-box treatment of strong correlations with effective
one-electron (mean-field) computational cost. The ensuing wave function is of
multireference character and permeates the entire Hilbert space of the problem.
The energy expression is different from regular HFB theory but remains a
functional of an independent quasiparticle density matrix. All reduced density
matrices are expressible as an integration of transition density matrices over
a gauge grid. We present several proof-of-principle examples demonstrating the
compelling power of projected quasiparticle theory for electronic structure
theory.
