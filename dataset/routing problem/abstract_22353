The counterparts of the Bertrand-Darboux equation for the two-dimensional
nonholonomic systems are discussed. We directly prove that integrable
potentials for the nonholonomic Suslov problem, for the Veselova system and the
Chaplygin ball on the plane can be recovered from the well-known integrable
potentials, which have been obtained many years ago in the framework of
Hamiltonian mechanics.
