We proposed a probabilistic algorithm to solve the Multiple Sequence
Alignment problem. The algorithm is a Simulated Annealing (SA) that exploits
the representation of the Multiple Alignment between $D$ sequences as a
directed polymer in $D$ dimensions. Within this representation we can easily
track the evolution in the configuration space of the alignment through local
moves of low computational cost. At variance with other probabilistic
algorithms proposed to solve this problem, our approach allows for the creation
and deletion of gaps without extra computational cost. The algorithm was tested
aligning proteins from the kinases family. When D=3 the results are consistent
with those obtained using a complete algorithm. For $D>3$ where the complete
algorithm fails, we show that our algorithm still converges to reasonable
alignments. Moreover, we study the space of solutions obtained and show that
depending on the number of sequences aligned the solutions are organized in
different ways, suggesting a possible source of errors for progressive
algorithms.
