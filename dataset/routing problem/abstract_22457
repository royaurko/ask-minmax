To any non-negatively graded dg Lie algebra $g$ over a field $k$ of
characteristic zero we assign a functor $\Sigma_g: art/k \to Kan$ from the
category of commutative local artinian $k$-algebras with the residue field $k$
to the category of Kan simplicial sets. There is a natural homotopy equivalence
between $\Sigma_g$ and the Deligne groupoid corresponding to $g$.
  The main result of the paper claims that the functor $\Sigma$ commutes up
to homotopy with the "total space" functors which assign a dg Lie algebra to
a cosimplicial dg Lie algebra and a simplicial set to a cosimplicial
simplicial set. This proves a conjecture of Schechtman which implies that if
a deformation problem is described ``locally'' by a sheaf of dg Lie algebras
$g$ on a topological space $X$ then the global deformation problem is
described by the homotopy Lie algebra $R\Gamma(X,g)$.
