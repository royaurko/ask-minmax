This paper focuses on fruit defect detection and glare removal using
morphological operations, Glare removal can be considered as an important
preprocessing step as uneven lighting may introduce it in images, which hamper
the results produced through segmentation by Gabor filters .The problem of
glare in images is very pronounced sometimes due to the unusual reflectance
from the camera sensor or stray light entering, this method counteracts this
problem and makes the defect detection much more pronounced. Anisotropic
diffusion is used for further smoothening of the images and removing the high
energy regions in an image for better defect detection and makes the defects
more retrievable. Our algorithm is robust and scalable the employability of a
particular mask for glare removal has been checked and proved useful for
counteracting.this problem, anisotropic diffusion further enhances the defects
with its use further Optimal Gabor filter at various orientations is used for
defect detection.
