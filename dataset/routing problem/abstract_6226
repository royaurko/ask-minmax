CP has a natural embedding in superstring models as a gauge symmetry
involving inversion of the compactified space. Hence the source of CP violation
could be geometrical. Such models face the problem of how to suppress
contributions to fermion electric dipole moments from softly-broken
supersymmetry, as well as other problems of string phenomenology. Stringy
symmetries are useful in evaluating models, and rule out some scenarios.
