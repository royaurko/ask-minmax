Smoothing is essential to many oceanographic, meteorological and hydrological
applications. The interval smoothing problem updates all desired states within
a time interval using all available observations. The fixed-lag smoothing
problem updates only a fixed number of states prior to the observation at
current time. The fixed-lag smoothing problem is, in general, thought to be
computationally faster than a fixed-interval smoother, and can be an
appropriate approximation for long interval-smoothing problems. In this paper,
we use an ensemble-based approach to fixed-interval and fixed-lag smoothing,
and synthesize two algorithms. The first algorithm produces a linear time
solution to the interval smoothing problem with a fixed factor, and the second
one produces a fixed-lag solution that is independent of the lag length.
Identical-twin experiments conducted with the Lorenz-95 model show that for lag
lengths approximately equal to the error doubling time, or for long intervals
the proposed methods can provide significant computational savings. These
results suggest that ensemble methods yield both fixed-interval and fixed-lag
smoothing solutions that cost little additional effort over filtering and model
propagation, in the sense that in practical ensemble application the additional
increment is a small fraction of either filtering or model propagation costs.
We also show that fixed-interval smoothing can perform as fast as fixed-lag
smoothing and may be advantageous when memory is not an issue.
