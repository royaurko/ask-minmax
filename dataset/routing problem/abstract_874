The bifurcation and chaotic behaviour of unidirectionally coupled
deterministic ratchets is studied as a function of the driving force amplitude
($a$) and frequency ($\omega$). A classification of the various types of
bifurcations likely to be encountered in this system was done by examining the
stability of the steady state in linear response as well as constructing a
two-parameter phase diagram in the ($a -\omega$) plane. Numerical explorations
revealed varieties of bifurcation sequences including quasiperiodic route to
chaos. Besides, the familiar period-doubling and crises route to chaos
exhibited by the one-dimensional ratchet were also found. In addition, the
coupled ratchets display symmetry-breaking, saddle-nodes and bubbles of
bifurcations. Chaotic behaviour is characterized by using the sensitivity to
initial condition as well as the Lyapunov exponent spectrum; while a perusal of
the phase space projected in the Poincar$\acute{e}$ cross-section confirms some
of the striking features.
