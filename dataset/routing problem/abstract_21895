We study boundary gradient estimates for second-order divergence type
parabolic and elliptic systems in $C^{1,\alpha}$ domains. The coefficients and
data are assumed to be H\"older in the time variable and all but one spatial
variables. This type of systems arises from the problems of linearly elastic
laminates and composite materials.
