The algorithm to calculate the generating function for the number of
``skeleton'' diagrams for the irreducible self-energy and vertex parts is
derived for the problems with Gaussian random fields. We find an exact
recurrence relation determining the number of diagrams for any given order of
perturbation theory, as well as its asymptotics for the large order limit.
These results are applied to the analysis of the problem of an electron in the
Gaussian random field with the ``white-noise'' correlation function. Assuming
the equality of all ``skeleton'' diagrams for the self-energy part in the given
order of perturbation theory, we construct the closed integral equation for the
one-particle Green's function, with its kernel defined by the previously
introduced generating function. Our analysis demonstrate that this
approximation gives the qualitatively correct form of the localized states
``tail'' in the density of states in the region of negative energies and is
apparently quite satisfactory in the most interesting region of strong
scattering close to the former band-edge, where we can derive the asymptotics
of the Green's function and density of states in the limit of very strong
scattering.
