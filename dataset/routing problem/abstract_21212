We discuss connections between certain well-known open problems related to
the uniform measure on a high-dimensional convex body. In particular, we show
that the "thin shell conjecture" implies the "hyperplane conjecture". This
extends a result by K. Ball, according to which the stronger "spectral gap
conjecture" implies the "hyperplane conjecture".
