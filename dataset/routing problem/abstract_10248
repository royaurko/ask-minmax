Financial derivatives pricing aims to find the fair value of a financial
contract on an underlying asset. Here we consider option pricing in the partial
differential equations framework. The contemporary models lead to
one-dimensional or multidimensional parabolic problems of the
convection-diffusion type and generalizations thereof. An overview of various
operator splitting methods is presented for the efficient numerical solution of
these problems.
  Splitting schemes of the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) type are
discussed for multidimensional problems, e.g. given by stochastic volatility
(SV) models. For jump models Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) methods are considered
which efficiently treat the nonlocal jump operator. For American options an
easy-to-implement operator splitting method is described for the resulting
linear complementarity problems.
  Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the actual stability and
convergence of the splitting schemes. Here European and American put options
are considered under four asset price models: the classical Black-Scholes
model, the Merton jump-diffusion model, the Heston SV model, and the Bates SV
model with jumps.
