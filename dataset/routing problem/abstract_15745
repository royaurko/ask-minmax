Large-distance modification of gravity may be the mechanism for solving the
cosmological constant problem. A simple model of the large-distance
modification -- four-dimensional (4D) gravity with the hard mass term-- is
problematic from the theoretical standpoint. Here we discuss a different model,
the brane-induced gravity, that effectively introduces a soft graviton mass. We
study the issues of unitarity, analyticity and causality in this model in more
than five dimensions. We show that a consistent prescription for the poles of
the Green's function can be specified so that 4D unitarity is preserved.
However, in certain instances 4D analyticity cannot be maintained when theory
becomes higher dimensional. As a result, one has to sacrifice 4D causality at
distances of the order of the present-day Hubble scale. This is a welcome
feature for solving the cosmological constant problem, as was recently argued
in the literature. We also show that, unlike the 4D massive gravity, the model
has no strong-coupling problem at intermediate scales.
