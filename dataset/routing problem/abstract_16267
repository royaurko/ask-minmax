One of the challenges of supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking and mediation is
generating a mu term consistent with the requirements of electro-weak symmetry
breaking. The most common approach to the problem is to generate the mu term
through a SUSY breaking F-term. Often these models produce unacceptably large B
mu terms as a result. We will present an alternate approach, where the mu term
is generated directly by non-perturtative effects. The same non-perturbative
effect will also retrofit the model of SUSY breaking in such a way that mu is
at the same scale as masses of the Standard Model superpartners. Because the mu
term is not directly generated by SUSY breaking effects, there is no associated
B mu problem. These results are demonstrated in a toy model where a stringy
instanton generates mu.
