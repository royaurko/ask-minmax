Does the trace language of a given vector addition system (VAS) intersect
with a given context-free language? This question lies at the heart of several
verification questions involving recursive programs with integer parameters. In
particular, it is equivalent to the coverability problem for VAS that operate
on a pushdown stack. We show decidability in dimension one, based on an
analysis of a new model called grammar-controlled vector addition systems.
