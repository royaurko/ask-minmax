Wilf posed the following problem: determine asymptotically as $n\to\infty$
the probability that a randomly chosen part size in a randomly chosen
composition of n has multiplicity m. One solution of this problem was given by
Hitczenko and Savage. In this paper, we study this question using the
techniques of generating functions and singularity analysis.
