In an attempt to find a polynomial-time algorithm for the edge-clique cover
problem on cographs we tried to prove that the edge-clique graphs of cographs
have bounded rankwidth. However, this is not the case. In this note we show
that the edge-clique graphs of cocktail party graphs have unbounded rankwidth.
