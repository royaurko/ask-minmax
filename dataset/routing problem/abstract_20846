We consider solutions to the time-harmonic Maxwell problem in $\R^3$. For
such solution we provide a rigorous derivation of the asymptotic expansions in
the practically interesting situation, where a finite number of inhomogeneities
of small diameter are imbedded in the entire space. Then, we describe the
behavior of the electromagnetic energy caused by the presence of these
inhomogeneities.
