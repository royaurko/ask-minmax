In this paper we investigate the descriptional complexity of knot theoretic
problems and show upper bounds for planarity problem of signed and unsigned
knot diagrams represented by Gauss words. Since a topological equivalence of
knots can involve knot diagrams with arbitrarily many crossings then Gauss
words will be considered as strings over an infinite (unbounded) alphabet. For
establishing the upper bounds on recognition of knot properties, we study these
problems in a context of automata models over an infinite alphabet.
