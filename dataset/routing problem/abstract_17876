In this paper we consider several problems of joint similarity to tuples of
bounded linear operators in noncommutative polydomains and varieties associated
with sets of noncommutative polynomials. We obtain analogues of classical
results such as Rota's model theorem for operators with spectral radius less
than one, Sz.-Nagy characterization of operators similar to isometries (or
unitary operators), and the refinement obtained by Foia\c s and by de Branges
and Rovnyak for strongly stable contractions. We also provide analogues of
these results in the context of joint similarity of commuting tuples of
positive linear maps on the algebra of bounded linear operators on a separable
Hilbert space. An important role in this paper is played by a class of
noncommutative cones associated with positive linear maps, the Fourier type
representation of their elements, and the constrained noncommutative Berezin
transforms associated with these elements. It is shown that there is a intimate
relation between the similarity problems and the existence of positive
invertible elements in these noncommutative cones and the corresponding Berezin
kernels.
