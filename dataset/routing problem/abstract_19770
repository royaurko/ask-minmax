The experimental evidence for pentaquarks, both old an new, is discussed.
Constraints due to $K^+N$ scattering data from previous decades is first
reviewed, followed by experiments with positive evidence and those with null
results. Finally, the problem of the narrow width of the Theta+ pentaquark is
discussed, along with theoretical implications.
