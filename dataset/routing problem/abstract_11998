We investigate a functional limit theorem (homogenization) for Reflected
Stochastic Differential Equations on a half-plane with stationary coefficients
when it is necessary to analyze both the effective Brownian motion and the
effective local time. We prove that the limiting process is a reflected
non-standard Brownian motion. Beyond the result, this problem is known as a
prototype of non-translation invariant problem making the usual method of the
"environment as seen from the particle" inefficient.
