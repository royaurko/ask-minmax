Population stratification is a problem encountered in several areas of
biology and public health. We tackle this problem by mapping a population and
its elements attributes into a hypergraph, a natural extension of the concept
of graph or network to encode associations among any number of elements. On
this hypergraph, we construct a statistical model reflecting our intuition
about how the elements attributes can emerge from a postulated population
structure. Finally, we introduce the concept of stratification
representativeness as a mean to identify the simplest stratification already
containing most of the information about the population structure. We
demonstrate the power of this framework stratifying an animal and a human
population based on phenotypic and genotypic properties, respectively.
