In this announcement we present a general and new approach to analyzing the
asymptotics of oscillatory Riemann-Hilbert problems. Such problems arise, in
particular, in evaluating the long-time behavior of nonlinear wave equations
solvable by the inverse scattering method. We will restrict ourselves here
exclusively to the modified Korteweg de Vries (MKdV) equation,
  $$y_t-6y^2y_x+y_{xxx}=0,\qquad -\infty<x<\infty,\ t\ge0, y(x,t=0)=y_0(x),$$
 but it will be clear immediately to the reader with some experience in the
field, that the method extends naturally and easily to the general class of
wave equations solvable by the inverse scattering method, such as the KdV,
nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS), and Boussinesq equations, etc., and also to
``integrable'' ordinary differential equations such as the Painlev\'e
transcendents.
