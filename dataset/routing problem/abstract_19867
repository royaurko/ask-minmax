By using the relation between CP-violation phase and the mixing angles in
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix postulated by us before, the rephasing
invariant is recalculated. Furthermore, the problem about maximal CP violation
is discussed. We find that the maximal value of Jarlskog's invariant is about
0.038. And it presents at alpha=1.239, beta=1.574 and gamma=0.327 in triangle
