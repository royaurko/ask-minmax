The selection of the best classification algorithm for a given dataset is a
very widespread problem. It is also a complex one, in the sense it requires to
make several important methodological choices. Among them, in this work we
focus on the measure used to assess the classification performance and rank the
algorithms. We present the most popular measures and discuss their properties.
Despite the numerous measures proposed over the years, many of them turn out to
be equivalent in this specific case, to have interpretation problems, or to be
unsuitable for our purpose. Consequently, classic overall success rate or
marginal rates should be preferred for this specific task.
