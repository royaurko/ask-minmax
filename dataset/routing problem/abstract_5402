Inverse scattering problem is discussed for the Maxwell's equations. A
reduction of the Maxwell's system to a new Fredholm second-kind integral
equation with a {\it scalar weakly singular kernel} is given for
electromagnetic (EM) wave scattering. This equation allows one to derive a
formula for the scattering amplitude in which only a scalar function is
present. If this function is small (an assumption that validates a Born-type
approximation), then formulas for the solution to the inverse problem are
obtained from the scattering data: the complex permittivity $\ep'(x)$ in a
bounded region $D\subset \R^3$ is found from the scattering amplitude
$A(\beta,\alpha,k)$ known for a fixed $k=\omega\sqrt{\ep_0 \mu_0}>0$ and all
$\beta,\alpha \in S^2$, where $S^2$ is the unit sphere in $\R^3$, $\ep_0$ and
$\mu_0$ are constant permittivity and magnetic permeability in the exterior
region $D'=\R^3 \setminus D$. The {\it novel points} in this paper include: i)
A reduction of the inverse problem for {\it vector EM waves} to a {\it vector
integral equation with scalar kernel} without any symmetry assumptions on the
scatterer, ii) A derivation of the {\it scalar integral equation} of the first
kind for solving the inverse scattering problem, and iii) Presenting formulas
for solving this scalar integral equation. The problem of solving this integral
equation is an ill-posed one. A method for a stable solution of this problem is
given.
