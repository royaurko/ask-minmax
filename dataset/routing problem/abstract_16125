We obtain sharp upper and lower bounds on a certain four-dimensional
Frobenius number determined by a prime pair $(p,q)$, $2<p<q$, including exact
formulae for two infinite subclasses of such pairs. Our work is motivated by
the study of compact Riemann surfaces which can be realized as a semi-regular
$pq$-fold coverings of surfaces of lower genus. In this context, the Frobenius
number is (up to an additive translation) the largest genus in which no surface
is such a covering. In many cases it is also the largest genus in which no
surface admits an automorphism of order $pq$. The general $t$-dimensional
Frobenius problem ($t \geq 3$) is $NP$-hard, and it may be that our restricted
problem retains this property.
