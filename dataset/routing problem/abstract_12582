The problem of broadcasting a parallel Gaussian source over an additive white
Gaussian noise broadcast channel under the mean-squared error distortion
criterion is studied. A hybrid digital-analog coding strategy which combines
source coding with side information, channel coding with side information,
layered source coding, and superposition broadcast channel coding is presented.
When specialized to the open problem of broadcasting a white Gaussian source
over an additive white Gaussian noise broadcast channel with bandwidth mismatch
which has been the subject of several previous investigations, this coding
scheme strictly improves on the state-of-the-art.
