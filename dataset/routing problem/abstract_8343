This paper develops and analyzes a generic method for reconstructing
solutions to the abstract Cauchy problem in a general Hilbert space, from noisy
measured data. The method is based on the relationship between a partial
differential equation and its adjoint equation with control. We demonsrate the
capability of the method through analysis and numerical experiments.
