We study the existence of automatic presentations for various algebraic
structures. An automatic presentation of a structure is a description of the
universe of the structure by a regular set of words, and the interpretation of
the relations by synchronised automata. Our first topic concerns characterising
classes of automatic structures. We supply a characterisation of the automatic
Boolean algebras, and it is proven that the free Abelian group of infinite
rank, as well as certain Fraisse limits, do not have automatic presentations.
In particular, the countably infinite random graph and the random partial order
do not have automatic presentations. Furthermore, no infinite integral domain
is automatic. Our second topic is the isomorphism problem. We prove that the
complexity of the isomorphism problem for the class of all automatic structures
is \Sigma_1^1-complete.
