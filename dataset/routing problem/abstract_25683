The modern design of industrial structures leads to very complex simulations
characterized by nonlinearities, high heterogeneities, tortuous geometries...
Whatever the modelization may be, such an analysis leads to the solution to a
family of large ill-conditioned linear systems. In this paper we study
strategies to efficiently solve to linear system based on non-overlapping
domain decomposition methods. We present a review of most employed approaches
and their strong connections. We outline their mechanical interpretations as
well as the practical issues when willing to implement and use them. Numerical
properties are illustrated by various assessments from academic to industrial
problems. An hybrid approach, mainly designed for multifield problems, is also
introduced as it provides a general framework of such approaches.
