This paper continues the study of the mixed problem for the Laplacian. We
consider a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega\subset \reals^n$, $n\geq2$, with
boundary that is decomposed as $\partial\Omega=D\cup N$, $D$ and $N$ disjoint.
We let $\Lambda$ denote the boundary of $D$ (relative to $\partial\Omega$) and
impose conditions on the dimension and shape of $\Lambda$ and the sets $N$ and
$D$. Under these geometric criteria, we show that there exists $p_0>1$
depending on the domain $\Omega$ such that for $p$ in the interval $(1,p_0)$,
the mixed problem with Neumann data in the space $L^p(N)$ and Dirichlet data in
the Sobolev space $W^ {1,p}(D) $ has a unique solution with the non-tangential
maximal function of the gradient of the solution in $L^p(\partial\Omega)$. We
also obtain results for $p=1$ when the Dirichlet and Neumann data comes from
Hardy spaces, and a result when the boundary data comes from weighted Sobolev
spaces.
