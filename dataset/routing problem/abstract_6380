A second-order differential (q-difference) eigenvalue equation is constructed
whose solutions are generating functions of the dual (q-)Hahn polynomials. The
fact is noticed that these generating functions are reduced to the (little
q-)Jacobi polynomials, and implications of this for quasi-exactly solvable
problems are studied. A connection with the Azbel-Hofstadter problem is
indicated.
