In this paper we are concerned with a general singular Dirichlet boundary
value problem whose model is the following $$ \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u = \frac{\mu}{u^{\gamma}} & \text{in}\ \Omega,\newline
  u=0 &\text{on}\ \partial\Omega,\newline
  u>0 &\text{on}\ \Omega\,.
  \end{cases} $$ Here $\mu$ is a nonnegative bounded Radon measure on a bounded
open set $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$, and $\gamma>0$.
