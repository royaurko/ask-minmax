The method of zero range potential (ZRP) for one-electron problems is
reviewed. In the absence of an external electromagnetic field, the notion of a
ZRP is introduced from different points of view and for an arbitrary dimension
of space. Then, three-dimensional problems of motion of an electron in the
field of several ZRPs and laser radiation are studied. Exact wave functions for
the processes of photoionization and stimulated bremsstrahlung in the presence
of the laser field of an arbitrary pulse shape are obtained in the form of
one-dimensional integral representations.
