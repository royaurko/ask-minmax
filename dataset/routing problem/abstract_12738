We describe a method for bounding the set of exceptional integers not
represented by a given additive form in terms of the exceptional set
corresponding to a subform. Illustrating our ideas with examples stemming from
Waring's problem for cubes, we show, in particular, that the number of positive
integers not exceeding N, that fail to have a representation as the sum of six
cubes of natural numbers, is O(N^{3/7}).
