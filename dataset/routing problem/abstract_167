In this paper, we have modeled the routing over- head generated by three
reactive routing protocols; Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV), Dynamic
Source Routing (DSR) and DYnamic MANET On-deman (DYMO). Routing performed by
reactive protocols consists of two phases; route discovery and route
maintenance. Total cost paid by a protocol for efficient routing is sum of the
cost paid in the form of energy consumed and time spent. These protocols
majorly focus on the optimization performed by expanding ring search algorithm
to control the flooding generated by the mechanism of blind flooding. So, we
have modeled the energy consumed and time spent per packet both for route
discovery and route maintenance. The proposed framework is evaluated in NS-2 to
compare performance of the chosen routing protocols.
