We discuss a generic form of the scalar potential appearing in geometric
scalar theory of gravity. We find the conditions on the potential by
considering weak and strong gravity. The modified black hole solutions are
obtained for generic potentials and the inverse problems on a black hole and on
a spherical body are investigated.
