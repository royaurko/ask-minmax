Audio restoration is effectively achieved by using low complexity algorithm
called AMP. This algorithm has fast convergence and has lower computation
intensity making it suitable for audio recovery problems. This paper focuses on
restoring an audio signal by using VLSI architecture called AMP-M that
implements AMP algorithm. This architecture employs MAC unit with fixed bit
Wallace tree multiplier, FFT-MUX and various memory units (RAM) for audio
restoration. VLSI and FPGA implementation results shows that reduced area, high
throughput, low power is achieved making it suitable for real time audio
recovery problems. Prominent examples are Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
Radar and Wireless Communications.
