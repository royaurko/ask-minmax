In this report we address the linear state estimation problem: to estimate a
linear transformation $\ell(\varphi)$ of the state $\varphi$ through an
algorithm $\widehat{\ell(\varphi)}$ operating on measurements $y$, where
$L\varphi=f,y=H\varphi+\eta$. We study the estimation problem in terms of the
minimax estimation framework: to find a linear algorithm
$\widehat{\widehat{\ell(\varphi)}}$ that minimizes the worst case error
$\sup_{\varphi,\eta}d(\ell(\varphi),\widehat{\ell(\varphi)}) $. A key feature
of the presented estimation approach is to fix a class of linear operators $L$,
$H$; given any pair $L,H$ from that class we describe a class $\mathcal L$ of
all solution operators $\ell$ such that the worst case error is finite.
  We formulate a duality theorem (like Kalman duality principle) that is the
estimation problem is equal to the optimal control problem if $G$ is convex
bounded subset of the corresponding Hilbert space, $L$ is a closed linear
mapping. We obtain optimal estimations as solutions of the linear operator
equations if $G$ is an ellipsoid. Then we apply this to the state estimation
for the linear differential-algebraic equations (DAE). The minimax observer for
DAE is represented in the form of the minimax filter. For discrete time DAEs we
present the online minimax estimator.
