We show that the full features of the dynamics towards the Feigenbaum
attractor, present in all low-dimensional maps with a unimodal leading
component, form a hierarchical construction with modular organization that
leads to a clear-cut emergent property. This well-known nonlinear model system
combines a simple and precise definition, an intricate nested hierarchical
dynamical structure, and emergence of a power-law dynamical property absent in
the exponential-law that governs the dynamics within the modules. This classic
nonlinear system is put forward as a working example for complex collective
behavior.
