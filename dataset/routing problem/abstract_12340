The problem of obtaining the Regge-like behaviour for meson mass spectrum in
the hard-wall AdS/QCD models is addressed. We show that the problem can be
solved by a simple incorporation of the effects of local vacuum condensates
into such models. The slope of trajectories turns out to be determined by the
local condensate of dimension~2 that is absent in the standard Operator Product
Expansion. This pitfall, however, can be escaped by means of physically
plausible modification of boundary conditions for the holographic fields
corresponding to the usual gluon condensate, the latter then determines the
slope.
