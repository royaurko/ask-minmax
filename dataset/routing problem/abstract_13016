We investigate the privacy amplification problem in which Eve can observe the
uniform binary source through a binary erasure channel (BEC) or a binary
symmetric channel (BSC). For this problem, we derive the so-called expurgation
exponent of the information leaked to Eve. The exponent is derived by relating
the leaked information to the error probability of the linear code that is
generated by the linear hash function used in the privacy amplification, which
is also interesting in its own right. The derived exponent is larger than
state-of-the-art exponent recently derived by Hayashi at low rate.
