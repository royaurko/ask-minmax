As a generalization of polyominoes we consider edge-to-edge connected
nonoverlapping unions of regular $k$-gons. For $n\le 4$ we determine formulas
for the number $a_k(n)$ of generalized polyominoes consisting of $n$ regular
$k$-gons. Additionally we give a table of the numbers $a_k(n)$ for small $k$
and $n$ obtained by computer enumeration. We finish with some open problems for
$k$-polyominoes.
