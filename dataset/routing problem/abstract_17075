A mechanism capable to provide a natural solution to two major cosmological
problems, i.e. the cosmic acceleration and the coincidence problem, is
proposed. A specific brane-bulk energy exchange mechanism produces a total dark
pressure, arising when adding all normal to the brane negative pressures in the
interior of galactic core black holes. This astrophysically produced negative
dark pressure explains cosmic acceleration and why the dark energy today is of
the same order to the matter density for a wide range of the involved
parameters. An exciting result of the analysis is that the recent rise of the
galactic core black hole mass density causes the recent passage from cosmic
deceleration to acceleration. Finally, it is worth mentioning that this work
corrects a wide spread fallacy among brane cosmologists, i.e. that escaping
gravitons result to positive dark pressure.
