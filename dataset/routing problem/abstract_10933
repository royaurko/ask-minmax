The problem of error growth due to the incomplete knowledge of the evolution
law which rules the dynamics of a given physical system is addressed. Major
interest is devoted to the analysis of error amplification in systems with many
characteristic times and scales. The importance of a proper parameterization of
fast scales in systems with many strongly interacting degrees of freedom is
highlighted and its consequences for the modelization of geophysical systems
are discussed.
