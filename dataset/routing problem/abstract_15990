Explicit solutions of the two-dimensional floating body problem (bodies that
can float in all positions) for relative density different from 1/2 and of the
tire track problem (tire tracks of a bicycle, which do not allow to determine,
which way the bicycle went) are given, which differ from circles. Starting
point is the differential equation given by the contributor in archive
physics/0205059 and Studies in Appl. Math. 111 (2003) 167-183. The curves are
also trajectories of charges in a perpendicular magnetic field.
