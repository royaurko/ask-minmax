An approach for a unified description of the nucleon electromagnetic form
factors in spacelike and timelike regions is presented. The main ingredients of
our model are: $i)$ a Mandelstam formula for the matrix elements of the nucleon
electromagnetic current; $ii)$ a 3-dimensional reduction of the problem on the
Light-Front performed within the so-called {\tt Propagator Pole Approximation}
({\bf PPA}), which consists in disregarding the analytical structure of the
Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes and of the quark-photon vertex function in the
integration over the minus components of the quark momenta; $iii)$ a dressed
photon vertex in the $q\bar{q}$ channel, where the photon is described by its
spin-1, hadronic component.
