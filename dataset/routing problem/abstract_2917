A choice of first-order variables for the characteristic problem of the
linearized Einstein equations is found which casts the system into manifestly
well-posed form. The concept of well-posedness for characteristic problems
invoked is that there exists an \textit{a priori} estimate of the solution of
the characteristic problem in terms of the data. The notion of manifest
well-posedness consists of an algebraic criterion sufficient for the existence
of the estimates, and is to characteristic problems as symmetric hyperbolicity
is to Cauchy problems. Both notions have been made precise elsewere.
