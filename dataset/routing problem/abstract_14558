We analyze existence and stability of point vortex relative equilibria with
one dominant vortex and N vortices with infinitesimal circulation. We show that
the problem can be reduced to an infinitesimal circulation limit, and that both
existence and stability are characterized by properties of critical points of a
particular real-valued function of N angular variables. We use these results to
prove that symmetric configurations require equality of two circulation
parameters in the (1 + 3)-vortex problem, and we show that there can be stable
asymmetric configurations.
