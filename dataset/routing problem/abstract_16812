Given a submersion $\pi:Q \to M$ with an Ehresmann connection $\mathcal{H}$,
we describe how to solve Hamiltonian systems on $M$ by lifting our problem to
$Q$ and doing our computations here. We also show how solutions of lifted
Hamiltonian systems on $Q$ can be viewed as particles in $M$ under the
influence of a generalization of the magnetic force. We investigate what this
means in terms of normal and abnormal extremals in optimal control problems on
respectively $M$ and $Q$. We give a demonstration of our theory by considering
the system of one Riemannian manifold rolling on another without twisting or
slipping.
