We construct a solution of a pure conduction problem in ice and bedrock. This
solution is suitable for, and is used in this paper for, verifying a numerical
scheme for conservation of energy. This exact solution forms one of a suite of
verification tests for PISM (Parallel Ice Sheet Model;
https://gna.org/projects/pism/).
