The vibrational equivalent of the Anderson tight-binding Hamiltonian has been
studied, with particular focus on the properties of the eigenstates at the
transition from extended to localized states. The critical energy has been
found approximately for several degrees of force-constant disorder using
system-size scaling of the multifractal spectra of the eigenmodes, and the
spectrum at which there is no system-size dependence has been obtained. This is
shown to be in good agreement with the critical spectrum for the electronic
problem, which has been derived both numerically and by analytic means.
Universality of the critical states is therefore suggested also to hold for the
vibrational problem.
