We show how a non-Abelian family symmetry Delta(27) can be used to solve the
flavour problem of supersymmetric standard models containing three Higgs
families such as the Exceptional Supersymmetric Standard Model (E(6)SSM). The
three 27 dimensional families of the E(6)SSM, including the three families of
Higgs fields, transform in a triplet representation of the Delta(27) family
symmetry, allowing the family symmetry to commute with a possible high energy
E(6) symmetry. The Delta(27) family symmetry here provides a high energy
understanding of the Z(2)H symmetry of the E(6)SSM, which solves the flavour
changing neutral current problem of the three families of Higgs fields. The
main phenomenological predictions of the model are tri-bi-maximal mixing for
leptons, two almost degenerate LSPs and two almost degenerate families of
colour triplet D-fermions, providing a clear prediction for the LHC. In
addition the model predicts PGBs with masses below the TeV scale, and possibly
much lighter, which appears to be a quite general and robust prediction of all
models based on the D-term vacuum alignment mechanism.
