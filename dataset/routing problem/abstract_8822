We consider a one-phase nonlocal free boundary problem obtained by the
superposition of a fractional Dirichlet energy plus a nonlocal perimeter
functional. We prove that the minimizers are H\"older continuous and the free
boundary has positive density from both sides.
  For this, we also introduce a new notion of fractional harmonic replacement
in the extended variables and we study its basic properties.
