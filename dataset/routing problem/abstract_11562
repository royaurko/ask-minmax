We suggest a modification of the operator exponential method for the
numerical solving the difference linear initial boundary value problems. The
scheme is based on the representation of the difference operator for given
boundary conditions as the perturbation of the same operator for periodic ones.
We analyze the error, stability and efficiency of the scheme for a model
example of the one-dimensional operator of second difference.
