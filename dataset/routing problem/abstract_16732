We examine in detail the relative equilibria in the four-vortex problem where
two pairs of vortices have equal strength, that is, \Gamma_1 = \Gamma_2 = 1 and
\Gamma_3 = \Gamma_4 = m where m is a nonzero real parameter. One main result is
that for m > 0, the convex configurations all contain a line of symmetry,
forming a rhombus or an isosceles trapezoid. The rhombus solutions exist for
all m but the isosceles trapezoid case exists only when m is positive. In fact,
there exist asymmetric convex configurations when m < 0. In contrast to the
Newtonian four-body problem with two equal pairs of masses, where the symmetry
of all convex central configurations is unproven, the equations in the vortex
case are easier to handle, allowing for a complete classification of all
solutions. Precise counts on the number and type of solutions (equivalence
classes) for different values of m, as well as a description of some of the
bifurcations that occur, are provided. Our techniques involve a combination of
analysis and modern and computational algebraic geometry.
