The online communities available on the Web have shown to be significantly
interactive and capable of collectively solving difficult tasks. Nevertheless,
it is still a challenge to decide how a task should be dispatched through the
network due to the high diversity of the communities and the dynamically
changing expertise and social availability of their members. We introduce
CrowdSTAR, a framework designed to route tasks across and within online crowds.
CrowdSTAR indexes the topic-specific expertise and social features of the crowd
contributors and then uses a routing algorithm, which suggests the best sources
to ask based on the knowledge vs. availability trade-offs. We experimented with
the proposed framework for question and answering scenarios by using two
popular social networks as crowd candidates: Twitter and Quora.
