These are lecture notes for various Summer and Winter schools that I have
given. The notes describe the methodology called Variational Modelling, and
focus on the application to the modelling of gradient-flow systems. I describe
the methodology itself in great detail, and explain why this is a rational
modelling route.
  A central example is diffusion, in combination with various other processes,
and a large part of the notes are devoted to this phenomenon. In the
Variational Modelling methodology, diffusion is commonly modelled by including
entropic terms in the driving functional and Wasserstein-type terms in the
dissipation. I explain how to understand these objects, motivate them from more
basic models, and how to use them in new situations.
