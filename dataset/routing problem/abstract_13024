Thermoacoustic tomography is a term for the inverse problem of determining of
one of initial conditions of a hyperbolic equation from boundary measurements.
In the past publications both stability estimates and convergent numerical
methods for this problem were obtained only under some restrictive conditions
imposed on the principal part of the elliptic operator. In this paper
logarithmic stability estimates are obatined for an arbitrary variable
principal part of that operator. Convergence of the Quasi-Reversibility Method
to the exact solution is also established for this case. Both complete and
incomplete data collection cases are considered.
