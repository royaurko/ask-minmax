Condorcet winning sets are a set-valued generalization of the well-known
concept of a Condorcet winner. As supersets of Condorcet winning sets are
always Condorcet winning sets themselves, an interesting property of preference
profiles is the size of the smallest Condorcet winning set they admit. This
smallest size is called the Condorcet dimension of a preference profile. Since
little is known about profiles that have a certain Condorcet dimension, we show
in this paper how the problem of finding a preference profile that has a given
Condorcet dimension can be encoded as a satisfiability problem and solved by a
SAT solver. Initial results include a minimal example of a preference profile
of Condorcet dimension 3, improving previously known examples both in terms of
the number of agents as well as alternatives. Due to the high complexity of
such problems it remains open whether a preference profile of Condorcet
dimension 4 exists.
