This paper presents an overview of current and potential applications of
living technology to some urban problems. Living technology can be described as
technology that exhibits the core features of living systems. These features
can be useful to solve dynamic problems. In particular, urban problems
concerning mobility, logistics, telecommunications, governance, safety,
sustainability, and society and culture are presented, while solutions
involving living technology are reviewed. A methodology for developing living
technology is mentioned, while supraoptimal public transportation systems are
used as a case study to illustrate the benefits of urban living technology.
Finally, the usefulness of describing cities as living systems is discussed.
