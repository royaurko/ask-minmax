The electronic structure of the Fe-based superconductors is discussed, mainly
from the point of view of first principles calculations in relation to
experimental data. Comparisons and contrasts with cuprates are made. The
problem of reconciling experiments indicating an $s$ symmetry gap with
experiments indicating line nodes is discussed and a possible resolution is
given.
