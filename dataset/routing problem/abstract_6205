Many models of supersymmetry breaking involve particles with weak scale mass
and Planck mass suppressed couplings. Coherent production of such particles in
the early universe destroys the successful predictions of nucleosynthesis. We
show that this problem may be solved by a brief period of weak scale inflation.
Furthermore the inflaton potential for such an inflation naturally arises from
the same assumptions which lead to the cosmological problem. Successful
baryogenesis and preservation of density fluctuations for large scale structure
formation are also possible in this scenario.
