A free boundary problem describing small deformations in a membrane based
model of electrostatically actuated MEMS is investigated. The existence of
stationary solutions is established for small voltage values. A justification
of the widely studied narrow-gap model is given by showing that steady state
solutions of the free boundary problem converge toward stationary solutions of
the narrow-gap model when the aspect ratio of the device tends to zero.
