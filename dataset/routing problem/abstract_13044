We shall consider the problem of Dark Matter in torsion gravity with Dirac
matter fields; we will consider the fact that if WIMPs in a bath are allowed to
form condensates then torsional effects may be relevant even at galactic
scales: we show that torsionally-gravitating Dirac fields have interesting
properties for the problem of DM. We discuss consequences.
