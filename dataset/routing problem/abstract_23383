Electroweak radiative corrections can generate the neutrino (mass)$^2$
difference required for the large mixing angle solution (LMA) to the solar
neutrino problem if two of the neutrinos are assumed degenerate at high energy.
We test this possibility with the existing experimental knowledge of the low
energy neutrino mass and mixing parameters. We derive restrictions on ranges of
the high scale mixing matrix elements and obtain predictions for the low energy
parameters required in order to get the LMA solution of the solar neutrino
problem picked out by KamLAND. We find that in the case of standard model this
is achieved only when the (degenerate) neutrino masses lie in the range
$(0.7-2) \eV$ which is at odds with the cosmological limit $m_{\nu}<0.23 \eV$
(at $95 % C.L$) established recently using WMAP results. Thus SM radiative
corrections cannot easily generate the LMA solution in this scenario. However,
the LMA solution is possible in case of the MSSM electroweak corrections with
(almost) degenerate spectrum or with inverted mass hierarchy for limited ranges
in the high scale parameters.
