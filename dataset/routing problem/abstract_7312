This paper presents a parallel genetic algorithm for generalised vertex cover
problem (GVCP) using Hadoop Map-Reduce framework. The proposed Map-Reduce
implementation helps to run the genetic algorithm for generalized vertex cover
problem (GVCP) on multiple machines parallely and computes the solution in
relatively short time.
