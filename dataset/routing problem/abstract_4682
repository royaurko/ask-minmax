Domain decomposition (DD) methods for solving time-dependent problems can be
classified by (i) the method of domain decomposition used, (ii) the choice of
decomposition operators (exchange of boundary conditions), and (iii) the
splitting scheme employed. To construct homogeneous numerical algorithms,
overlapping subdomain methods are preferable. Domain decomposition is
associated with the corresponding additive representation of the problem
operator. To solve time-dependent problems with the DD splitting, different
operator-splitting schemes are used. Various variants of decomposition
operators differ by distinct types of data exchanges on interfaces. They ensure
the convergence of the approximate solution in various spaces of grid
functions.
