We consider the Cauchy problem associated with a general parabolic partial
differential equation in $d$ dimensions. We find a family of closed-form
asymptotic approximations for the unique classical solution of this equation as
well as rigorous short-time error estimates. Using a boot-strapping technique,
we also provide convergence results for arbitrarily large time intervals.
