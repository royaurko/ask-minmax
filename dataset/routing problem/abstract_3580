In the previous paper we considered two classic problems - the diffuse
reflection of the light beam from semi-infinite atmosphere, and the Milne
problem. For both problems we used the technique of invariance principle. In
this paper we consider the solution of the problem when in semi-infinite
atmosphere the sources of unpolarized radiation are exist. Here we used the
technique of the Green matrices. We consider only continuum radiation.
