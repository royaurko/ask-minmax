We show how standard Metadynamics coupled with classical Molecular Dynamics
can be successfully ap- plied to sample the configurational and free energy
space of metallic and bimetallic nanopclusters via the implementation of
collective variables related to the pair distance distribution function of the
nanoparticle itself. As paradigmatic examples we show an application of our
methodology to Ag147, Pt147 and their alloy AgshellPtcore at 1:1 and 2:1
chemical compositions. The proposed scheme is not only able to reproduce known
structural transformation pathways, as the five and the six square-diamond
mechanisms both in pure and core-shell nanoparticles but also to predict a new
route connecting icosahedron to anti-cuboctahedron.
