This work is motivated by the papers [EG85] and [Ngu15] in which the
following two problems are solved. Let $\mathcal{O}$ is a finitely generated
$\mathbb{Z}$-algebra that is an integrally closed domain of characteristic
zero, consider the following problems:
  (A) Fix $s$ that is integral over $\mathcal{O}$, describe all $t$ such that
$\mathcal{O}[s]=\mathcal{O}[t]$.
  (B) Fix $s$ and $t$ that are integral over $\mathcal{O}$, describe all pairs
$(m,n)\in\mathbb{N}^2$ such that $\mathcal{O}[s^m]=\mathcal{O}[t^n]$.
  In this paper, we solve these problems and provide a uniform bound for a
certain "discriminant form equation" that is closely related to Problem (A)
when $\mathcal{O}$ has characteristic $p>0$. While our general strategy roughly
follows [EG85] and [Ngu15], many new delicate issues arise due to the presence
of the Frobenius automorphisms $x\mapsto x^p$. Recent advances in unit
equations over fields of positive characteristic together with classical
results in characteristic zero play an important role in this paper.
