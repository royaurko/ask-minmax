Supersymmetric standard models where the ultraviolet cut-off scale is only a
few orders of magnitude higher than the electroweak scale are considered.
Phenomenological consequences of this class of models are expected to be very
different from, for example, the conventional supergravity scenario. We apply
this idea to a model with an anomalous U(1) gauge group and construct a viable
model in which some difficulties of the decoupling solution to the
supersymmetric flavor problem are ameliorated.
