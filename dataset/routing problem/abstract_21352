We study Markovian symmetry and non-symmetry random evolutions in
$\mathbf{R}^n$. Weak convergence of Markovian symmetry random evolution to
Wiener process and of Markovian non-symmetry random evolution to a diffusion
process with drift is proved using problems of singular perturbation for the
generators of evolutions. Relative compactness in
$\mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{R}^n\times\Theta}[0,\infty)$ of the families of Markovian
random evolutions is also shown.
