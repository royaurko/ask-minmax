In this paper, we extend the QMRDT probabilistic model for the domain of
internal medicine to include decisions about treatments. In addition, we
describe how we can use the comprehensive decision model to construct a simpler
decision model for a specific patient. In so doing, we transform the task of
problem formulation to that of narrowing of a larger problem.
