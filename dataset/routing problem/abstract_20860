Magnetic properties of quark matter is discussed by evaluating the spin
susceptibility within Fermi-liquid theory. We take into account the dynamical
and static screening effects. At finite temperature, an anomalous T^2 ln T term
for susceptibity is shown as a non-Fermi-liquid effect due to the dynamical
screening of transverse gluons.
