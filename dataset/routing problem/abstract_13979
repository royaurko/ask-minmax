We answer a problem posed by Panov, which is to describe the relationship
between the wedge summands in a homotopy decomposition of the moment-angle
complex corresponding to a disjoint union of k points and the connected sum
factors in a diffeomorphism decomposition of the moment-angle manifold
corresponding to the simple polytope obtained by making k vertex cuts on a
standard d-simplex. This establishes a bridge between two very different
approaches to moment-angle manifolds.
