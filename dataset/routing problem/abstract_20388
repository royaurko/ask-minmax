We study the electromagnetic scattering by multilayered biperiodic aggregates
of dielectric layers and gratings of conducting plates. We show that the
characteristic lengths of such structures provide a good control of absorption
bands. The influence of the physical parameters of the problem (sizes,
impedances) is discussed.
