Newtonian Cosmology is commonly used in astrophysical problems, because of
its obvious simplicity when compared with general relativity. However it has
inherent difficulties, the most obvious of which is the non-existence of a
well-posed initial value problem. In this paper we investigate how far these
problems are met by using the post-Newtonian approximation in cosmology.
