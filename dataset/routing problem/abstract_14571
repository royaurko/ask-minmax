We consider the problem of parameter estimation by the observations of
deterministic signal in white gaussian noise. It is supposed that the signal
has a singularity of cusp-type. The properties of the maximum likelihood and
bayesian estimators are described in the asymptotics of small noise. Special
attention is paid to the problem of parameter estimation in the situation of
misspecification in regularity, i.e.; the statistician supposes that the
observed signal has this singularity, but the real signal is smooth. The rate
and the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator in this
situation are described.
