Orientation estimation for 3D objects is a common problem that is usually
tackled with traditional nonlinear filtering techniques such as the extended
Kalman filter (EKF) or the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). Most of these
techniques assume Gaussian distributions to account for system noise and
uncertain measurements. This distributional assumption does not consider the
periodic nature of pose and orientation uncertainty. We propose a filter that
considers the periodicity of the orientation estimation problem in its
distributional assumption. This is achieved by making use of the Bingham
distribution, which is defined on the hypersphere and thus inherently more
suitable to periodic problems. Furthermore, handling of non-trivial system
functions is done using deterministic sampling in an efficient way. A
deterministic sampling scheme reminiscent of the UKF is proposed for the
nonlinear manifold of orientations. It is the first deterministic sampling
scheme that truly reflects the nonlinear manifold of the orientation.
