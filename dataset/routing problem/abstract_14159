In this paper, we consider the following problem: Does there exist a cubic
surface over $\mathbb{Q}$ which contains no line over $\mathbb{Q}$, yet
contains a line over every completion of $\mathbb{Q}$? This question may be
interpreted as asking whether the Hilbert scheme of lines on a cubic surface
can fail the Hasse principle. We also consider analogous problems, over
arbitrary number fields, for other del Pezzo surfaces and complete
intersections of two quadrics.
