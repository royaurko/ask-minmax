Present routes to produce magnetic organic-based materials adopt a common
strategy: the use of magnetic species (atoms, polyradicals, etc.) as building
blocks. We explore an alternative approach which consists of selective
hydrogenation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons. Self-Consistent-Field (SCF)
(Hartree-Fock and DFT) and multi-configurational (CISD and MCSCF) calculations
on coronene and corannulene, both hexa-hydrogenated, show that the formation of
stable high spin species is possible. The spin of the ground states is
discussed in terms of the Hund rule and Lieb's theorem for bipartite lattices
(alternant hydrocarbons in this case). This proposal opens a new door to
magnetism in the organic world.
