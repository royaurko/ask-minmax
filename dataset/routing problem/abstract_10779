In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to maximize the sum rate in
interference-limited scenarios where each user decodes its own message with the
presence of unknown interferences and noise considering the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio. It is known that the problem of
adapting the transmit and receive filters of the users to maximize the sum rate
with a sum transmit power constraint is non-convex. Our novel approach is to
formulate the sum rate maximization problem as an equivalent multi-convex
optimization problem by adding two sets of auxiliary variables. An iterative
algorithm which alternatingly adjusts the system variables and the auxiliary
variables is proposed to solve the multi-convex optimization problem. The
proposed algorithm is applied to a downlink cellular scenario consisting of
several cells each of which contains a base station serving several mobile
stations. We examine the two cases, with or without several half-duplex
amplify-and-forward relays assisting the transmission. A sum power constraint
at the base stations and a sum power constraint at the relays are assumed.
Finally, we show that the proposed multi-convex formulation of the sum rate
maximization problem is applicable to many other wireless systems in which the
estimated data symbols are multi-affine functions of the system variables.
