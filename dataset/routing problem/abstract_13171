In this paper we prove a sufficient condition, in terms of the behavior of a
ground state of a singular p-Laplacian problem with a potential term, such that
a nonzero subsolution of another such problem is also a ground state. Unlike in
the linear case (p=2), this condition involves comparison of both the functions
and of their gradients.
