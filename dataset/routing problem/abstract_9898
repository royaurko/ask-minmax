This paper addresses problems on the structural design of control systems
taking explicitly into consideration the possible application to large-scale
systems. We provide an efficient and unified framework to solve the following
major minimization problems: (i) selection of the minimum number of
manipulated/measured variables to achieve structural
controllability/observability of the system, and (ii) selection of the minimum
number of feedback interconnections between measured and manipulated variables
such that the closed-loop system has no structurally fixed modes. Contrary to
what would be expected, we show that it is possible to obtain a global solution
for each of the aforementioned minimization problems using polynomial
complexity algorithms in the number of the state variables of the system. In
addition, we provide several new graph-theoretic characterizations of
structural systems concepts, which, in turn, enable us to characterize all
possible solutions to the above problems.
