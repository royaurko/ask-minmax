In this paper, we propose a blind signature scheme and three practical educed
schemes based on elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. The proposed
schemes impart the GOST signature structure and utilize the inherent advantage
of elliptic curve cryptosystems in terms of smaller key size and lower
computational overhead to its counterpart public key cryptosystems such as RSA
and ElGamal. The proposed schemes are proved to be secure and have less time
complexity in comparison with the existing schemes.
