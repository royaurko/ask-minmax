Magnetic and transport properties of (Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3A1/3MnO3 (A = Ca, Sr and
Ba) compounds, prepared by the citrate gel route, have been investigated. These
compounds are found to crystallize in the orthorhombic structure. Charge
ordering transport behavior is indicated only in Ca-substituted compound. The
Sr- and Ba-substituted compounds show metal-insulator transition and
semiconducting-like behavior, respectively. The magnetoresistance is highest in
the Ba substituted compound. All the three samples show irreversibility in
magnetization as a function of temperature in zero-field cooled (ZFC) and field
cooled (FC) plots. The non-saturating magnetization, even at 5K and 4 Tesla
field, are observed in Ca as well Ba-substituted compounds.
