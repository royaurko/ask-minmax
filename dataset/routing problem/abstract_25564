Suppose that we observe noisy linear measurements of an unknown signal that
can be modeled as the sum of two component signals, each of which arises from a
nonlinear sub-manifold of a high dimensional ambient space. We introduce SPIN,
a first order projected gradient method to recover the signal components.
Despite the nonconvex nature of the recovery problem and the possibility of
underdetermined measurements, SPIN provably recovers the signal components,
provided that the signal manifolds are incoherent and that the measurement
operator satisfies a certain restricted isometry property. SPIN significantly
extends the scope of current recovery models and algorithms for low dimensional
linear inverse problems and matches (or exceeds) the current state of the art
in terms of performance.
