Time division multiple access (TDMA) is a method for sharing communication
media. In wireless communications, TDMA algorithms often divide the radio time
into timeslots of uniform size, $\xi$, and then combine them into frames of
uniform size, $\tau$. We consider TDMA algorithms that allocate at least one
timeslot in every frame to every node. Given a maximal node degree, $\delta$,
and no access to external references for collision detection, time or position,
we consider the problem of collision-free self-stabilizing TDMA algorithms that
use constant frame size.
  We demonstrate that this problem has no solution when the frame size is $\tau
< \max\{2\delta,\chi_2\}$, where $\chi_2$ is the chromatic number for
distance-$2$ vertex coloring. As a complement to this lower bound, we focus on
proving the existence of collision-free self-stabilizing TDMA algorithms that
use constant frame size of $\tau$. We consider basic settings (no hardware
support for collision detection and no prior clock synchronization), and the
collision of concurrent transmissions from transmitters that are at most two
hops apart. In the context of self-stabilizing systems that have no external
reference, we are the first to study this problem (to the best of our
knowledge), and use simulations to show convergence even with computation time
uncertainties.
