We study the temperature scale of the Kondo screening of a magnetic impurity
which hybridizes with a two-dimensional electron gas in the presence of the
Rashba spin-orbit interaction. The problem is mapped to an effective
single-band impurity model with a hybridization function having an
inverse-square-root divergence at the bottom of the band. We study the effect
of this divergence on the Kondo screening. The problem is solved numerically
without further approximations using the numerical renormalization group
technique. We find that the Rashba interaction leads to a small variation of
the Kondo temperature (increase or decrease) which depends on the values of the
impurity parameters.
