Translucency is now a common design element in at least one popular mobile
operating system. This raises security concerns as it can make it harder for
users to correctly identify and interpret trusted interaction elements. In this
paper, we demonstrate this security problem using the example of the Safari
browser in the latest iOS version on Apple tablets and phones (iOS7), and
discuss technical challenges of an attack as well as solutions to these
challenges. We conclude with a survey-based user study, where we seek to
quantify the security impact, and find that further investigation is warranted.
