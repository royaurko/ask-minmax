We consider fundamental issues of the mathematical theory of the wave
propagation in waveguides with inclusions. Analysis is performed in terms of a
boundary eigenvalue problem for the Maxwell equations which is reduced to an
eigenvalue problem for an operator pencil. We formulate the definition of
eigenwaves and associated waves using the system of eigenvectors and associated
vectors of the pencil and prove that the spectrum of normal waves forms a
nonempty set of isolated points localized in a strip with at most finitely many
real points.
