We present relations between growth, growth of diameters and the rate of
vanishing of the spectral gap in Schreier graphs of automaton groups. In
particular, we introduce a series of examples, called Hanoi Towers groups since
they model the well known Hanoi Towers Problem, that illustrate some of the
possible types of behavior.
