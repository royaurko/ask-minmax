Global optimisation problems in networks often require shortest path length
computations to determine the most efficient route. The simplest and most
common problem with a shortest path solution is perhaps that of a traditional
labyrinth or maze with a single entrance and exit. Many techniques and
algorithms have been derived to solve mazes, which often tend to be
computationally demanding, especially as the size of maze and number of paths
increase. In addition, they are not suitable for performing multiple shortest
path computations in mazes with multiple entrance and exit points. Mazes have
been proposed to be solved using memristive networks and in this paper we
extend the idea to show how networks of memristive elements can be utilised to
solve multiple shortest paths in a single network. We also show simulations
using memristive circuit elements that demonstrate shortest path computations
in both 2D and 3D networks, which could have potential applications in various
fields.
