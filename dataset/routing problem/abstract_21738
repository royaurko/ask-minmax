We study the conditions under which the iterated elimination of strictly
dominated strategies is order independent and we identify a class of
discontinuous games for which order does not matter. In this way, we answer the
open problem raised by M. Dufwenberg and M. Stegeman (2002) and generalize
their main results. We also establish new theorems concerning the existence and
uniqueness of the maximal game reduction when the pure strategies are dominated
by mixed strategies.
