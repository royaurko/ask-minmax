This paper is concerned with two examples on the application of the free
boundary formulation to BVPs on a semi-infinite interval. In both cases we are
able to provide the exact solution of both the BVP and its free boundary
formulation. Therefore, these problems can be used as benchmarks for the
numerical methods applied to BVPs on a semi-infinite interval and to free BVPs.
Moreover, we emphasize how for two classes of free BVPs, we can define
non-iterative initial value methods, whereas BVPs are usually solved
iteratively. These non-iterative methods can be deduced within Lie's group
invariance theory. Then, we show how to apply the non-iterative methods to the
two introduced free boundary formulations in order to obtain meaningful
numerical results. Finally, we indicate several problems from the literature
where our non-iterative transformation methods can be applied.
