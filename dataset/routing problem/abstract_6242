The Coulomb problem for vector bosons W incorporates a well known difficulty;
the charge of the boson localized in a close vicinity of the attractive Coulomb
center proves be infinite. This fact contradicts the renormalizability of the
Standard Model, which presumes that at small distances all physical quantities
are well defined. The paradox is shown to be resolved by the QED vacuum
polarization, which brings in a strong effective repulsion that eradicates the
infinite charge of the boson on the Coulomb center. This property allows to
define the Coulomb problem for vector bosons properly, making it consistent
with the Standard Model.
