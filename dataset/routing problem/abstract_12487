Bound states of complex scalar fields (boson stars) have long been proposed
as possible candidates for the dark matter in the universe. Considerable work
has already been done to study various aspects of boson stars. In the present
work, assuming a particular anisotropic matter distribution, we solve the
Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations with a cosmological constant to obtain bosonic
configurations by treating the problem geometrically. The results are then
applied to problems covering a wide range of masses and radii of the boson
stars and the relevant self interaction parameters are calculated. We compare
our results with earlier treatments to show the applicability of the
geometrical approach.
