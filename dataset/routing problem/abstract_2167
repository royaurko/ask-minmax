In air traffic management (ATM) all necessary operations (tactical planing,
sector configuration, required staffing, runway configuration, routing of
approaching aircrafts) rely on accurate measurements and predictions of the
current weather situation. An essential basis of information is delivered by
weather radar images (WXR), which, unfortunately, exhibit a vast amount of
disturbances. Thus, the improvement of these datasets is the key factor for
more accurate predictions of weather phenomena and weather conditions. Image
processing methods based on texture analysis and geometric operators allow to
identify regions including artefacts as well as zones of missing information.
Correction of these zones is implemented by exploiting multi-spectral satellite
data (Meteosat Second Generation). Results prove that the proposed system for
artefact detection and data correction significantly improves the quality of
WXR data and, thus, enables more reliable weather now- and forecast leading to
increased ATM safety.
