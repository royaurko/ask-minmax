We characterize joint k-hyponormality for 2-variable weighted shifts. Using
this characterization we construct a family of examples which establishes and
illustrates the gap between k-hyponormality and (k+1)-hyponormality for each
k>=1. As a consequence, we obtain an abstract solution to the Lifting Problem
for Commuting Subnormals.
