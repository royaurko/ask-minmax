The problem of bound states in delta potentials is revisited by means of
Fourier transform approach. The problem in a simple delta potential sums up to
solve an algebraic equation of degree one for the Fourier transform of the
eigenfunction and the problem for more than one delta function also reveals
itself to be a simple matter. Quite differently from direct methods, no
knowledge about the jump discontinuity of the first derivative of the
eigenfunction is required to determine the solution of the problem.
