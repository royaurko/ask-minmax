This paper presents a novel idea for the general case of the Common Due-Date
(CDD) scheduling problem. The problem is about scheduling a certain number of
jobs on a single or parallel machines where all the jobs possess different
processing times but a common due-date. The objective of the problem is to
minimize the total penalty incurred due to earliness or tardiness of the job
completions. This work presents exact polynomial algorithms for optimizing a
given job sequence for single and identical parallel machines with the run-time
complexities of $O(n \log n)$ for both cases, where $n$ is the number of jobs.
Besides, we show that our approach for the parallel machine case is also
suitable for non-identical parallel machines. We prove the optimality for the
single machine case and the runtime complexities of both. Henceforth, we extend
our approach to one particular dynamic case of the CDD and conclude the chapter
with our results for the benchmark instances provided in the OR-library.
