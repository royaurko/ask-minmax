In this work we study the set size distribution estimation problem, where
elements are randomly sampled from a collection of non-overlapping sets and we
seek to recover the original set size distribution from the samples. This
problem has applications to capacity planning, network theory, among other
areas. Examples of real-world applications include characterizing in-degree
distributions in large graphs and uncovering TCP/IP flow size distributions on
the Internet. We demonstrate that it is hard to estimate the original set size
distribution. The recoverability of original set size distributions presents a
sharp threshold with respect to the fraction of elements that remain in the
sets. If this fraction remains below a threshold, typically half of the
elements in power-law and heavier-than-exponential-tailed distributions, then
the original set size distribution is unrecoverable. We also discuss practical
implications of our findings.
