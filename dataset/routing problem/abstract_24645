Popular density functionals for the exchange-correlation energy typically
fail to reproduce the degeneracy of different ground states of open-shell
atoms. As a remedy, functionals which explicitly depend on the current density
have been suggested. We present an analysis of this problem by investigating
functionals that explicitly depend on the Kohn-Sham orbitals. Going beyond the
exact-exchange approximation by adding correlation in the form of the
Colle-Salvetti functional we show how current-dependent terms enter the
Colle-Salvetti expression and their relevance is evaluated. A very good
description of the degeneracy of ground-states for atoms of the first and
second row of the periodic table is obtained.
