Recently Yoon has suggested that there may be problems for the conformal
gravity theory in recovering Newtonian gravity. Here we show that Yoon's
results are due to assuming that gravitational sources can be treated the same
way that they are treated in standard gravity. Since such an assumption
violates the theory's underlying conformal invariance,Yoon's conclusions are
invalid.
