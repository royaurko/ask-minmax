We consider the renormalization group approach to the SUSY flavor problem in
the supersymmetric SU(5) model with one extra dimension. In higher dimensional
SUSY gauge theories, it has been recently shown that power corrections due to
the Kaluza-Klein states of gauge fields run the soft masses generated at the
orbifold fixed point to flavor conserving values in the infra-red limit. In
models with GUT breaking at the brane where the GUT scale can be larger than
the compactification scale, we show that the addition of a bulk Higgs
multiplet, which is necessary for the successful unification, is compatible
with the flavor universality achieved at the compactification scale.
