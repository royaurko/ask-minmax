The aim of this paper is to consider quasi-linear systems which are not in
the form of evolution equations. We propose new condition of Richness or
Semi-Hamiltonicity for such a system and prove that the blow up analysis along
characteristic curves can be performed for it in an analogous manner. This
opens a possibility to use this ansatz also for geometric problems. We apply
the results to the problem of Polynomial integral for geodesic flows on the
2-torus.
