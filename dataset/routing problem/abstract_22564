We present warm dark matter (WDM) as a possible solution to the missing
satellites and angular momentum problem in galaxy formation and introduce
improved initial conditions for numerical simulations of WDM models, which
avoid the formation of unphysical haloes found in earlier simulations. There is
a hint, that the mass function of satellite haloes has been overestimated so
far, pointing to higher values for the WDM particle mass.
