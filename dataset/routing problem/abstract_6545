Many interesting graph families contain only 2-connected graphs, which have
ear decompositions. We develop a technique to generate families of unlabeled
2-connected graphs using ear augmentations and apply this technique to two
problems. In the first application, we search for uniquely K_r-saturated graphs
and find the list of uniquely K_4-saturated graphs on at most 12 vertices,
supporting current conjectures for this problem. In the second application, we
verifying the Edge Reconstruction Conjecture for all 2-connected graphs on at
most 12 vertices. This technique can be easily extended to more problems
concerning 2-connected graphs.
