We study KKLT type models with moduli-mixing superpotential. In several
string models, gauge kinetic functions are written as linear combinations of
two or more moduli fields. Their gluino condensation generates moduli-mixing
superpotential. We assume one of moduli fields is frozen already around the
string scale. It is found that K\"ahler modulus can be stabilized at a
realistic value without tuning 3-form fluxes because of gluino condensation on
(non-)magnetized D-brane. Furthermore, we do not need to highly tune parameters
in order to realize a weak gauge coupling and a large hierarchy between the
gravitino mass and the Planck scale, when there exists non-perturbative effects
on D3-brane. SUSY breaking patterns in our models have a rich structure. Also,
some of our models have cosmologically important implications, e.g., on the
overshooting problem and the destabilization problem due to finite temperature
effects as well as the gravitino problem and the moduli problem.
