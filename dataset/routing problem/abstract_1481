Nanocarbon-doped Fe-sheathed MgB2 tapes with different doping levels were
prepared by the in situ powder-in-tube method. Compared to the undoped tapes,
Jc for all the C-doped samples was enhanced by more than an order of magnitude
in magnetic fields above 9 T. At 4.2 K, the transport Jc for the 5 at% doped
tapes reached 1.85x104 A/cm2 at 10 T and 2.8x103 A/cm2 at 14 T, respectively.
Moreover, the critical temperature for the doped tapes decreased slightly.
Transmission electron microscopy showed a number of intra-granular dislocations
and the dispersed nanoparticles embedded within MgB2 grains induced by the C
doping. The mechanism for the enhancement of flux pinning is also discussed.
These results indicate that powder-in-tube-processed MgB2 tape is very
promising for high-field applications.
