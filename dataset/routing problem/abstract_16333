The problem of identifying splice sites consists of two sub-problems: finding
their boundaries, and characterizing their sequence markers. Other splicing
elements---including, enhancers and silencers---that occur in the intronic and
exonic regions play an important role in splicing activity. Existing methods
for detecting splicing elements are limited to finding either splice sites or
enhancers and silencers, even though these elements are well-known to co-occur.
We introduce SeeSite, an efficient and accurate tool for detecting splice sites
and their complementary exon splicing enhancers (ESEs).
  SeeSite has three stages: graph construction, finding dense subgraphs, and
recovering splice sites and ESEs along with their consensus. The third step
involves solving Consensus Sequence with Outliers, an NP-complete string
clustering problem. We prove that our algorithm for this problem outputs
near-optimal solutions in polynomial time. Using SeeSite we demonstrate that
ESEs are preferentially associated with weaker splice sites, and splice sites
of a certain canonical form co-occur with specific ESEs.
