We consider two-player turn-based games with zero-reachability and
zero-safety objectives generated by extended vector addition systems with
states. Although the problem of deciding the winner in such games is
undecidable in general, we identify several decidable and even tractable
subcases of this problem obtained by restricting the number of counters and/or
the sets of target configurations.
