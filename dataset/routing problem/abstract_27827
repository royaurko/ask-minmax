The classification of separable operator spaces and systems is commonly
believed to be intractable. We analyze this belief from the point of view of
Borel complexity theory. On one hand we confirm that the classification
problems for arbitrary separable operator systems and spaces are intractable.
On the other hand we show that the finitely generated operator systems and
spaces are completely classifiable (or smooth); in fact a finitely generated
operator system is classified by its complete theory when regarded as a
structure in continuous logic. In the particular case of operator systems
generated by a single unitary, a complete invariant is given by the spectrum of
the unitary up to a rigid motion of the circle, provided that the spectrum
contains at least $5$ points. As a consequence of these results we show that
the relation on compact subsets of $\mathbb{C}^{n}$, given by homeomorphism via
a degree $1$ polynomial, is smooth.
