Design of {\it online algorithms} for assigning mobile users to basestations
is considered with the objective of maximizing the sum-rate, when all users
associated to any one basestation equally share each basestation's resources.
Each user on its arrival reveals the rates it can obtain if connected to each
of the basestations, and the problem is to assign each user to any one
basestation irrevocably so that the sum-rate is maximized at the end of all
user arrivals, without knowing the future user arrival or rate information or
its statistics at each user arrival. Online algorithms with constant factor
loss in comparison to offline algorithms (that know both the user arrival and
user rates profile in advance) are derived. The proposed online algorithms are
motivated from the famous online k-secretary problem and online maximum weight
matching problem.
