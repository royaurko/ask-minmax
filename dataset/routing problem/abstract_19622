Formula for calculating the atomic scattering factor for spherical x-ray
waves is derived and used to solve the near field effects problem in X-ray
Fluorescence Holography theory. A rigorous formalism to calculate the X-ray
fluorescence hologram for given atomic distributions is then given so that
quantitative structural information can be derived from XFH measurements.
