We derive energy-norm a posteriori error bounds for an Euler time-stepping
method combined with various spatial discontinuous Galerkin schemes for linear
parabolic problems. For accessibility, we address first the spatially
semidiscrete case, and then move to the fully discrete scheme by introducing
the implicit Euler time-stepping. All results are presented in an abstract
setting and then illustrated with particular applications. This enables the
error bounds to hold for a variety of discontinuous Galerkin methods, provided
that energy-norm a posteriori error bounds for the corresponding elliptic
problem are available. To illustrate the method, we apply it to the interior
penalty discontinuous Galerkin method, which requires the derivation of novel a
posteriori error bounds. For the analysis of the time-dependent problems we use
the elliptic reconstruction technique and we deal with the nonconforming part
of the error by deriving appropriate computable a posteriori bounds for it.
