We consider a nonlocal problem involving the fractional laplacian and the
Hardy potential, in bounded smooth domains. Exploiting the moving plane method
and some weak and strong comparison principles, we deduce symmetry and
monotonicity properties of positive solutions under zero Dirichlet boundary
conditions.
