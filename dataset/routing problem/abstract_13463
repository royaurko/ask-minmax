We try to improve a problem asked in an Indian Math Olympiad. We give a brief
overview of the work done in Saikia and Vogrinc (2011) and Saikia and Vogrinc
where the contributors have found a periodic sequence and the length of its period,
all inspired from an Olympiad problem. The main goal of the paper is to improve
the main result in Saikia and Vogrinc (2011).
