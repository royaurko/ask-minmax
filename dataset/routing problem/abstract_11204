Micron-sized black holes do not necessarily have a constant horizon
temperature distribution. The black hole remote-sensing problem means to find
out the `surface' temperature distribution of a small black hole from the
spectral measurement of its (Hawking) grey pulse. This problem has been
previously considered by Rosu, who used Chen's modified Moebius inverse
transform. Here, we hint on a Ramanujan generalization of Chen's modified
Moebius inverse transform that may be considered as a special wavelet
processing of the remote-sensed grey signal coming from a black hole or any
other distant grey source
