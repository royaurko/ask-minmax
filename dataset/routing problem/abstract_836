We present a theoretical analysis of methods to synthesize entangled states
of two superconducting resonators. These methods use experimentally
demonstrated interactions of resonators with artificial atoms, and offer
efficient routes to generate nonclassical states. We analyze physical
implementations, energy level structure, and the effects of decoherence through
detailed dynamical simulations.
