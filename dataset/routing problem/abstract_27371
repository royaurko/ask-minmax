Omnidirectional light concentration remains an unsolved problem despite such
important practical applications as design of efficient mobile photovoltaic
cells. Optical black hole designs developed recently offer partial solution to
this problem. However, even these solutions are not truly omnidirectional since
they do not exhibit a horizon, and at large enough incidence angles light may
be trapped into quasi-stationary orbits around such imperfect optical black
holes. Here we propose and realize experimentally another gravity-inspired
design of a broadband omnidirectional light concentrator based on the
cosmological Big Crunch solutions. By mimicking the Big Crunch spacetime via
corresponding effective optical metric we make sure that every photon world
line terminates in a single point.
