In this paper two things are done. First, we propose a simple model of
dynamical gauge-mediated SUSY breaking. This model incorporates a dynamical
relaxation mechanism which solves the \mu-problem with no light fields beyond
those of the MSSM. In the second part of the paper we show how this mechanism
is generalized and give two more examples in which it is incorporated.
