In the present paper we focus on the coherence properties of general random
Euclidean distance matrices, which are very closely related to the respective
matrix completion problem. This problem is of great interest in several
applications such as node localization in sensor networks with limited
connectivity. Our results can directly provide the sufficient conditions under
which an EDM can be successfully recovered with high probability from a limited
number of measurements.
