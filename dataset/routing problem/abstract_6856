The global regularity for the incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations
(MHD) in three dimensions is a long standing open problem of fluid dynamics and
PDE theory. The Navier-Stokes equations can be viewed as a special case of MHD
with a constant magnetic field, whose global regularity problem is known as a
Clay Millennium Prize Problem. In this article, we prove the global regularity
of axially symmetric solutions to the ideal MHD in three dimensions for a
family of non-trivial magnetic fields. The proofs are based on the special
structures of MHD and can of course also applied to the resistive MHD. Our
result might indicate that there are richer fantastic research topics in MHD
than Navier-Stokes equations.
