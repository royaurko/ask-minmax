We present the first streaming algorithm for counting an arbitrary hypergraph
$H$ of constant size in a massive hypergraph $G$. Our algorithm can handle both
edge-insertions and edge-deletions, and is applicable for the distributed
setting. Moreover, our approach provides the first family of graph polynomials
for the hypergraph counting problem. Because of the close relationship between
hypergraphs and set systems, our approach may have applications in studying
similar problems.
