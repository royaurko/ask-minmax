We give a joint description of weak radiative (WR) and nonleptonic (NL)
hyperon decays (HD) in broken SU(3). The two groups of decays are linked via
$SU(2)_W$ spin symmetry and vector meson dominance (VMD). We use experimental
information on the parity-conserving (p.c.) NLHD amplitudes to fix the
corresponding WRHD amplitudes. With the latter known, the data on the WRHD
branching ratios and asymmetries permit us to determine the parity-violating
(p.v.) WRHD amplitudes in terms of two parameters corresponding to the
two-quark and single-quark transitions. We obtain a good description of the
data, and in particular a large $\Sigma ^+ \to p \gamma$ asymmetry. Then, using
the $SU(2)_W$+VMD route we determine the non-soft-meson correction term in the
p.v. NLHD amplitudes. The latter is shown to subtract a substantial amount from
the current-algebra commutator thus leading towards the resolution of the S:P
discrepancy in NLHD.
