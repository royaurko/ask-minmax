We consider signals that follow a parametric distribution where the parameter
values are unknown. To estimate such signals from noisy measurements in scalar
channels, we study the empirical performance of an empirical Bayes (EB)
approach and a full Bayes (FB) approach. We then apply EB and FB to solve
compressed sensing (CS) signal estimation problems by successively denoising a
scalar Gaussian channel within an approximate message passing (AMP) framework.
Our numerical results show that FB achieves better performance than EB in
scalar channel denoising problems when the signal dimension is small. In the CS
setting, the signal dimension must be large enough for AMP to work well; for
large signal dimensions, AMP has similar performance with FB and EB.
