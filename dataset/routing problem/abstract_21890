Any given surface of revolution embedded in Euclidean three-space can always
be perturbed by arbitrarily small ambient isotopies as to admit highly
nontrivial vector fields inducing infinitesimal deformations. For this matter
Morse Theory is used, clarifying and giving a general response of a problem
started with an idea of M. Spivak.
