In this paper, we consider planning in stochastic shortest path (SSP)
problems, a subclass of Markov Decision Problems (MDP). We focus on medium-size
problems whose state space can be fully enumerated. This problem has numerous
important applications, such as navigation and planning under uncertainty. We
propose a new approach for constructing a multi-level hierarchy of
progressively simpler abstractions of the original problem. Once computed, the
hierarchy can be used to speed up planning by first finding a policy for the
most abstract level and then recursively refining it into a solution to the
original problem. This approach is fully automated and delivers a speed-up of
two orders of magnitude over a state-of-the-art MDP solver on sample problems
while returning near-optimal solutions. We also prove theoretical bounds on the
loss of solution optimality resulting from the use of abstractions.
