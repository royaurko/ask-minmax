Solutions to the complementarity problem constructed in [1], generally,
possess non-zero total charge. In natural sciences, bodies possessing non-zero
total charge (ions and similar object) are considered as specific objects.
Bodies possessing zero total charge (electro-neutral bodies) are considered as
general case objects. This paper presents a solution to the complementarity
problem for electro-neutral bodies. The solution is constructed under the
condition that the volumes of the bodies are small.
