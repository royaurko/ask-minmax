We propose an extension of the standard model with a $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ global
symmetry that accommodates radiative neutrino masses along with dark matter and
leptogenesis. The observed matter antimatter asymmetry of the universe is
generated through the leptogenesis route keeping the $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ symmetry
intact. The $B-L$ global symmetry is then softly broken, providing the sub-eV
neutrino masses. The model then incorporates a MeV scale sterile neutrino like
dark matter.
