We study two nonlinear methods for statistical linear inverse problems when
the operator is not known. The two constructions combine Galerkin
regularization and wavelet thresholding. Their performances depend on the
underlying structure of the operator, quantified by an index of sparsity. We
prove their rate-optimality and adaptivity properties over Besov classes.
