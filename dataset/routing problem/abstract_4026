We simulate magnetic reconnection in the GEM problem using a two-fluid model
with 10 moments for the electron fluid as well as the proton fluid. We show
that use of 10 moments for electrons gives good qualitative agreement with the
the electron pressure tensor components in published kinetic simulations.
