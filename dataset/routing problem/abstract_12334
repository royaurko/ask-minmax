The form $A\cdot exp(-(x-c)^2 /(a(x-c)+2b^2))$ is an asymmetric distribution
intermediate between the normal and exponential distributions. Some specific
properties of the form are presented and methods of approximation are offered.
Appropriate formulae and table are presented. The practical problems of
approximation by the form are discussed with connection to the quality of
original data. Application of the methods is illustrated by using in the
problem of calculating and studying distribution function of maximum ultra high
energy atmospheric showers. Relationship with exponential and normal
distributions makes usage of the form to be effective in practice.
