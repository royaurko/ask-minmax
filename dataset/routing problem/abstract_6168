Very few studies involve how to construct the efficient RBFs by means of
problem features. Recently the present contributor presented general solution RBF
(GS-RBF) methodology to create operator-dependent RBFs successfully [1]. On the
other hand, the normal radial basis function (RBF) is defined via Euclidean
space distance function or the geodesic distance [2]. This purpose of this note
is to redefine distance function in conjunction with problem features, which
include problem-dependent and time-space distance function.
