The Bousso-Polchinski (BP) Landscape is a proposal for solving the
Cosmological Constant Problem. The solution requires counting the states in a
very thin shell in flux space. We find an exact formula for this counting
problem which has two simple asymptotic regimes, one of them being the method
of counting low $\Lambda$ states given originally by Bousso and Polchinski. We
finally give some applications of the extended formula: a robust property of
the Landscape which can be identified with an effective occupation number, an
estimator for the minimum cosmological constant and a possible influence on the
KKLT stabilization mechanism.
