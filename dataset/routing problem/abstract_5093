We study the adversarial satisfiability problem, where the adversary can
choose whether variables are negated in clauses or not in order to make the
resulting formula unsatisfiable. This is one case of a general class of
adversarial optimization problems that often arise in practice and are
algorithmically much harder than the standard optimization problems. We use the
cavity method to compute large deviations of the entropy in the random
satisfiability problem with respect to the negation-configurations. We conclude
that in the thermodynamic limit the best strategy the adversary can adopt is
extremely close to simply balancing the number of times every variable is and
is not negated. We also conduct a numerical study of the problem, and find that
there are very strong pre-asymptotic effects that are due to the fact that for
small sizes exponential and factorial growth is hardly distinguishable.
