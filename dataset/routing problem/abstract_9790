In this paper, we have studied the control problem of target-point based path
following for car-type vehicles. This special path following task arises from
the needs of vision based guidance systems, where a given target-point located
ahead of the vehicle, in the visual range of the camera, must follow a
specified path. A solution to this problem is developed through a non linear
transformation of the path following problem into a reference trajectory
tracking problem, by modeling the target point as a virtual vehicle. Bounded
feedback laws must be then used on the real vehicle's angular acceleration and
the virtual vehicle's velocity, to achieve stability. The resulting controller
is globally asymptotically stable with respect and the proof is demonstrated
using Lyapunov based arguments and a bootstrap argument. The effectiveness of
this controller has been illustrated through simulations.
