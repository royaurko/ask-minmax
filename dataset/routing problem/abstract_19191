Markovian processes have long been used to model stochastic environments.
Reinforcement learning has emerged as a framework to solve sequential planning
and decision-making problems in such environments. In recent years, attempts
were made to apply methods from reinforcement learning to construct decision
support systems for action selection in Markovian environments. Although
conventional methods in reinforcement learning have proved to be useful in
problems concerning sequential decision-making, they cannot be applied in their
current form to decision support systems, such as those in medical domains, as
they suggest policies that are often highly prescriptive and leave little room
for the users input. Without the ability to provide flexible guidelines, it is
unlikely that these methods can gain ground with users of such systems. This
paper introduces the new concept of non-deterministic policies to allow more
flexibility in the users decision-making process, while constraining decisions
to remain near optimal solutions. We provide two algorithms to compute
non-deterministic policies in discrete domains. We study the output and running
time of these method on a set of synthetic and real-world problems. In an
experiment with human subjects, we show that humans assisted by hints based on
non-deterministic policies outperform both human-only and computer-only agents
in a web navigation task.
