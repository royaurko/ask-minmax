The problem of heat conduction in one-dimensional piecewise homogeneous
composite materials is examined by providing an explicit solution of the
one-dimensional heat equation in each domain. The location of the interfaces is
known, but neither temperature nor heat flux are prescribed there. Instead, the
physical assumptions of their continuity at the interfaces are the only
conditions imposed. The problem of two semi-infinite domains and that of two
finite-sized domains are examined in detail. We indicate also how to extend the
solution method to the setting of one finite-sized domain surrounded on both
sides by semi-infinite domains, and on that of three finite-sized domains.
