In this paper, we use the method of Fourier analysis to derive the formula of
the total energy for the Cauchy problem of the Cauchy-Navier elastodynamics
wave equation describing the motion of an isotropic elastic body. The
conservation law of the total energy is obtained and consequently, the global
uniqueness of the solution to the problem is implied.
