Optical phase measurement is a simple example of a quantum--limited
measurement problem with important applications in metrology such as
gravitational wave detection. The formulation of optimal strategies for such
measurements is an important test-bed for the development of robust statistical
methods for instrument evaluation. However, the class of possible distributions
exhibits extreme pathologies not commonly encountered in conventional
statistical analysis. To overcome these difficulties we reformulate the basic
variational problem of optimal phase measurement within a Bayesian paradigm and
employ the Shannon information as a robust figure of merit. Single-mode
performance bounds are discussed, and we invoke a general theorem that reduces
the problem of finding the multi-mode performance bounds to the bounding of a
single integral, without need of the central limit theorem.
