In this article (it's only in italian, but I'm translating it) I will try to
solve some questions about a mathematical problem that my friend Patrizio
Frederic, a researcher in statistics at the University of Modena, proposed to
me. Given some parallel line segments, is there at least one straight line that
passes through all of them? If there were many lines that solve the problem,
how can I choose a "better one" among all of them? I fully answer the first
question, for the second I'll just give some ideas for future research.
