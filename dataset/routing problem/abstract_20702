In this paper we look at new class of objects made up entirely of dark matter
particles. We look at these objects as possible candidate for short duration
gamma ray bursts eliminating the baryon load problem. These could also provide
a possible scenario for the formation of sub-stellar black holes, distinct from
the usual Hawking black hole.
