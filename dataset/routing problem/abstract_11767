We investigate the mKdV hierarchy with integral type of source (mKdVHWS),
which consist of the reduced AKNS eigenvalue problem with $r=q$ and the mKdV
hierarchy with extra term of the integration of square eigenfunction. First we
propose a method to find the explicit evolution equation for eigenfunction of
the auxiliary linear problems of the mKdVHWS. Then we determine the evolution
equations of scattering data corresponding to the mKdVHWS which allow us to
solve the equation in the mKdVHWS by inverse scattering transformation.
