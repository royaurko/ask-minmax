We consider energy-critical Schroedinger maps with target either the sphere
S^2 or hyperbolic plane H^2 and establish that a unique solution may be
continued so long as a certain space-time L^4 norm remains bounded. This
reduces the large data global wellposedness problem to that of controlling this
norm.
