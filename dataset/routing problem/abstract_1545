Magnetic properties of core-shell cobalt ferrite nanoparticles 15 to 48nm
prepared by a sol-gel route have been studied. It is shown that the coercivity
follows non-monotonic size dependence varying as 1/d above the maximum (d is
the particle size). Field cooled magnetization exhibited both horizontal
(exchange bias) and vertical shifts. The exchange bias is understood as
originating at the interface between a surface region with structural and spin
disorder and a core ferrimagnetic region. The dependence of the exchange bias
and vertical shifts on the particle sizes and cooling fields are found to have
significant differences and the differences are explained in the light of
recent results which suggest that both weakly and strongly pinned spins are
present at the interface. It is suggested that the exchange bias is dominated
by the weakly pinned spins while the vertical shift is affected by the strongly
pinned ones.
