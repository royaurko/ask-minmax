We compute the full order statistics of a one-dimensional gas of fermions in
a harmonic trap at zero temperature, including its large deviation tails. The
problem amounts to computing the probability distribution of the $k$th smallest
eigenvalue $\lambda_{(k)}$ of a large dimensional Gaussian random matrix. We
find that this probability behaves for large $N$ as
$\mathcal{P}[\lambda_{(k)}=x]\approx \exp\left(-\beta N^2 \psi(k/N,x)\right)$,
where $\beta$ is the Dyson index of the ensemble. The rate function
$\psi(c,x)$, computed explicitly as a function of $x$ in terms of the intensive
label $c=k/N$, has a quadratic behavior modulated by a weak logarithmic
singularity at its minimum. This is shown to be related to phase transitions in
the associated Coulomb gas problem. The connection with statistics of extreme
eigenvalues of random matrices is also elucidated.
