The Symmetric Primal-Dual Simplex Pivoting Decision Strategy (spdspds) is a
novel iterative algorithm to solve linear programming (LP) problems. Each
iteration is based on a systematic selection and application of one among the
newly identified set of four (or possibly six) distinct types of simplex pivots
defined over a symmetric primal-dual pair of LP. The two (or possibly four)
types of classical (standard) simplex pivots are the Primal Standard Pivot with
positive (or zero) indicator, and the Dual Standard Pivot with negative (or
zero) indicator. The two newly identified pivot types are: the Primal Tricky
Pivot with positive indicator and the Dual Tricky Pivot with negative
indicator. If more than one candidate pivot element/cell is of the same type,
then a selection among them can be made based on a measure of goodness that is
defined as the decrease in the infeasibility index of such cells. If further
pivoting is not possible, then the tableau is checked for the terminal type to
facilitate the problem classification. An analysis of the evolution of the
Tableau data entries pattern observed as the iterations proceed is also
presented. A classification of the LP problem into one of the six types is
identified based on the data entries pattern observed in the final Tableau.
