In this paper we deal with the exterior problem for a system of nonlinear
wave equations in two space dimensions, assuming that the initial data is small
and smooth. We establish the same type of lower bound of the lifespan for the
problem as that for the Cauchy problem, despite of the weak decay property of
the solution in two space dimensions.
