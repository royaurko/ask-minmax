We propose and study a number of layer methods for stochastic Navier-Stokes
equations (SNSE) with spatial periodic boundary conditions and additive noise.
The methods are constructed using conditional probabilistic representations of
solutions to SNSE and exploiting ideas of the weak sense numerical integration
of stochastic differential equations. We prove some convergence results for the
proposed methods. Results of numerical experiments on two model problems are
presented.
