We study the problem of conformal deformation of Riemannian structure to
constant scalar curvature with zero mean curvature on the boundary. We prove
compactness for the full set of solutions when the boundary is umbilic and the
dimension $n \leq 24$. The Weyl Vanishing Theorem is also established under
these hypotheses, and we provide counter-examples to compactness when $n \geq
25$. Lastly, our methods point towards a vanishing theorem for the umbilicity
tensor, which is anticipated to be fundamental for a study of the nonumbilic
case.
