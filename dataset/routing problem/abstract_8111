We consider a particular case of an analog for elliptic curves to the
Mersenne problem : finding explicitely all prime power terms in an elliptic
divisibility sequence when descent via isogeny is possible. We explain how this
question can be related to classical problems in diophantine geometry and we
compute an explicit upper bound on the index of prime power terms in magnified
elliptic divisibility sequences.
