A distributed data collection algorithm to accurately store and forward
information obtained by wireless sensor networks is proposed. The proposed
algorithm does not depend on the sensor network topology, routing tables, or
geographic locations of sensor nodes, but rather makes use of uniformly
distributed storage nodes. Analytical and simulation results for this algorithm
show that, with high probability, the data disseminated by the sensor nodes can
be precisely collected by querying any small set of storage nodes.
