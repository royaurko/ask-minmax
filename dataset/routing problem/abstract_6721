In this paper, we settle the open complexity status of interval constrained
coloring with a fixed number of colors. We prove that the problem is already
NP-complete if the number of different colors is 3. Previously, it has only
been known that it is NP-complete, if the number of colors is part of the input
and that the problem is solvable in polynomial time, if the number of colors is
at most 2. We also show that it is hard to satisfy almost all of the
constraints for a feasible instance.
