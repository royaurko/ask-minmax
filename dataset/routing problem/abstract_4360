A sort of two dimensional linear auxiliary problem for the complex of 3D $R$
-- operators associated with the Zamolodchikov -- Bazhanov -- Baxter
statistical model is proposed. This problem resembles the problem of the local
Yang -- Baxter equation but does not coincide with it. The formulation of the
auxiliary problem admits a notion of a ``fusion'', and usual local Yang --
Baxter equation appears among other results of this ``fusion''.
