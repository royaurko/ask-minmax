This paper concerns the asymptotic expansion of the solution of the
Dirichlet-Laplace problem in a domain with small inclusions. This problem is
well understood for the Neumann condition in dimension greater than two or
Dirichlet condition in dimension greater than three. The case of two circular
inclusions in a bidimensional domain was considered in [1]. In this paper, we
generalize the previous result to any shape and relax the assumptions of
regularity and support of the data. Our approach uses conformal mapping and
suitable lifting of Dirichlet conditions. We also analyze configurations with
several scales for the distance between the inclusions (when the number is
larger than 2).
