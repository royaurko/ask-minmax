We consider a Reinforcement Learning setup where an agent interacts with an
environment in observation-reward-action cycles without any (esp.\ MDP)
assumptions on the environment. State aggregation and more generally feature
reinforcement learning is concerned with mapping histories/raw-states to
reduced/aggregated states. The idea behind both is that the resulting reduced
process (approximately) forms a small stationary finite-state MDP, which can
then be efficiently solved or learnt. We considerably generalize existing
aggregation results by showing that even if the reduced process is not an MDP,
the (q-)value functions and (optimal) policies of an associated MDP with same
state-space size solve the original problem, as long as the solution can
approximately be represented as a function of the reduced states. This implies
an upper bound on the required state space size that holds uniformly for all RL
problems. It may also explain why RL algorithms designed for MDPs sometimes
perform well beyond MDPs.
