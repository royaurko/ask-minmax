Some examples from the mathematics of shape are presented that question some
of the almost hidden assumptions behind results on limiting behaviour of
finitary approximations to space-time. These are presented so as to focus
attention on the observational problem of refinement and suggest the necessity
for an alternative theory of `fractafolds' against which the limiting theory of
$C^\infty$-differential manifolds usually underlying (quantum) general
relativity can be measured.
