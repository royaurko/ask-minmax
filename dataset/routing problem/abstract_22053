We consider p-evolution equations, for $p\geq2$, with complex valued
coefficients. We prove that a necessary condition for $H^\infty$ well-posedness
of the associated Cauchy problem is that the imaginary part of the coefficient
of the subprincipal part (in the sense of Petrowski) satisfies a decay estimate
as x goes to infinity.
