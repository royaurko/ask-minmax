Nadirashvili presented a beautiful example showing that the Poincar\'e
recurrence does not occur near a particular solution to the 2D Euler equation
of inviscid incompressible fluids. Unfortunately, Nadirashvili's setup of the
phase space is not appropriate, and details of the proof are missing. This note
fixes that.
