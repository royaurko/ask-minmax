Electromagnetic (EM) wave scattering problems by many small impedance bodies
are studied. A numerical method for solving the problems is presented. The
problem is solved under the physical assumptions $a\ll d \ll \lambda$, where
$a$ is the characteristic size of the bodies, $d$ is the minimal distance
between neighboring bodies, $\lambda=2\pi/k$ is the wave length and $k$ is the
wave number. The problem is solved asymptotically and numerical results for the
cases of 125 and 1000 small bodies are presented. Error estimates for the
asymptotic solutions are also provided.
