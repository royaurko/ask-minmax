We present GUT models based on an $SU(5)\times SU(5)$ GUT group. These models
maintain the main successes of simple-group GUTs but permit simple solutions to
the doublet-triplet splitting problem. Moreover, GUT breaking is triggered by
supersymmetry breaking so that the GUT scale is naturally generated as a
combination of the Planck scale and the supersymmetry breaking scale.
