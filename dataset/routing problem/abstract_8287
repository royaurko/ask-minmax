Following an idea of Bendersky-Gitler, we construct an isomorphism between
Anderson's and Arone's complexes modelling the chain complex of a map space.
This allows us to apply Shipley's convergence theorem to Arone's model. As a
corollary, we reduce the problem of homotopy equivalence for certain "toy"
spaces to a problem in homological algebra.
