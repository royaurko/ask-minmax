This paper talk about the complexity of computation by Turing Machine. I take
attention to the relation of symmetry and order structure of the data, and I
think about the limitation of computation time. First, I make general problem
named "testing problem". And I get some condition of the P complete and NP
complete by using testing problem. Second, I make two problem "orderly problem"
and "chaotic problem". Orderly problem have some order structure. And DTM can
limit some possible symbol effectly by using symmetry of each symbol. But
chaotic problem must treat some symbol as a set of symbol, so DTM cannot limit
some possible symbol. Orderly problem is P complete, and chaotic problem is NP
complete. Finally, I clear the computation time of orderly problem and chaotic
problem. And P != NP.
