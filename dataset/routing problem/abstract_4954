A $\sqrt{n}$ estimate in the hyperplane problem with arbitrary measures has
recently been proved in \cite{K3}. In this note we present analogs of this
result for sections of lower dimensions and in the complex case. We deduce
these inequalities from stability in comparison problems for different
generalizations of intersection bodies.
