A Finsler geometry may be understood as a homogeneous variational problem,
where the Finsler function is the Lagrangian. The extremals in Finsler geometry
are curves, but in more general variational problems we might consider extremal
submanifolds of dimension $m$. In this minicourse we discuss these problems
from a geometric point of view.
