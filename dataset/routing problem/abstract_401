In the past two decades high-harmonic generation (HHG) has become a key
process in ultra-fast science due to the extremely short time-structure of the
underlying electron dynamics being imprinted in the emitted harmonic light
bursts. After discussing the fundamental physical picture of HHG including
continuum--continuum transitions, we describe the experimental progress
rendering HHG to the unique source of attosecond pulses. The development of
bright photon sources with zeptosecond pulse duration and keV photon energy is
underway. In this article we describe several approaches pointed toward this
aim and beyond. As the main barriers for multi-keV HHG, phase-matching and
relativistic drift are discussed. Routes to overcome these problems are pointed
out as well as schemes to control the HHG process via alterations of the
driving fields. Finally, we report on how the investigation of fundamental
physical processes benefits from the continuous development of HHG sources.
