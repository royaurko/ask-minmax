Diagnosing faults in aircraft gas turbine engines is a complex problem. It
involves several tasks, including rapid and accurate interpretation of patterns
in engine sensor data. We have investigated contextual normalization for the
development of a software tool to help engine repair technicians with
interpretation of sensor data. Contextual normalization is a new strategy for
employing machine learning. It handles variation in data that is due to
contextual factors, rather than the health of the engine. It does this by
normalizing the data in a context-sensitive manner. This learning strategy was
developed and tested using 242 observations of an aircraft gas turbine engine
in a test cell, where each observation consists of roughly 12,000 numbers,
gathered over a 12 second interval. There were eight classes of observations:
seven deliberately implanted classes of faults and a healthy class. We compared
two approaches to implementing our learning strategy: linear regression and
instance-based learning. We have three main results. (1) For the given problem,
instance-based learning works better than linear regression. (2) For this
problem, contextual normalization works better than other common forms of
normalization. (3) The algorithms described here can be the basis for a useful
software tool for assisting technicians with the interpretation of sensor data.
