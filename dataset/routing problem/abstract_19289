The problem of finding the $k$ most critical nodes, referred to as the
$top\text{-}k$ problem, is a very important one in several contexts such as
information diffusion and preference aggregation in social networks, clustering
of data points, etc. It has been observed in the literature that the value
allotted to a node by most of the popular cooperative game theoretic solution
concepts, acts as a good measure of appropriateness of that node (or a data
point) to be included in the $top\text{-}k$ set, by itself. However, in
general, nodes having the highest $k$ values are not the desirable
$top\text{-}k$ nodes, because the appropriateness of a node to be a part of the
$top\text{-}k$ set depends on other nodes in the set. As this is not explicitly
captured by cooperative game theoretic solution concepts, it is necessary to
post-process the obtained values in order to output the suitable $top\text{-}k$
nodes. In this paper, we propose several such post-processing methods and give
reasoning behind each of them, and also propose a standalone algorithm that
combines cooperative game theoretic solution concepts with the popular greedy
hill-climbing algorithm.
