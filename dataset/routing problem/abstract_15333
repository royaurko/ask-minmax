In this short note, we use Robert Bruner's $\mathcal{A}(1)$-resolution of $P
= \mathbb{F}_2[t]$ to shed light on the Hit Problem. In particular, the reduced
syzygies $P_n$ of $P$ occur as direct summands of $\widetilde{P}^{\otimes n}$,
where $\widetilde{P}$ is the augmentation ideal of the map $P \to
\mathbb{F}_2$. The complement of $P_n$ in $\widetilde{P}^{\otimes n}$ is free,
and the modules $P_n$ exhibit a type of "Bott Periodicity" of period $4$:
$P_{n+4} = \Sigma^8P_n$. These facts taken together allow one to analyze the
module of indecomposables in $\widetilde{P}^{\otimes n}$, that is, to say
something about the "$\mathcal{A}(1)$-hit Problem." Our study is essentially in
two parts: First, we expound on the approach to the Hit Problem begun by
William Singer, in which we compare images of Steenrod Squares to certain
kernels of Squares. Using this approach, the contributor discovered a nontrivial
element in bidegree $(5, 9)$ that is neither $\mathcal{A}(1)$-hit nor in
$\mathrm{ker} Sq^1 + \mathrm{ker} Sq^3$. Such an element is extremely rare, but
Bruner's result shows clearly why these elements exist and detects them in full
generality. Second, we describe the graded $\mathbb{F}_2$-space of
$\mathcal{A}(1)$-hit elements of $\widetilde{P}^{\otimes n}$ by determining its
Hilbert series.
