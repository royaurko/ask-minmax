An equation containing a fractional power of an elliptic operator of second
order is studied for Dirichlet boundary conditions. Finite difference
approximations in space are employed. The proposed numerical algorithm is based
on solving an auxiliary Cauchy problem for a pseudo-parabolic equation.
Unconditionally stable vector additive schemes (splitting schemes) are
constructed. Numerical results for a model problem in a rectangle calculated
using the splitting with respect to spatial variables are presented.
