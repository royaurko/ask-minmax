Localized modes of large amplitudes in nonlinear lattices are considered. The
applied method allows the reduction of nonlinear problem to a linear inverse
problem of phonons scattering on a local potential. The method is efficient in
the case of strongly localized modes. Analytical description of such modes in
monatomic chain is given. Results of numerical calculations of anharmonic local
vibrations of light ions in pure and impure alkali halide crystal are
presented. It is found that, in the case of amplitudes ~0.5A, the vibrations
depend very strongly on the crystallographic directions.
