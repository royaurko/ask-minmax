Research regarding the stable marriage and roommate problem has a long and
distinguished history in mathematics, computer science and economics. Stability
in this context is predominantly core stability or one of its variants in which
each deviation is by a group of players. There has been little focus in
matching theory on stability concepts such as Nash stability and individual
stability in which the deviation is by a single player. Such stability concepts
are suitable especially when trust for the other party is limited, complex
coordination is not feasible, or when only unmatched agents can be approached.
Furthermore, weaker stability notions such as individual stability may in
principle circumvent the negative existence and computational complexity
results in matching theory. We characterize the computational complexity of
checking the existence and computing individual-based stable matchings for the
marriage and roommate settings. One of our key computational results for the
stable marriage setting also carries over to different classes of hedonic games
for which individual-based stability has already been of much interest.
