Computing the first few singular vectors of a large matrix is a problem that
frequently comes up in statistics and numerical analysis. Given the presence of
noise, exact calculation is hard to achieve, and the following problem is of
importance:
  \vskip2mm \centerline {\it How much a small perturbation to the matrix
changes the singular vectors ?} \vskip2mm Answering this question, classical
theorems, such as those of Davis-Kahan and Wedin, give tight estimates for the
worst-case scenario. In this paper, we show that if the perturbation (noise) is
random and our matrix has low rank, then better estimates can be obtained. Our
method relies on high dimensional geometry and is different from those used an
earlier papers.
