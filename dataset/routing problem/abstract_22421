Consider the initial value problem for systems of cubic derivative nonlinear
Schr\"odinger equations in one space dimension with the masses satisfying a
suitable resonance relation. We give structural conditions on the nonlinearity
under which the small data solution gains an additional logarithmic decay as $t
\to +\infty$ compared with the corresponding free evolution.
