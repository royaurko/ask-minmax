In this paper, we propose a distributive queueaware intra-cell user
scheduling and inter-cell interference (ICI) management control design for a
delay-optimal celluar downlink system with M base stations (BSs), and K users
in each cell. Each BS has K downlink queues for K users respectively with
heterogeneous arrivals and delay requirements. The ICI management control is
adaptive to joint queue state information (QSI) over a slow time scale, while
the user scheduling control is adaptive to both the joint QSI and the joint
channel state information (CSI) over a faster time scale. We show that the
problem can be modeled as an infinite horizon average cost Partially Observed
Markov Decision Problem (POMDP), which is NP-hard in general. By exploiting the
special structure of the problem, we shall derive an equivalent Bellman
equation to solve the POMDP problem. To address the distributive requirement
and the issue of dimensionality and computation complexity, we derive a
distributive online stochastic learning algorithm, which only requires local
QSI and local CSI at each of the M BSs. We show that the proposed learning
algorithm converges almost surely (with probability 1) and has significant gain
compared with various baselines. The proposed solution only has linear
complexity order O(MK).
