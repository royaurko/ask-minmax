We discuss the notions of circumradius, inradius, diameter, and minimum width
in generalized Minkowski spaces (that is, with respect to gauges), i.e., we
measure the "size" of a given convex set in a finite-dimensional real vector
space with respect to another convex set. This is done via formulating some
kind of containment problem incorporating homothetic bodies of the latter set
or strips bounded by parallel supporting hyperplanes thereof. The paper can be
seen as a theoretical starting point for studying metrical problems of sets in
generalized Minkowski spaces.
