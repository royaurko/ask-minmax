Solution of the scattering problem turns to be very difficult task both from
the formal as well as from the computational point of view. If the last two
decades have witnessed decisive progress in ab initio bound state calculations,
rigorous solution of the scattering problem remains limited to A$\leq$4 case.
Therefore there is a rising interest to apply bound-state-like methods to
handle non-relativistic scattering problems. In this article the latest
theoretical developments in this field are reviewed. Five fully rigorous
methods will be discussed, which address the problem of nuclear collisions in
full extent (including the break-up problem) at the same time avoiding
treatment of the complicate boundary conditions or integral kernel
singularities. These new developments allows to use modern bound-state
techniques to advance significantly rigorous solution of the scattering
problem.
