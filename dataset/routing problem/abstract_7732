We propose a new construction of Banach-Lie groups and algebras relying on
nonstandard analysis. A major standard application is the Local Theorem which
to certain extent reduces the problem of associating a Lie group to a given
banach-Lie algebra to a similar problem for finitely generated Lie subalgebras.
We discuss possible applications, e.g., to gauge theories.
