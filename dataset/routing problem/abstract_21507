We present a comparative study of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking and
conventional standard model breaking, and pose the question whether experiments
can distinguish one breaking mode from the other. The importance of the problem
lies in the fact that the two breaking modes have very different physical
interpretations concerning the mechanism of spontaneous electroweak symmetry
breaking and the origin of mass.
