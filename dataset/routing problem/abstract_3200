Quantization is still a central problem of modern physics. One example of an
unsolved problem is the quantization of Nambu mechanics. After a brief comment
on the role of Harrison cohomology, this review concentrates on the central
problem of quantization of QCD and, more generally, quark confinement seen as a
problem of quantization. Several suggestions are made, some of them rather
extravagant.
