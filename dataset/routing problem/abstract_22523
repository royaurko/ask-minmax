Recent cosmological observations strongly suggest that the universe is
dominated by an unknown form of energy with negative pressure. Why is this dark
energy density of order the critical density today? We propose that the dark
energy has periodically dominated in the past so that its preponderance today
is natural. We illustrate this paradigm with a model potential and show that
its predictions are consistent with all observations.
