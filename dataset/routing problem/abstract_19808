It is argued with the help of an illustrative model, that the inter--species
hierarchy among the fermion masses and the quark mixing angles can be
accommodated naturally in the standard model with (approximate) flavor
democracy provided there are four families of sequential quark--leptons with
all members of the fourth family having roughly equal masses. The special
problem of light neutrino masses (if any) and possible solutions are also
discussed.
