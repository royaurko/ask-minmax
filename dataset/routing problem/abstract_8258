We consider the cascade and triangular rate-distortion problem where side
information is known to the source encoder and to the first user but not to the
second user. We characterize the rate-distortion region for these problems. For
the quadratic Gaussian case, we show that it is sufficient to consider jointly
Gaussian distributions, a fact that leads to an explicit solution.
