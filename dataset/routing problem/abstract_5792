We consider the "moment vanishing problem" for a general class of
piecewise-analytic functions which satisfy on each continuity interval a linear
ODE with polynomial coefficients. This problem, which essentially asks how many
zero first moments can such a (nonzero) function have, turns out to be related
to several difficult questions in analytic theory of ODEs (Poincare's
Center-Focus problem) as well as in Approximation Theory and Signal Processing
("Algebraic Sampling"). While the solution space of any particular ODE admits
such a bound, it will in the most general situation depend on the coefficients
of this ODE. We believe that a good understanding of this dependence may
provide a clue for attacking the problems mentioned above.
  In this paper we undertake an approach to the moment vanishing problem which
utilizes the fact that the moment sequences under consideration satisfy a
recurrence relation of fixed length, whose coefficients are polynomials in the
index. For any given operator, we prove a general bound for its moment
vanishing index. We also provide uniform bounds for several operator families.
