The notions of captured/lost vertices and dead edges in the Shannon game
(Shannon switching game on nodes) are examined using graph theory. Simple
methods are presented for identifying some dead edges and some captured sets of
vertices, thus simplifying the (computationally hard) problem of analyzing the
game.
