We prove the uniqueness of solutions to Dirichlet problem for p-harmonic maps
with images in a small geodesic ball of the target manifold. As a consequence,
we show that such maps have Hoelder continuous derivatives. This gives an
extension of a result by S. Hildebrandt et al concerning harmonic maps.
