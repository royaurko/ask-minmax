We develop a robust regularized singular value decomposition (RobRSVD) method
for analyzing two-way functional data. The research is motivated by the
application of modeling human mortality as a smooth two-way function of age
group and year. The RobRSVD is formulated as a penalized loss minimization
problem where a robust loss function is used to measure the reconstruction
error of a low-rank matrix approximation of the data, and an appropriately
defined two-way roughness penalty function is used to ensure smoothness along
each of the two functional domains. By viewing the minimization problem as two
conditional regularized robust regressions, we develop a fast iterative
reweighted least squares algorithm to implement the method. Our implementation
naturally incorporates missing values. Furthermore, our formulation allows
rigorous derivation of leave-one-row/column-out cross-validation and
generalized cross-validation criteria, which enable computationally efficient
data-driven penalty parameter selection. The advantages of the new robust
method over nonrobust ones are shown via extensive simulation studies and the
mortality rate application.
