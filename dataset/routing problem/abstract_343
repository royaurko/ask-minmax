Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) is a special class of Mobile Ad hoc Network
(MANET) where vehicles are considered as MANET nodes with wireless links. The
key difference of VANET and MANET is the special mobility pattern and rapidly
changeable topology. There has been significant interest in improving safety
and traffic efficiency using VANET. The design of routing protocols in VANET is
important and necessary issue for support the smart ITS. Existing routing
protocols of MANET are not suitable for VANET. AOMDV is the most important on
demand multipath routing protocol. This paper proposes SSD-AOMDV as VANET
routing protocol. SSD-AOMDV improves AOMDV to suit VANET characteristics.
SSD-AOMDV adds the mobility parameters: Stop_times, Speed and Direction to hop
count as new AOMDV routing metric to select next hop during the route discovery
phase. Stop_times metric is added to simulate buses mobility pattern and
traffic lights at intersections. Simulation results show that SSD-AOMDV
achieves better performance compared to AOMDV.
