The initial value problem is introduced after a thorough review of the
essential geometry. The initial value equations are put into elliptic form
using both conformal transformations and a treatment of the extrinsic curvature
introduced recently. This use of the metric and the extrinsic curvature is
manifestly equivalent to the contributor's conformal thin sandwich formulation.
Therefore, the reformulation of the constraints as an elliptic system by use of
conformal techniques is complete.
