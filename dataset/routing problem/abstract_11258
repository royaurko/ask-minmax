Because the staggered fermion determinant is complex at nonzero mu, taking
its fourth root leads to phase ambiguities. These unphysical effects cause the
measure to become discontinuous; the problem becomes acute when Re mu exceeds
approximately half the pion mass (when T>0 this rough bound probably moves
towards larger mu). We show how to overcome the problem, but only very close to
the continuum limit. This regime may be beyond reach with current resources.
