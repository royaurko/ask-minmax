This article explains why a paper by Heinz G. Helfenstein entitled "Ovals
with equichordal points", published in J.London Math.Soc.31, 54-57, 1956, is
incorrect. We point out a computational error which renders his conclusions
invalid. More importantly, we explain that the method cannot be used to solve
the equichordal point problem with the method presented there. Today, there is
a solution to the problem: Marek R. Rychlik, "A complete solution to the
equichordal point problem of Fujiwara, Blaschke, Rothe and Weizenb\"ock",
Inventiones Mathematicae 129 (1), 141-212, 1997. However, some mathematicians
still point to Helfenstein's paper as a plausible path to a simpler solution.
We show that Helfenstein's method cannot be salvaged. The fact that
Helfenstein's argument is not correct was known to Wirsing, but he did not
explicitly point out the error. This article points out the error and the
reasons for the failure of Helfenstein's approach in an accessible, and
hopefully enjoyable way.
