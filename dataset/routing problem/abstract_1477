Colloidal particles or nanoparticles, with equal affinity for two fluids, are
known to adsorb irreversibly to the fluid-fluid interface. We present
large-scale computer simulations of the demixing of a binary solvent containing
such particles. The newly formed interface sequesters the colloidal particles;
as the interface coarsens, the particles are forced into close contact by
interfacial tension. Coarsening is dramatically curtailed, and the jammed
colloidal layer seemingly enters a glassy state, creating a multiply connected,
solid-like film in three dimensions. The resulting gel contains percolating
domains of both fluids, with possible uses as, for example, a microreaction
medium.
