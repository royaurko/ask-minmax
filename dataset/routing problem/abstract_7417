Given $(M,g_0)$ a closed Riemannian manifold and a nonempty closed subset $X$
in $M$, the singular $\sigma_k-$Yamabe problem asks for a complete metric $g$
on $M\backslash X$ conformal to $g_0$ with constant $\sigma_k-$curvature. The
$\sigma_k-$curvature is defined as the $k-$th elementary symmetric function of
the eigenvalues of the Schouten tensor of a Riemannian metric. The main goal of
this paper is to find solutions to the singular $\sigma_2-$Yamabe problem with
isolated singularities in any compact non-degenerate manifold such that the
Weyl tensor vanishing to sufficiently high order at the singular point. We will
use perturbation techniques and gluing methods.
