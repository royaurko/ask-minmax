The problem of Laplacian growth in two dimensions is considered within the
Loewner-equation framework. Initially the problem of fingered growth recently
discussed by Gubiec and Szymczak [T. Gubiec and P. Szymczak, Phys. Rev. E 77,
041602 (2008)] is revisited and a new exact solution for a three-finger
configuration is reported. Then a general class of growth models for an
interface growing in the upper-half plane is introduced and the corresponding
Loewner equation for the problem is derived. Several examples are given
including interfaces with one or more tips as well as multiple growing
interfaces. A generalization of our interface growth model in terms of
``Loewner domains,'' where the growth rule is specified by a time evolving
measure, is briefly discussed.
