Given the rapid proliferation of advanced information technologies, including
the Internet, modern humans can easily access vast amount of socially
transmitted information. Intuitively, this situation is isomorphic to some
eusocial insects that are known to solve the exploration-exploitation dilemma
collectively through information transfer (e.g., honeybees [Seeley et al.,
1991]; and ants [Shaffer, Sasaki & Pratt, 2013]). Yet, in contrast from the
eusocial insects, whose colonies are composed of kin, human collective
performance may be affected by an inherent free-rider problem [Bolton & Harris,
1999; Kameda, Tsukasaki, Hastie & Berg, 2011]. Specifically, in groups
involving non-kin members, it is expected that free-riders, who allow others to
search for better alternatives and then exploit their findings through social
learning ("information scroungers"), will frequently appear, and consequently
undermine the advantage of collective intelligence [Rogers, 1998; Kameda &
Nakanishi, 2003].
