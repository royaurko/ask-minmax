In this paper we address the question as to what extent the
quantum-mechanical nature of the process is relevant for teleportation of A
spin-1/2 state. For this purpose we analyze the possibility of underpinning
teleportation with a local-hidden-variable model. The nature of the models,
which we consider as legitimate candidates, guarantees the classical character
of all the probabilities which can be deduced from them. When we try to
describe the teleportation process following two different mathematical routes,
we find two different hidden-variable densities, which thus end up having a
doubtful physical significance within the "reality" that a hidden-variable
model tries to restore. This result we consider as a "no-go theorem" for the
hidden-variable description of the teleportation process. We also show that
this kind of conflict arises when considering successive measurements (one of
which is selective projective) for one spin-1/2 particle.
