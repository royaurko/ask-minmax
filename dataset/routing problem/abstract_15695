We consider the potential problems due to the production of inflatinos and
gravitinos after inflation. Inflationary models with a single scale set by the
microwave background anisotropies have a low enough reheat temperature to avoid
problems with the thermal production of gravitinos. Moreover, the nonthermal
production of gravitinos has been shown to be sufficiently small if the sector
ultimately responsible for supersymmetry breaking is coupled only
gravitationally to the inflationary sector. Still, in some models, inflatinos
can be created during preheating with a substantial abundance. The main
contribution to the gravitino abundance may thus come from their decay into the
inflaton, or into its scalar partner, as well as from the inverse processes. We
show that this production needs to be strongly suppressed. This suppression can
be realized in the simplest scenarios which typically have a sufficiently high
inflationary scale.
