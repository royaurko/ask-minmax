We study mode-locking in disordered media as a boundary-value problem.
Focusing on the simplest class of mode-locking models which consists of a
single driven overdamped degree-of-freedom, we develop an analytical method to
obtain the shape of the Arnol'd tongues in the regime of low ac-driving
amplitude or high ac-driving frequency. The method is exact for a scalloped
pinning potential and easily adapted to other pinning potentials. It is
complementary to the analysis based on the well-known Shapiro's argument that
holds in the perturbative regime of large driving amplitudes or low driving
frequency, where the effect of pinning is weak.
