The paper develops a calculus for a class of real-valued functions having a
quadratic variation. The main result is a solution of the representation
problem for a class of evolutions having a quadratic variation. The result is
applied to build up an asset pricing model. Also in the paper there are some
results concerning an extension of the class of all semimartingales.
