Several negative results are presented concerning the solvability in Sobolev
classes of the Cauchy problem for the inhomogeneous second-order uniformly
parabolic equations without lower order terms in one space dimension. The main
coefficient is assumed to be a bounded measurable function of $(t,x)$ bounded
away from zero. We also discuss upper and lower estimates of certain kind on
the fundamental solutions of such equations.
