While previous work on energy-efficient algorithms focused on assumption that
tasks can be assigned to any processor, we initially study the problem of task
scheduling on restricted parallel processors. The objective is to minimize the
overall energy consumption while speed scaling (SS) method is used to reduce
energy consumption under the execution time constraint (Makespan $C_{max}$). In
this work, we discuss the speed setting in the continuous model that processors
can run at arbitrary speed in $[s_{min},s_{max}]$. The energy-efficient
scheduling problem, involving task assignment and speed scaling, is inherently
complicated as it is proved to be NP-Complete. We formulate the problem as an
Integer Programming (IP) problem. Specifically, we devise a polynomial time
optimal scheduling algorithm for the case tasks have a uniform size. Our
algorithm runs in $O(mn^3logn)$ time, where $m$ is the number of processors and
$n$ is the number of tasks. We then present a polynomial time algorithm that
achieves an approximation factor of $2^{\alpha-1}(2-\frac{1}{m^{\alpha}})$
($\alpha$ is the power parameter) when the tasks have arbitrary size work.
Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm could provide an efficient
scheduling for the problem of task scheduling on restricted parallel
processors.
