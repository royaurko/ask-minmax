On the occasion of the 40-th anniversary of IHES I present a few scientific
reminiscences: most of my scientific life has been marked by my visits and I
run through them concluding with the analysis of a problem that originated
during my last visit. The problem is to develop a convergent perturbative
algorithm for the construction of the ``Eliasson's potential'' for the stable
and unstable manifolds of an invariant torus: and to study its properties. A
brief review follows.
