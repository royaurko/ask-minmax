This paper studies a class of source coding problems that combines elements
of the CEO problem with the multiple description problem. In this setting,
noisy versions of one remote source are observed by two nodes with encoders
(which is similar to the CEO problem). However, it differs from the CEO problem
in that each node must generate multiple descriptions of the source. This
problem is of interest in multiple scenarios in efficient communication over
networks. In this paper, an achievable region and an outer bound are presented
for this problem, which is shown to be sum rate optimal for a class of
distortion constraints.
