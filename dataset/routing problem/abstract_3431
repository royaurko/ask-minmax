This article discusses ability of Linear Programming models to be used as
solvers of NP-complete problems. Integer Linear Programming is known as
NP-complete problem, but non-integer Linear Programming problems can be solved
in polynomial time, what places them in P class. During past three years there
appeared some articles using LP to solve NP-complete problems. This methods use
large number of variables (O(n^9)) solving correctly almost all instances that
can be solved in reasonable time. Can they solve infinitively large instances?
This article gives answer to this question.
