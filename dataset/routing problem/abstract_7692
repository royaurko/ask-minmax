We describe the structure of bifurcations in the unbounded classical
Diamagnetic Kepler problem. We conjecture that this system does not have any
stable orbits and that the non-wandering set is described by a complete trinary
symbolic dynamics for scaled energies larger then $\epsilon_c=0.328782\ldots$.
