Centralized Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) when used in distributed systems
have performance constraints as all traffic must traverse through a central
server. In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift towards the use of P2P
in VPNs to alleviate pressure placed upon the central server by allowing
participants to communicate directly with each other, relegating the server to
handling session management and supporting NAT traversal using relays when
necessary. Another, less common, approach uses unstructured P2P systems to
remove all centralization from the VPN. These approaches currently lack the
depth in security options provided by other VPN solutions, and their
scalability constraints have not been well studied.
  In this paper, we propose and implement a novel VPN architecture, which uses
a structured P2P system for peer discovery, session management, NAT traversal,
and autonomic relay selection and a central server as a partially-automated
public key infrastructure (PKI) via a user-friendly web interface. Our model
also provides the first design and implementation of a P2P VPN with full
tunneling support, whereby all non-P2P based Internet traffic routes through a
trusted third party and does so in a way that is more secure than existing full
tunnel techniques. To verify our model, we evaluate our reference
implementation by comparing it quantitatively to other VPN technologies
focusing on latency, bandwidth, and memory usage. We also discuss some of our
experiences with developing, maintaining, and deploying a P2P VPN.
