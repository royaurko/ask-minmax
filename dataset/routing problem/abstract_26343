We give a deterministic O(log n)^n algorithm for the {\em Shortest Vector
Problem (SVP)} of a lattice under {\em any} norm, improving on the previous
best deterministic bound of n^O(n) for general norms and nearly matching the
bound of 2^O(n) for the standard Euclidean norm established by Micciancio and
Voulgaris (STOC 2010). Our algorithm can be viewed as a derandomization of the
AKS randomized sieve algorithm, which can be used to solve SVP for any norm in
2^O(n) time with high probability. We use the technique of covering a convex
body by ellipsoids, as introduced for lattice problems in (Dadush et al., FOCS
2011).
  Our main contribution is a deterministic approximation of an M-ellipsoid of
any convex body. We achieve this via a convex programming formulation of the
optimal ellipsoid with the objective function being an n-dimensional integral
that we show can be approximated deterministically, a technique that appears to
be of independent interest.
