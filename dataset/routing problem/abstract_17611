Traditionally quantitative games such as mean-payoff games and discount sum
games have two players -- one trying to maximize the payoff, the other trying
to minimize it. The associated decision problem, "Can Eve (the maximizer)
achieve, for example, a positive payoff?" can be thought of as one player
trying to attain a payoff in the interval $(0,\infty)$. In this paper we
consider the more general problem of determining if a player can attain a
payoff in a finite union of arbitrary intervals for various payoff functions
(liminf, mean-payoff, discount sum, total sum). In particular this includes the
interesting exact-value problem, "Can Eve achieve a payoff of exactly (e.g.)
0?"
