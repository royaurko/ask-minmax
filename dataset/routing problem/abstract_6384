Roe and Woodroofe (RW) have suggested that certain conditional probabilities
be incorporated into the ``unified approach'' for constructing confidence
intervals, previously described by Feldman and Cousins (FC). RW illustrated
this conditioning technique using one of the two prototype problems in the FC
paper, that of Poisson processes with background. The main effect was on the
upper curve in the confidence belt. In this paper, we attempt to apply this
style of conditioning to the other prototype problem, that of Gaussian errors
with a bounded physical region. We find that the lower curve on the confidence
belt is also moved significantly, in an undesirable manner.
