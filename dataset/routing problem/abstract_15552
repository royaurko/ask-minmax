We discuss a many-body Hamiltonian with two- and three-body interactions in
two dimensions introduced recently by Murthy, Bhaduri and Sen. Apart from an
analysis of some exact solutions in the many-body system, we analyze in detail
the two-body problem which is completely solvable. We show that the solution of
the two-body problem reduces to solving a known differential equation due to
Heun. We show that the two-body spectrum becomes remarkably simple for large
interaction strength and the level structure resembles that of the Landau
Levels. We also clarify the "ultraviolet" regularization which is needed to
define an inverse-square potential properly and discuss its implications for
our model.
