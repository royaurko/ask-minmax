It is universal to see people obtain knowledge on micro-blog services by
asking others decision making questions. In this paper, we study the Jury
Selection Problem(JSP) by utilizing crowdsourcing for decision making tasks on
micro-blog services. Specifically, the problem is to enroll a subset of crowd
under a limited budget, whose aggregated wisdom via Majority Voting scheme has
the lowest probability of drawing a wrong answer(Jury Error Rate-JER). Due to
various individual error-rates of the crowd, the calculation of JER is
non-trivial. Firstly, we explicitly state that JER is the probability when the
number of wrong jurors is larger than half of the size of a jury. To avoid the
exponentially increasing calculation of JER, we propose two efficient
algorithms and an effective bounding technique. Furthermore, we study the Jury
Selection Problem on two crowdsourcing models, one is for altruistic
users(AltrM) and the other is for incentive-requiring users(PayM) who require
extra payment when enrolled into a task. For the AltrM model, we prove the
monotonicity of JER on individual error rate and propose an efficient exact
algorithm for JSP. For the PayM model, we prove the NP-hardness of JSP on PayM
and propose an efficient greedy-based heuristic algorithm. Finally, we conduct
a series of experiments to investigate the traits of JSP, and validate the
efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms on both synthetic and
real micro-blog data.
