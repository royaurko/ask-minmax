This paper generalizes a classification of solutions of a superlinear
Dirichlet problem given in \cite{rouaki2} to a nonautonomous case. In
\cite{rouaki1} the increasing of $f(t)$ was used to prove the classification
and in \cite{rouaki2} the unicity of the solution of the \emph{Cauchy} problem
was used. Here the classification appears as a consequence of the \emph{a
priori} estimates. It results that existence classificarion remain true for a
class of nonautonomous problems.
