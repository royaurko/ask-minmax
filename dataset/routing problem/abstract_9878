A stable partitioned algorithm for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems
that couple viscous incompressible flow with structural shells or beams is
described. This added-mass partitioned (AMP) scheme uses Robin (mixed)
interface conditions for the pressure and velocity in the fluid that are
derived directly from the governing equations. The AMP scheme is stable even
for very light structures, requires no sub-iterations, and can be made fully
second-order, or higher-order, accurate. The new scheme is shown to be stable
through the analysis of a model problem. Exact traveling wave solutions for
three FSI model problems are derived. Numerical results for a linearized FSI
problem in two-dimensions, using these exact solutions, demonstrate that the
scheme is stable and accurate, even for very light structures.
