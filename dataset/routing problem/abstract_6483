We consider the hyperbolic-parabolic singular perturbation problem for a
degenerate quasilinear Kirchhoff equation with weak dissipation. This means
that the coefficient of the dissipative term tends to zero when t tends to
+infinity.
  We prove that the hyperbolic problem has a unique global solution for
suitable values of the parameters. We also prove that the solution decays to
zero, as t tends to +infinity, with the same rate of the solution of the limit
problem of parabolic type.
