In this paper we develop the global symbolic calculus of pseudo-differential
operators generated by a boundary value problem for a given (not necessarily
self-adjoint or elliptic) differential operator. For this, we also establish
elements of a non-self-adjoint distribution theory and the corresponding
biorthogonal Fourier analysis. We give applications of the developed analysis
to obtain a-priori estimates for solutions of operators that are elliptic
within the constructed calculus.
