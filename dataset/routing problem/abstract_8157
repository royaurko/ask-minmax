Data exchanges between Web services engaged in a composition raise several
heterogeneities. In this paper, we address the problem of data cardinality
heterogeneity in a composition. Firstly, we build a theoretical framework to
describe different aspects of Web services that relate to data cardinality, and
secondly, we solve this problem by developing a solution for cardinality
mediation based on constraint logic programming.
