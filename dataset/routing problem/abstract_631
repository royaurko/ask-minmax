RPL, the routing protocol proposed by IETF for IPv6/6LoWPAN Low Power and
Lossy Networks has significant complexity. Another protocol called LOADng, a
lightweight variant of AODV, emerges as an alternative solution. In this paper,
we compare the performance of the two protocols in a Home Automation scenario
with heterogenous traffic patterns including a mix of multipoint-to-point and
point-to-multipoint routes in realistic dense non-uniform network topologies.
We use Contiki OS and Cooja simulator to evaluate the behavior of the
ContikiRPL implementation and a basic non-optimized implementation of LOADng.
Unlike previous studies, our results show that RPL provides shorter delays,
less control overhead, and requires less memory than LOADng. Nevertheless,
enhancing LOADng with more efficient flooding and a better route storage
algorithm may improve its performance.
