In this paper, we study a class of generalized monotone variational
inequality (GMVI) problems whose operators are not necessarily monotone (e.g.,
pseudo-monotone). We present non-Euclidean extragradient (N-EG) methods for
computing approximate strong solutions of these problems, and demonstrate how
their iteration complexities depend on the global Lipschitz or H\"{o}lder
continuity properties for their operators and the smoothness properties for the
distance generating function used in the N-EG algorithms. We also introduce a
variant of this algorithm by incorporating a simple line-search procedure to
deal with problems with more general continuous operators. Numerical studies
are conducted to illustrate the significant advantages of the developed
algorithms over the existing ones for solving large-scale GMVI problems.
