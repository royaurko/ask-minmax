Among several techniques available for solving Computational Electromagnetics
(CEM) problems, the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method is one of the
best suited approaches when a parallelized hardware platform is used. In this
paper we investigate the feasibility of implementing the FDTD method using the
NVIDIA GT 520, a low cost Graphical Processing Unit (GPU), for solving the
differential form of Maxwell's equation in time domain. Initially a generalized
benchmarking problem of bandwidth test and another benchmarking problem of
'matrix left division is discussed for understanding the correlation between
the problem size and the performance on the CPU and the GPU respectively. This
is further followed by the discussion of the FDTD method, again implemented on
both, the CPU and the GT520 GPU. For both of the above comparisons, the CPU
used is Intel E5300, a low cost dual core CPU.
