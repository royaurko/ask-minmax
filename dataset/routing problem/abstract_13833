In this work, we recover the problem of legitimate topologically trivial
Gribov copies inside the Gribov horizon. We avoid the reducibility problem
which hampered the standard construction of van Baal, and then we are able to
build a valid example with spherical symmetry. We also apply the same technique
in the presence of a background of a Polyakov instanton in a Euclidian 3D
spacetime, in order to study the effect of a non trivial environment in the
generation of multiple copies inside the horizon.
