The Plant Propagation Algorithm, epitomised by the Strawberry Algorithm, has
been previously successfully tested on low dimensional continuous optimisation
problems. It is a neighborhood search algorithm. In this paper, we introduce,
robust and efficient version of the algorithm and explain how it can be
implemented to compete with one of the best available alternatives, namely the
Artificial Bee Colony algorithm and we present an improved and more effective
variant on standard continuous optimisation test problem instances in high
dimensions. Computational and comparative results are included.
