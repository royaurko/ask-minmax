One of the yet unsolved questions of QCD in the context of the Standard Model
is to explain the strong CP problem. A way to look for a better understanding
of it is to investigate the theory in the presence of a non-zero topological
theta term. On the lattice such a term is complex: hence it introduces a sign
problem which, in general, limits the applicability of standard Monte Carlo
methods. Here we will discuss the approach of complex Langevin dynamics and
show results for both real and imaginary values of theta. We also report on our
experience with the gradient flow for real and imaginary theta.
