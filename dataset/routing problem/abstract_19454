In this paper, we address robust static anti-windup compensator design and
performance analysis for saturated linear closed loops in the presence of
probabilistic parameter uncertainties via randomized techniques. The proposed
static anti-windup analysis and robust performance synthesis correspond to
several optimization goals, ranging from minimization of the nonlinear
input/output gain to maximization of the stability region or minimization of
the region of attraction. We also introduce a novel paradigm accounting for
uncertainties in the energy of the disturbance inputs. Due to the special
structure of static anti-windup design, wherein the design variables are
decoupled from the Lyapunov certificates, we introduce a significant extension,
called scenario with certificates (SwC), of the so-called scenario approach for
uncertain optimization problems. This extension is of independent interest for
similar robust synthesis problems involving parameter-dependent Lyapunov
functions. We demonstrate that the scenario with certificates robust design
formulation is appealing because it provides a way to implicitly design the
parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions and to remove restrictive assumptions
about convexity with respect to the uncertain parameters. Subsequently, to
reduce the computational cost, we present a sequential randomized algorithm for
iteratively solving this problem. The obtained results are illustrated by
numerical examples.
