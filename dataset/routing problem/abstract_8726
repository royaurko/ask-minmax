In this paper we prove global well - posedness and scattering for the
focusing, energy - critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger initial value problem in
four dimensions. Previous work proved this in five dimensions and higher using
the double Duhamel trick. In this paper, using long time Strichartz estimates
we are able to overcome the logarithmic blowup in four dimensions.
