We prove well-posedness of solution to the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation
associated to the twisted Laplacian on $\C^n$ for a general class of
nonlinearities including power type with subcritical case $0\leq
\alpha<\frac{2}{n-1}$, see Ratnakumar, Sohani (J. Funct. Anal. 2013). In this
paper, we consider critical case $\alpha=\frac{2}{n-1}$ with $n\geq 2$. Our
approach is based on truncation of the given nonlinearity $G$, which is used by
Cazenave Weissler (1989). We obtain solution for the truncated problem. We
obtain solution to the original problem by passing to the limit.
