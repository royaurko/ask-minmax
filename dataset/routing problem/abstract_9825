An interesting family of geometric integrators for Lagrangian systems can be
defined using discretizations of the Hamilton's principle of critical action.
This family of geometric integrators is called variational integrators.
  In this paper, we derive new variational integrators for higher-order
lagrangian mechanical system subjected to higher-order constraints. From the
discretization of the variational principles, we show that our methods are
automatically symplectic and, in consequence, with a very good energy behavior.
Additionally, the symmetries of the discrete Lagrangian imply that momenta is
conserved by the integrator. Moreover, we extend our construction to
variational integrators where the lagrangian is explicitly time-dependent.
Finally, some motivating applications of higher-order problems are considered;
in particular, optimal control problems for explicitly time-dependent
underactuated systems and an interpolation problem on Riemannian manifolds.
