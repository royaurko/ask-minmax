We develop a new paradigm for finding bifurcations of solutions of nonlinear
problems, which is based on the detection of extreme values of new type of
variational functional associated with the considering problem. The variational
functional is obtained constructively by the extended functional method which
can be applied to a wide class of parametric problems including nonlinear
partial differential equations and problems in non-variational form. The main
feature of the approach is that it allows to consider the problem of finding
bifurcations from another geometric point of view, namely using the extended
variational functional. Sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence
of a maximal turning point by the approach are proved. Based on these, an
algorithm of the quasi-direction of steepest ascent is introduced. Simulation
experiments are used to illustrate the behavior of the method and to discuss
its advantages and disadvantages in comparison with the alternatives.
