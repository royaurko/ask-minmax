This is a list of open problems on invariants of knots and 3-manifolds with
expositions of their history, background, significance, or importance. This
list was made by editing open problems given in problem sessions in the
workshop and seminars on `Invariants of Knots and 3-Manifolds' held at Kyoto in
2001.
