Parallel computation is widely employed in scientific researches, engineering
activities and product development. Parallel program writing itself is not
always a simple task depending on problems solved. Large-scale scientific
computing, huge data analyses and precise visualizations, for example, would
require parallel computations, and the parallel computing needs the
parallelization techniques. In this Chapter a parallel program generation
support is discussed, and a computer-assisted parallel program generation
system P-NCAS is introduced. Computer assisted problem solving is one of key
methods to promote innovations in science and engineering, and contributes to
enrich our society and our life toward a programming-free environment in
computing science. Problem solving environments (PSE) research activities had
started to enhance the programming power in 1970's. The P-NCAS is one of the
PSEs; The PSE concept provides an integrated human-friendly computational
software and hardware system to solve a target class of problems
