Quantum 3D R-matrix in the classical (i.e. functional) limit gives a
symplectic map of dynamical variables. The corresponding 3D evolution model is
considered. An auxiliary problem for it is a system of linear equations playing
the role of the monodromy matrix in 2D models. A generating function for the
integrals of motion is constructed as a determinant of the auxiliary system.
