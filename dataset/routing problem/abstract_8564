We study the problem of reconstructing a hidden graph given access to a
distance oracle. We design randomized algorithms for the following problems:
reconstruction of a degree bounded graph with query complexity
$\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$; reconstruction of a degree bounded outerplanar graph with
query complexity $\tilde{O}(n)$; and near-optimal approximate reconstruction of
a general graph.
