The Fourier-Transform ghost imaging of both amplitude-only and pure-phase
objects was experimentally observed with classical incoherent light at Fresnel
distance by a new lensless scheme. The experimental results are in good
agreement with the standard Fourier-transform of the corresponding objects.
This scheme provides a new route towards aberration-free diffraction-limited 3D
images with classically incoherent thermal light, which have no resolution and
depth-of-field limitations of lens-based tomographic systems.
