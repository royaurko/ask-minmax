In this paper, we present and analyze a new set of low-rank recovery
algorithms for linear inverse problems within the class of hard thresholding
methods. We provide strategies on how to set up these algorithms via basic
ingredients for different configurations to achieve complexity vs. accuracy
tradeoffs. Moreover, we study acceleration schemes via memory-based techniques
and randomized, $\epsilon$-approximate matrix projections to decrease the
computational costs in the recovery process. For most of the configurations, we
present theoretical analysis that guarantees convergence under mild problem
conditions. Simulation results demonstrate notable performance improvements as
compared to state-of-the-art algorithms both in terms of reconstruction
accuracy and computational complexity.
