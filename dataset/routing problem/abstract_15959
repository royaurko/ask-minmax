After recapitulating the eigenvalue problem of the su(1,1)-algebra in the
conventional form, the same problem is treated in an unconventional form, in
which the eigenvalue is pure imaginary. Further, the coupling scheme of two
su(1,1)-spins is discussed in the framework of two possibilities, in which
certain new aspects appear. Finally, the coupling scheme developed in this
paper is applied to a concrete example, which will serve boson realization of
the so(4)- and the so(3,1)-algebra presented in the next paper.
