The paper is devoted to the controllability problem for 3D compressible Euler
system. The control is a finite-dimensional external force acting only on the
velocity equation. We show that the velocity and density of the fluid are
simultaneously controllable. In particular, the system is approximately
controllable and exactly controllable in projections
