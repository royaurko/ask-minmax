Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) interact en route to Earth, producing
secondary gamma-rays. For the case of high cosmic ray power and weak
intergalactic magnetic fields, the deflections of these UHECRs may be small
leading to detectable gamma-ray fluxes that point back to their origin. We
summarize current results and prospects of detecting a signature of these
interactions using the current and next generation of imaging atmospheric
Cherenkov telescopes.
