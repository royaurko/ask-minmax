In this paper, we prove the local well-posedness of the water wave problem
with surface tension in the case of finite depth by working in the Eulerian
setting. For the flat bottom, as surface tension tends to zero, the solution of
the water wave problem with surface tension converges to the solution of the
water wave problem without surface tension.
