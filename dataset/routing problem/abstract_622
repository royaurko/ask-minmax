Many energy-aware routing protocols have been proposed for wireless sensor
networks. Most of them are only energy savers and do not take care about energy
balancing. The energy saver protocols try to decrease the energy consumption of
the network as a whole; however the energy manager protocols balance the energy
consumption in the network to avoid network partitioning. This means that
energy saver protocols are not necessarily energy balancing and vice versa.
However, the lifetime of wireless sensor network is strictly depending on
energy consumption; therefore, energy management is an essential task to be
considered. This paper proposes an energy aware routing protocol, named FEAR,
which considers energy balancing and energy saving. It finds a fair trade-off
between energy balancing and energy saving by fuzzy set concept. FEAR routing
protocol is simulated and evaluated by Glomosim simulator.
