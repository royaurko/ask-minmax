In this treatise the well-known 2-body problem with a rotating central body
is systematically reinvestigated on the basis of the Projective Unified Field
Theory (PUFT) under the following aspects (including the special case of the
Newton mechanics): First, equation of motion with abstract additional terms
being appropriate for the interpretation of the various effects under
discussion: tidal friction effect as well as non-tidal effects (e.g. rebound
effect as temporal variation of the moment of inertia of the rotating body,
general-relativistic Lense-Thirring effect, new scalaric effects of
cosmological origin, being an outcome of the scalarity phenomenon of matter
(PUFT). Second, numerical evaluation of the theory.
  Key words: two-body problem with rotating central body -- tidal and non-tidal
effects -- scalaric-cosmological influence of the expanding cosmos on the
2-body system.
