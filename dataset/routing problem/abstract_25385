Editing on digital images is ubiquitous. Identification of deliberately
modified facial images is a new challenge for face identification system. In
this paper, we address the problem of identification of a face or person from
heavily altered facial images. In this face identification problem, the input
to the system is a manipulated or transformed face image and the system reports
back the determined identity from a database of known individuals. Such a
system can be useful in mugshot identification in which mugshot database
contains two views (frontal and profile) of each criminal. We considered only
frontal view from the available database for face identification and the query
image is a manipulated face generated by face transformation software tool
available online. We propose SIFT features for efficient face identification in
this scenario. Further comparative analysis has been given with well known
eigenface approach. Experiments have been conducted with real case images to
evaluate the performance of both methods.
