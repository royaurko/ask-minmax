The development of long-term data storage technology is one of the urging
problems of our time. This paper presents the results of implementation of
technical solution for long-term data storage technology proposed a few years
ago on the basis of single crystal sapphire. It is shown that the problem of
reading data through a substrate of negative single crystal sapphire can be
solved by using for reading a special optical system with a plate of positive
single crystal quartz. The experimental results confirm the efficiency of the
proposed method of compensation.
