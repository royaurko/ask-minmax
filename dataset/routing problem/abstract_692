This paper studied the behavior-cognitive model of drivers during their
travel based on the current research on driver behavior. Firstly, a route
choice behavior-cognitive model was proposed for describing the decision-making
mechanism of drivers during his travel; then, simulation experiments were
carried out on the cosimulation VBc-vissim platform. From the experimental
results, dynamic behavior features of drivers during their travel can be
properly explained by the behavior-cognitive model, thus optimal path can be
obtained from this model.
