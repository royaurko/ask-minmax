We study dynamical mass generation in QED in (2+1) dimensions using
Hamiltonian lattice methods. We use staggered fermions, and perform simulations
with explicit dynamical fermions in the chiral limit. We demonstrate that a
recently developed method to reduce the fermion sign problem can successfully
be applied to this problem. Our results are in agreement with both the strong
coupling expansion and with Euclidean lattice simulations.
