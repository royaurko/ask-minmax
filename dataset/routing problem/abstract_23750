Modern multitarget-multisensor tracking systems involve the development of
reliable methods for the data association and the fusion of multiple sensor
information, and more specifically the partioning of observations into tracks.
This paper discusses and compares the application of Dempster-Shafer Theory
(DST) and the Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT) methods to the fusion of
multiple sensor attributes for target identification purpose. We focus our
attention on the paradoxical Blackman's association problem and propose several
approaches to outperfom Blackman's solution. We clarify some preconceived ideas
about the use of degree of conflict between sources as potential criterion for
partitioning evidences.
