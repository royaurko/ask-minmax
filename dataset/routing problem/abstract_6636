In contrast to the classical cake-cutting problem (how to fairly divide a
desirable object), "chore division" is the problem of how to divide an
undesirable object. We develop the first explicit algorithm for envy-free chore
division among N people, a counterpart to the N-person envy-free cake-division
solution of Brams-Taylor (1995). This is accomplished by exploiting a notion of
"irrevocable advantage" for chores. We discuss the differences between
cake-cutting and chore division and additional problems encountered in chore
division.
