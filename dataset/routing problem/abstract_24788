We study the maximization version of the fundamental graph coloring problem.
Here the goal is to color the vertices of a k-colorable graph with k colors so
that a maximum fraction of edges are properly colored (i.e. their endpoints
receive different colors). A random k-coloring properly colors an expected
fraction 1-1/k of edges. We prove that given a graph promised to be
k-colorable, it is NP-hard to find a k-coloring that properly colors more than
a fraction ~1-O(1/k} of edges. Previously, only a hardness factor of 1-O(1/k^2)
was known. Our result pins down the correct asymptotic dependence of the
approximation factor on k. Along the way, we prove that approximating the
Maximum 3-colorable subgraph problem within a factor greater than 32/33 is
NP-hard. Using semidefinite programming, it is known that one can do better
than a random coloring and properly color a fraction 1-1/k +2 ln k/k^2 of edges
in polynomial time. We show that, assuming the 2-to-1 conjecture, it is hard to
properly color (using k colors) more than a fraction 1-1/k + O(ln k/ k^2) of
edges of a k-colorable graph.
