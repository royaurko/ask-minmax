We consider the decision problem asking whether a partial rational symmetric
matrix with an all-ones diagonal can be completed to a full positive
semidefinite matrix of rank at most $k$. We show that this problem is
$\NP$-hard for any fixed integer $k\ge 2$. Equivalently, for $k\ge 2$, it is
$\NP$-hard to test membership in the rank constrained elliptope $\EE_k(G)$,
i.e., the set of all partial matrices with off-diagonal entries specified at
the edges of $G$, that can be completed to a positive semidefinite matrix of
rank at most $k$. Additionally, we show that deciding membership in the convex
hull of $\EE_k(G)$ is also $\NP$-hard for any fixed integer $k\ge 2$.
