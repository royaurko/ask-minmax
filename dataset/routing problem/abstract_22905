Successful achievement of public policies requires satisfaction of conditions
affecting political feasibility for policy adoption and maintenance as well as
economic viability of the desired activity or enterprise. This paper discusses
the difficulties of satisfying these joint constraints given the legacy of the
common law doctrines of "just price" and "businesses affected with a public
interest." In this regard, it is helpful to view traditional public utility
regulation as a form of welfare state regulation, as it suffers from similar
political problems from policy retrenchment. The retrenchment problems are
examined in the context of the electricity crisis in California as well as the
passage and implementation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. As expected,
retrenchment from low residential retail rates - the most universalistic
benefit for customers - faces the greatest political resistance. The societal
trade-offs between monopoly and competition must be reexamined in light of the
greater instability and political difficulties under a deregulatory regime.
