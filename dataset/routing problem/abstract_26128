In recent years, predicting the user's next request in web navigation has
received much attention. An information source to be used for dealing with such
problem is the left information by the previous web users stored at the web
access log on the web servers. Purposed systems for this problem work based on
this idea that if a large number of web users request specific pages of a
website on a given session, it can be concluded that these pages are satisfying
similar information needs, and therefore they are conceptually related. In this
study, a new clustering approach is introduced that employs logical path
storing of a website pages as another parameter which is regarded as a
similarity parameter and conceptual relation between web pages. The results of
simulation have shown that the proposed approach is more than others precise in
determining the clusters.
