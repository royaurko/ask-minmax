In the present work we prove a common generalization of Maynard-Tao's recent
result about consecutive bounded gaps between primes and on the
Erd\H{o}s-Rankin bound about large gaps between consecutive primes. The work
answers in a strong form a 60 years old problem of Erd\"os, which asked whether
the ratio of two consecutive primegaps can be infinitely often arbitrarily
small, and arbitrarily large, respectively.
