We consider the fluid interface problem given by two incompressible fluids
with different densities evolving by Darcy's law. This scenario is known as the
Muskat problem for fluids with the same viscosities, being in two dimensions
mathematically analogous to the two-phase Hele-Shaw cell. We prove in the
stable case (the denser fluid is below) a maximum principle for the $L^\infty$
norm of the free boundary.
