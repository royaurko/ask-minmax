Designing human computer interaction interface is an important and a complex
task, but it could be simplified by decomposing task into subcomponents and
maintaining relationships among those subcomponents. Task decomposition is a
structured approach, applicable in both Software Engineering and Human Computer
Interaction (HCI) fields depending on specific processes and design artifacts.
Using design artifacts applications could be made for analysis and design by
making the hand draw sketches to provide high level of logical design based on
user requirements, usage scenarios and essential use cases. To design hand draw
sketches there are some strategies to be followed .i.e., planning, sequential
work flow, and levels of details. In this research paper we are presenting
design artifacts, goals, principles, guidelines and currently faced problems to
human computer interaction design community. Moreover in the end concluded with
assessed observations in a case study.
