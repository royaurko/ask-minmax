We prove the closure for the sequential weak $L^p$-topology of the class of
vectorfields on $B^3$ having integer flux through almost every sphere. We show
how this problem is connected to the study of the minimization problem for the
Yang-Mills functional in dimension higher than critical, in the abelian case.
