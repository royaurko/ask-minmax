A numerical technique is described that can efficiently compute solutions in
interface problems. These are problems with data, such as the coefficients of
differential equations, discontinuous or even singular across one or more
interfaces. A prime example of these problems are optical waveguides and as
such the scheme is applied to Maxwell's equations as they are formulated to
describe light confinement in Bragg fibers. It is based on standard finite
differences appropriately modified to take into account all possible
discontinuities across the waveguide's interfaces due to the change of the
refractive index. Second and fourth order schemes are described with additional
adaptations to handle matrix eigenvalue problems, demanding geometries and
defects.
