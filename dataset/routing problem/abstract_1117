The locator/identifier split approach assumes separating functions of a
locator (i.e. topology--dependent attachment point address) and identifier
(topology-independent unique identifier) currently both served by an IP
address. This work is an attempt to redefine semantics of MAC address to make
it a pure layer-2 locator instead of a pure globally-unique identifier. Such an
exercise might be interesting from the standpoint of Ethernet scaling and Metro
Ethernet technologies. From the global routing perspective, introduction of
multihoming, traffic engineering and failover at the 2nd layer may reduce
pressure on the 3rd layer.
