We study the problem of ranking with submodular valuations. An instance of
this problem consists of a ground set $[m]$, and a collection of $n$ monotone
submodular set functions $f^1, \ldots, f^n$, where each $f^i: 2^{[m]} \to R_+$.
An additional ingredient of the input is a weight vector $w \in R_+^n$. The
objective is to find a linear ordering of the ground set elements that
minimizes the weighted cover time of the functions. The cover time of a
function is the minimal number of elements in the prefix of the linear ordering
that form a set whose corresponding function value is greater than a unit
threshold value.
  Our main contribution is an $O(\ln(1 / \epsilon))$-approximation algorithm
for the problem, where $\epsilon$ is the smallest non-zero marginal value that
any function may gain from some element. Our algorithm orders the elements
using an adaptive residual updates scheme, which may be of independent
interest. We also prove that the problem is $\Omega(\ln(1 / \epsilon))$-hard to
approximate, unless P = NP. This implies that the outcome of our algorithm is
optimal up to constant factors.
