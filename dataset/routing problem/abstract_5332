We consider a restricted four-body problem on the dynamics of a massless
particle under the gravitational force produced by three mass points forming an
equilateral triangle configuration. We assume that the mass m3 of one primary
is very small compared with the other two, m1 and m2, and we study the
Hamiltonian system describing the motion of the massless particle in a
neighborhood of m3. In a similar way to Hill approximation of the lunar
problem, we perform a symplectic scaling, sending the two massive bodies to
infinity, expanding the potential as a power series in m3, and taking the limit
case when m3 tends to cero. We show that the limiting Hamiltonian inherits
dynamical features from both the restricted three-body problem and the
restricted four-body problem. In particular, it extends the classical lunar
Hill problem. We investigate the geometry of the Poincare sections, direct and
retrograde periodic orbits about m3, libration points, periodic orbits near
libration points, their stable and unstable manifolds, and the corresponding
homoclinic intersections. The motivation for this model is the study of the
motion of a satellite near a jovian Trojan asteroid.
