The Libopt environment is both a methodology and a set of tools that can be
used for testing, comparing, and profiling solvers on problems belonging to
various collections. These collections can be heterogeneous in the sense that
their problems can have common features that differ from one collection to the
other. Libopt brings a unified view on this composite world by offering, for
example, the possibility to run any solver on any problem compatible with it,
using the same Unix/Linux command. The environment also provides tools for
comparing the results obtained by solvers on a specified set of problems. Most
of the scripts going with the Libopt environment have been written in Perl.
