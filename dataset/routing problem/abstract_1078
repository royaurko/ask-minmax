The Weizsacker-Williams method is a semiclassical approximation scheme used
to analyze a wide variety of electromagnetic interactions. It can greatly
simplify calculations that would otherwise be impractical or impossible to
carry out using the standard route of the Feynman rules. With a few reasonable
assumptions, the scope of the method was generalized so as to accommodate weak,
as well as the usual electromagnetic, interactions. The results are shown to be
in excellent agreement, in the high energy limit of interest, with other
methods, and the generalized scheme is shown to still work in regimes of
analysis where those methods break down.
