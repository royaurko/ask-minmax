The structured operators and corresponding operator identities, which appear
in inverse problems for the self-adjoint and skew-self-adjoint Dirac systems
with rectangular potentials, are studied in detail. In particular, it is shown
that operators with the close to displacement kernels are included in this
class. A special case of positive and factorizable operators is dealt with
separately.
