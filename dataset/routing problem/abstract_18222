The Workflow Satisfiability Problem (WSP) asks whether there exists an
assignment of contributorized users to the steps in a workflow specification,
subject to certain constraints on the assignment. The problem is NP-hard even
when restricted to just not equals constraints. Since the number of steps $k$
is relatively small in practice, Wang and Li (2010) introduced a
parametrisation of WSP by $k$. Wang and Li (2010) showed that, in general, the
WSP is W[1]-hard, i.e., it is unlikely that there exists a fixed-parameter
tractable (FPT) algorithm for solving the WSP. Crampton et al. (2013) and Cohen
et al. (2014) designed FPT algorithms of running time $O^*(2^{k})$ and
$O^*(2^{k\log_2 k})$ for the WSP with so-called regular and user-independent
constraints, respectively. In this note, we show that there are no algorithms
of running time $O^*(2^{ck})$ and $O^*(2^{ck\log_2 k})$ for the two
restrictions of WSP, respectively, with any $c<1$, unless the Strong
Exponential Time Hypothesis fails.
