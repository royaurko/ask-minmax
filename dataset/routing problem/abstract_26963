The growth of an elastic film adhered to a confining substrate might lead to
the formation of delimitation blisters. Many results have been derived when the
substrate is flat. The equilibrium shapes, beyond small deformations, are
determined by the interplay between the sheet elastic energy and the adhesive
potential due to capillarity. Here, we study a non-trivial generalization to
this problem and consider the adhesion of a growing elastic loop to a confining
\emph{circular} substrate. The fundamental equations, i.e., the Euler Elastica
equation, the boundary conditions and the transversality condition, are derived
from a variational procedure. In contrast to the planar case, the curvature of
the delimiting wall appears in the transversality condition, thus acting as a
further source of adhesion. We provide the analytic solution to the problem
under study in terms of elliptic integrals and perform the numerical and the
asymptotic analysis of the characteristic lengths of the blister. Finally, and
in contrast to previous studies, we also discuss the mechanics and the internal
stresses in the case of vanishing adhesion. Specifically, we give a theoretical
explanation to the observed divergence of the mean pressure exerted by the
strip on the container in the limit of small excess-length.
