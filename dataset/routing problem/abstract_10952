The problem of the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition in the highly
frustrated XY Kagom\'{e} antiferromagnet is solved. The problem is mapped onto
that of the KT transition in the XY ferromagnet on the hexagonal lattice. The
transition temperature is found. It is shown that the spin correlation function
exponentially decays with distance even in the low-temperature phase, in
contrast to the order parameter correlation function, which decays
algebraically with distance.
