We consider the Cauchy problem for the weakly dissipative wave equation $$
\square u+\frac\mu{1+t} u_t=0 $$ with parameter $\mu\ge2$.
  Based on the explicit representations of solutions provided in [Math. Meth.
Appl. Sci. 2004; {\bf 27}:101-124] sharp decay estimates for data from a dense
subspace of the energy space are derived. Furthermore, sharpness is discussed
in terms of a modified scattering theory.
