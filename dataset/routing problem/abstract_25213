Translated into the language of representations of quivers, a challenge in
matrix pencil theory is to find sufficient and necessary conditions for a
Kronecker representation to be a subfactor of another Kronecker representation
in terms of their Kronecker invariants. The problem is reduced to a numerical
criterion for a Kronecker representation to be a subrepresentation of another
Kronecker representation in terms of their Kronecker invariants. The key to the
problem is the calculation of ranks of matrices over polynomial rings. For
this, a generalization and specialization approach is introduced. This approach
is applied to provide a numerical criterion for a preprojective (resp. regular,
preinjective) Kronecker representation to be a subrepresentation of another
preprojective (resp. regular, preinjective) Kronecker representation in terms
of their Kronecker invariants.
