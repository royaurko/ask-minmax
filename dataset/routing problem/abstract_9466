Crux Mathematicorum with Mathematical Mayhem, is a problem solving journal
published by the Canadian Mathematical Society. In the March 2010 issue(see
reference[1]) ,the following problem was proposed:Determine all positive
integers a,b, and c such that a^(b^c)=(a^b)^c; or equivalently,
a^(b^c)=a^(b^c). A solution by this contributor was published in the December2010
issue of Crux(see reference[2]). Accordingly, all such positive integer triples
are the following:The triples of the form (1,b,c); with b, c any positive
integers; the triples (a,b,1); a, b positive integers, with a being at least 2;
and the triples of the form (a,2,2); a being a positive integer not equal to
1.These are then the positive integer solutions to the 3-variable exponential
diophantine equation, x^(y^z)=x^(yz) (1) Motivated by mayhem problem M429, in
this work we investigate for more 3-variable exponential diophantine equations:
  x^(y^z)=x^(z^y) (2), x^(y^z)=y^(xz) (3) x^(yz)=y^(xz) (4), x^(y^z)=z^(xy) (5)
We completely determine the positive integer solution sets of equations (2),
(3), and (4). This is done in Theorems2,3, and4 respectively. We also find
three different families of solutions to equation (5); listed in Theorem5.
