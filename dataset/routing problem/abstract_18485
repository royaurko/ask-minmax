We study a recently proposed mechanism to solve the hierarchy problem in the
context of the landscape, where the solution of the hierarchy problem is
connected to the requirement of having baryons in our universe via Electroweak
Baryogenesis. The phase transition is triggered by the fermion condensation of
a new gauge sector which becomes strong at a scale Lambda determined by
dimensional transmutation, and it is mediated to the standard model by a new
singlet field. In a ``friendly'' neighborhood of the landscape, where only the
relevant operators are ``scanned'' among the vacua, baryogenesis is effective
only if the higgs mass m_h is comparable to this low scale Lambda, forcing m_h
to be of order Lambda, and solving the hierarchy problem. A new CP violating
phase is needed coupling the new singlet and the higgs field to new matter
fields. We study the constraints on this model given by baryogenesis and by the
electron electric dipole moment (EDM), and we briefly comment on gauge coupling
unification and on dark matter relic abundance. We find that next generation
experiments on the EDM will be sensitive to essentially the entire viable
region of the parameter space, so that absence of a signal would effectively
rule out the model.
