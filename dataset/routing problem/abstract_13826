This paper is devoted to the study of the Dirichlet problem associated with
the Dunkl Laplacian $\Delta_k$. We establish, under some condition on a bounded
domain $D$ of $\R^d$, the existence of a unique continuous function $h$ on
$\R^d$ such that $\Delta_kh=0$ on $D$ and $h=f$ on $\R^d\setminus D$ the
complement of $D$ in $\R^d$, where the function $f$ is asumed to be continuous.
We also give an analytic formula characterizing the solution $h$.
