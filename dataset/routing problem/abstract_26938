Dealing with structured data needs the use of expressive representation
formalisms that, however, puts the problem to deal with the computational
complexity of the machine learning process. Furthermore, real world domains
require tools able to manage their typical uncertainty. Many statistical
relational learning approaches try to deal with these problems by combining the
construction of relevant relational features with a probabilistic tool. When
the combination is static (static propositionalization), the constructed
features are considered as boolean features and used offline as input to a
statistical learner; while, when the combination is dynamic (dynamic
propositionalization), the feature construction and probabilistic tool are
combined into a single process. In this paper we propose a selective
propositionalization method that search the optimal set of relational features
to be used by a probabilistic learner in order to minimize a loss function. The
new propositionalization approach has been combined with the random subspace
ensemble method. Experiments on real-world datasets shows the validity of the
proposed method.
