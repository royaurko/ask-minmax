For three positive integers ai, aj, ak pairwise coprime, we present an
algorithm that find the least multiple of ai that is a positive linear
combination of aj, ak. The average running time of this algorithm is O(1).
Using this algorithm and the chinese remainder theorem leads to a direct
computation of the Frobenius number f(a1, a2, a3).
