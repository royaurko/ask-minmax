We present a geometric approach to the three-body problem in the
non-relativistic context of the Barbour-Bertotti theories. The Riemannian
metric characterizing the dynamics is analyzed in detail in terms of the
relative separations. Consequences of a conformal symmetry are exploited and
the sectional curvatures of geometrically preferred surfaces are computed. The
geodesic motions are integrated. Line configurations, which lead to curvature
singularities for $N\neq 3$, are investigated. None of the independent scalars
formed from the metric and curvature tensor diverges there.
