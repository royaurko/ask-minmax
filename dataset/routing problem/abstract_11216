We formulate in an intuitive manner several conceptual aspects of the
field-to-particle transition problem which intends to extract physical
properties of elementary particles from specific field configurations. We
discuss the possibility of using the conceptual basis of the holographic
principle and the mathematical fundaments of nonlinear sigma models for the
field-to-particle transition. It is shown that certain classical gravitational
configurations in vacuum may contain physical parameters with discrete values,
and that they behave under rotations as particle-like objects.
