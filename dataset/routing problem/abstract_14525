This work presents a classical Lie point symmetry analysis of a
two-component, non-isospectral Lax pair of a hierarchy of partial differential
equations in $2+1$ dimensions, which can be considered as a modified version of
the Camassa-Holm hierarchy in $2+1$ dimensions. A classification of reductions
for this spectral problem is performed. Non-isospectral reductions in $1+1$
dimensions are considered of remarkable interest.
