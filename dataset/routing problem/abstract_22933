We present a C++ implementation of a fifth order semi-implicit Runge-Kutta
algorithm for solving Ordinary Differential Equations. This algorithm can be
used for studying many different problems and in particular it can be applied
for computing the evolution of any system whose Hamiltonian is known. We
consider in particular the problem of calculating the neutrino oscillation
probabilities in presence of matter interactions. The time performance and the
accuracy of this implementation is competitive with respect to the other
analytical and numerical techniques used in literature. The algorithm design
and the salient features of the code are presented and discussed and some
explicit examples of code application are given.
