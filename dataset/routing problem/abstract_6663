We show that the model checking problem for intuitionistic propositional
logic with one variable is complete for logspace-uniform AC1. As basic tool we
use the connection between intuitionistic logic and Heyting algebra, and
investigate its complexity theoretical aspects. For superintuitionistic logics
with one variable, we obtain NC1-completeness for the model checking problem.
