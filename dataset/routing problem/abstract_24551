We deal with Bayesian inference for Beta autoregressive processes. We
restrict our attention to the class of conditionally linear processes. These
processes are particularly suitable for forecasting purposes, but are difficult
to estimate due to the constraints on the parameter space. We provide a full
Bayesian approach to the estimation and include the parameter restrictions in
the inference problem by a suitable specification of the prior distributions.
Moreover in a Bayesian framework parameter estimation and model choice can be
solved simultaneously. In particular we suggest a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) procedure based on a Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs algorithm and
solve the model selection problem following a reversible jump MCMC approach.
