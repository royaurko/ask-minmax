Adhoc networks are characterized by connectivity through a collection of
wireless nodes and fast changing network topology. Wireless nodes are free to
move independent of each other which makes routing much difficult. This calls
for the need of an efficient dynamic routing protocol. Mesh-based multicast
routing technique establishes communications between mobile nodes of wireless
adhoc networks in a faster and efficient way. In this article the performance
of prominent on-demand routing protocols for mobile adhoc networks such as
ODMRP (On Demand Multicast Routing Protocol), AODV (Adhoc on Demand Distance
Vector) and FSR (Fisheye State Routing protocol) was studied. The parameters
viz., average throughput, packet delivery ration and end-to-end delay were
evaluated. From the simulation results and analysis, a suitable routing
protocol can be chosen for a specified network. The results show that the ODMRP
protocol performance is remarkably superior as compared with AODV and FSR
routing protocols. Keywords: MANET, Multicast Routing, ODMRP, AODV, FSR.
