Generalized Chebyshev iteration (GCI) applied for solving linear equations
with nonselfadjoint operators is considered. Sufficient conditions providing
the convergence of iterations imposed on the domain of localization of the
spectrum on the complex plane are obtained. A minimax problem for the
determination of optimal complex iteration parameters is formulated. An
algorithm of finding an optimal iteration parameter in the case of arbitrary
location of the operator spectrum on the complex plane is constructed for the
generalized simple iteration method. The results are applied to numerical
solution of volume singular integral equations (VSIEs) associated with the
problems of the mathematical theory of wave diffraction by 3D dielectric
bodies. In particular, the domain of the spectrum location is described
explicitly for low-frequency scattering problems and in the general case. The
obtained results are discussed and recommendations concerning their
applications are given.
