Results for penetrating probes treated within a hybrid hydro-kinetic model
are projected onto the energy range covered by the NICA and FAIR projects. A
new source of dileptons emitted from a mixed quark-hadron phase, quark-hadron
bremsstrahlung, is proposed. An estimate for the $\pi\pi \to\sigma \to
\gamma\gamma$ process in nuclear collisions is given.
