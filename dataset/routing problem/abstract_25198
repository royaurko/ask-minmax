The semantic e-government is a new application field accompanying the
development of semantic web where the ontologies have become a fertile field of
investigation. This is due firstly to both the complexity and the size of
e-government systems and secondly to the importance of the issues. However,
permitting easy and personalized access to e-government services has become, at
this juncture, an arduous and not spontaneous process. Indeed, the provided
e-gov services to the user represent a critical contact point between
administrations and users. The encountered problems in the e-gov services
retrieving process are: the absence of an integrated one-stop government, the
difficulty of localizing the services' sources, the lack of mastery of search
terms and the deficiency of multilingualism of the online services. In order to
solve these problems, to facilitate access to e-gov services and to satisfy the
needs of potential users, we propose an original approach to this issue. This
approach incorporates a semantic layer as a crucial element in the retrieving
process. It consists in implementing a personalized search system that
integrates ontology of the e-gov domain in this process.
