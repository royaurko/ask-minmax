Network Utility Maximization (NUM) is often applied for the cross-layer
design of wireless networks considering known wireless channels. However,
realistic wireless channel capacities are stochastic bearing time-varying
statistics, necessitating the redesign and solution of NUM problems to capture
such effects. Based on NUM theory we develop a framework for scheduling,
routing, congestion and power control in wireless multihop networks that
considers stochastic Long or Short Term Fading wireless channels. Specifically,
the wireless channel is modeled via stochastic differential equations
alleviating several assumptions that exist in state-of-the-art channel modeling
within the NUM framework such as the finite number of states or the
stationarity. Our consideration of wireless channel modeling leads to a NUM
problem formulation that accommodates non-convex and time-varying utilities. We
consider both cases of non orthogonal and orthogonal access of users to the
medium. In the first case, scheduling is performed via power control, while the
latter separates scheduling and power control and the role of power control is
to further increase users' optimal utility by exploiting random reductions of
the stochastic channel power loss while also considering energy efficiency.
Finally, numerical results evaluate the performance and operation of the
proposed approach and study the impact of several involved parameters on
convergence.
