Two multivehicle routing problems are considered in the framework that a
visit to a location must take place during a specific time window in order to
be counted and all time windows are the same length. In the first problem, the
goal is to visit as many locations as possible using a fixed number of
vehicles. In the second, the goal is to visit all locations using the smallest
number of vehicles possible. For the first problem, we present an approximation
algorithm whose output path collects a reward within a constant factor of
optimal for any fixed number of vehicles. For the second problem, our algorithm
finds a 6-approximation to the problem on a tree metric, whenever a single
vehicle could visit all locations during their time windows.
