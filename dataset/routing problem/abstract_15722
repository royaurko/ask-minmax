The tracing of cosmological relics from the early string dynamics may enhance
the theory and provide new perspectives on the major cosmological problems.
This point is illustrated in a leading-order Bianchi-type $VII_0$ string
background, wherein spatial isotropy can be claimed as such a relic. A much
finer one, descending from a premordial gravitational wave, could be retrieved
from its imprint on the small-scale structure of the cosmic microwave
background. In spite of the absence of conventional inflation, there is no
horizon problem thanks to the presence of an equally fundamental mixmaster
dynamics. Implications and certain new perspectives which thus arise for the
more general problem of cosmological mixing are briefly discussed.
