In this paper we present an extension of standard iterative splitting schemes
to multiple splitting schemes for solving higher order differential equations.
  We are motivated by dynamical systems, which occur in dynamics of the
electrons in the plasma using a simplified Boltzmann equation. Oscillation
problems in spectroscopy problems using wave-equations.
  The motivation arose to simulate active plasma resonance spectroscopy which
is used for plasma diagnostic techniques.
