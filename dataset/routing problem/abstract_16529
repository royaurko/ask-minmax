The method of analytic continuation is one of the most powerful tools to
circumvent the sign problem in lattice QCD. The present study is part of a
larger project which, based on the investigation of QCD-like theories which are
free of the sign problem, is aimed at testing the validity of the method of
analytic continuation and at improving its predictivity, in view of its
application to real QCD. We have shown that a considerable improvement can be
achieved if suitable functions are used to interpolate data with imaginary
chemical potential. We present results obtained in a theory free of the sign
problem such as two-color QCD at finite chemical potential.
