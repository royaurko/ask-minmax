We give a solution to the word problem for the singular braid monoid SB_n.
The complexity of the algorithm is quadratic in the product of the word length
and the number of the singular generators in the word. Furthermore we
algebraically reprove a result of Fenn, Keyman and Rourke that the monoid
embeds into a group and we compute the cohomological dimension of this group.
