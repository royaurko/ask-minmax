There are, at present, several gravitational and cosmological anomalies; the
dark energy problem, the lambda problem, accelerating cosmological expansion,
the anomalous Pioneer spacecraft acceleration, a spin-up of the Earth and an
apparent variation of G observed from analysis of the evolution of planetary
longitudes. These conundrums may be resolved in the theory of Self Creation
Cosmology, in which the Principle of Mutual Interaction subsumes both Mach's
Principle and the Local Conservation of Energy. The theory is conformally
equivalent to General Relativity in vacuo with the consequence that predictions
of the theory are identical with General Relativity in the standard solar
system experiments. Other observable local and cosmological consequences offer
an explanation for the anomalies above. The SCC universe expands linearly in
its Einstein Frame and it is static in its Jordan Frame; hence, as there are no
density, smoothness or horizon problems, there is no requirement for Inflation.
The theory determines the total density parameter to be one third, and the cold
dark matter density parameter to be two ninths, yet in the Jordan frame the
universe is similar to Einstein's original static cylindrical model and
spatially flat. Therefore there is no need for a 'Dark Energy' hypothesis. As
the field equations determine the false vacuum energy density to be a specific,
and feasibly small, value there is no 'Lambda Problem'. Finally certain
observations in SCC would detect cosmic acceleration.
