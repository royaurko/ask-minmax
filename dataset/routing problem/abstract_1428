We show that the oscillatory driving of crystal surfaces can induce pattern
formation or smoothening. The driving force can be of quite different origin
such as a pulsed laser beam, an electric field, or elasticity. Depending on
driving conditions, step bunching and meandering, mound formation, or surface
smoothening may be seen in presence of a kinetic asymmetry at the steps or
kinks (the Ehrlich-Schwoebel effect). We employ a step model to calculate the
induced mass flux along misoriented surfaces, which accounts for surface
dynamics and stability. Flux inversion is found when varying the driving
frequency. Slope selection and metastability result from the cancellation of
the mass flux along special orientations. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations
illustrate these points.
