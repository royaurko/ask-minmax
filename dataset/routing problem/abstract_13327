In this note, we present a counterexample to a conjecture of Rozoy and
Thiagarajan from 1991 (called also the nice labeling problem) asserting that
any (coherent) event structure with finite degree admits a labeling with a
finite number of labels, or equivalently, that there exists a function $f:
\mathbb{N} \mapsto \mathbb{N}$ such that an event structure with degree $\le n$
admits a labeling with at most $f(n)$ labels. Our counterexample is based on
the Burling's construction from 1965 of 3-dimensional box hypergraphs with
clique number 2 and arbitrarily large chromatic numbers and the bijection
between domains of event structures and median graphs established by
Barth\'elemy and Constantin in 1993.
