A domain integral method employing a specific Green's function (i.e.,
incorporating some features of the global problem of wave propagation in an
inhomogeneous medium) is developed for solving direct and inverse scattering
problems relative to slab-like macroscopically inhomogeneous porous obstacles.
It is shown how to numerically solve such problems, involving both
spatially-varying density and compressibility, by means of an iterative scheme
initialized with a Born approximation. A numerical solution is obtained for a
canonical problem involving a two-layer slab.
