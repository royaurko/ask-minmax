The maximum volume $j$-simplex problem asks to compute the $j$-dimensional
simplex of maximum volume inside the convex hull of a given set of $n$ points
in $\mathbb{Q}^d$. We give a deterministic approximation algorithm for this
problem which achieves an approximation ratio of $e^{j/2 + o(j)}$. The problem
is known to be $\mathrm{NP}$-hard to approximate within a factor of $c^{j}$ for
some constant $c > 1$. Our algorithm also gives a factor $e^{j + o(j)}$
approximation for the problem of finding the principal $j\times j$ submatrix of
a rank $d$ positive semidefinite matrix with the largest determinant. We
achieve our approximation by rounding solutions to a generalization of the
$D$-optimal design problem, or, equivalently, the dual of an appropriate
smallest enclosing ellipsoid problem. Our arguments give a short and simple
proof of a restricted invertibility principle for determinants.
