In this paper we study the branching problems for Hecke algebra $\H(D_n)$ of
type $D_n$. We explicitly describe the decompositions of the socle of the
restriction of each irreducible $\H(D_n)$-representation to $\H(D_{n-1})$ into
irreducible modules by using the corresponding results for type $B$ Hecke
algebras. In particular, we show that any such restrictions are always
multiplicity free.
