Recently Simenhaus proved that for any elliptic random walk in random
environment, transience in the neighborhood of a given direction is equivalent
to the a.s. existence of a deterministic asymptotic direction and to transience
in any direction in the open half space defined by this asymptotic direction.
Here we prove an improved version of this result and review some open problems.
