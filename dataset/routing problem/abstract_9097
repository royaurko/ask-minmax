The Hamiltonian describing fermion pair production from an arbitrarily
time-varying electric field in two dimensions is studied using a
group-theoretic approach. We show that this Hamiltonian can be encompassed by
two, commuting SU(2) algebras, and that the two-dimensional problem can
therefore be reduced to two one-dimensional problems. We compare the group
structure for the two-dimensional problem with that previously derived for the
one-dimensional problem, and verify that the Schwinger result is obtained under
the appropriate conditions.
