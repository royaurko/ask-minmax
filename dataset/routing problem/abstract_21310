The induction equation of kinematic magnetohydrodynamics is mathematically
equivalent to a system of integral equations for the magnetic field in the bulk
of the fluid and for the electric potential at its boundary. We summarize the
recent developments concerning the numerical implementation of this scheme and
its applications to various forward and inverse problems in dynamo theory and
applied MHD.
