We are reaching relative maturity and standardization in one-dimensional
single-star stellar evolution and pulsation modeling, and are making advances
in binary and 2D and 3D models. However, many physical inputs are still
uncertain or neglected in models of the Sun and of other stars. Thanks to the
the Kepler, CoRoT, and MOST spacecraft, for example, as well as to ground-based
networks, we now have pulsation data for stars that are of comparable quality
to that for the Sun to constrain models and test physical assumptions. Here I
will focus on main sequence (core H-burning) or slightly post-main sequence
(shell H-burning) stellar models, and some of the unsolved problems for these
stars. I will revisit the solar abundance problem, and show the effects of
modified electron screening, dark matter, and early mass loss on solar models.
I will discuss the gamma Dor/ delta Sct hybrid stars, the mismatch between
predicted and observed frequencies for delta Sct stars, and how seismology of
stars more massive than the Sun, e.g. the brightest Kepler target theta Cyg,
could help us constrain physical processes such as diffusive settling, test
pulsation driving mechanisms, and provide clues to the solar abundance problem.
