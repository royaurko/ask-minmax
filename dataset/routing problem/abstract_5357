We study the Continuous Infinite Zeros Problem, which asks whether a
real-valued function $f$ satisfying a given ordinary linear differential
equation has infinitely many zeros on $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$. We consider also
the closely related Unbounded Continuous Skolem Problem, which asks whether $f$
has a zero in a given unbounded subinterval of $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$. These are
fundamental reachability problems arising in the analysis of continuous linear
dynamical systems, including linear hybrid automata and continuous-time Markov
chains.
  Our main decidability result is that if the ordinary differential equation
satisfied by $f$ is of order at most $7$ or if the imaginary parts of its
characteristic roots are all rational multiples of one another, then the
Infinite Zeros Problem is decidable, and moreover, if $f$ has only finitely
many zeros, then an upper bound $T$ may be found such that $f(t)=0$ entails
$t\leq T$. On the other hand, our main hardness results is that if the Infinite
Zeros Problem is decidable for ordinary differential equations of order at
least $9$, then this would entail a major breakthrough in Diophantine
Approximation, specifically, the computability of the Lagrange constant
$L_{\infty}(x)$ for all real algebraic $x$.
