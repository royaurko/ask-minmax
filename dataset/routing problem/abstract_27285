Low pole order frames of slanted vector fields are constructed on the space
of vertical k-jets of the universal family of complete intersections in
$\mathbb{P}^n$ and, adapting the arguments, low pole order frames of slanted
vector fields are also constructed on the space of vertical logarithmic k-jets
along the universal family of projective hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^n$ with
several irreducible smooth components.
  Both the pole order (here $=5k-2$) and the determination of the locus where
the global generation statement fails are improved compared to the literature
(previously $=k^2+2k$), thanks to three new ingredients; we reformulate the
problem in terms of some adjoint action, we introduce a new formalism of
geometric jet coordinates, and then we construct what we call building-block
vector fields, making the problem for arbitrary jet order $k\geqslant1$ into a
very analog of the much easier case where $k=0$, i.e. where no jet coordinates
are needed.
