The search for Majorana fermions in p-wave paired fermionic systems has
recently moved to the forefront of condensed-matter research. Here we propose
an alternative route and show theoretically that Majorana-like modes can be
realized and probed in a driven-dissipative system of strongly correlated
photons consisting of a chain of tunnel-coupled cavities, where p-wave pairing
effectively arises from the interplay between strong on-site interactions and
two-photon parametric driving. The nonlocal nature of these exotic modes could
be demonstrated through cross-correlation measurements carried out at the ends
of the chain---revealing a strong photon bunching signature---and their
non-Abelian properties could be simulated through tunnel-braid operations.
