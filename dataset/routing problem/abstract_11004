The problem of creating well-collimated beams of atoms escaping from a trap
is studied. This problem is of high importance for the realization of atom
lasers. Nonadiabatic dynamics of neutral atoms in nonuniform magnetic fields,
typical of quadrupole magnetic traps, has been considered. The main result of
this report is that an unusual semiconfining regime of motion is found, when
atoms are confined from one side of an axis but are not confined from another
side. This regime can be achieved by means of only magnetic fields. The formed
atomic beam can be forwarded in arbitrary direction.
