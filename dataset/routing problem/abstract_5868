Let G=(V,E) be a graph. A vertex dominates itself and all its neighbors,
i.e., every vertex v in V dominates its closed neighborhood N[v]. A vertex set
D in G is an efficient dominating (e.d.) set for G if for every vertex v in V,
there is exactly one d in D dominating v. An edge set M is an efficient edge
dominating (e.e.d.) set for G if it is an efficient dominating set in the line
graph L(G) of G. The ED problem (EED problem, respectively) asks for the
existence of an e.d. set (e.e.d. set, respectively) in the given graph.
  We give a unified framework for investigating the complexity of these
problems on various classes of graphs. In particular, we solve some open
problems and give linear time algorithms for ED and EED on dually chordal
graphs.
  We extend the two problems to hypergraphs and show that ED remains
NP-complete on alpha-acyclic hypergraphs, and is solvable in polynomial time on
hypertrees, while EED is polynomial on alpha-acyclic hypergraphs and
NP-complete on hypertrees.
