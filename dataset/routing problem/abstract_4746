We consider the problem of assembling a sequence based on a collection of its
substrings observed through a noisy channel. This problem of reconstructing
sequences from traces was first investigated in the noiseless setting under the
name of "Markov type" analysis. Here, we explain the connection between the
problem and the problem of DNA synthesis and sequencing, and introduce the
notion of a DNA storage channel. We analyze the number of sequence equivalence
classes under the channel mapping and propose new asymmetric coding techniques
to combat the effects of synthesis noise. In our analysis, we make use of
Ehrhart theory for rational polytopes.
