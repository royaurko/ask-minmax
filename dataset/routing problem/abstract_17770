The Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP) is an important
example of a particle system driven by an irreversible Markov chain. In this
paper we give a simple yet rigorous derivation of the chain stationary measure
in the case of parallel updating rule. In this parallel framework we then
consider the blockage problem (aka slow bond problem). We find the exact
expression of the current for an arbitrary blockage intensity $\varepsilon$ in
the case of the so-called rule-184 cellular automaton, i.e. a parallel TASEP
where at each step all particles free-to-move are actually moved. Finally, we
investigate through numerical experiments the conjecture that for parallel
updates other than rule-184 the current may be non-analytic in the blockage
intensity around the value $\varepsilon = 0$.
