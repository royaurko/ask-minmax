These lecture notes have been prepared as a first course in fluid mechanics
up to the presentation of the millennium problem listed by the Clay
Mathematical Institute. With this document, our primary goal is to debunk this
beautiful problem as much as possible. At the end, a very modern aspect of
fluid mechanics is covered concerning the subtle issue of its application to
high energetic hadronic collisions.
