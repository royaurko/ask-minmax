A new phenomenon, entrainment of chaos, which is understood as a seizure of
an irregular behavior by limit cycles, is discussed. As a result, chaotic
cycles appear if the chaos amplitude is small. Otherwise, the chaos is not
necessarily cyclic, if the perturbations are strong and/or diameter of the
limit cycle is small. Sensitivity as a main and a unique ingredient is
considered and, in addition, period-doubling route to chaos is chosen for
extension. The results may be of strong importance for engineering sciences,
brainwaves and biomusicology phenomena as well as can be developed for
hydrodynamics. Theoretical results are supported by simulations and discussions
over Chua's oscillators, entrainment of chaos by toroidal attractors and
controlling problems. Moreover, through an example, by means of the Lyapunov
functions method, a chaotic attractor is provided.
