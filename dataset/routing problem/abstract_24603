We present two versions of third order accurate jet schemes, which achieve
high order accuracy by tracking derivative information of the solution along
characteristic curves. For a benchmark linear advection problem, the efficiency
of jet schemes is compared with WENO and Discontinuous Galerkin methods of the
same order. Moreover, the performance of various schemes in tracking solution
contours is investigated. It is demonstrated that jet schemes possess the
simplicity and speed of WENO schemes, while showing several of the advantages
as well as the accuracy of DG methods.
