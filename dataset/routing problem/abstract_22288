We consider viscosity solutions of a class of nonlinear degenerate elliptic
equations on bounded domains. We prove comparison principles and a priori
supremum bounds for the solutions. We also address the eigenvalue problem and,
in many instances, show the existence of a first eigenvalue and a first
positive eigenfunction.
