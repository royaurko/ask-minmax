We present a waveform relaxation version of the Dirichlet-Neumann and
Neumann-Neumann methods for parabolic problems. Like the Dirichlet-Neumann
method for steady problems, the method is based on a non-overlapping spatial
domain decomposition, and the iteration involves subdomain solves with
Dirichlet boundary conditions followed by subdomain solves with Neumann
boundary conditions. For the Neumann-Neumann method, one step of the method
consists of solving the subdomain problems using Dirichlet interface
conditions, followed by a correction step involving Neumann interface
conditions. However, each subdomain problem is now in space and time, and the
interface conditions are also time-dependent. Using Laplace transforms, we show
for the heat equation that when we consider finite time intervals, the
Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Neumann methods converge superlinearly for an
optimal choice of the relaxation parameter, similar to the case of Schwarz
waveform relaxation algorithms. The convergence rate depends on the size of the
subdomains as well as the length of the time window. For any other choice of
the relaxation parameter, convergence is only linear. We illustrate our results
with numerical experiments.
