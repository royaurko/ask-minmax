Let G be a graph on n vertices in which every induced subgraph on s=\log^3 n
vertices has an independent set of size at least t=\log n. What is the largest
q=q(n) so that every such G must contain an independent set of size at least q
? This is one of several related questions raised by Erdos and Hajnal. We show
that q(n)=\Theta(\log^2 n/\log \log n), investigate the more general problem
obtained by changing the parameters s and t, and discuss the connection to a
related Ramsey-type problem.
