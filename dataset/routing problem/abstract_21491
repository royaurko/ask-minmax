We prove global well-posedness for the Cauchy problem associated with the
Kadomotsev-Petviashvili-Burgers equation (KPBII) in $\mathbb R^2$ when the
initial value belongs to the anisotropic Sobolev space $H^{s_1,s_2}(\mathbb
R^2)$ for all $s_1>-\frac12$ and $s_2\geq0$. On the other hand, we prove in
some sense that our result is sharp.
