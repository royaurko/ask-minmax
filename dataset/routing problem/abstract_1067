We describe an architecture and investigate the characteristics of
distributed searching in federated digital libraries. We introduce the notion
of a query mediator as a digital library service responsible for selecting
among available search engines, routing queries to those search engines, and
aggregating results. We examine operational data from the NCSTRL distributed
digital library that reveals a number of characteristics of distributed
resource discovery. These include availability and response time of indexers
and the distinction between the query mediator view of these characteristics
and the indexer view.
