Non-Euclidean method of the generalized geometry construction is considered.
According to this approach any generalized geometry is obtained as a result of
deformation of the proper Euclidean geometry. The method may be applied for
construction of space-time geometries. Uniform isotropic space-time geometry
other, than that of Minkowski, is considered as an example. The problem of the
geometrical objects existence and their temporal evolution may be considered in
the constructed space-time geometry. Such a statement of the problem is
impossible in the framework of the Riemannian space-time geometry. Existence
and dynamics of microparticles is considered to be conditioned by existence of
corresponding geometrical objects and their temporal evolution in the
space-time. Geometrization of the particle mass and its momentum is produced.
