We continue the study of the operator of generalized Maxwell equations and
completely discover the behavior of the solutions of the time-harmonic
equations as the frequency tends to zero. Thereby, we identify degenerate
operators in terms of special 'polynomially growing' solutions of a
corresponding static problem, which must be added to the 'usual' Neumann series
in order to describe the low frequency asymptotic adequately.
