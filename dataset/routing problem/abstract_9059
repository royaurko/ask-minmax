We provide a solution to the isomorphism problem for torsion-free relatively
hyperbolic groups with abelian parabolics. As special cases we recover
solutions to the isomorphism problem for: (i) torsion-free hyperbolic groups
(Sela); and (ii) fully residually free groups (Bumagin, Kharlampovich and
Miasnikov).
  We also give a solution to the homeomorphism problem for finite volume
hyperbolic n-manifolds, for $n \ge 3$.
  In the course of the proof of the main result, we prove that a particular JSJ
decomposition of a freely indecomposable torsion-free relatively hyperbolic
group with abelian parabolics is algorithmically constructible.
