3-SAT problem is of great importance to many technical and scientific
applications. This paper presents a new hybrid evolutionary algorithm for
solving this satisfiability problem. 3-SAT problem has the huge search space
and hence it is known as a NP-hard problem. So, deterministic approaches are
not applicable in this context. Thereof, application of evolutionary processing
approaches and especially PSO will be very effective for solving these kinds of
problems. In this paper, we introduce a new evolutionary optimization technique
based on PSO, Memetic algorithm and local search approaches. When some
heuristics are mixed, their advantages are collected as well and we can reach
to the better outcomes. Finally, we test our proposed algorithm over some
benchmarks used by some another available algorithms. Obtained results show
that our new method leads to the suitable results by the appropriate time.
Thereby, it achieves a better result in compared with the existent approaches
such as pure genetic algorithm and some verified types
