Balsara (2001) showed the importance of divergence-free reconstruction in
adaptive mesh refinement problems for magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and the
importance of the same for designing robust second order schemes for MHD was
shown in Balsara (2004). In this paper we show that the reconstruction of
divergence-free vector fields can be carried out with better than second order
accuracy. As a result, we design divergence-free RKDG and hybrid RKDG+HWENO
schemes for MHD that have accuracies that are better than second order.
Accuracy analysis is carried out and it is shown that the schemes meet their
design accuracy for smooth problems. Stringent one-dimensional tests are also
presented showing that the schemes perform well on those tests.
