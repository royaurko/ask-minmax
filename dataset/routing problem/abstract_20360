Some nonlinear aspects of a cluster phenomenon in nuclei are considered using
of cubic Nonlinear Schroedinger Equation and Korteveg de Vries Equation. We
discuss the following possible nonlinear effects: i) the decribing clusters as
solitons; ii) an anomalous large angle scattering of $\alpha$-particles by
light and intermediate nuclei; iii) stable vortical objects; iv) and dynamical
clusterization in the presence of instability.
