The LHC inverse problem refers to the difficulties in determining the
parameters of an underlying theory from data (to be) taken by the LHC
experiments: if they find signals of new physics, and an underlying theory is
assumed, could its parameters be determined uniquely, or do different parameter
choices give indistinguishable experimental signatures? This inverse problem
was studied before for a supersymmetric Standard Model with 15 free parameters.
This earlier study found 283 indistinguishable pairs of parameter choices,
called degenerate pairs, even if backgrounds are ignored. We can resolve all
but 23 of those pairs by constructing a true \chi^2 distribution using mostly
counting observables. The elimination of systematic errors would even allow
separating the residual degeneracies. Taking the Standard Model background into
account we still can resolve 237 of the 283 "degenerate" pairs. This indicates
that (some of) our observables should also be useful for the purpose of
determining the values of SUSY parameters.
