This note highlights a special class of mean field games in which the
coefficients satisfy a convolution-type structural condition. A mean field game
of this type with common noise is related to a certain mean field game without
common noise by a simple transformation, which permits a tractable construction
of a solution of the problem with common noise from a solution of the problem
without.
