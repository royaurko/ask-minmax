The suggestive idea of "cloaking" an electromagnetic sensor, i.e., strongly
reducing its visibility (scattering) while maintaining its field-sensing
(absorption) capabilities, has recently been proposed in the literature, based
on scattering-cancellation, Fano-resonance, or transformation-optics
approaches. In this paper, we explore an alternative,
transformation-optics-based route, which relies on the recently-introduced
concept of "anti-cloaking." More specifically, our proposed approach relies on
a suitable tailoring of the competing cloaking and anti-cloaking mechanisms,
interacting in a two-dimensional cylindrical scenario. Via analytical and
parametric studies, we illustrate the underlying phenomenology, identify the
critical design parameters, and address the relevant optimality and tradeoff
issues, taking also into account the effect of material losses. Our results
confirm the envisaged potentials of the proposed transformation-optics approach
as an attractive alternative route to sensor cloaking.
