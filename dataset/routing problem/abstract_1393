We survey the status of some decision problems for 3-manifolds and their
fundamental groups. This includes the classical decision problems for finitely
presented groups (Word Problem, Conjugacy Problem, Isomorphism Problem), and
also the Homeomorphism Problem for 3-manifolds and the Membership Problem for
3-manifold groups.
