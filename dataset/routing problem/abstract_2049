All carbon electronics based on graphene has been an elusive goal. For more
than a decade, the inability to produce significant band-gaps in this material
has prevented the development of semiconducting graphene. While chemical
functionalization was thought to be a route to semiconducting graphene,
disorder in the chemical adsorbates, leading to low mobilities, have proved to
be a hurdle in its production. We demonstrate a new approach to produce
semiconducting graphene that uses a small concentration of covalently bonded
surface nitrogen, not as a means to functionalize graphene, but instead as a
way to constrain and bend graphene. We demonstrate that a submonolayer
concentration of nitrogen on SiC is sufficient to pin epitaxial graphene to the
SiC interface as it grows, causing the graphene to buckle. The resulting
3-dimensional modulation of the graphene opens a band-gap greater than 0.7eV in
the otherwise continuous metallic graphene sheet.
