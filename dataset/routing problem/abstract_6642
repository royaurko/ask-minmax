We report a new analytical method for solution of a wide class of
second-order differential equations with eigenvalues replaced by arbitrary
functions. Such classes of problems occur frequently in Quantum Mechanics and
Optics. This approach is based on the extension of the previously reported
differential transfer matrix method with modified basis functions. Applications
of the method to boundary value and initial value problems, as well as several
examples are illustrated.
