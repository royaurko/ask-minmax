We consider the problem of a sphere rolling of a curved surface and solve it
by mapping it to the precession of a spin 1/2 in a magnetic field of variable
magnitude and direction. The mapping can be of pedagogical use in discussing
both rolling and spin precession, and in particular in understanding the
emergence of geometrical phases in classical problems.
