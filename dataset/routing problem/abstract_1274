We present the integrated imaging of cold molecules in a microchip
environment. The on-chip de- tection is based on REMPI, which is
quantum-state-selective and generally applicable. We demon- strate and
characterize time-resolved spatial imaging and subsequently use it to analyze
the effect of a phase-space manipulation sequence aimed at compressing the
velocity distribution of a molec- ular ensemble with a view to future
high-resolution spectroscopic studies. The realization of such on-chip
measurements adds the final fundamental component to the molecule chip,
offering a new and promising route for investigating cold molecules.
