In this paper, we consider the problem of testing the mean vector in the high
dimensional settings. We proposed a new robust scalar transform invariant test
based on spatial sign. The proposed test statistic is asymptotically normal
under elliptical distributions. Simulation studies show that our test is very
robust and efficient in a wide range of distributions.
