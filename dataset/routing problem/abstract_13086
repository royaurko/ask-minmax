In the present work we solve the many-fermion problem in dimensions greater
than one by identifying its normal modes. We start by decomposing the Fermi sea
into independent sectors labeled by a wavevector q. The product of exactly
calculable eigenstates, one from each sector, is an exact eigenstate of the
full many-body problem. We examine bosonization of fermions, exchange and
pairing forces and quasiparticles, all from this point of view.
