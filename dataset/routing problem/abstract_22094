We study random walks on the semi-direct product of F_p^d and SL_d(F_p). We
estimate the spectral gap in terms of the spectral gap of the projection to the
linear part SL_d(F_p). This problem is motivated by an analogue in the isometry
group of Euclidean space, which have application to smoothness of self-similar
measures.
