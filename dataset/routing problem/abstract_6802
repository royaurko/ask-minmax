We give an exposition of recent results on regularity and Fredholm properties
for first-order one-dimensional hyperbolic PDEs. We show that large classes of
boundary operators cause an effect that smoothness increases with time. This
property is the key in finding regularizers (parametrices) for hyperbolic
problems. We construct regularizers for periodic problems for dissipative
first-order linear hyperbolic PDEs and show that these problems are modeled by
Fredholm operators of index zero.
