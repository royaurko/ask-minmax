The problem of a fermion subject to a general scalar potential in a
two-dimensional world for nonzero eigenenergies is mapped into a
Sturm-Liouville problem for the upper component of the Dirac spinor. In the
specific circumstance of an exponential potential, we have an effective Morse
potential which reveals itself as an essentially relativistic problem. Exact
bound solutions are found in closed form for this problem. The behaviour of the
upper and lower components of the Dirac spinor is discussed in detail,
particularly the existence of zero modes.
