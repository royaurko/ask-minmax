In this paper we discuss the central configurations of the Trapezoidal
four-body Problem. We consider four point masses on the vertices of an
isosceles trapezoid with two equal masses $m_1=m_4$ at positions $(\mp 0.5,
r_B)$ and $m_2=m_3$ at positions $(\mp \alpha/2, r_A)$. We derive, both
analytically and numerically, regions of central configurations in the phase
space where it is possible to choose positive masses. It is also shown that in
the compliment of these regions no central configurations are possible.
