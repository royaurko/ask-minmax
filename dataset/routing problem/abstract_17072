After incorporating the f(R) gravity into the general braneworld sum rules
scope, it is shown that some particular class of warped five dimensional
nonlinear braneworld models, which may be interesting for the hierarchy problem
solution, still require a negative tension brane. For other classes of warp
factors (suitable and not suitable for approaching the hierarchy problem) it is
not necessary any negative brane tension in the compactification scheme. In
this vein, it is argued that in the bulk f(R) gravity context, some types of
warp factors may be useful for approaching the hierarchy problem and for
evading the necessity of a negative brane tension in the compactification
scheme.
