We consider the class of graphs having linear rank-width one, also known as
thread graphs, and investigate a related graph modification problem called the
Thread Vertex Deletion. In this problem, given an $n$ vertex graph $G$ and a
positive integer $k$, we want to decide whether there is a set of at most $k$
vertices whose removal turns $G$ into a thread graph and if one exists, find
such a vertex set. While the meta-theorem of Courcelle, Makowsky, Rotics
implies that Thread Vertex Deletion can be computed in time $f(k)\cdot n^3$, it
is not clear whether this problem allows a runtime with a modest exponential
function. We establish that Thread Vertex Deletion can be solved in time
$8^k\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The major obstacle to this end is how to handle
a long induced cycle as an obstruction. To fix this issue, we define a graph
class called the necklace graphs and investigate its structural properties. We
also show that the Thread Vertex Deletion has a polynomial kernel.
