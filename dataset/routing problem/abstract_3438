This paper is the continuation of the work "On an inverse problem for
finite-difference operators of second order". We consider the Cauchy problem
for the Toda lattice in the case when the corresponding L-operator is a Jacobi
matrix with bounded elements, whose spectrum of multipliciy 2 is separated from
its simple spectrum and contains an interval of asolutely continuous spectrum.
Using the integral equation of the inverse problem for this matrix, obtained in
the previous work, we solve the Cauchy problem for the Toda lattice with
non-stabilized initial data.
