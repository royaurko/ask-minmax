We consider algorithms and recovery guarantees for the analysis sparse model
in which the signal is sparse with respect to a highly coherent frame. We
consider the use of a monotone version of the fast iterative shrinkage-
thresholding algorithm (MFISTA) to solve the analysis sparse recovery problem.
Since the proximal operator in MFISTA does not have a closed-form solution for
the analysis model, it cannot be applied directly. Instead, we examine two
alternatives based on smoothing and decomposition transformations that relax
the original sparse recovery problem, and then implement MFISTA on the relaxed
formulation. We refer to these two methods as smoothing-based and
decomposition-based MFISTA. We analyze the convergence of both algorithms, and
establish that smoothing- based MFISTA converges more rapidly when applied to
general nonsmooth optimization problems. We then derive a performance bound on
the reconstruction error using these techniques. The bound proves that our
methods can recover a signal sparse in a redundant tight frame when the
measurement matrix satisfies a properly adapted restricted isometry property.
Numerical examples demonstrate the performance of our methods and show that
smoothing-based MFISTA converges faster than the decomposition-based
alternative in real applications, such as MRI image reconstruction.
