This paper is devoted to the numerical approximation of a degenerate
anisotropic elliptic problem. The numerical method is designed for arbitrary
space-dependent anisotropy directions and does not require any specially
adapted coordinate system. It is also designed to be equally accurate in the
strongly and the mildly anisotropic cases. The method is applied to the
Euler-Lorentz system, in the drift-fluid limit. This system provides a model
for magnetized plasmas.
