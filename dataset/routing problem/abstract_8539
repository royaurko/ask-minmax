In this paper, we consider the problem of distinguishing the noisy codewords
of a known binary linear block code from a random bit sequence. We propose to
use the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) to solve this problem. We also
give a formula to find approximate number of codewords required and compare our
results with an existing method.
