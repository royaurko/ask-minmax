We provide a full derivation of Laughlin's Jastrow-type wave functions for
quantized Hall states subject to periodic boundary conditions using an operator
formalism. The construction includes the quasi-hole and the technically more
challenging quasi-electron excitation, which was left as an open problem in the
classic paper by Haldane and Rezayi [Phys. Rev. B 31, 2529 (1985)].
