The problem of secure lossy source-channel wiretapping with arbitrarily
correlated side informations at both receivers is investigated. This scenario
consists of an encoder (referred to as Alice) that wishes to compress a source
and send it through a noisy channel to a legitimate receiver (referred to as
Bob). In this context, Alice must simultaneously satisfy the desired
requirements on the distortion level at Bob, and the equivocation rate at the
eavesdropper (referred to as Eve). This setting can be seen as a generalization
of the conventional problems of secure source coding with side information at
the decoders, and the wiretap channel. Inner and outer bounds on the
rate-distortion-equivocation region for the case of arbitrary channels and side
informations are derived. In some special cases of interest, it is shown that
separation holds. By means of an appropriate coding, the presence of any
statistical difference among the side informations, the channel noises, and the
distortion at Bob can be fully exploited in terms of secrecy.
