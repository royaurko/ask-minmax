This paper analyzes the vanishing pressure limit of solutions to the
Aw-Rascle model and the perturbed Aw-Rascle model for modified Chaplygin gas.
Firstly, the Riemann problem of the Aw-Rascle model is solved constructively. A
special delta shock wave in the limit of Riemann solutions is obtained.
Secondly, the Riemann problem of the perturbed Aw-Rascle model is solved
analytically. It is proved that, as the pressure tends to zero, any Riemann
solution containing two shock wave tends to a delta shock solution to the
transport equations; any Riemann solution containing two rarefaction wave tends
to a two-contact-discontinuity solution to the transport equations and the
nonvacuum intermediate state in between tends to a vacuum state.
