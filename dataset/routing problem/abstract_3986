We study the boundary value problem with Radon measures for nonnegative
solutions of $-\Delta u+Vu=0$ in a bounded smooth domain $\Gw$, when $V$ is a
locally bounded nonnegative function. Introducing some specific capacity, we
give sufficient conditions on a Radon measure $\gm$ on $\prt\Gw$ so that the
problem can be solved. We study the reduced measure associated to this equation
as well as the boundary trace of positive solutions.
