We consider the non-crossing connectors problem, which is stated as follows:
Given n simply connected regions R_1,...,R_n in the plane and finite point sets
P_i subset of R_i for i=1,...,n, are there non-crossing connectors y_i for
(R_i,P_i), i.e., arc-connected sets y_i with P_i subset of y_i subset of R_i
for every i=1,...,n, such that y_i and y_j are disjoint for all i different
from j?
  We prove that non-crossing connectors do always exist if the regions form a
collection of pseudo-disks, i.e., the boundaries of every pair of regions
intersect at most twice. We provide a simple polynomial-time algorithm if the
regions are axis-aligned rectangles. Finally we prove that the general problem
is NP-complete, even if the regions are convex, the boundaries of every pair of
regions intersect at most four times and P_i consists of only two points on the
boundary of R_i for i=1,...,n.
