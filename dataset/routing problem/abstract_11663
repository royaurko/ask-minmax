A problem of Banach asks whether every infinite-dimensional Banach space
which is isomorphic to all its infinite-dimensional subspaces must be
isomorphic to a separable Hilbert space. In this paper we prove a result of a
Ramsey-theoretic nature which implies an interesting dichotomy for subspaces of
Banach spaces. Combined with a result of Komorowski and Tomczak-Jaegermann,
this gives a positive answer to Banach's problem. We then generalize the
Ramsey-theoretic result and deduce a further dichotomy for Banach spaces with
an unconditional basis.
