We consider the problem of communicating over the general discrete memoryless
broadcast channel (BC) with partially cooperating receivers. In our setup,
receivers are able to exchange messages over noiseless conference links of
finite capacities, prior to decoding the messages sent from the transmitter. In
this paper we formulate the general problem of broadcast with cooperation. We
first find the capacity region for the case where the BC is physically
degraded. Then, we give achievability results for the general broadcast
channel, for both the two independent messages case and the single common
message case.
