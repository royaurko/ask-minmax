We analyse the spectral bounds of nonoverlapping domain decomposition
preconditioners for $hp$-version discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods
in $H^2$-type norms, which arise in applications to fully nonlinear
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equations. We show that for a
symmetric model problem, the condition number of the preconditioned system is
at most of order $1+ p^6 H^3 /q^3 h^3$, where $H$ and $h$ are respectively the
coarse and fine mesh sizes, and $q$ and $p$ are respectively the coarse and
fine mesh polynomial degrees. This represents the first result for this class
of methods that explicitly accounts for the dependence of the condition number
on $q$, and its sharpness is shown numerically. The key analytical tool is an
original optimal order approximation result between fine and coarse
discontinuous finite element spaces. We then go beyond the model problem and
show computationally that these methods lead to efficient and competitive
solvers in practical applications to nonsymmetric, fully nonlinear
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations.
