The Sylvester smallest enclosing circle problem involves finding the smallest
circle that encloses a finite number of points in the plane. We consider
generalized versions of the Sylvester problem in which the points are replaced
by sets. Based on the log-exponential smoothing technique and Nesterov's
accelerated gradient method, we present an effective numerical algorithm for
solving these problems.
