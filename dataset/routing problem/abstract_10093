In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for studying various cloud
traffic management problems, ranging from geographical load balancing to
backbone traffic engineering. We first abstract these real-world problems as a
multi-facility resource allocation problem, and then develop two distributed
optimization algorithms by exploiting the special structure of the problem. Our
algorithms are inspired by Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM),
enjoying a number of unique features. Compared to dual decomposition, they
converge with non-strictly convex objective functions; compared to other
ADMM-type algorithms, they not only achieve faster convergence under weaker
assumptions, but also have lower computational complexity and lower
message-passing overhead. The simulation results not only confirm these
desirable features of our algorithms, but also highlight several additional
advantages, such as scalability and fault-tolerance.
