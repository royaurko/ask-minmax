Mobile ad-hoc networks(MANET) is the collection of mobile nodes which are
self organizing and are connected by wireless links where nodes which are not
in the direct range communicate with each other relying on the intermediate
nodes. As a result of trusting other nodes in the route, a malicious node can
easily compromise the security of the network. A black-hole node is the
malicious node which drops the entire packet coming to it and always shows the
fresh route to the destination, even if the route to destination doesn't exist.
This paper describes a scheme that will detect the intrusion in the network in
the presence of black-hole node and its performance is compared with the
previous technique. This novel technique helps to increase the network
performance by reducing the overhead in the network.
