Structure of real networked systems, such as social relationship, can be
modeled as temporal networks in which each edge appears only at the prescribed
time. Understanding the structure of temporal networks requires quantifying the
importance of a temporal vertex, which is a pair of vertex index and time. In
this paper, we define two centrality measures of a temporal vertex by the
proportion of (normal) vertex pairs, the quickest routes between which can (or
should) use the temporal vertex. The definition is free from parameters and
robust against the change in time scale on which we focus. In addition, we can
efficiently compute these centrality values for all temporal vertices. Using
the two centrality measures, we reveal that distributions of these centrality
values of real-world temporal networks are heterogeneous. For various datasets,
we also demonstrate that a majority of the highly central temporal vertices are
located within a narrow time window around a particular time. In other words,
there is a bottleneck time at which most information sent in the temporal
network passes through a small number of temporal vertices, which suggests an
important role of these temporal vertices in spreading phenomena.
