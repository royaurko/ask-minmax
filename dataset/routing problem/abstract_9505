In this paper we study a Tikhonov-type method for ill-posed nonlinear
operator equations $\gdag = F(\udag)$ where $\gdag$ is an integrable,
non-negative function. We assume that data are drawn from a Poisson process
with density $t\gdag$ where $t>0$ may be interpreted as an exposure time. Such
problems occur in many photonic imaging applications including positron
emission tomography, confocal fluorescence microscopy, astronomic observations,
and phase retrieval problems in optics. Our approach uses a
Kullback-Leibler-type data fidelity functional and allows for general convex
penalty terms. We prove convergence rates of the expectation of the
reconstruction error under a variational source condition as $t\to\infty$ both
for an a priori and for a Lepski{\u\i}-type parameter choice rule.
