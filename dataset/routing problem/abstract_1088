Two cases of a phenomenological model for ferromagnetism are considered,
discrete and continuous. And the relationship, in general, between discrete and
continuous models explored. In a similar way to the logistic map behavior, the
continuous case is exactly solvable while the discrete one contains the
bifurcation route to chaos. Through the ferromagnetic interpretation I comment
on the relevance of this to understanding evolution of systems in time, the
role of the configuration space in chaotic behavior, and how this understanding
may lead to new exotic magnetic phenomena.
