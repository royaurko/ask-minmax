A generalization of the regular continued fractions was given by Chakraborty
and Rao \cite{CR-2003}. For the transformation which generates this expansion
and its invariant measure, the Perron-Frobenius operator is given and studied.
For this expansion, we apply the method of Rockett and Sz\"usz \cite{RS-1992}
and obtained the solution of its Gauss-Kuzmin-type problem.
