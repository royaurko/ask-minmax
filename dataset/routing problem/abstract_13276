The restricted planar three-body problem has a rich history, yet many
unanswered questions still remain. In the present paper we prove the existence
of a global surface of section near the smaller body in a new range of energies
and mass ratios for which the Hill's region still has three connected
components. The approach relies on recent global methods in symplectic geometry
and contrasts sharply with the perturbative methods used until now.
