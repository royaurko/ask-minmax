We study the dynamics of the standard model Higgs field in the inflationary
cosmology. Since metastability of our vacuum is indicated by the current
experimental data of the Higgs boson and top quark, inflation models with a
large Hubble parameter may have a problem: In such models, the Higgs field
rolls down towards the unwanted true vacuum due to the large fluctuation in the
inflationary background. However, this problem can be relaxed by supposing an
additional mass term for the Higgs field generated during and after inflation.
We point out that it does not have to be larger than the Hubble parameter if
the number of $e$-folds during inflation is not too large. We demonstrate that
a high reheating temperature is favored in such a relatively small mass case
and it can be checked by future gravitational wave observations. Such an
induced mass can be generated by, {\it e.g.,} a direct coupling to the inflaton
field or nonminimal coupling to gravity.
