Compact remnants on orbits with peri-apses close to the Schwarzschild radius
of a massive black hole (MBH) lose orbital energy by emitting gravitational
waves (GWs) and spiral in. Scattering with other stars allows successful
inspiral of such extreme mass ratio inspiral sources (EMRIs) only within small
distances, a < few \times 0.01 pc from the MBH. The event rate of EMRIs is
therefore dominated by the stellar dynamics and content in the inner few \times
0.01 pc. I discuss the relevant dynamical aspects and resulting estimated event
rates of EMRIs. Subjects considered include the loss-cone treatment of inspiral
sources; mass segregation; resonant relaxation; and alternative routes to EMRI
formation such as tidal binary disruptions, stellar formation in disks and
tidal capture of massive main sequence stars. The EMRI event rate is estimated
to be of order few \times 10^2/Gyr per MBH, giving excellent prospects for
observation by LISA.
