Assuming that the observed deficit of solar neutrinos is due to the
interaction of their transition magnetic moment with the solar magnetic field
we derive the predictions for the forthcoming Borexino experiment. Three
different model magnetic field profiles which give very good global fits of the
currently available solar neutrino data are used. The expected signal at
Borexino is significantly lower than those predicted by the LMA, LOW and VO
neutrino oscillation solutions of the solar neutrino problem. It is similar to
that of the SMA oscillation solution which, however, is strongly disfavoured by
the Super-Kamiokande data on day and night spectra and zenith angle
distribution of the events. Thus, the neutrino magnetic moment solution of the
solar neutrino problem can be unambiguously distinguished from the currently
favoured oscillation solutions at Borexino.
