The problem for consistency between linear transports along paths and real
bundle metrics in real vector bundles is stated. Necessary and/or sufficient
conditions, as well as conditions for existence, for such consistency are
derived. All metrics (resp. transports) consistent with a given transport
(resp. metric) are explicitly obtained. The special case of linear transports,
generated by derivations of tensor algebras, of vectors is considered.
Analogous problems are investigated in complex vector bundles endowed with
Hermitian metrics.
