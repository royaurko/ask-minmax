In this paper, we present a convergence rate analysis for the inexact
Krasnosel'skii-Mann iteration built from nonexpansive operators. Our results
include two main parts: we first establish global pointwise and ergodic
iteration-complexity bounds, and then, under a metric subregularity assumption,
we establish local linear convergence for the distance of the iterates to the
set of fixed points. The obtained iteration-complexity result can be applied to
analyze the convergence rate of various monotone operator splitting methods in
the literature, including the Forward-Backward, the Generalized
Forward-Backward, Douglas-Rachford, ADMM and Primal-Dual splitting methods. For
these methods, we also develop easily verifiable termination criteria for
finding an approximate solution, which can be seen as a generalization of the
termination criterion for the classical gradient descent method. We finally
develop a parallel analysis for the non-stationary Krasnosel'skii-Mann
iteration. The usefulness of our results is illustrated by applying them to a
large class of structured monotone inclusion and convex optimization problems.
Experiments on some large scale inverse problems in signal and image processing
problems are shown.
