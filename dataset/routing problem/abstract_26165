Many matrices that arise in the solution of signal processing problems have a
special displacement structure. For example, adaptive filtering and
direction-of-arrival estimation yield matrices of Toeplitz type. A recent
method of Gohberg, Kailath and Olshevsky (GKO) allows fast Gaussian elimination
with partial pivoting for such structured matrices. In this paper, a rounding
error analysis is performed on the Cauchy and Toeplitz variants of the GKO
method. It is shown the error growth depends on the growth in certain auxiliary
vectors, the generators, which are computed by the GKO algorithms. It is also
shown that in certain circumstances, the growth in the generators can be large,
and so the error growth is much larger than would be encountered with normal
Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting. A modification of the algorithm to
perform a type of row-column pivoting is proposed; it may ameliorate this
problem.
