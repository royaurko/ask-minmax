The free-energy distribution function of an elastic string in a quenched
random potential, P(F), is investigated with the help of the
optimal-fluctuation approach. The form of the far-right tail of P(F) is found
by constructing the exact solution of the non-linear saddle-point equations
describing the asymptotic form of the optimal fluctuation. The solution of the
problem is obtained for two different types of boundary conditions and for an
arbitrary dimension of the imbeding space 1+d with d from the interval 0<d<2.
The results are also applicable for the description of the far-left tail of the
height distribution function in the stochastic growth problem described by the
d-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.
