Three explicit families of spacelike Zoll surface admitting a Killing field
are provided. It allows to prove the existence of spacelike Zoll surface not
smoothly conformal to a cover of de Sitter space as well as the existence of
Lorentzian M\"obius strips of non constant curvature all of whose spacelike
geodesics are closed. Further the conformality problem for spacelike Zoll
cylinders is studied.
