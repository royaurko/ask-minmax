In the paper, we establish a blow-up criterion in terms of the integrability
of the density for strong solutions to the Cauchy problem of compressible
isentropic Navier-Stokes equations in \mathbb{R}^3 with vacuum, under the
assumptions on the coefficients of viscosity: \frac{29\mu}{3}>\lambda. This
extends the corresponding results in [20, 36] where a blow-up criterion in
terms of the upper bound of the density was obtained under the condition
7\mu>\lambda. As a byproduct, the restriction 7\mu>\lambda in [12, 37] is
relaxed to \frac{29\mu}{3}>\lambda for the full compressible Navier-Stokes
equations by giving a new proof of Lemma 3.1. Besides, we get a blow-up
criterion in terms of the upper bound of the density and the temperature for
strong solutions to the Cauchy problem of the full compressible Navier-Stokes
equations in \mathbb{R}^3. The appearance of vacuum could be allowed. This
extends the corresponding results in [37] where a blow-up criterion in terms of
the upper bound of (\rho,\frac{1}{\rho}, \theta) was obtained without vacuum.
The effective viscous flux plays a very important role in the proofs.
