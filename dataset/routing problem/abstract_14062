The problem of nonlinear filtering has engendered a surprising number of
mathematical techniques for its treatment. A notable example is the
change-of--probability-measure method originally introduced by Kallianpur and
Striebel to derive the filtering equations and the Bayes-like formula that
bears their names. More recent work, however, has generally preferred other
methods. In this paper, we reconsider the change-of-measure approach to the
derivation of the filtering equations and show that many of the technical
conditions present in previous work can be relaxed. The filtering equations are
established for general Markov signal processes that can be described by a
martingale-problem formulation. Two specific applications are treated.
