The theoretical foundations of data hiding have been revealed by formulating
the problem as message communication over a noisy channel. We revisit the
problem in light of a more general characterization of the watermark channel
and of weighted distortion measures. Considering spread spectrum based
information hiding, we release the usual assumption of an i.i.d. cover signal.
The game-theoretic resolution of the problem reveals a generalized
characterization of optimum attacks. The paper then derives closed-form
expressions for the different parameters exhibiting a practical embedding and
extraction technique.
