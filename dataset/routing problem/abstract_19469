Current high-throughput data acquisition technologies probe dynamical systems
with different imaging modalities, generating massive data sets at different
spatial and temporal resolutions posing challenging problems in multimodal data
fusion. A case in point is the attempt to parse out the brain structures and
networks that underpin human cognitive processes by analysis of different
neuroimaging modalities (functional MRI, EEG, NIRS etc.). We emphasize that the
multimodal, multi-scale nature of neuroimaging data is well reflected by a
multi-way (tensor) structure where the underlying processes can be summarized
by a relatively small number of components or "atoms". We introduce
Markov-Penrose diagrams - an integration of Bayesian DAG and tensor network
notation in order to analyze these models. These diagrams not only clarify
matrix and tensor EEG and fMRI time/frequency analysis and inverse problems,
but also help understand multimodal fusion via Multiway Partial Least Squares
and Coupled Matrix-Tensor Factorization. We show here, for the first time, that
Granger causal analysis of brain networks is a tensor regression problem, thus
allowing the atomic decomposition of brain networks. Analysis of EEG and fMRI
recordings shows the potential of the methods and suggests their use in other
scientific domains.
