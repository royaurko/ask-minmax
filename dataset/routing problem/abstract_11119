The widely studied benchmark problem, 2-D driven cavity flow problem is
discussed in details in terms of physical and mathematical and also numerical
aspects. A very brief literature survey on studies on the driven cavity flow is
given. Based on the several numerical and experimental studies, the fact of the
matter is, above moderate Reynolds numbers physically the flow in a driven
cavity is not two-dimensional. However there exist numerical solutions for 2-D
driven cavity flow at high Reynolds numbers.
