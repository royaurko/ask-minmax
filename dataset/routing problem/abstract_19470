We study large deviations properties of the second--order hypoelliptic
multiscale Langevin equation. We study the homogenization regime and based on
an appropriately chosen parametrization of the mass parameter in terms of the
parameter that separates the scales we derive the related large deviations
principle and prove that it is consistent with the large deviations behavior of
its overdamped counterpart. In particular, we prove that the large deviation
rate function converges to the large deviations rate function of the first
order Langevin equation as the mass parameter tends to zero. To do so, we prove
convergence in mean square sense of the invariant measure that corresponds to
the hypoelliptic problem to that of the limiting elliptic problem as the mass
goes to zero and similarly of the corresponding PDE "cell problems" that appear
in the rate functions due to the homogenization effects. We rigorously obtain
an expansion of the solution in terms of the mass parameter, characterizing the
order of convergence. The proof of convergence of invariant measures is of
independent interest, as it involves an improvement of the hypocoercivity
result for the kinetic Fokker--Planck equation. In particular, we do not
restrict attention to potential drifts and we provide explicit information on
the dependence of the norms of interest with respect to the mass parameter.
