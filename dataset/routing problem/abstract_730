In Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN), a channel assignment has to balance the
objectives of maintaining connectivity and increasing the aggregate bandwidth.
The main aim of the channel assignment algorithm is to assign the channels to
the network interfaces, from the given expected load on each virtual link. From
the existing work done so far, we can examine that there is no combined
solution of multi-channel assignment with routing and congestion control. In
this paper, we propose a congestion control routing protocol along with
multi-channel assignment. We use a traffic aware metric in this protocol in
order to provide quality of service. The proposed protocol can improve the
throughput and channel utilization to very high extent because it provides
solution for multi-channel assignment and congestion control. The proposed
algorithm assigns the channels in a way that, congestion is avoided and
co-channel interference levels among links with same channel are reduced. By
our simulation results in NS2, we show that the proposed protocol attains high
throughput and channel utilization along with reduced latency.
