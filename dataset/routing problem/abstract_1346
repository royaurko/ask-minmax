We report an easy route single step synthesis of BiOCuS with and without Cu
deficiency. The title compound is synthesized via solid state reaction route by
encapsulation in an evacuated (10-3 Torr) quartz tube. Mixed components of the
ingredients in stoichiometric ratio (1/3Bi2O3 +0.34Bi +Cu1-x + S) are
pelletized, sealed in evacuated quartz tube and heat treated for 30 hours at
500 0C. Finally the sample is allowed to cool down to room temperature. The
resultant compound is black is color and could not hold in pellet form, but is
powdered. X-ray diffraction Reitveld analysis is carried out on all three
samples of series BiOCu1-xS with x = 0.0, 0.10 and 0.15. These samples
crystallize in single phase with space group P4/nmm and with cell parameters as
a = 3.868 A and c = 8.557 A for stoichiometric BiOCuS. The volume of the cell
slightly increases with an increase in Cu deficiency. The co-ordinate positions
are determined by fitting the observed XRD patterns of the studied samples.
