We theoretically examine plasmonic resonance between two close metallic
grains separated by a gap of width much less than the length of the incident
electromagnetic wave. Resonance conditions are established and the electric
field enhancement is found. Our general arguments are confirmed by analytic
solution of the problem for simplest geometries. We discuss an extension of our
results to more complex cases.
