The three-body problem is reexamined in the framework of general relativity.
The Newtonian three-body problem admits Euler's collinear solution, where three
bodies move around the common center of mass with the same orbital period and
always line up. The solution is unstable. Hence it is unlikely that such a
simple configuration would exist owing to general relativistic forces dependent
not only on the masses but also on the velocity of each body. However, we show
that the collinear solution remains true with a correction to the spatial
separation between masses. Relativistic corrections to the Sun-Jupiter Lagrange
points L1, L2 and L3 are also evaluated.
