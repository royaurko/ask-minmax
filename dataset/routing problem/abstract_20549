Geometric complexity theory (GCT) is an approach to the $P$ vs. $NP$ and
related problems through algebraic geometry and representation theory. This
article gives a high-level exposition of the basic plan of GCT based on the
principle, called the flip, without assuming any background in algebraic
geometry or representation theory.
