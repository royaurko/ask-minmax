Let $(M,g)$ be a $n-$dimensional compact Riemannian manifold without boundary
and $\Gamma$ be a non degenerate closed geodesic of $(M,g)$. We prove that the
supercritical problem $$-\Delta_gu+h u=u^{\frac{n+1}{n-3}\pm\epsilon},\ u>0,\
\hbox{in}\ (M,g)$$ has a solution that concentrates along $\Gamma$ as
$\epsilon$ goes to zero, provided the function $h$ and the sectional curvatures
along $\Gamma$ satisfy a suitable condition. A connection with the solution of
a class of periodic O.D.E.'s with singularity of attractive or repulsive type
is established.
