In this paper, we consider a dynamic linear system in state-space form where
the observation equation depends linearly on a set of parameters. We address
the problem of how to dynamically calculate these parameters in order to
minimize the mean-squared error (MSE) of the state estimate achieved by a
Kalman filter. We formulate and solve two kinds of problems under a quadratic
constraint on the observation parameters: minimizing the sum MSE (Min-Sum-MSE)
or minimizing the maximum MSE (Min-Max-MSE). In each case, the optimization
problem is divided into two sub-problems for which optimal solutions can be
found: a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem followed by a constrained
least-squares minimization. A more direct solution is shown to exist for the
special case of a scalar observation; in particular, the Min-Sum-MSE solution
can be found directly using a generalized eigendecomposition, and is optimally
solved utilizing Rayleigh quotient, and the Min-Max-MSE problem reduces to an
SDP feasibility test that can be solved via the bisection method.
