The Lonely Runner Conjecture is a number theory problem, dating to 1964.
Using dynamical systems theory, we show almost all sets of velocities solve the
conjecture. Furthermore, any "traditional" approach of Diophantine
approximation cannot solve the problem, and we offer a short list of
reformulations of the problem.
