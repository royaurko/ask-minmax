We solve the inverse problem from the spectral measure and the inverse
three-spectra problem for the class of singular Krein strings on a finite
interval with trace class resolvents. In particular, this includes a complete
description of all possible spectral measures and three (Dirichlet) spectra
associated with this class of Krein strings. The solutions of these inverse
problems are obtained by approximation with Stieltjes strings.
