Multiple carrier-frequency offsets (CFO) arise in a distributed antenna
system, where data are transmitted simultaneously from multiple antennas. In
such systems the received signal contains multiple CFOs due to mismatch between
the local oscillators of transmitters and receiver. This results in a
time-varying rotation of the data constellation, which needs to be compensated
for at the receiver before symbol recovery. This paper proposes a new approach
for blind CFO estimation and symbol recovery. The received base-band signal is
over-sampled, and its polyphase components are used to formulate a virtual
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) problem. By applying blind MIMO system
estimation techniques, the system response is estimated and used to
subsequently transform the multiple CFOs estimation problem into many
independent single CFO estimation problems. Furthermore, an initial estimate of
the CFO is obtained from the phase of the MIMO system response. The Cramer-Rao
Lower bound is also derived, and the large sample performance of the proposed
estimator is compared to the bound.
