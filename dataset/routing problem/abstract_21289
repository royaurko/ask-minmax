We consider (small) algebraic deformations of germs of real-algebraic CR
submanifolds in complex space and study the biholomorphic equivalence problem
for such deformations. We show that two algebraic deformations of minimal
holomorphically nondegenerate real-algebraic CR submanifolds are
holomorphically equivalent if and only if they are algebraically equivalent.
