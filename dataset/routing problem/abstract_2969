We extend the famous diophantine Frobenius problem to the case of polynomials
over a field $k$. Similar to the classical problem, we show that the $n=2$ case
of the Frobenius problem for polynomials is easy to solve. In addition, we
translate a few results from the Frobenius problem over $\mathbb{Z}$ to $k[t]$
and give an algorithm to solve the Frobenius problem for polynomials over a
field $k$ of sufficiently large size.
