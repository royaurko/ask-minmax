Reachability and LTL model-checking problems for flat counter systems are
known to be decidable but whereas the reachability problem can be shown in NP,
the best known complexity upper bound for the latter problem is made of a tower
of several exponentials. Herein, we show that the problem is only NP-complete
even if LTL admits past-time operators and arithmetical constraints on
counters. Actually, the NP upper bound is shown by adequately combining a new
stuttering theorem for Past LTL and the property of small integer solutions for
quantifier-free Presburger formulae. Other complexity results are proved, for
instance for restricted classes of flat counter systems.
