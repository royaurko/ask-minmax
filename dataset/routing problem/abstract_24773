Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a probabilistic nonparametric representation
of functions in regression, classification, and other problems. Unfortunately,
exact learning with GPs is intractable for large datasets. A variety of
approximate GP methods have been proposed that essentially map the large
dataset into a small set of basis points. The most advanced of these, the
variable-sigma GP (VSGP) (Walder et al., 2008), allows each basis point to have
its own length scale. However, VSGP was only derived for regression. We
describe how VSGP can be applied to classification and other problems, by
deriving it as an expectation propagation algorithm. In this view, sparse GP
approximations correspond to a KL-projection of the true posterior onto a
compact exponential family of GPs. VSGP constitutes one such family, and we
show how to enlarge this family to get additional accuracy. In particular, we
show that endowing each basis point with its own full covariance matrix
provides a significant increase in approximation power.
