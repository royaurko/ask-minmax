This paper studies exact linearization methods for stochastic SISO affine
controlled dynamical systems. The systems are defined as vectorfield triplets
in Euclidean space. The goal is to find, for a given nonlinear stochastic
system, a combination of invertible transformations which transform the system
into a controllable linear form. Of course, for most nonlinear systems such
transformation does not exist.
  We are focused on linearization by state coordinate transformation combined
with feedback. The difference between Ito and Stratonovich systems is
emphasized. Moreover, we define three types of linearity of stochastic systems
-- g-linearity, sigma-linearity, and g sigma-linearity.
  Six variants of the stochastic exact linearization problem are studied. The
most useful problem -- the Ito-g sigma linearization is solved using the
correcting term, which proved to be a very useful tool for Ito systems. The
results are illustrated on a numerical example solved with help of symbolic
algebra.
