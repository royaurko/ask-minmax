This paper presents mathematical framework and study of proactive routing
Protocols. The performance analysis of three major proactive routing protocols:
Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV), Fish-eye State Routing (FSR) and
Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) are under consideration in this work.
Taking these routing protocols into account, we enhance existing framework. In
the next step we further discuss and produce analytical framework by
considering variations in different network and protocol parameters. Finally,
experiments are performed regarding above mentioned routing protocols followed
with detailed comparison and analysis of different environments.
