In this paper, optimal linear transceiver designs for multi-hop
amplify-and-forward (AF) Multiple-input Multiple-out (MIMO) relaying systems
with Gaussian distributed channel estimation errors are investigated. Some
commonly used transceiver design criteria are unified into a single
matrix-variate optimization problem. With novel applications of majorization
theory and properties of matrix-variate function, the optimal structure of
robust transceiver is first derived. Based on the optimal structure, the
original transceiver design problems are reduced to much simpler problems with
only scalar variables whose solutions are readily obtained by iterative
water-filling algorithms. The performance advantages of the proposed robust
designs are demonstrated by the simulation results.
