Recently proposed by Battistel et al. "predictive formulation of the NJL
model" is discussed and its connection with the differential regularization is
noted. The principal problem of this formulation is a non-physical singularity
(Landau pole) in meson propagators. A modification of the formulation, which is
free of the Landau pole and conserves main features of the approach, is
proposed.
