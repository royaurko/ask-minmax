We investigate the pitch sensitivity of cholesteric phases of helicoidal
patchy cylinders as a generic model for chiral (bio-)polymers and helix-shaped
colloidal rods. The behaviour of the macroscopic cholesteric pitch is studied
from microscopic principles by invoking a simple density functional theory
generalised to accommodate weakly twisted director fields. Upon changing the
degree of alignment along the local helicoidal director we find that
cholesteric phases exhibit a sudden sense inversion whereby the cholesteric
phase changes from left- to right-handed and vice versa. Since the local
alignment is governed by thermodynamic variables such as density, temperature
or the amplitude of an external directional field such pitch sense inversions
can be expected in systems of helical mesogens of both thermotropic and
lyotropic origin. We show that the spontaneous change of helical symmetry is a
direct consequence of an antagonistic effective torque between helical
particles with a certain prescribed internal helicity. The results may help
opening up new routes towards precise control of the helical handedness of
chiral assemblies by a judicious choice of external control parameters.
