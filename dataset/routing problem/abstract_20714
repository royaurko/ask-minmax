This paper studies regularity property of the value function for an
infinite-horizon discounted cost impulse control problem, where the underlying
controlled process is a multidimensional jump diffusion with possibly
`infinite-activity' jumps. Surprisingly, despite these jumps, we obtain the
same degree of regularity as for the diffusion case, at least when the jump
satisfies certain integrability conditions.
