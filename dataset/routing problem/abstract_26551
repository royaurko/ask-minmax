Preservation of the maximum principle is studied for the combination of the
linear finite element method in space and the $\theta$-method in time for
solving time dependent anisotropic diffusion problems. It is shown that the
numerical solution satisfies a discrete maximum principle when all element
angles of the mesh measured in the metric specified by the inverse of the
diffusion matrix are non-obtuse and the time step size is bounded below and
above by bounds proportional essentially to the square of the maximal element
diameter. The lower bound requirement can be removed when a lumped mass matrix
is used. In two dimensions, the mesh and time step conditions can be replaced
by weaker Delaunay-type conditions. Numerical results are presented to verify
the theoretical findings.
