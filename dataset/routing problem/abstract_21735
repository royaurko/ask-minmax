The problem of computing the pulse profiles from thermally emitting spots on
the surface of a neutron star in general relativity is reconsidered. We show
that it is possible to extend Beloborodov (2002) approach to include (multiple)
spots of finite size in different positions on the star surface. Results for
the pulse profiles are expressed by comparatively simple analytical formulas
which involve only elementary functions.
