In order to meet usability requirements, most logic-based applications
provide explanation facilities for reasoning services. This holds also for
Description Logics, where research has focused on the explanation of both TBox
reasoning and, more recently, query answering. Besides explaining the presence
of a tuple in a query answer, it is important to explain also why a given tuple
is missing. We address the latter problem for instance and conjunctive query
answering over DL-Lite ontologies by adopting abductive reasoning; that is, we
look for additions to the ABox that force a given tuple to be in the result. As
reasoning tasks we consider existence and recognition of an explanation, and
relevance and necessity of a given assertion for an explanation. We
characterize the computational complexity of these problems for arbitrary,
subset minimal, and cardinality minimal explanations.
