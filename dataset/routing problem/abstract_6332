In this paper, we consider finite-time state agreement problems for
continuous-time multi-agent systems and propose two protocols, which ensure
that states of agents reach an agreement in a finite time. Moreover, the second
protocol solves the finite-time average-agreement problem and can be applied to
the systems with switching topology. Upper bounds of convergence time are also
established. Examples are presented to show the effectiveness of our results.
