This article presents the problem of estimating the population mean using
auxiliary information in the presence of measurement errors. A numerical study
is made among the proposed estimator, the exponential ratio estimator, Singh
and Solanki (2012) estimator and the mean per unit estimator in the presence of
measurement errors. Key words: Population mean, Study variate, Auxiliary
variates, Mean squared error, Measurement errors, Efficiency
