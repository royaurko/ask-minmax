The present paper formulates and solves a problem of dividing coins. The
basic form of the problem seeks the set of the possible ways of dividing coins
of face values 1,2,4,8,... between three people. We show that this set
possesses a nested structure like the Sierpinski-gasket fractal. For a set of
coins with face values power of r, the number of layer of the gasket becomes r.
A higher-dimensional Sierpinski gasket is obtained if the number of people is
more than three. In addition to Sierpinski-type fractals, the Cantor set is
also obtained in dividing an incomplete coin set between two people.
