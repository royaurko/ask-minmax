The structure and dielectric properties of 6% $\rm{Sr}^{2+}$-substituted,
modified Lead Zirconium Titanate (PZT) piezoelectric ceramic, with composition
$[\rm{Pb}_{0.94}\rm{Sr}_{0.06}][(\rm{Mn}_{1/3}\rm{Sb}_{2/3})_{0.05}(\rm{Zr}_{0.54}\rm{Ti}_{0.46})_{0.95}]O_3$
and lead manganese antimonite as an additional dopant, synthesized by ceramic
route have been investigated in a frequency range from 50Hz to 1MHz and in a
temperature range between room temperature and 633K. The scanning electron
micrograph of the sample taken at the room temperature confirms the formation
of a fairly homogenous structure and well-formed grains with sharp boundaries.
From the Rietveld analysis, it was found that the structure of the material is
tetragonal with space group P4mm. The scaling behavior of imaginary part of the
electric modulus suggests that the relaxation is described by the same
mechanism at various temperatures. The values of the electromechanical coupling
factor ($\rm{k_p}$), the high mechanical quality factor ($\rm{Q_m}$) and the
piezoelectric coefficient ($\rm{d}_{33}$) of the synthesized sintered & poled
ceramics gives a good set of values for the piezoelectric properties when
compared with related materials, useful for various interesting piezoelectric
device applications.
