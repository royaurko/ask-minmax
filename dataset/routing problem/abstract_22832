We investigate the localization of a hydrophobic - polar (HP) - regular
copolymer at a selective solvent-solvent interface with emphasis on the impact
of block length $M$ on the copolymer behavior. The considerations are based on
simple scaling arguments and use the mapping of the problem onto a homopolymer
adsorption problem. The resulting scaling relations treat the gyration radius
of the copolymer chain perpendicular and parallel to the interface in terms of
chain length N and block size M, as well as the selectivity parameter \chi .
The scaling relations differ for the case of weak and strong localization. In
the strong localization limit a scaling relation for the lateral diffusion
coefficient D is also derived. We implement a dynamic off-lattice Monte - Carlo
model to verify these scaling predictions. For chain lengths in a wide range
(32 < N < 512) we find good agreement with the scaling predictions.
