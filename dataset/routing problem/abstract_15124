This is an expository essay about systolic geometry. It describes a central
theorem in the subject and why the proof is difficult. Then it discusses
different metaphors which suggest ways to approach the problem. The metaphors
connect the systolic inequality to minimal surfaces, topological dimension,
scalar curvature, and hyperbolic geometry.
