We study a supervised clustering problem seeking to cluster either features,
tasks or sample points using losses extracted from supervised learning
problems. We formulate a unified optimization problem handling these three
settings and derive algorithms whose core iteration complexity is concentrated
in a k-means clustering step, which can be approximated efficiently. We test
our methods on both artificial and realistic data sets extracted from movie
reviews and 20NewsGroup.
