Frustrated magnets in high magnetic field have a long history of offering
beautiful surprises to the patient investigator. Here we present the results of
extensive classical Monte Carlo simulations of a variety of models of two
dimensional magnets in magnetic field, together with complementary spin wave
analysis. Striking results include (i) a massively enhanced magnetocaloric
effect in antiferromagnets bordering on ferromagnetic order, (ii) a route to an
$m=1/3$ magnetization plateau on a square lattice, and (iii) a cascade of phase
transitions in a simple model of AgNiO$_2$.
