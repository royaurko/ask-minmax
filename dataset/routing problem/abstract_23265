We propose a new solution to the cosmological monopole problem in which
domain walls sweep away the magnetic monopoles and subsequently decay. The
solution does not require extensive fine tuning or model building - it works
for the prototype SU(5) Grand Unification model. More generally, it shows that
defect interactions can lead to ``defect erasure'' in phase transitions and
that this can be relevant to early universe physics.
