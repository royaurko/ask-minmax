The long-standing problem of finding a closed formula for the relative
entropy of entanglement (REE) for two qubits is addressed. A compact-form
solution to the inverse problem, which characterizes an entangled state for a
given closest separable state, is obtained. Analysis of the formula for a large
class of entangled states strongly suggests that a compact analytical solution
of the original problem, which corresponds to finding the closest separable
state for a given entangled state, can be given only in some special cases. A
few applications of the compact-form formula are given to show additivity of
the REE, to relate the REE with the Rains upper bound for distillable
entanglement, and to show that a Bell state does not have a unique closest
separable state.
