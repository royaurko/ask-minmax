An ordered biclique partition of the complete graph $K_n$ on $n$ vertices is
a collection of bicliques (i.e., complete bipartite graphs) such that (i) every
edge of $K_n$ is covered by at least one and at most two bicliques in the
collection, and (ii) if an edge $e$ is covered by two bicliques then each
endpoint of $e$ is in the first class in one of these bicliques and in the
second class in other one. In this note, we give an explicit construction of
such a collection of size $n^{1/2+o(1)}$, which improves the $O(n^{2/3})$ bound
shown in the previous work [Disc. Appl. Math., 2014].
  As the immediate consequences of this result, we show (i) a construction of
$n \times n$ 0/1 matrices of rank $n^{1/2+o(1)}$ which have a fooling set of
size $n$, i.e., the gap between rank and fooling set size can be at least
almost quadratic, and (ii) an improved lower bound $(2-o(1)) \log N$ on the
nondeterministic communication complexity of the clique vs. independent set
problem, which matches the best known lower bound on the deterministic version
of the problem shown by Kushilevitz, Linial and Ostrovsky [Combinatorica,
1999].
