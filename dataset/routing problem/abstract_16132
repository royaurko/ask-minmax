We propose a method for solving boundary value and eigenvalue problems for
the elliptic operator D=divpgrad+q in the plane using pseudoanalytic function
theory and in particular pseudoanalytic formal powers. Under certain conditions
on the coefficients p and q with the aid of pseudoanalytic function theory a
complete system of null solutions of the operator can be constructed following
a simple algorithm consisting in recursive integration. This system of
solutions is used for solving boundary value and spectral problems for the
operator D in bounded simply connected domains. We study theoretical and
numerical aspects of the method.
