This paper deals with a modifed iterative projection method for approximating
a solution of hierarchical fixed point problems for nearly nonexpansive
mappings. Some strong convergence theorems for the proposed method are
presented under certain approximate assumptions of mappings and parameters. As
a special case, this projection method solves some quadratic minimization
problem. It should be noted that the proposed method can be regarded as a
generalized version of Wang et.al. [15], Ceng et. al. [14], Sahu [4] and many
other contributors.
