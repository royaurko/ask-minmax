Specifying boundary conditions continues to be a challenge in numerical
relativity in order to obtain a long time convergent numerical simulation of
Einstein's equations in domains with artificial boundaries. In this paper, we
address this problem for the Einstein--Christoffel (EC) symmetric hyperbolic
formulation of Einstein's equations linearized around flat spacetime. First, we
prescribe simple boundary conditions that make the problem well posed and
preserve the constraints. Next, we indicate boundary conditions for a system
that extends the linearized EC system by including the momentum constraints and
whose solution solves Einstein's equations in a bounded domain.
