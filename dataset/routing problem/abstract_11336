The status of the electroweak precision data as of winter 2003 and the
corresponding theoretical calculations are presented. The possible problems
within the data and the calculations are discussed in a critical way. If the
NuTeV anomaly cannot be explained by unknown effects like higher order parton
distribution functions and if it is not just a statistical fluctuation the
Standard Model of electroweak interactions is in deep problems. Otherwise the
conclusions that the Higgs Boson is relatively light seems quite robust within
the Standard Model.
