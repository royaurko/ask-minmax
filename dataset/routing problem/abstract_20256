We prove the unique solvability of second order elliptic equations in
non-divergence form in Sobolev spaces. The coefficients of the second order
terms are measurable in one variable and VMO in other variables. From this
result, we obtain the weak uniqueness of the martingale problem associated with
the elliptic equations.
