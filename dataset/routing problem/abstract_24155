We study incremental wave propagation for what is seemingly the simplest
boundary value problem, namely that constitued by the plane interface of a
semi-infinite solid. With a view to model loaded elastomers and soft tissues,
we focus on incompressible solids, subjected to large homogeneous static
deformations. The resulting strain-induced anisotropy complicates matters for
the incremental boundary value problem, but we transpose and take advantage of
powerful techniques and results from the linear anisotropic elastodynamics
theory. In particular we cover several situations where fully explicit secular
equations can be derived, including Rayleigh and Stoneley waves in principal
directions, and Rayleigh waves polarized in a principal plane or propagating in
any direction in a principal plane. We also discuss the merits of polynomial
secular equations with respect to more robust, but less transparent, exact
secular equations.
