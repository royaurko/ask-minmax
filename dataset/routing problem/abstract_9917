Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious health condition that is associated
with premature mortality and decreased quality of life. Most of the existing
population-level CKD studies focus on either the prevalence of CKD or the
associations of CKD with other health problems. Very few studies have examined
these quantities jointly, or have examined how the associations between CKD and
other health problems vary by demographic characteristics. In this article, we
propose a joint mean and covariance regression model to statistically describe
how the quantitative measurement of CKD and associations between CKD and other
health problems vary according to demographic predictors. We apply the
methodology to the NHANES 2010 data and discuss guidelines for model selection
and evaluation using standard criteria such as AIC in conjunction with
posterior predictive goodness of fit plots. With the fitted results from the
model, we are able to identify sub-populations that are at high risk of
developing CKD, as well as those for which CKD is likely to co-occur with other
health problems.
