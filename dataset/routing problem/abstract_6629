The problem of disturbed flow in the laminar boundary layer is investigated
when a heating element is located on the surface of the body. The flow is
supposed to be laminar one. It is shown that the problem may be solved in terms
of free interaction theory. The solution of linear flat problem is constructed.
The results of asymptotic analysis are also presented.
