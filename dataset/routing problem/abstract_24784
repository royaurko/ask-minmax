The design of multi-agent based simulations (MABS) is up to now mainly done
in laboratories and based on designers' understanding of the activities to be
simulated. Domain experts have little chance to directly validate agent
behaviors. To fill this gap, we are investigating participatory methods of
design, which allow users to participate in the design the pickup and delivery
problem (PDP) in the taxi planning problem. In this paper, we present a
participatory process for designing new socio-technical architectures to afford
the taxi dispatch for this transportation system. The proposed dispatch
architecture attempts to increase passenger satisfaction more globally, by
concurrently dispatching multiple taxis to the same number of passengers in the
same geographical region, and vis-avis human driver and dispatcher
satisfaction.
