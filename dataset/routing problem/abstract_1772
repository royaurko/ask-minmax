In this article we propose a method for measuring internet connection
stability which is fast and has negligible overhead for the process of its
complexity. This method finds a relative value for representing the stability
of internet connections and can also be extended for aggregated internet
connections. The method is documented with help of a real time implementation
and results are shared. This proposed measurement scheme uses HTTP GET method
for each connections. The normalized responses to identified sites like
gateways of ISPs, google.com etc are used for calculating current link
stability. The novelty of the approach is that historic values are used to
calculate overall link stability. In this discussion, we also document a method
to use the calculated values as a dynamic threshold metric. This is used in
routing decisions and for load-balancing each of the connections in an
aggregated bandwidth pipe. This scheme is a very popular practice in aggregated
internet connections.
