The goal of this paper is to generalize most of the moment formulae obtained
in [Pri11]. More precisely, we consider a general point process \mu, and show
that the relevant quantities to our problem are the so-called Papangelou
intensities. Then, we show some general formulae to recover the moment of order
n of the stochastic integral of a random process. We will use these extended
results to study a random transformation of the point process.
