This article presents results of the observation of a project management
teaching-by-project course. It describe return of experience not only of
student but also of tutors one years after the course. Many problems are
identified like individual student evaluation, tutor distance, lake of
coordination, lake of communication. We ask tutor about the pertinence of an
instrumental solution, based upon dashboard, to solve problems of coordination
and evaluation identified. We made the hypothese that a cognitive tool will
improve too the knowledge construction and the learning process.
