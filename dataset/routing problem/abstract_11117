One of the open problems posed in [3] is: what is the minimal number k such
that an open, flexible k-chain can interlock with a flexible 2-chain? In this
paper, we establish the assumption behind this problem, that there is indeed
some k that achieves interlocking. We prove that a flexible 2-chain can
interlock with a flexible, open 16-chain.
