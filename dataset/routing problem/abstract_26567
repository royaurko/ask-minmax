The inverse problem of the calculus of variations asks whether a given system
of partial differential equations (PDEs) admits a variational formulation. We
show that the existence of a presymplectic form in the variational bicomplex,
when horizontally closed on solutions, allows us to construct a variational
formulation for a subsystem of the given PDE. No constraints on the
differential order or number of dependent or independent variables are assumed.
The proof follows a recent observation of Bridges, Hydon and Lawson and
generalizes an older result of Henneaux from ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) to PDEs. Uniqueness of the variational formulation is also discussed.
