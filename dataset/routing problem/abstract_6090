The simulation of rich star clusters presents challenging problems of several
kinds, including the design of suitable hardware and software, and numerous
theoretical problems in stellar dynamics and stellar physics. Great progress
has been made possible in recent years through the widespread use of GRAPE
hardware. Simulations are, however, still too small to be applied to real star
clusters without scaling. How this is done is partly an issue of stellar
dynamics, and it has thrown into focus a number of fundamental theoretical
problems in this field.
