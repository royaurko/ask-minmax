An inequality refining the lower bound for a periodic (Breitenberger)
uncertainty constant is proved for a wide class of functions. A connection of
uncertainty constants for periodic and non-periodic functions is extended to
this class. A particular minimization problem for a non-periodic (Heisenberg)
uncertainty constant is studied.
