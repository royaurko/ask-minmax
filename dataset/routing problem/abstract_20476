The problem of the uniqueness in the introduction of spin operators in the
synchrotron radiation theory is discussed. For this purpose we give the
invariant spin projections on the basis of the spin projections in the rest
frame. The spin equations are used to construct the integrals of motion in the
presence of the external electromagnetic field.
