We propose an algorithm for the efficient parallel implementation of
elastoplastic problems with hardening based on the so-called TFETI (Total
Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting) domain decomposition method. We
consider an associated elastoplastic model with the von Mises plastic criterion
and the linear isotropic hardening law. Such a model is discretized by the
implicit Euler method in time and the consequent one time step elastoplastic
problem by the finite element method in space. The latter results in a system
of nonlinear equations with a strongly semismooth and strongly monotone
operator. The semismooth Newton method is applied to solve this nonlinear
system. Corresponding linearized problems arising in the Newton iterations are
solved in parallel by the above mentioned TFETI domain decomposition method.
The proposed TFETI based algorithm was implemented in Matlab parallel
environment and its performance was illustrated on a 3D elastoplastic
benchmark. Numerical results for different time discretizations and mesh levels
are presented and discussed and a local quadratic convergence of the semismooth
Newton method is observed.
