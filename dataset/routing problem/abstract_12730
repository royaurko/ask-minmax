We present a scaling technique which transforms the evolution problem for a
nonlinear wave equation with small initial data to a linear wave equation with
a distributional source. The exact solution of the latter uniformly
approximates the late-time behavior of solutions of the nonlinear problem in
timelike and null directions.
