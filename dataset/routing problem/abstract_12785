This paper studies eigenvalues of the buckling problem of arbitrary order on
bounded domains in Euclidean spaces and spheres. We prove universal bounds for
the k-th eigenvalue in terms of the lower ones independent of the domains. Our
results strengthen the recent work in [28] and generalize Cheng-Yang's recent
estimates [16] on the buckling eigenvalues of order two to arbitrary order.
