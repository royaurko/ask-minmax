We consider the mixed problem for the Laplace operator in a class of
Lipschitz graph domains in two dimensions with Lipschitz constant at most 1.
The boundary of the domain is decomposed into two disjoint sets D and N. We
suppose the Dirichlet data, f_D has one derivative in L^p(D) of the boundary
and the Neumann data is in L^p(N). We find conditions on the domain and the
sets D and N so that there is a p_0>1 so that for p in the interval (1,p_0), we
may find a unique solution to the mixed problem and the gradient of the
solution lies in L^p.
