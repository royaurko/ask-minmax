A adapted tensor-structured GMRES method for the TT format is proposed and
investigated. The Tensor Train (TT) approximation is a robust approach to
high-dimensional problems. One class of problems is solution of a linear
system. In this work we study the convergence of the GMRES method in the
presence of tensor approximations and provide relaxation techniques to improve
its performance. Several numerical examples are presented. The method is also
compared with a projection TT linear solver based on the ALS and DMRG methods.
On a particular sPDE (high-dimensional parametric) problem, these methods
manifest comparable performance, with a good preconditioner the TT-GMRES
overcomes the ALS solver.
