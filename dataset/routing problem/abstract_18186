The SD-SPIDER method for the characterization of ultrashort laser pulses
requires the solution of a nonlinear integral equation of autoconvolution type
with a device-based kernel function. Taking into account the analytical
background of a variational regularization approach for solving the
corresponding ill-posed operator equation formulated in complex-valued
$L^2$-spaces over finite real intervals, we suggest and evaluate numerical
procedures using NURBS and the TIGRA method for calculating the regularized
solutions in a stable manner. In this context, besides the complex
deautoconvolution problem with noisy but full data, a phase retrieval problem
is introduced which adapts to the experimental state of the art in laser
optics. For the treatment of this problem facet, which is formulated as a
tensor product operator equation, we derive well-posedness of variational
regularization methods. Case studies with synthetic and real optical data show
the capability of the implemented approach as well as its limitation due to
measurement deficits.
