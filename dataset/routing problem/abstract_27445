It is well known that single-peaked consistency for total orders is in P.
However in practice a preference profile is not always comprised of total
orders. Often voters have indifference between some of the candidates. In a
weak preference order indifference must be transitive. We show that
single-peaked consistency for weak orders is in P for the three different
variants of single-peakedness for weak orders. Specifically, we consider
Black's original definition for weak orders (Black 1948), single-plateaued
preferences (Black 1958), and the existential model recently introduced by
Lackner (2014). We accomplish this by transforming each of these single-peaked
consistency problems to the problem of determining if a 0-1 matrix has the
property of consecutive ones in rows.
