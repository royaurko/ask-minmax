Cryptographically signing XML, and normalizing it prior to signing, are
forbiddingly intricate problems in the general case. This is largely because of
the complexities of the XML Information Set. We can define a more aggressive
normalization, which dispenses with distinctions and features which are
unimportant in a large class of cases, and thus define a straightforwardly
implementable and portable signature framework.
