A technique using a systolic array structure is proposed for solving the
common approximate substring (CAS) problem. This approach extends the technique
introduced in earlier work from the computation of the edit-distance between
two strings to the more encompassing CAS problem. A comparison to existing work
is given, and the technique presented is validated and analyzed based on
simulations.
