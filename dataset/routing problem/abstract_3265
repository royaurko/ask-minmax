A low-order mimetic finite difference (MFD) method for Reissner-Mindlin plate
problems is considered. Together with the source problem, the free vibration
and the buckling problems are investigated. Full details about the scheme
implementation are provided, and the numerical results on several different
types of meshes are reported.
