We study transversality for Lipschitz-Fredholm maps in the context of bounded
Fr\'{e}chet manifolds. We show that the set of all Lipschitz-Fredholm maps of a
fixed index between Fr\'{e}chet spaces has the transverse stability property.
We give a straightforward extension of the Smale transversality theorem by
using the generalized Sard's theorem for this category of manifolds. We also
provide an answer to the well known problem concerning the existence of a
submanifold structure on the preimage of a transversal submanifold.
