Inverse spectral problems for Sturm-Liouville operators with nonlocal
boundary conditions are studied. As the main spectral characteristics we
introduce the so-called Weyl-type function and two spectra, which are
generalizations of the well-known Weyl function and Borg's inverse problem for
the classical Sturm-Liouville operator. Two uniqueness theorems of inverse
problems from the Weyl-type function and two spectra are presented and proved,
respectively.
