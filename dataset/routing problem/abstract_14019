We first study the linear eigenvalue problem for a planar Dirac system in the
open half-line and describe the nodal properties of its solution by means of
the rotation number. We then give a global bifurcation result for a planar
nonlinear Dirac system in the open half-line. As an application, we provide a
global continuum of solutions of the nonlinear Dirac equation which have a
special form.
