For the first time two separate production routes of Tc radionuclides have
been studied bombarding $^{7}$Li on $^{nat}$Zr and $^{9}$Be on $^{89}$Y.
Excitation functions of the evaporation residues produced in those reactions
have been measured using stacked-foil technique followed by the
$\gamma$-spectrometric studies in the energy range 37-45 MeV and 30-48 MeV
respectively. Measured excitation functions have been compared with those
calculated using the nuclear reaction model codes PACE-II and ALICE91.
Experimental results show good agreement with the theoretical predictions.
Compound nuclear reaction is the key mechanism in producing evaporation
residues.
