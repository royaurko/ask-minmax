The bondage number of a nonempty graph $G$ is the cardinality of a smallest
edge set whose removal from $G$ results in a graph with domination number
greater than the domination number of $G$. This lecture gives a survey on the
bondage number, including the known results, problems and conjectures. We also
summarize other types of bondage numbers.
