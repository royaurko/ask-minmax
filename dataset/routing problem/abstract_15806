In 1969, H. Davenport and W. M. Schmidt studied the problem of approximation
to a real number \xi by algebraic integers of degree at most three. They did
so, using geometry of numbers, by resorting to the dual problem of finding
simultaneous approximations to \xi and \xi^2 by rational numbers with the same
denominator. In this paper, we show that their measure of approximation for the
dual problem is optimal and that it is realized for a countable set of real
numbers \xi. We give several properties of these numbers including measures of
approximation by rational numbers, by quadratic real numbers and by algebraic
integers of degree at most three.
