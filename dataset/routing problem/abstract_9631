A common problem in applied mathematics is to find a function in a Hilbert
space with prescribed best approximations from a finite number of closed vector
subspaces. In the present paper we study the question of the existence of
solutions to such problems. A finite family of subspaces is said to satisfy the
\emph{Inverse Best Approximation Property (IBAP)} if there exists a point that
admits any selection of points from these subspaces as best approximations. We
provide various characterizations of the IBAP in terms of the geometry of the
subspaces. Connections between the IBAP and the linear convergence rate of the
periodic projection algorithm for solving the underlying affine feasibility
problem are also established. The results are applied to problems in harmonic
analysis, integral equations, signal theory, and wavelet frames.
