For the additive real BSS machines using only constants 0 and 1 and order
tests we consider the corresponding Turing reducibility and characterize some
semi-decidable decision problems over the reals. In order to refine,
step-by-step, a linear hierarchy of Turing degrees with respect to this model,
we define several halting problems for classes of additive machines with
different abilities and construct further suitable decision problems. In the
construction we use methods of the classical recursion theory as well as
techniques for proving bounds resulting from algebraic properties. In this way
we extend a known hierarchy of problems below the halting problem for the
additive machines using only equality tests and we present a further
subhierarchy of semi-decidable problems between the halting problems for the
additive machines using only equality tests and using order tests,
respectively.
