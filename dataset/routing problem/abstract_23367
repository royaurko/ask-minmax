We present a mini-review of present constraints of the large extra dimension
scenario. We show many experiments and considerations that can constrain the
fundamental scale of the large extra dimension. We observe that constraints
come from collider experiments are much weaker than those of astrophysical and
cosmological considerations. When the number of extra dimension n is smaller
than 4, the constraint is so strong that the large extra dimension scenario
cannot solve hierarchy problem. But when n >= 4 there is still possibility that
it can solve the hierarchy problem.
