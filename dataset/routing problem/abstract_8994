Global isothermic immersions are defined and studied with the aid of a
connection between quadratic differentials and immersions. The applications are
two problems stemming from the fundamental question: how much data is needed to
identify a surface immersion (Christoffel's problem) or its shape (Bonnet's
problem). A short complete solution of Christoffel's problem, including closed
surfaces, is given. It is shown that every immersion of an oriented closed
surface (genus $\neq$ 1) is uniquely determined up to similitude by its
conformal class and the tangent planes map. A classification of all generic
Bonnet surfaces follows from a series of papers by Bonnet, Cartan, and Chern.
The existence of a new class of Bonnet surfaces is shown here. The
understanding of this class is necessary in order to study the rigidity of
closed surfaces.
