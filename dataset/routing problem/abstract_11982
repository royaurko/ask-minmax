In this paper we study iterative algorithms for finding a common element of
the set of fixed points of $\kappa$-strict pseudocontractions or finding a
solution of a variational inequality problem for a monotone, Lipschitz
continuous mapping. The last problem being related to finding fixed points of
pseudocontractions. These algorithms were already studied in [G.L. Acedo, H.-K.
Xu] and [N. Nadezhkina, W. Takahashi] but our aim here is to provide the links
between these know algorithms and the general framework of ${\cal T}$-class
algorithms studied in [H.H. Bauschke, P.L. Combettes].
