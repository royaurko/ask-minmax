Sparse signal restoration is usually formulated as the minimization of a
quadratic cost function $\|y-Ax\|_2^2$, where A is a dictionary and x is an
unknown sparse vector. It is well-known that imposing an $\ell_0$ constraint
leads to an NP-hard minimization problem. The convex relaxation approach has
received considerable attention, where the $\ell_0$-norm is replaced by the
$\ell_1$-norm. Among the many efficient $\ell_1$ solvers, the homotopy
algorithm minimizes $\|y-Ax\|_2^2+\lambda\|x\|_1$ with respect to x for a
continuum of $\lambda$'s. It is inspired by the piecewise regularity of the
$\ell_1$-regularization path, also referred to as the homotopy path. In this
paper, we address the minimization problem $\|y-Ax\|_2^2+\lambda\|x\|_0$ for a
continuum of $\lambda$'s and propose two heuristic search algorithms for
$\ell_0$-homotopy. Continuation Single Best Replacement is a forward-backward
greedy strategy extending the Single Best Replacement algorithm, previously
proposed for $\ell_0$-minimization at a given $\lambda$. The adaptive search of
the $\lambda$-values is inspired by $\ell_1$-homotopy. $\ell_0$ Regularization
Path Descent is a more complex algorithm exploiting the structural properties
of the $\ell_0$-regularization path, which is piecewise constant with respect
to $\lambda$. Both algorithms are empirically evaluated for difficult inverse
problems involving ill-conditioned dictionaries. Finally, we show that they can
be easily coupled with usual methods of model order selection.
