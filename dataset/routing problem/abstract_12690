We propose a linear finite-element discretization of Dirichlet problems for
static Hamilton-Jacobi equations on unstructured triangulations. The
discretization is based on simplified localized Dirichlet problems that are
solved by a local variational principle. It generalizes several approaches
known in the literature and allows for a simple and transparent convergence
theory. In this paper the resulting system of nonlinear equations is solved by
an adaptive Gauss-Seidel iteration that is easily implemented and quite
effective as a couple of numerical experiments show.
