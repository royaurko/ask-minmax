We consider the modeling, stability analysis and controller design problems
for discrete-time LTI systems with state feedback, when the actuation signal is
subject to switching propagation delays, due to e.g. the routing in a multi-hop
communication network. We show how to model these systems as regular switching
linear systems and, as a corollary, we provide an (exponential-time) algorithm
for robust stability analysis. We also show that the general stability analysis
problem is NP-hard in general. Even though the systems studied here are
inherently switching systems, we show that their particular structure allows
for analytical understanding of the dynamics, and even efficient algorithms for
some problems: for instance, we give an algorithm that computes in a finite
number of steps the minimal look-ahead knowledge of the delays necessary to
achieve controllability. We finally show that when the switching signal cannot
be measured it can be necessary to use nonlinear controllers for stabilizing a
linear plant.
