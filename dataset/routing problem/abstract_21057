The non-equilibrium thermodynamics of relativistic systems have a rich
phenomenology. The simplest phenomenon in the class of dissipative processes is
that of heat. This letter presents a brief summary of the efforts made to
tackle the problem of relativistic heat conduction. In particular, we focus on
the multi-fluid approach to relativistic dissipation.
