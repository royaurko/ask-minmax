I review ten problems associated with the dynamical wave function collapse
program, which were described in the first of these two papers. Five of these,
the \textit{interaction, preferred basis, trigger, symmetry} and
\textit{superluminal} problems, were discussed as resolved there. In this
volume in honor of Abner Shimony, I discuss the five remaining problems,
\textit{tails, conservation law, experimental, relativity, legitimization}.
Particular emphasis is given to the tails problem, first raised by Abner. The
discussion of legitimization contains a new argument, that the energy density
of the fluctuating field which causes collapse should exert a gravitational
force. This force can be repulsive, since this energy density can be negative.
Speculative illustrations of cosmological implications are offered.
