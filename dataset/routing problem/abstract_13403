We introduce a notion of viscosity solutions for a general class of
elliptic-parabolic phase transition problems. These include the Richards
equation, which is a classical model in filtration theory. Existence and
uniqueness results are proved via the comparison principle. In particular, we
show existence and stability properties of maximal and minimal viscosity
solutions for a general class of initial data. These results are new even in
the linear case, where we also show that viscosity solutions coincide with the
regular weak solutions introduced in [Alt&Luckhaus 1983].
