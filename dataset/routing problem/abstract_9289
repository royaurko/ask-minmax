Previously the contributor has demonstrated that a representative polynomial
search partition is required to solve a NP-complete problem in deterministic
polynomial time. It has also been demonstrated that finding such a partition
can only be done in deterministic polynomial time if the form of the problem
provides a simple method for producing the partition. It is the purpose of this
article to demonstrate that no deterministic polynomial time method exists to
produce a representative polynomial search partition for the Knapsack problem.
