Various MSr2YCu2Oz (M1212 with M = Fe, Co, Al and Ga) compounds have been
synthesized through a solid state reaction route. All these compounds are
derived from the basic CuBa2YCu2O7 structure. Rietveld structural refinement of
the room-temperature neutron diffraction data for Fe-1212 reveals that nearly
half of Fe remains at the M site, while the other half goes to the Cu site in
the CuO2 plane. For the M = Co, Al and Ga compounds, the basic unit cell gets
doubled due to two distinct M sites in the M-O layer and the space group Ima2,
without any cation intermixing is found more appropriate. For the M = Fe
sample, magnetic ordering of Fe spins is seen from magnetization data below 70
K. In the case of the M = Co compound, a shallow down-turn in magnetic
susceptibility is seen below 150 K, indicating low dimensional magnetic
characteristics of the CoO layer. The compounds with M = Al and Ga show
paramagnetic behaviour in their magnetization data down to 5 K. The oxygen
content, established for each compound based on oxygen occupancies, refined
from the neutron diffraction data comes close to 7.0 for each.
