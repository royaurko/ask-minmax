We are concerned with singular elliptic problems of the form $-\Delta u\pm
p(d(x))g(u)=\la f(x,u)+\mu |\nabla u|^a$ in $\Omega,$ where $\Omega$ is a
smooth bounded domain in $\RR^N$, $d(x)={\rm dist}(x,\partial\Omega),$ $\la>0,$
$\mu\in\RR$, $0<a\leq 2$, and $f,k$ are nonnegative and nondecreasing
functions. We assume that $p(d(x))$ is a positive weight with possible singular
behavior on the boundary of $\Omega$ and that the nonlinearity $g$ is unbounded
around the origin. Taking into account the competition between the anisotropic
potential $p(d(x))$, the convection term $|\nabla u|^a$, and the singular
nonlinearity $g$, we establish various existence and nonexistence results.
