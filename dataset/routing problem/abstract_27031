This paper deals with the query problem in the Internet of Things (IoT).
Flooding is an important query strategy. However, original flooding is prone to
cause heavy network loads. To address this problem, we propose a variant of
flooding, called Level-Based Flooding (LBF). With LBF, the whole network is
divided into several levels according to the distances (i.e., hops) between the
sensor nodes and the sink node. The sink node knows the level information of
each node. Query packets are broadcast in the network according to the levels
of nodes. Upon receiving a query packet, sensor nodes decide how to process it
according to the percentage of neighbors that have processed it. When the
target node receives the query packet, it sends its data back to the sink node
via random walk. We show by extensive simulations that the performance of LBF
in terms of cost and latency is much better than that of original flooding, and
LBF can be used in IoT of different scales.
