Perturbative calculations of corrections to the behavior of an ideal gas of
quarks and gluons, the limit that is formally realized at infinite temperature,
are obstructed by severe infrared divergences. The limits to computability that
the infrared problem poses can be overcome in the framework of dimensionally
reduced effective theories. Here, we give details on the evaluation of the
highest perturbative coefficient needed for this setup, in the continuum.
