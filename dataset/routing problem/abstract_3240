In this paper we obtain a Nevanlinna-type formula for the matrix Hamburger
moment problem in a general case. We only assume that the problem is solvable
and has more that one solution. We express the matrix coefficients of the
corresponding linear fractional transformation in terms of the prescribed
moments. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the determinacy of the moment
problem are given.
