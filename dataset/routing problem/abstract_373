Flooding provides important control and route establishment functionality for
a number of unicast and multicast protocols in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks.
Considering its wide use as a building block for other network layer protocols,
the flooding methodology should deliver a packet from one node to all other
network nodes using as few messages as possible. In this paper, we propose the
Optimized Flooding Protocol (OFP), based on a variation of The Covering Problem
that is encountered in geometry, to minimize the unnecessary transmissions
drastically and still be able to cover the whole region. OFP does not need
hello messages and hence OFP saves a significant amount of wireless bandwidth
and incurs lesser overhead. We present simulation results to show the
efficiency of OFP in both ideal cases and randomly distributed networks.
Moreover, OFP is scalable with respect to density; in fact OFP requires lesser
number of transmissions at higher densities. OFP is also resilient to
transmission errors.
