We prove that the word problem in the mapping class group of the
once-punctured surface of genus g has complexity O(|w|^2 g for |w| > log(g)
where |w| is the length of the word in a (standard) set of generators. The
corresponding bound in the case of the closed surface is O(|w|^2 g^2). We also
carry out the same methods for the braid groups, and show that this gives a
bound which improves the best known bound in this case; namely, the complexity
of the word problem in the n-braid group is O(|w|^2 n), for |w| > log n.
 We state a similar result for mapping class groups of surfaces with several
punctures.
