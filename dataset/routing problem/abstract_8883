The satisfactory development of Quaternionic Analysis has indicated new
solutions for physical and mathematical problems. It is worth mentioning the
fact that quaternions possess four dimensions, and in this way they may be
considered as natural elements for the formulation many of physical and
geometrical problems. The scope of this paper is to show that the cycles of
time [1] may be performed quaternionic logarithm.
