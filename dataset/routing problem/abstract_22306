We present a complete set of criteria for determining A-types of
plane-to-plane map-germs of corank one with A-codimension <7, which provides a
new insight into the A-classification theory from the viewpoint of recognition
problem. As an application to generic differential geometry, we discuss about
projections of smooth surfaces in 3-space.
