We investigate the use of linear programming tools for solving semidefinite
programming relaxations of quadratically constrained quadratic problems.
Classes of valid linear inequalities are presented, including sparse PSD cuts,
and principal minors PSD cuts. Computational results based on instances from
the literature are presented.
