In this paper second order elliptic boundary value problems on bounded
domains $\Omega\subset\dR^n$ with boundary conditions on $\partial\Omega$
depending nonlinearly on the spectral parameter are investigated in an operator
theoretic framework. For a general class of locally meromorphic functions in
the boundary condition a solution operator of the boundary value problem is
constructed with the help of a linearization procedure. In the special case of
rational Nevanlinna or Riesz-Herglotz functions on the boundary the solution
operator is obtained in an explicit form in the product Hilbert space
$L^2(\Omega)\oplus (L^2(\partial\Omega))^m$, which is a natural generalization
of known results on $\lambda$-linear elliptic boundary value problems and
$\lambda$-rational boundary value problems for ordinary second order
differential equations.
