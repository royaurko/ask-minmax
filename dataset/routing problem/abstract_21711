When can two regular word languages K and L be separated by a simple
language? We investigate this question and consider separation by piecewise-
and suffix-testable languages and variants thereof. We give characterizations
of when two languages can be separated and present an overview of when these
problems can be decided in polynomial time if K and L are given by
nondeterministic automata.
