Supersymmetry (SUSY) interchanges bosons and fermions but no direct evidences
of it have been revealed in nature yet. In this letter, we observe that
fluctuating pair density waves (PDW) consist of two complex order parameters
which can be superpartners of the unavoidably-doubled Weyl fermions in
three-dimensional lattice models. We construct explicit fermionic lattice
models featuring 3D Weyl fermions and show that PDW is the leading instability
via a continuous phase transition as short-range interactions exceed a critical
value. Using renormalization group, we theoretically show that N=2 space-time
SUSY emerges at the continuous PDW transitions in 3D Weyl semimetals, which we
believe is the first realization of emergent (3+1)D space-time SUSY in
microscopic lattice models. We further discuss possible routes to realize such
lattice models and experimental signatures of emergent SUSY at the PDW
criticality.
