We investigate the non-smooth and non-convex $L^1$-Potts functional in
discrete and continuous time. We show $\Gamma$-convergence of discrete
$L^1$-Potts functionals towards their continuous counterpart and obtain a
convergence statement for the corresponding minimizers as the discretization
gets finer. For the discrete $L^1$-Potts problem, we introduce an $O(n^2)$ time
and $O(n)$ space algorithm to compute an exact minimizer. We apply $L^1$-Potts
minimization to the problem of recovering piecewise constant signals from noisy
measurements $f.$ It turns out that the $L^1$-Potts functional has a quite
interesting blind deconvolution property. In fact, we show that mildly blurred
jump-sparse signals are reconstructed by minimizing the $L^1$-Potts functional.
Furthermore, for strongly blurred signals and known blurring operator, we
derive an iterative reconstruction algorithm.
