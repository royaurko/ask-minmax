We consider the Dirichlet problem for the focusing NLS equation on the
half-line, with given Schwartz initial data and boundary data $q(0,t)$ equal to
an exponentially decaying perturbation $u(t)$ of the periodic boundary data $ a
e^{2i\omega t + i \epsilon}$ at $x=0.$ It is known from PDE theory that this is
a well-posed problem (for fixed initial data and fixed $u$). On the other hand,
the associated inverse scattering transform formalism involves the Neumann
boundary value for $x=0$. Thus the implementation of this formalism requires
the understanding of the "Dirichlet-to-Neumann" map which characterises the
associated Neumann boundary value.
  We consider this map in an indirect way: we postulate a certain
Riemann-Hilbert problem and then prove that the solution of the
initial-boundary value problem for the focusing NLS constructed through this
Riemann-Hilbert problem satisfies all the required properties: the data
$q(x,0)$ are Schwartz and $q(0,t)-a e^{2i\omega t + i \epsilon}$ is
exponentially decaying.
  More specifically, we focus on the case $-3a^2 < \omega < a^2.$ By
considering a large class of appropriate scattering data for the t-problem, we
provide solutions of the above Dirichlet problem such that the data $q_x(0,t)$
is given by an exponentially decaying perturbation of the function $2iab
e^{2i\omega t + i \epsilon},$ where $\omega = a^2-2b^2,~~b>0$.
