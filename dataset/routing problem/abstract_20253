In two preceding articles, we studied the problem of the existence and
uniqueness of a solution to some general BSDE on manifolds. In these two
articles, we assumed some Lipschitz conditions on the drift $f(b,x,z)$. The
purpose of this article is to extend the existence and uniqueness results under
weaker assumptions, in particular a monotonicity condition in the variable $x$.
This extends well-known results for Euclidean BSDE.
