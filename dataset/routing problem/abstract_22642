The modern era in spectral line broadening began with the understanding that
the slow(quasistatic) ion and fast(impact) electron perturbers could be treated
separately. The problem remained of unifying these two theoretical limits. A
scheme for this unification is presented here that has at its foundation a
fundamental observation that is supported by analytical theory and is further
demonstrated by computer simulation. The fundamental observation is that the
ions and electrons can be separated most of the time, and that a frequency
separation within each perturber subsystem can be used for unification. That
is, the rigorous inclusion of slow, but not necessarily static ions together
with the correct impact ion perturbations, will produce valid ionic line
shapes. We show that a frequency separation may be effected to exactly include
the fast modulation limit in a variety of modern methods that can deal with the
intermediate regime between the fast and slow frequency limits of the
perturbation.
