The problem of identifying sparse solutions for the link structure and
dynamics of an unknown linear, time-invariant network is posed as finding
sparse solutions x to Ax=b. If the sensing matrix A satisfies a rank condition,
this problem has a unique, sparse solution. Here each row of A comprises one
experiment consisting of input/output measurements and cannot be freely chosen.
We show that if experiments are poorly designed, the rank condition may never
be satisfied, resulting in multiple solutions. We discuss experimental
strategies for designing experiments such that the sensing matrix has the
desired properties and the problem is therefore well posed. This formulation
allows prior knowledge to be taken into account in the form of known nonzero
entries of x, requiring fewer experiments to be performed. A number of
simulated examples are given to illustrate the approach, which provides a
useful strategy commensurate with the type of experiments and measurements
available to biologists. We also confirm suggested limitations on the use of
convex relaxations for the efficient solution of this problem.
