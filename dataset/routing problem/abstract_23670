In this paper, we address the following two general problems: given two
algebraic varieties in ${\bf C}^n$, find out whether or not they are (1)
isomorphic; (2) equivalent under an automorphism of ${\bf C}^n$. Although a
complete solution of either of these problems is out of the question at this
time, we give here some handy and useful invariants of isomorphic as well as of
equivalent varieties. Furthermore, and more importantly, we give a universal
procedure for obtaining all possible algebraic varieties isomorphic to a given
one, and use it to construct numerous examples of isomorphic, but inequivalent
algebraic varieties in ${\bf C}^n$.
 Among other things, we establish the following interesting fact: for
isomorphic hypersurfaces $\{p(x_1,...,x_n)=0\}$ and $\{q(x_1,...,x_n)=0\}$, the
number of zeros of $grad(p)$ might be different from that of $grad(q)$.
