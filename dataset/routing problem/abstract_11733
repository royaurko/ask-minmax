We propose an original method for determining suitable refracting profiles
between two media to solve two related problems: to produce a given wave front
from a single point source after refraction at the refracting profile, and to
focus a given wave front in a fixed point. These profiles are obtained as
envelopes of specific families of Cartesian ovals. We study the singularities
of these profiles and give a method to construct them from the data of the
associated caustic.
