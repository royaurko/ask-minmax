We study boosting algorithms from a new perspective. We show that the
Lagrange dual problems of AdaBoost, LogitBoost and soft-margin LPBoost with
generalized hinge loss are all entropy maximization problems. By looking at the
dual problems of these boosting algorithms, we show that the success of
boosting algorithms can be understood in terms of maintaining a better margin
distribution by maximizing margins and at the same time controlling the margin
variance.We also theoretically prove that, approximately, AdaBoost maximizes
the average margin, instead of the minimum margin. The duality formulation also
enables us to develop column generation based optimization algorithms, which
are totally corrective. We show that they exhibit almost identical
classification results to that of standard stage-wise additive boosting
algorithms but with much faster convergence rates. Therefore fewer weak
classifiers are needed to build the ensemble using our proposed optimization
technique.
