We present an elementary account of mathematical cosmology through a series
of important unsolved problems. We introduce the fundamental notion of `a
cosmology' and focus on the issue of singularities as a theme unifying many
current, seemingly unrelated trends of this subject. We discuss problems
associated with the definition and asymptotic structure of the notion of
cosmological solution and also problems related to the qualification of
approximations and to the ranges of validity of given cosmologies.
