We show how a candidate mean-field amplitude can be constructed from the
exact wave function of an externally forced $N$-Boson system. The construction
makes use of subsidiary $(N-1)$-particle states which are propagated in time in
addition to the true $N$-particle state, but does not involve spontaneous
breaking of the $U(1)$ symmetry associated with particle number conservation.
Provided the flow in Fock space possesses a property which we call maximum
stiffness, or $t$-coherence, the candidate amplitude actually satisfies the
time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and then serves as macroscopic wave
function of the forced $N$-particle system. The general procedure is
illustrated in detail by numerical calculations performed for the model of a
driven bosonic Josephson junction, which allows one to keep track of all
contributions which usually are subject to uncontrolled assumptions. These
calculations indicate that macroscopic wave functions can persist even under
conditions of strong forcing, but are rapidly destroyed upon entering a regime
of chaotic dynamics. Our results provide a foundation for future attempts to
manipulate, and actively control, macroscopic wave functions by means of
purposefully designed force protocols.
