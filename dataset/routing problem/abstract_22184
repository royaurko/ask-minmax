We study a class of semilinear elliptic equations with constraints in higher
dimension. It is known that several mathematical structures of the problem are
closed to those of the Liouville equation in dimension two. In this paper, we
establish a classification of entire solutions, the $\sup + \inf$ type
inequality and the quantized blowup mechanism.
