Let $G$ be a finite undirected graph. A vertex {\em dominates} itself and all
its neighbors in $G$. A vertex set $D$ is an {\em efficient dominating set}
(\emph{e.d.}\ for short) of $G$ if every vertex of $G$ is dominated by exactly
one vertex of $D$. The \emph{Efficient Domination} (ED) problem, which asks for
the existence of an e.d.\ in $G$, is known to be \NP-complete even for very
restricted graph classes such as for claw-free graphs, for chordal graphs and
for $2P_3$-free graphs (and thus, for $P_7$-free graphs). We call a graph $F$ a
{\em linear forest} if $F$ is cycle- and claw-free, i.e., its components are
paths. Thus, the ED problem remains \NP-complete for $F$-free graphs, whenever
$F$ is not a linear forest. Let WED denote the vertex-weighted version of the
ED problem asking for an e.d. of minimum weight if one exists.
  In this paper, we show that WED is solvable in polynomial time for
$(P_5+kP_2)$-free graphs for every fixed $k$, which solves an open problem,
and, using modular decomposition, we improve known time bounds for WED on
$(P_4+P_2)$-free graphs, $(P_6,S_{1,2,2})$-free graphs, and on
$(2P_3,S_{1,2,2})$-free graphs and simplify proofs. For $F$-free graphs, the
only remaining open case is WED on $P_6$-free graphs.
