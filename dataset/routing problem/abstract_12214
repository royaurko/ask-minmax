We analyze the Sibert et al. group-based (Feige-Fiat-Shamir type)
authentication protocol and show that the protocol is not computationally
zero-knowledge. In addition, we provide experimental evidence that our approach
is practical and can succeed even for groups with no efficiently computable
length function such as braid groups. The novelty of this work is that we are
not attacking the protocol by trying to solve an underlying complex algebraic
problem, namely, the conjugacy search problem, but use a probabilistic
approach, instead.
