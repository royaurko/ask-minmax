The problem of reliably transferring data from a set of $N_P$ producers to a
set of $N_C$ consumers in the BAR model, named N-party BAR Transfer (NBART), is
an important building block for volunteer computing systems. An algorithm to
solve this problem in synchronous systems, which provides a Nash equilibrium,
has been presented in previous work. In this paper, we propose an NBART
algorithm for asynchronous systems. Furthermore, we also address the
possibility of collusion among the Rational processes. Our game theoretic
analysis shows that the proposed algorithm tolerates certain degree of
arbitrary collusion, while still fulfilling the NBART properties.
