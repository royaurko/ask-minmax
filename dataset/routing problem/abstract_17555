The paper presents an algebraic framework for optimization problems
expressible as Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problems. Our results generalize
the algebraic framework for the decision version (CSPs) provided by Bulatov et
al. [SICOMP 2005]. We introduce the notions of weighted algebras and varieties
and use the Galois connection due to Cohen et al. [SICOMP 2013] to link VCSP
languages to weighted algebras. We show that the difficulty of VCSP depends
only on the weighted variety generated by the associated weighted algebra.
Paralleling the results for CSPs we exhibit a reduction to cores and rigid
cores which allows us to focus on idempotent weighted varieties. Further, we
propose an analogue of the Algebraic CSP Dichotomy Conjecture; prove the
hardness direction and verify that it agrees with known results for VCSPs on
two-element sets [Cohen et al. 2006], finite-valued VCSPs [Thapper and Zivny
2013] and conservative VCSPs [Kolmogorov and Zivny 2013].
