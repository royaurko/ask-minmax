Multi-dimensional meta-analysis (MDMA) is an innovative technique for
investigating complex scientific problems influenced by "external" factors,
such as social, medical, economic, political or climatic trends. MDMA extends
traditional meta-analysis by identifying significant data from diverse and
independent disciplines ("orthogonal dimensions") and incorporating truth
tables and non-parametric analysis methods in the interpretation protocol. In
this paper, we outline the methodology of MDMA. We then demonstrates how to
apply the method to a specific problem: the relationship between asthma and air
particulates. The conclusions from the example show that the further reduction
of atmospheric particulate levels is not necessarily the answer to the
increasing asthma incidence. This example also demonstrates the strength of
this method of analysis for complex problems.
