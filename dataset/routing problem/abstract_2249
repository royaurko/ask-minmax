The ability to navigate light signals in two-dimensional networks of
waveguide arrays is a prerequisite for the development of all-optical
integrated circuits for information processing and networking. In this article,
we present a theoretical analysis of bending losses in linear photonic lattices
with engineered couplings, and discuss possible ways for their minimization. In
contrast to previous work in the field, the lattices under consideration
operate in the linear regime, in the sense that discrete solitons cannot exist.
The present results suggest that the functionality of linear waveguide networks
can be extended to operations that go beyond the recently demonstrated
point-to-point transfer of signals, such as blocking, routing, logic functions,
etc.
