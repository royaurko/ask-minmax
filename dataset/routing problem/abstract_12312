A numerical method is presented to obtain approximate solutions to problems
arising from sedimentation models. These processes are widely utilized in
minery for recovering water from suspensions coming out of flotation processes.
The main idea is to apply a multiresolution method to the existing schemes
developed by B\"urger et al. [2, 3, 4] and to observe the good performance of
the multiresolution strategy when applied to these kind of problems. We obtain
high rates of memory compression without affecting the quality of the solution.
