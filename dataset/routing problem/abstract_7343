We prove a nonlinear steepest descent theorem for Riemann-Hilbert problems
with Carleson jump contours and jump matrices of low regularity and slow decay.
We illustrate the theorem by deriving the long-time asymptotics for the mKdV
equation in the similarity sector for initial data with limited decay and
regularity. Our approach is slightly different from the original approach of
Deift and Zhou: By isolating the dominant contributions of the critical points
directly in an appropriately rescaled Riemann-Hilbert problem, we find the
asymptotics using Cauchy's formula. This hopefully leads to a more transparent
presentation.
