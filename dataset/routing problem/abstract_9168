In the PhD thesis of the second contributor under the supervision of the third
contributor was defined the class SI of J-contractive functions, depending on a
parameter and arising as transfer functions of overdetermined conservative 2D
systems invariant in one direction. In this paper we extend and solve in the
class SI, a number of problems originally set for the class SC of functions
contractive in the open right-half plane, and unitary on the imaginary line
with respect to some preassigned signature matrix J. The problems we consider
include the Schur algorithm, the partial realization problem and the
Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation problem. The arguments rely on a correspondence
between elements in a given subclass of SI and elements in SC. Another
important tool in the arguments is a new result pertaining to the classical
tangential Schur algorithm.
