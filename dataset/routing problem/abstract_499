Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs) comprise on wireless mobile nodes that are
communicating with each other without any infrastructure. Vehicular Ad-hoc
NETwork (VANET) is a special type of MANETs in which vehicles with high
mobility need to communicate with each other. In this paper, we present a novel
framework for link availability of paths for static as well as dynamic
networks. Moreover, we evaluate our frame work for routing protocols
performance with different number of nodes in MANETs and in VANETs. We select
three routing protocols namely Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV),
Fish-eye State Routing (FSR) and Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR).
Furthermore, we have also modified default parameters of selected protocols to
check their efficiencies. Performance of these protocols is analyzed using
three performance metrics; Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Normalized Routing
Overhead (NRO) and End-to-End Delay (E2ED) against varying scalabilities of
nodes. We perform these simulations with NS-2 using TwoRayGround propagation
model. The SUMO simulator is used to generate a random mobility pattern for
VANETs. From the extensive simulations, we observe that AODV outperforms among
all three protocols.
