During these last years, the use of the web technologies in the enterprises
becomes an essential factor to define a new business model. Among these
technologies, web services and enterprise portals have gathered to integrate
existing heterogeneous systems such as e-commerce, eservices hub and
e-learning. However, the design and the modeling of the portals, on the one
hand, and their integration with the existing applications, on the other hand,
are still two points open for discussion. The first problem is related to the
development of the lifecycle that can be used for designing and modeling the
enterprise portals. For the second problem, which is the integration of the
existing applications, the discussion is intended towards the use of
technologies based on web services. In This paper, we present a software
engineering solution for the development of Web services-based enterprise
portals.
