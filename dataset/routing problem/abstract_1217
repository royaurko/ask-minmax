By applying the optical nanocircuit concepts to metasurfaces, we propose an
effective route to locally control light transmission over a deeply
subwavelength scale. This concept realizes the optical equivalent of a
transmitarray, whose use is demonstrated for light bending and focusing with
unprecedented efficiency over a subwavelength distance, with crucial benefits
for nano-optics applications. These findings may lead to large improvements in
the manipulation of optical transmission and processing of nanoscale optical
signals over conformal and Si-compatible substrates.
