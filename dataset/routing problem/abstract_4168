This article proves the uniqueness for two kinds of inverse problems of
identifying fractional orders in diffusion equations with multiple
time-fractional derivatives by pointwise observation. By means of eigenfunction
expansion and Laplace transform, we reduce the uniqueness for our inverse
problems to the uniqueness of expansions of some special function and complete
the proof.
