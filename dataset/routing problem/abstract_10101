The aggregation of conflicting preferences is a central problem in multiagent
systems. The key difficulty is that the agents may report their preferences
insincerely. Mechanism design is the art of designing the rules of the game so
that the agents are motivated to report their preferences truthfully and a
(socially) desirable outcome is chosen. We propose an approach where a
mechanism is automatically created for the preference aggregation setting at
hand. This has several advantages, but the downside is that the mechanism
design optimization problem needs to be solved anew each time. Focusing on
settings where side payments are not possible, we show that the mechanism
design problem is NP-complete for deterministic mechanisms. This holds both for
dominant-strategy implementation and for Bayes-Nash implementation. We then
show that if we allow randomized mechanisms, the mechanism design problem
becomes tractable. In other words, the coordinator can tackle the computational
complexity introduced by its uncertainty about the agents preferences BY making
the agents face additional uncertainty.This comes at no loss, AND IN SOME cases
at a gain, IN the(social) objective.
