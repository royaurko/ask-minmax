Given the popularity of the viral marketing campaign in online social
networks, finding an effective method to identify a set of most influential
nodes so to compete well with other viral marketing competitors is of upmost
importance. We propose a "General Competitive Independent Cascade (GCIC)" model
to describe the general influence propagation of two competing sources in the
same network. We formulate the "Competitive Influence Maximization (CIM)"
problem as follows: Under a prespecified influence propagation model and that
the competitor's seed set is known, how to find a seed set of $k$ nodes so as
to trigger the largest influence cascade? We propose a general algorithmic
framework TCIM for the CIM problem under the GCIC model. TCIM returns a
$(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximate solution with probability at least
$1-n^{-\ell}$, and has an efficient time complexity of $O(c(k+\ell)(m+n)\log
n/\epsilon^2)$, where $c$ depends on specific propagation model and may also
depend on $k$ and underlying network $G$. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first general algorithmic framework that has both $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$
performance guarantee and practical efficiency. We conduct extensive
experiments on real-world datasets under three specific influence propagation
models, and show the efficiency and accuracy of our framework. In particular,
we achieve up to four orders of magnitude speedup as compared to the previous
state-of-the-art algorithms with the approximate guarantee.
