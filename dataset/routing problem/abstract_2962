In this paper we propose a general methodology for solving a broad class of
continuous, multifacility location problems, in any dimension and with
$\ell_\tau$-norms proposing two different methodologies: 1) by a new second
order cone mixed integer programming formulation and 2) by formulating a
sequence of semidefinite programs that converges to the solution of the
problem; each of these relaxed problems solvable with SDP solvers in polynomial
time. We apply dimensionality reductions of the problems by sparsity and
symmetry in order to be able to solve larger problems.
