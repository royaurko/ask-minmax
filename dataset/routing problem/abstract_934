We study {\em bottleneck routing games} where the social cost is determined
by the worst congestion on any edge in the network. In the literature,
bottleneck games assume player utility costs determined by the worst congested
edge in their paths. However, the Nash equilibria of such games are inefficient
since the price of anarchy can be very high and proportional to the size of the
network. In order to obtain smaller price of anarchy we introduce {\em
exponential bottleneck games} where the utility costs of the players are
exponential functions of their congestions. We find that exponential bottleneck
games are very efficient and give a poly-log bound on the price of anarchy:
$O(\log L \cdot \log |E|)$, where $L$ is the largest path length in the
players' strategy sets and $E$ is the set of edges in the graph. By adjusting
the exponential utility costs with a logarithm we obtain games whose player
costs are almost identical to those in regular bottleneck games, and at the
same time have the good price of anarchy of exponential games.
