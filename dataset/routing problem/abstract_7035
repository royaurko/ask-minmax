We study the inverse electrostatic and elasticity problems associated with
Poisson and Navier equations. The uniqueness of solutions of these problems is
proved for piecewise constant electric charge and internal stress distributions
having a checkered structure: they are constant on rectangular blocks. Such
distributions appear naturally in practical applications. We also discuss
computational challenges arising in the numerical implementation of our method.
