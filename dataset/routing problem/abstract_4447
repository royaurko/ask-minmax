The principle of Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV) provides a natural solution
to the SUSY flavour problem, but does not solve the SUSY CP problem as it
allows for the presence of new CP-violating phases. If the MFV principle is
generalized by the assumption of CP conservation in the limit of flavour
blindness, the SUSY CP problem can be solved, predicting at the same time
interesting CP violating phenomenology.
