Universal extra dimension (UED) models with right-handed neutrinos are
studied. The introduction of the neutrinos makes us possible not only to
describe Dirac neutrino masses but also to solve the cosmological problem
called the KK graviton problem. This problem is essentially caused by the late
time decay of a KK photon into a KK graviton and a photon, and it distorts the
spectrum of the cosmic microwave background or the diffuse photon. We point out
that, once we introduce right-handed neutrinos to UED models, the KK photon
decays dominantly into neutrinos and does not emit a photon. We also discuss
sub-dominant modes with a photon in the decay quantitatively, and show that
their branching ratios are so small that the spectra are not distorted.
