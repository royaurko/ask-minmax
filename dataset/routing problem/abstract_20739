In this paper, we address the scheduling problem of multi-mode real-time
systems upon uniform multiprocessor platforms. We propose two transition
protocols, specified together with their schedulability test, and provide the
reader with two distinct upper bounds for the length of the transient phases
during mode transitions, respectively for the cases where jobs priorities are
known and unknown beforehand.
