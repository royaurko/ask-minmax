It is a small theory of non almost periodic ergodic families of Jacobi
matrices with pure (however) absolutely continuous spectrum. And the reason why
this effect may happen: under our "axioms" we found an analytic condition on
the resolvent set that is responsible for (exactly equivalent to) this effect.
