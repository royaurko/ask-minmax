Intermittent strange nonchaotic attractors (SNAs) appear typically in
quasiperiodically forced period-doubling systems. As a representative model, we
consider the quasiperiodically forced logistic map and investigate the
mechanism for the intermittent route to SNAs using rational approximations to
the quasiperiodic forcing. It is thus found that a smooth torus is transformed
into an intermittent SNA via a phase-dependent saddle-node bifurcation when it
collides with a new type of ``ring-shaped'' unstable set. Besides this
intermittent transition, other transitions such as the interior, boundary, and
band-merging crises may also occur through collision with the ring-shaped
unstable sets. Hence the ring-shaped unstable sets play a central role for such
dynamical transitions. Furthermore, these kinds of dynamical transitions seem
to be ``universal,'' in the sense that they occur typically in a large class of
quasiperiodically forced period-doubling systems.
