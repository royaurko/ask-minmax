In this paper, we propose a cross-layer scheduling algorithm that achieves a
throughput "epsilon-close" to the optimal throughput in multi-hop wireless
networks with a tradeoff of O(1/epsilon) in delay guarantees. The algorithm
aims to solve a joint congestion control, routing, and scheduling problem in a
multi-hop wireless network while satisfying per-flow average end-to-end delay
guarantees and minimum data rate requirements. This problem has been solved for
both backlogged as well as arbitrary arrival rate systems. Moreover, we discuss
the design of a class of low-complexity suboptimal algorithms, the effects of
delayed feedback on the optimal algorithm, and the extensions of the proposed
algorithm to different interference models with arbitrary link capacities.
