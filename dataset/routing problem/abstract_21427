There are many generalizations of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem. We give new
results (and problems) concerning families of $t$-intersecting $k$-element
multisets of an $n$-set and point out connections to coding theory and
classical geometry. We establish the conjecture that for $n \geq t(k-t)+2$ such
a family can have at most ${n+k-t-1\choose k-t}$ members.
