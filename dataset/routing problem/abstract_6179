We show, that a simple generalization of the Deferred Acceptance Procedure
with firms proposing due to Gale and Shapley(1962), yeild outcomes for a
two-sided contract choice problem, which necessarily belong to the core and are
Weakly Pareto Optimal for firms. Under additional assumptions: (a) given any
two distinct workers, the set of yields acheivable by a firm with the first
worker is disjoint from the set of yields acheivable by it with the second, and
(b) the contract choice problem is pair-wise efficient, we prove that there is
no stable outcome at which a firm can get more than what it gets at the unique
outcome of our procedure.
