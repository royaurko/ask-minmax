Using forcing with measured creatures we build a universe of set theory in
which:
  (a) every sup-measurable function f:RxR-->R is measurable, and
  (b) every function f:R-->R is continuous on a non-measurable set.
  This answers a question of Balcerzak, Ciesielski and Kharazishvili and von
Weizsacker's problem (see Fremlin's list of problems).
