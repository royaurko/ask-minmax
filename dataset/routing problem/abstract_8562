We propose a inexact Newton method for solving inverse eigenvalue problems
(IEP). This method is globalized by employing the classical backtracking
techniques. A global convergence analysis of this method is provided and the
R-order convergence property is proved under some mild assumptions. Numerical
examples demonstrate that the proposed method is very effective for solving the
IEP with distinct eigenvalues.
