We prove the global classical solvability of initial-boundary problems for
semilinear first-order hyperbolic systems subjected to local and nonlocal
nonlinear boundary conditions. We also establish lower bounds for the order of
nonlinearity demarkating a frontier between regular cases (classical
solvability) and singular cases (blow-up of solutions).
