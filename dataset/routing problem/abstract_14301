This paper deals with the problem of recovering the unknown norm of relative
translations between cameras based on the knowledge of relative rotations and
translation directions. We provide theoretical conditions for the solvability
of such a problem, and we propose a two-stage method to solve it. First, a
cycle basis for the epipolar graph is computed, then all the scaling factors
are recovered simultaneously by solving a homogeneous linear system. We
demonstrate the accuracy of our solution by means of synthetic and real
experiments.
