We investigate the exact relation existing between the stability equation for
the solutions of a mechanical system and the geodesic deviation equation of the
associated geodesic problem in the Jacobi metric constructed via the
Maupertuis-Jacobi Principle. We conclude that the dynamical and geometrical
approaches to the stability/instability problem are not equivalent.
