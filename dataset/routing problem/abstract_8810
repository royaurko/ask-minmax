Motivated by the controllability/reachability problems for switched linear
control systems and some classes of nonlinear (mechanical) control systems we
address a related problem of existence of a cyclic vector for an associative
(matrix) algebra. We provide a sufficient criterion for existence of cyclic
vector and draw conclusions for controllability.
