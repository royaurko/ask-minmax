We consider non smooth general degenerate/singular parabolic equations in non
divergence form with degeneracy and singularity occurring in the interior of
the spatial domain, in presence of Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. In
particular, we consider well posedness of the problem and then we prove
  Carleman estimates for the associated adjoint problem.
