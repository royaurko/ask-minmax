The problem of controlling surge and stall in jet engine compressors is of
fundamental importance in preventing damage and lengthening the life of these
components. In this paper, we use the Moore-Greitzer mathematical model to
develop an output feedback controller for these two instabilities (only one of
the three states is measurable). This problem is particularly challenging since
the system is not completely observable and, hence, none of the output feedback
control techniques found in the literature can be applied to recover the
performance of a full state feedback controller. However, we show how to
successfully solve it by using a novel output feedback approach for the
stabilization of general stabilizable and incompletely observable systems.
