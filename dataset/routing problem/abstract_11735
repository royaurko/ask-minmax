The invariant theory of Killing tensors (ITKT) is extended by introducing the
new concepts of covariants and joint invariants of (product) vector spaces of
Killing tensors defined in pseudo-Riemannian spaces of constant curvature. The
covariants are employed to solve the problem of classification of the
orthogonal coordinate webs generated by non-trivial Killing tensors of valence
two defined in the Euclidean and Minkowski planes. Illustrative examples are
provided.
