For a given regular language of infinite trees, one can ask about the minimal
number of priorities needed to recognise this language with a
non-deterministic, alternating, or weak alternating parity automaton. These
questions are known as, respectively, the non-deterministic, alternating, and
weak Rabin-Mostowski index problems. Whether they can be answered effectively
is a long-standing open problem, solved so far only for languages recognisable
by deterministic automata (the alternating variant trivialises).
  We investigate a wider class of regular languages, recognisable by so-called
game automata, which can be seen as the closure of deterministic ones under
complementation and composition. Game automata are known to recognise languages
arbitrarily high in the alternating Rabin-Mostowski index hierarchy, i.e., the
alternating index problem does not trivialise any more.
  Our main contribution is that all three index problems are decidable for
languages recognisable by game automata. Additionally, we show that it is
decidable whether a given regular language can be recognised by a game
automaton.
