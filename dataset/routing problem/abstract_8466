Eigenvalue problem for two coupled Ginzburg-Landau equations is numerically
investigated. The fixed points of corresponding equations system are found. The
classification of these points is made. The phase portraits of corresponding
ordinary differential equations and the dependence of some parameters of the
equations system and the total energy on the initial values are given.
