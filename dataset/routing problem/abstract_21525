Until now the problem counting Latin rectangles m x n has been solved with an
explicit formula for m = 2, 3 and 4 only. In the present paper an explicit
formula is provided for the calculation of the number of Latin rectangles for
any order m. The results attained up to now become particular cases of this new
formula. Furthermore, putting m = n, the number of Latin squares of order n can
also be obtained in an explicit form.
