Radial stability of the continuous pressure gravastar is studied using the
conventional Chandrasekhar method. The equation of state for the static
gravastar solutions is derived and Einstein equations for small perturbations
around the equilibrium are solved as an eigenvalue problem for radial
pulsations. Within the model there exist a set of parameters leading to a
stable fundamental mode, thus proving radial stability of the continuous
pressure gravastar. It is also shown that the central energy density possesses
an extremum in rho_c(R) curve which represents a splitting point between stable
and unstable gravastar configurations. As such the rho_c(R) curve for the
gravastar mimics the famous M(R) curve for a polytrope. Together with the
former axial stability calculations this work completes the stability problem
of the continuous pressure gravastar.
