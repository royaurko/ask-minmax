We formulate the variational problem for AdS gravity with Dirichlet boundary
conditions and demonstrate that the covariant counterterms are necessary to
make the variational problem well-posed. The holographic charges associated
with asymptotic symmetries are then rederived via Noether's theorem and
`covariant phase space' techniques. This allows us to prove the first law of
black hole mechanics for general asymptotically locally AdS black hole
spacetimes. We illustrate our discussion by computing the conserved charges and
verifying the first law for the four dimensional Kerr-Newman-AdS and the five
dimensional Kerr-AdS black holes.
