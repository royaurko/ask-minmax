The local solvability of the Cauchy problem for the nonlinear vibrating plate
equation is showed in the framework of modulation spaces. In the opposite
direction, it is proved that there is no local wellposedness in Wiener amalgam
spaces even for the solution to the homogeneous vibrating plate equation.
