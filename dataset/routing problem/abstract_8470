This paper analyzes different online algorithms for the problem of assigning
weights to edges in a fully-connected bipartite graph that minimizes the
overall cost while satisfying constraints. Edges in this graph may disappear
and reappear over time. Performance of these algorithms is measured using
simulations. This paper also attempts to derandomize the randomized online
algorithm for this problem.
