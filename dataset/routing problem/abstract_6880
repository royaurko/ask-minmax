In this paper, we use the fractional calculus to discuss the fractional
mechanics, where the time derivative is replaced with the fractional derivative
of order $\nu$. We deal with the motion of a body in a resisting medium where
the retarding force is assumed to be proportional to the fractional velocity
which is obtained by acting the fractional derivative on the position. The
fractional harmonic oscillator problem, fractional damped oscillator problem
and fractional forced oscillator problem are also studied.
