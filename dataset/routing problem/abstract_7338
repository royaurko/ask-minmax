We consider commutative regular and context-free grammars, or, in other
words, Parikh images of regular and context-free languages. By using linear
algebra and a branching analog of the classic Euler theorem, we show that,
under an assumption that the terminal alphabet is fixed, the membership problem
for regular grammars (given v in binary and a regular commutative grammar G,
does G generate v?) is P, and that the equivalence problem for context free
grammars (do G_1 and G_2 generate the same language?) is in $\mathrm{\Pi_2^P}$.
