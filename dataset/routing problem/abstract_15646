The coupled cluster or exp S form of the eigenvalue problem for lattice
Hamiltonian QCD (without quarks) is investigated. A new construction
prescription is given for the calculation of the relevant coupled cluster
matrix elements with respect to an orthogonal and independent loop space basis.
The method avoids the explicit introduction of gauge group coupling
coefficients by mapping the eigenvalue problem onto a suitable set of character
functions, which allows a simplified procedure. Using appropriate group
theoretical methods, we show that it is possible to set up the eigenvalue
problem for eigenstates having arbitrary lattice momentum and lattice angular
momentum.
