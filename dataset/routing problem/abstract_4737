We consider the Minimum Feasible Tileset problem: Given a set of symbols and
subsets of these symbols (scenarios), find a smallest possible number of pairs
of symbols (tiles) such that each scenario can be formed by selecting at most
one symbol from each tile. We show that this problem is NP-complete even if
each scenario contains at most three symbols. Our main result is a
4/3-approximation algorithm for the general case. In addition, we show that the
Minimum Feasible Tileset problem is fixed-parameter tractable both when
parameterized with the number of scenarios and with the number of symbols.
