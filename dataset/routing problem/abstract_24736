This manuscript represents the contributor's PhD dissertation thesis.The first
part studies decision problems in Thompson's groups F,T,V and some
generalizations. The simultaneous conjugacy problem is determined to be
solvable for Thompson's group F and suitable larger groups of piecewise-linear
homeomorphisms of the unit interval. We determine algorithms to compute roots
and centralizers in these groups and to detect periodic points and their
behavior by looking at a particular diagram associated to an element.
  In the second part, we describe the structure of subgroups of the group of
all homeomorphisms of the unit circle, with the additional requirement that
they contain no non-abelian free subgroup. It is shown that in this setting the
rotation number map is a group homomorphism. We give a classification of such
subgroups as subgroups of certain wreath products and we show that such
subgroups can exist by building examples. Similar techniques are then used to
compute centralizers in these groups.
