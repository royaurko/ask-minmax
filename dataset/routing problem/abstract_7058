We show how to restrict the analysis of a class of online problems that
includes the $k$-server problem in finite metrics such that we only have to
consider finite sequences of request. When applying the restrictions, both the
optimal offline solutions and the best possible deterministic or randomized
online solutions only differ by at most an arbitrarily small constant factor
from the corresponding solutions without restrictions. Furthermore, we show how
to obtain an algorithm with best possible deterministic or randomized
competitive ratio for the restricted setup. Thus, for each fixed finite metrics
our result qualifies as a competitive ratio approximation scheme as defined by
G\"unther et al.
