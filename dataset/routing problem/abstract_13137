We solve an inverse spectral problem for a star graph of Krein strings, where
the known spectral data comprises the spectrum associated with the whole graph,
the spectra associated with the individual edges as well as so-called coupling
matrices. In particular, we show that these spectral quantities uniquely
determine the weight within the class of Borel measures on the graph, which
give rise to trace class resolvents. Furthermore, we obtain a concise
characterization of all possible spectral data for this class of weights.
