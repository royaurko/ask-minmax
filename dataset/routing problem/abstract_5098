Nowadays, Cellular Neural Networks (CNN) are practically implemented in
parallel, analog computers, showing a fast developing trend. Physicist must be
aware that such computers are appropriate for solving in an elegant manner
practically important problems, which are extremely slow on the classical
digital architecture. Here, CNN is used for solving NP-hard optimization
problems on lattices. It is proved, that a CNN in which the parameters of all
cells can be separately controlled, is the analog correspondent of a
two-dimensional Ising type (Edwards-Anderson) spin-glass system. Using the
properties of CNN computers a fast optimization method can be built for such
problems. Estimating the simulation time needed for solving such NP-hard
optimization problems on CNN based computers, and comparing it with the time
needed on normal digital computers using the simulated annealing algorithm, the
results are astonishing: CNN computers would be faster than digital computers
already at 10*10 lattice sizes. Hardwares realized nowadays are of 176*144
size. Also, there seems to be no technical difficulties adapting CNN chips for
such problems and the needed local control is expected to be fully developed in
the near future.
