In this article, we show to which extent one can improve a theorem of
Bombieri, Friedlander and Iwaniec by using Hooley's variant of the divisor
switching technique. We also give an application of the theorem in question,
which is a Bombieri-Vinogradov type theorem for the Tichmarsh divisor problem
in arithmetic progressions.
