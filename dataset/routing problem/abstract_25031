The heat-balance integral method of Goodman has been thoroughly analyzed in
the case of a parabolic profile with unspecified exponent depending on the
boundary condition imposed. That the classical Good man's boundary conditions
defining the time-dependent coefficients of the prescribed temperature profile
do not work efficiently at the front of the thermal layers if the specific
parabolic profile at issue is employed. Additional constraints based on
physical assumption enhance the heat-balance integral method and form a robust
algorithm defining the parabola exponent . The method has been compared by
results provided by the Veinik's method that is by far different from the Good
man's idea but also assume forma tion of thermal layer penetrating the heat
body. The method has been demonstrated through detailed solutions of 4 1-D
heat-conduction problems in Cartesian co-ordinates including a spherical
problem (through change of vari ables) and over-specified boundary condition at
the face of the thermal layer.
