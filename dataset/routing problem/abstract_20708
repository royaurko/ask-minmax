In 1891 a paper by Georg Cantor was published in which he addressed the
relative cardinality of two sets, the set of integers and the set of real
numbers, in effort to demonstrate that the two sets were of unequal
cardinality. This paper offers a contrary conclusion to Cantor's argument,
together with implication of such to the theory of computation.
