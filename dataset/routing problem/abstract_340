Quality of Service provisioning is one of the major design goals of IEEE
802.16 mesh networks. In order to provide quality delivery of delay sensitive
services such as voice, video etc., it is required to route such traffic over a
minimum delay path. In this paper we propose a routing metric for delay
sensitive services in IEEE 802.16 mesh networks. We design a new cross layer
routing metric, namely Expected Scheduler Delay (ESD), based on HoldOff
exponent and the current load at each node of the network. This proposed metric
takes into account the expected theoretical end-to-end delay of routing paths
as well as network congestion to find the best suited path. We propose an
efficient distributed scheme to calculate ESD and route the packets using
source routing mechanism based on ESD. The simulation results demonstrate that
our metric achieves reduced delay compared to a standard scheme used in IEEE
802.16 mesh, that takes hop count to find the path.
