Basic ideas for creating wave-focusing materials by injecting small particles
in a given material are described.
  The number of small particles to be injected around any point is calculated.
Inverse scattering problem with fixed wavenumber and fixed incident direction
of the plane acoustic wave is formulated and solved.
