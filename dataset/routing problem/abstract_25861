We study the channel coding problem when errors and uncertainty occur in the
encoding process. For simplicity we assume the channel between the encoder and
the decoder is perfect. Focusing on linear block codes, we model the encoding
uncertainty as erasures on the edges in the factor graph of the encoder
generator matrix. We first take a worst-case approach and find the maximum
tolerable number of erasures for perfect error correction. Next, we take a
probabilistic approach and derive a sufficient condition on the rate of a set
of codes, such that decoding error probability vanishes as blocklength tends to
infinity. In both scenarios, due to the inherent asymmetry of the problem, we
derive the results from first principles, which indicates that robustness to
encoding errors requires new properties of codes different from classical
properties.
