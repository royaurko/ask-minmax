In the Red-Blue Dominating Set problem, we are given a bipartite graph $G =
(V_B \cup V_R,E)$ and an integer $k$, and asked whether $G$ has a subset $D
\subseteq V_B$ of at most $k$ "blue" vertices such that each "red" vertex from
$V_R$ is adjacent to a vertex in $D$. We provide the first explicit linear
kernel for this problem on planar graphs, of size at most $46k$.
