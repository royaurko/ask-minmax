We propose a new method to overcome the nodal plane problem for the
tomographic reconstruction of molecular orbitals with twofold mirror
antisymmetry in the length form based on high-order harmonic generation. It is
shown that, by carrying out the reconstruction procedure in the rotating
laboratory frame using the component of the dipole moment parallel to the
electron recollision direction, the nodal plane problem is avoided and the
target orbital is successfully reconstructed. Moreover, it is found that, the
proposed method can completely avoid the additional artificial lobes found in
the results from the traditional method in the velocity form and therefore
provides a more reliable reproduction of the target orbital.
