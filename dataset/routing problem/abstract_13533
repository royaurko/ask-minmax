In this work, the concept of a system for analysing social relations between
entities using the social network analysis and multi-agent system approaches is
presented. The following problems especially appear within the domain of our
interests: identification of the most influential individuals in a given
society, identification of roles played by the given individuals in that
society and the recognition of groups of individuals strongly connected with
one another. For the analysis of these problems, two application domains are
selected: an analysis of data regarding phone calls and analysis of Internet
Weblogs.
