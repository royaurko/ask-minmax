This document consists the basis of my Master's thesis work at the University
of Reading, UK from 2006-2008. It focuses primarily on two main concepts:
context awareness and choice in artificial systems set within a boundary of
available epistemology which serves to describe it. It was hypothesised that
such definitions yield a strong adaptation mechanism for an artificial entity
to manifest as a consequence of the program's runtime. The problem is presented
by discussing different points of view and proposing experiments to demonstrate
the complexities of such problems in artificial life in terms of machine
consciousness while indicating what a suitable answer might be.
