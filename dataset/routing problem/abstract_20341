We analyze the behavior of a Brownian particle moving in a double-well
potential. The escape probability of this particle over the potential barrier
from a metastable state toward another state is known as the Kramers problem.
In this work we generalize Kramers' rate theory to the case of an environment
always out of thermodynamic equilibrium reckoning with non-Markovian effects.
