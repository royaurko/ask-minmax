The selection of features that are relevant for a prediction or
classification problem is an important problem in many domains involving
high-dimensional data. Selecting features helps fighting the curse of
dimensionality, improving the performances of prediction or classification
methods, and interpreting the application. In a nonlinear context, the mutual
information is widely used as relevance criterion for features and sets of
features. Nevertheless, it suffers from at least three major limitations:
mutual information estimators depend on smoothing parameters, there is no
theoretically justified stopping criterion in the feature selection greedy
procedure, and the estimation itself suffers from the curse of dimensionality.
This chapter shows how to deal with these problems. The two first ones are
addressed by using resampling techniques that provide a statistical basis to
select the estimator parameters and to stop the search procedure. The third one
is addressed by modifying the mutual information criterion into a measure of
how features are complementary (and not only informative) for the problem at
hand.
