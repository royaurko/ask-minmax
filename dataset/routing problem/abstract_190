Operating vehicles in adversarial environments between a recurring
origin-destination pair requires new planning techniques. A two players
zero-sum game is introduced. The goal of the first player is to minimize the
expected casualties undergone by a convoy. The goal of the second player is to
maximize this damage. The outcome of the game is obtained via a linear program
that solves the corresponding minmax optimization problem over this outcome.
Different environment models are defined in order to compute routing strategies
over unstructured environments. To compare these methods for increasingly
accurate representations of the environment, a grid-based model is chosen to
represent the environment and the existence of a sufficient network size is
highlighted. A global framework for the generation of realistic routing
strategies between any two points is described. This framework requires a good
assessment of the potential casualties at any location, therefore the most
important parameters are identified. Finally the framework is tested on real
world environments.
