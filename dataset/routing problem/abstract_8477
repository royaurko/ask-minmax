We focus on the problem of finding a good representative of a sample of
random curves warped from a common pattern f. We first prove that such a
problem can be moved onto a manifold framework. Then, we propose an estimation
of the common pattern f based on an approximated geodesic distance on a
suitable manifold. We then compare the proposed method to more classical
methods.
