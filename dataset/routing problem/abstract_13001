A counting constraint satisfaction problem (#CSP) asks for the number of ways
to satisfy a given list of constraints, drawn from a fixed constraint language
\Gamma. We study how hard it is to evaluate this number approximately. There is
an interesting partial classification, due to Dyer, Goldberg, Jalsenius and
Richerby, of Boolean constraint languages when the degree of instances is
bounded by d>=3 - every variable appears in at most d constraints - under the
assumption that "pinning" is allowed as part of the instance. We study the d=2
case under the stronger assumption that "variable weights" are allowed as part
of the instance. We give a dichotomy: in each case, either the #CSP is
tractable, or one of two important open problems, #BIS or #PM, reduces to the
#CSP.
