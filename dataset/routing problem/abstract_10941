We show that the spin dynamics of the 4--channel Kondo model is equivalent to
the one of a model with a spin 1/2 impurity coupled to spin 1 conduction
electrons. By abelian bosonization of the latter model we find a kind of
Toulouse limit analogous to that recently discussed by Emery and Kivelson for
the 2--channel case. We analyse the model by exploiting the close analogy to
the problem of an impurity in the Luttinger liquid.
