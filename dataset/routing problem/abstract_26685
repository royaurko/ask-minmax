Imaging has occupied a huge role in the management of patients, whether
hospitalized or not. Depending on the patients clinical problem, a variety of
imaging modalities were available for use. This gave birth of the annotation of
medical image process. The annotation is intended to image analysis and solve
the problem of semantic gap. The reason for image annotation is due to increase
in acquisition of images. Physicians and radiologists feel better while using
annotation techniques for faster remedy in surgery and medicine due to the
following reasons: giving details to the patients, searching the present and
past records from the larger databases, and giving solutions to them in a
faster and more accurate way. However, classical conceptual modeling does not
incorporate the specificity of medical domain specially the annotation of
medical image. The design phase is the most important activity in the
successful building of annotation process. For this reason, we focus in this
paper on presenting the conceptual modeling of the annotation of medical image
by defining a new profile using the StarUML extensibility mechanism.
