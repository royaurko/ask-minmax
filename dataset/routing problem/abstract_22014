In this article, we introduce a new class of parabolic-type pseudo
differential equations with variable coefficients over the p-adics. We
establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the Cauchy problem
associated with these equations. The fundamental solutions of these equations
are connected with Markov processes. Some of these equations are related to new
models of complex systems.
