We solve the problem of finding all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
Neumann matrix of the matter sector of open bosonic string field theory,
including the zero modes, and switching on a background B-field. We give the
discrete eigenvalues as roots of transcendental equations, and we give
analytical expressions for all the eigenvectors.
