The vector of periodic, compound returns of a typical investment portfolio is
almost never a convex combination of the return vectors of the securities in
the portfolio. As a result the ex post version of Harry Markowitz's "standard
mean-variance portfolio selection model" does not apply to compound return
data. We propose using notional portfolios and normalized linear returns to
remedy this problem.
