The purpose of this paper is to provide efficient algorithms that decide
membership for classes of several Boolean hierarchies for which efficiency (or
even decidability) were previously not known. We develop new forbidden-chain
characterizations for the single levels of these hierarchies and obtain the
following results: - The classes of the Boolean hierarchy over level $\Sigma_1$
of the dot-depth hierarchy are decidable in $NL$ (previously only the
decidability was known). The same remains true if predicates mod $d$ for fixed
$d$ are allowed. - If modular predicates for arbitrary $d$ are allowed, then
the classes of the Boolean hierarchy over level $\Sigma_1$ are decidable. - For
the restricted case of a two-letter alphabet, the classes of the Boolean
hierarchy over level $\Sigma_2$ of the Straubing-Th\'erien hierarchy are
decidable in $NL$. This is the first decidability result for this hierarchy. -
The membership problems for all mentioned Boolean-hierarchy classes are
logspace many-one hard for $NL$. - The membership problems for quasi-aperiodic
languages and for $d$-quasi-aperiodic languages are logspace many-one complete
for $PSPACE$.
