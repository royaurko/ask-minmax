First the crucial but very confidential fact is brought into evidence that,
as Kolmogorov himself repeatedly claimed, there exists no abstract theory of
probabilities, simply because the factual concept of probability is itself
unachieved: it is nowhere specified how to construct the factual probability
law to be asserted on a given physical random phenomenon. Then an algorithm of
semantic integration is built that permits to identify this factual probability
law.
