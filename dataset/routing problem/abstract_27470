We investigate the effect of nonlocal conditions expressed by linear
continuous mappings over the hypotheses which guarantee the existence of global
mild solutions for functional-differential equations in a Banach space. A
progressive transition from the Volterra integral operator associated to the
Cauchy problem, to Fredholm type operators appears when the support of the
nonlocal condition increases from zero to the entire interval of the problem.
The results are extended to systems of equations in a such way that the system
nonlinearities behave independently as much as possible and the support of the
nonlocal condition may differ from one variable to another.
