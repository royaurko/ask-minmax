We study the usage of regularity properties of collections of sets in
convergence analysis of alternating projection methods for solving feasibility
problems. Several equivalent characterizations of these properties are
provided. Two settings of inexact alternating projections are considered and
the corresponding convergence estimates are established and discussed.
