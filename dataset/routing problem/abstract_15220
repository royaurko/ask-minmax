This article considers the parallel machine scheduling problem with
step-deteriorating jobs and sequence-dependent setup times. The objective is to
minimize the total tardiness by determining the allocation and sequence of jobs
on identical parallel machines. In this problem, the processing time of each
job is a step function dependent upon its starting time. An individual extended
time is penalized when the starting time of a job is later than a specific
deterioration date. The possibility of deterioration of a job makes the
parallel machine scheduling problem more challenging than ordinary ones. A
mixed integer programming model for the optimal solution is derived. Due to its
NP-hard nature, a hybrid discrete cuckoo search algorithm is proposed to solve
this problem. In order to generate a good initial swarm, a modified heuristic
named the MBHG is incorporated into the initialization of population. Several
discrete operators are proposed in the random walk of L\'{e}vy Flights and the
crossover search. Moreover, a local search procedure based on variable
neighborhood descent is integrated into the algorithm as a hybrid strategy in
order to improve the quality of elite solutions. Computational experiments are
executed on two sets of randomly generated test instances. The results show
that the proposed hybrid algorithm can yield better solutions in comparison
with the commercial solver CPLEX with one hour time limit, discrete cuckoo
search algorithm and the existing variable neighborhood search algorithm.
