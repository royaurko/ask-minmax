Molecular building blocks interacting at the nanoscale organize spontaneously
into stable mono- layers that display intriguing long-range ordering motifs on
the surface of atomic substrates. The patterning process, if appropriately
controlled, represents a viable route to manufacture practical nanodevices.
With this goal in mind, we seek to capture the salient features of the
self-assembly process by means of an interaction-site model. The geometry of
the building blocks, the symmetry of the underlying substrate, and the strength
and range of interactions encode the self-assembly pro- cess. By means of Monte
Carlo simulations, we have predicted an ample variety of ordering motifs which
nicely reproduce the experimental results. Here, we explore in detail the phase
behavior of the system in terms of the temperature and the lattice constant of
the underlying substrate. Our method is suitable to investigate the stability
of the emergent patterns as well as to identify the nature of the melting
transition monitoring appropriate order parameters.
