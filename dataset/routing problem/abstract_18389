We discuss the current implementation of the ALI method into our
HYDrodynamical RAdiation(HYDRA) code for rapidly expanding, low density
envelopes commonly found in core collapse and thermonuclear supernovae, novae
and WR stars. Due to the low densities, non-thermal excitation by high energy
photons (e.g. by radioactive decays) and the time dependence of the problem,
large departures from LTE are common throughout the envelope even at large
optical depths. ALI is instrumental for both the coupling of the statistical
equations and the hydrodynamical equations with the radiation transport (RT).
We employ several concepts to improve the stability, and convergence
rate/control including the concept of leading elements, the use of net rates,
level locking, reconstruction of global photon redistribution functions,
equivalent-2-level approach, and predictive corrector methods. For appropriate
conditions, the solution of the time-dependent rate equations can be reduced to
the time-independent problem plus an analytic solution of an ODE For the 3-D
problem, we solve the radiation transport via the moment equations. To
construct the Eddington tensor elements, we use a Monte Carlo scheme to
determine the deviation of the solution of the RT equation from the diffusion
approximation (ALI of second kind). At the example of a thermonuclear supernova
(SN99by),we show an analysis of light light curves, flux and polarization
spectra and discuss the limitations of our approach.
