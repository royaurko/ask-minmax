We consider the Calder\'on problem in the case of partial
Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for the system of elliptic equations in a bounded two
dimensional domain. The main result of the manuscript is as follows: If two
systems of elliptic operators generate the same partial Dirichlet-to-Neumann
map the coefficients can be uniquely determined up to the gauge equivalence.
