In the present work, we address a class of Cahn-Hilliard equations
characterized by a singular diffusion term. The problem is a simplified version
with constant mobility of the Cahn-Hilliard-de Gennes model of phase separation
in binary, incompressible, isothermal mixtures of polymer molecules. It is
proved that, for any final time T, the problem admits a unique energy type weak
solution, defined over (0,T). For any s > 0 such solution is classical in the
sense of belonging to a suitable Hoelder class over (s,T), and enjoys the
property of being separated from the singular values corresponding to pure
phases.
