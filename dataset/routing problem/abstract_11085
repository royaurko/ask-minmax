The problem of the principal existence of the perfect lens and superlensing
is discussed. We have demonstrated that in the case of the virtual focus the
idea of perfect lens based upon amplification of evanescent waves as proposed
by Pendry is perfectly right unlike the case of the real foci. We think that
some experimental results claiming superlensing can be explained in terms of
the proposed theory for the case when the virtual focus is inside the lens but
very close to the rear face of it.
