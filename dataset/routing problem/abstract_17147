In the EDGE CLIQUE COVER (ECC) problem, given a graph G and an integer k, we
ask whether the edges of G can be covered with k complete subgraphs of G or,
equivalently, whether G admits an intersection model on k-element universe.
Gramm et al. [JEA 2008] have shown a set of simple rules that reduce the number
of vertices of G to 2^k, and no algorithm is known with significantly better
running time bound than a brute-force search on this reduced instance. In this
paper we show that the approach of Gramm et al. is essentially optimal: we
present a polynomial time algorithm that reduces an arbitrary 3-CNF-SAT formula
with n variables and m clauses to an equivalent ECC instance (G,k) with k =
O(log n) and |V(G)| = O(n + m). Consequently, there is no 2^{2^{o(k)}}poly(n)
time algorithm for the ECC problem, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis
fails. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results for a natural,
fixed-parameter tractable problem, and proving that a doubly-exponential
dependency on the parameter is essentially necessary.
