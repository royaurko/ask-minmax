The Lasserre/Sum-of-Squares hierarchy is a systematic procedure to strengthen
LP relaxations by constructing a sequence of increasingly tight formulations.
For a wide variety of optimization problems, this approach captures the convex
relaxations used in the best available approximation algorithms.
  The \emph{capacitated covering IP} is an integer program of the form
$\min\{cx:Ux\geq d, 0\leq x\leq b, x\in Z^+\}$, where all the entries of $c,U$
and $d$ are nonnegative. One difficulty in approximating the capacitated
covering problems lies in the fact that the ratio between the optimal IP
solution to the optimal LP solution can be as large as $||d||_{\infty}$, even
when $U$ consists of a single row (i.e. the \textsc{Min Knapsack} problem).
Currently the strongest linear program relaxation is obtained by adding
(exponentially many) valid \emph{knapsack cover} $(KC)$ inequalities introduced
by Wolsey~\cite{Wolsey75}, which yields a very powerful way to cope with these
problems.
  For the \textsc{Min Knapsack} problem we prove that even after non-constant
number of levels the Lasserre/Sum-of-Squares hierarchy does not improve the
integrality gap of 2 implied by the starting $(KC)$ inequalities. Furthermore,
we show that the integrality gap of the relaxation stays $M$ for the special
case of $\sum_i x_i \geq 1/M$ when starting with the standard \textsc{Min
Knapsack} polytope. We note that \textsc{Min Knapsack} admits an FPTAS and our
results quantify a fundamental weakness of the Lasserre/Sum-of-Squares
hierarchy for this basic problem.
