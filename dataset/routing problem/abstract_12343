The paper studies a natural $n$-dimensional generalization of the classical
nonholonomic Chaplygin sphere problem. We prove that for a specific choice of
the inertia operator, the restriction of the generalized problem onto zero
value of the SO(n-1)-momentum mapping becomes an integrable Hamiltonian system
after an appropriate time reparametrization.
