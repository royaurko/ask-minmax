With developments of real-time applications into data centers, the need for
alternatives of the standard TCP protocol has been prime demand in several
applications of data centers. The several alternatives of TCP protocol has been
proposed but SCTP has edge due to its several well-built characteristics that
make it capable to work efficiently. In this paper, we examine the features of
SCTP into data centers like Multi-streaming and Multi-homing over the features
of TCP protocol. In this paper, our objective is to introduce internal problems
of data centers. Robust transport protocol reduces the problems with some
extend. Focusing the problems of data centers, we also examine weakness of
highly deployed standard TCP, and evaluate the performance of SCTP in context
of faster communication for data centers. We also discover some weaknesses and
shortcomings of SCTP into data centers and try to propose some ways to avoid
them by maintaining SCTP native features. To validate strength and weakness of
TCP and SCTP, we use ns2 for simulation in context of data center. On basis of
findings, we highlight major strength of SCTP. At the end, we Implemen
