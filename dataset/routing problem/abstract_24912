The work of Oh and Park ([OP]) on the deformation problem of coisotropic
submanifolds opened the possibility of studying a large and interesting class
of foliations with some explicit geometric tools. These tools assemble into the
structure of an L-infinity algebra on the shifted foliation complex
(\Omega^*[1](\fol), d_\fol), which allows a concise description of deformations
in terms of a Maurer-Cartan equation. Infinitesimal deformations are given by
d_\fol-closed forms, and the relation between infinitesimal deformations and
full deformations can be studied in terms of obstruction classes lying in the
foliation cohomology H^*_\fol. Closely related to the foliation cohomology is
Haefliger's group \Omega^*_c(T/H), an under-appreciated model for the leaf
space of a foliation. We make integral use of this group in showing solvability
and unsolvability of the obstruction equations. We also show the L-infinity
apparatus to be capable of detecting the Liouville/diophantine distinction of
KAM theory, and argue for the greater significance of Haefliger's
integration-over-leaves map in passing this fine structure to a geometric model
for the leaf space.
