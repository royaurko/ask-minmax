We investigate the use of noncommutative Groebner bases in solving partially
prescribed matrix inverse completion problems. The types of problems considered
here are similar to those in [BLJW]. There the contributors gave necessary and
sufficient conditions for the solution of a two by two block matrix completion
problem. Our approach is quite different from theirs and relies on symbolic
computer algebra.
  Here we describe a general method by which all block matrix completion
problems of this type may be analyzed if sufficient computational power is
available. We also demonstrate our method with an analysis of all three by
three block matrix inverse completion problems with eleven blocks known and
seven unknown. We discover that the solutions to all such problems are of a
relatively simple form.
  We then perform a more detailed analysis of a particular problem from the
31,824 three by three block matrix completion problems with eleven blocks known
and seven unknown. A solution to this problem of the form derived in [BLJW] is
presented.
  Not only do we give a proof of our detailed result, but we describe the
strategy used in discovering our theorem and proof, since it is somewhat
unusual for these types of problems.
