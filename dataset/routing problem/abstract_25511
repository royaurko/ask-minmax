We prove new results for approximating the graphic TSP and some related
problems. We obtain polynomial-time algorithms with improved approximation
guarantees.
  For the graphic TSP itself, we improve the approximation ratio to 7/5. For a
generalization, the connected-$T$-join problem, we obtain the first nontrivial
approximation algorithm, with ratio 3/2. This contains the graphic
$s$-$t$-path-TSP as a special case. Our improved approximation guarantee for
finding a smallest 2-edge-connected spanning subgraph is 4/3.
  The key new ingredient of all our algorithms is a special kind of
ear-decomposition optimized using forest representations of hypergraphs. The
same methods also provide the lower bounds (arising from LP relaxations) that
we use to deduce the approximation ratios.
