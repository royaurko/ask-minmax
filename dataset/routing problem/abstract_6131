We consider the generalized exclusion statistics in the Kondo problem. The
thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations have been used for a multicomponent system
of particles obeying the generalized exclusion principle. We have found a
relation between the derivative of the phase shift of the scattering matrix for
Fermi particles and for particles characterized by generalized exclusion
statistics. We show that the statistical matrix in the Kondo problem has a
universal form in high and low temperature limits.
