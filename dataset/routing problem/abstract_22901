The model of Dynamic Meta-Constraints has special activity constraints which
can activate other constraints. It also has meta-constraints which range over
other constraints. An algorithm is presented in which constraints can be
assigned one of five different satisfaction values, which leads to the
assignment of domain values to the variables in the CSP. An outline of the
model and the algorithm is presented, followed by some initial results for two
problems: a simple classic CSP and the Car Configuration Problem. The algorithm
is shown to perform few backtracks per solution, but to have overheads in the
form of historical records required for the implementation of state.
