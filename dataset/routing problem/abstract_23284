We perform an updated model-independent analysis using the latest solar
neutrino data obtained by $^{37}$Cl and $^{71}$Ga radiochemical experiments,
and most notably by a large water-Cherenkov detector SuperKamiokande with their
504 days of data taking. We confirm that the astrophysical solutions to the
solar neutrino problem are extremely disfavored by the data and a
low-temperature modification of the standard solar model is excluded by more
than 5 $\sigma$. We also propose a new way of illuminating the suppression
pattern of various solar neutrino flux without invoking detailed flavor
conversion mechanisms. It indicates that the strong suppression of $^7$Be
neutrinos is no more true when the neutrino flavor conversion is taken into
account.
