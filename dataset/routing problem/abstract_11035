We study irreversible dimer nucleation on top of terraces during epitaxial
growth in one and two dimensions, for all values of the step-edge barrier. The
problem is solved exactly by transforming it into a first passage problem for a
random walker in a higher-dimensional space. The spatial distribution of
nucleation events is shown to differ markedly from the mean-field estimate
except in the limit of very weak step-edge barriers. The nucleation rate is
computed exactly, including numerical prefactors.
