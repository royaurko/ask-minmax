X-ray Fluorescence Computed Tomography(XFCT) is a prevalent experimental
technique which is utilized to investigate the spatial distribution of elements
in sample. The sensitivity of L-shell XFCT of some elements is lower than that
of K-shell XFCT. However, the image reconstruction for this technique has much
more problems than that of transmission tomography, one of which is
self-absorption. In the present work, a novel strategy was developed to deal
with such problems. But few researches are concerned on attenuation correction
of L-shell XFCT that are essential to get accurate reconstructed image. We make
use of the known quantities and the unknown elemental concentration of interest
to express the unknown attenuation maps. And then the attenuation maps are
added in the contribution value of the pixel in MLEM reconstruction method.
Results indicate that the relative error is less than 14.1%, which is proved
this method can correct L-shell XFCT very well.
