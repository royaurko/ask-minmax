The two body problem in a scalar theory of gravity is investigated. We focus
on the closest theory to General Relativity (GR), namely Nordstr\"om's theory
of gravity (1913). The gravitational field can be exactly solved for any
configuration of point-particles. We then derive the exact equations of motion
of two inspiraling bodies including the exact self-forces terms. We prove that
there is no innermost circular orbit (ICO) in the exact theory whereas we find
(order-dependent) ICOs if post-Newtonian (PN) truncations are used. We
construct a solution of the two body problem in an iterative (non-PN) way,
which can be viewed as a series in powers of $(v/c)^{5}$. Besides this rapid
convergence, each order also provides non-perturbative information. Starting
from a circular Newtonian-like orbit, the first iteration already yields the
4.5 PN radiation reaction. These results not only shed light on some
non-perturbative effects of relativistic gravity, but may also be useful to
test numerical codes.
