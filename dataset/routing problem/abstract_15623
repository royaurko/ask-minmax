In a recent paper Abramowicz and Klu{\'z}niak have discussed the problem of
epicyclic oscillations in Newton's and Einstein's dynamics and have shown that
Newton's dynamics in a properly curved three-dimensional space is identical to
test-body dynamics in the three-dimensional optical geometry of Schwarzschild
space-time. One of the main results of this paper was the proof that different
behaviour of radial epicyclic frequency and Keplerian frequency in Newtonian
and General Relativistic regimes had purely geometric origin contrary to claims
that nonlinearity of Einstein's theory was responsible for this effect.
  In this paper we obtain the same result from another perspective: by
representing these two distinct problems (Newtonian and Einstein's test body
motion in central gravitational field) in a uniform way -- as a geodesic
motion. The solution of geodesic deviation equation reproduces the well known
results concerning epicyclic frequencies and clearly demonstrates geometric
origin of the difference between Newtonian and Einstein's problems.
