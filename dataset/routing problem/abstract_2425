The link between nuclear activity and the host galaxy remains elusive. It
seems now clear that the galactic environment is not the key, and that there is
no significant apparent difference in terms of the presence of bars/spirals
between active and non-active galaxies. Nuclear activity nevertheless requires
a small central gas reservoir (10^4-10^7 Msun) which may be only partly
consumed during the 10^6-10^7 yr AGN duty cycle. A possible route towards a
better understanding of the involved physical processes is to directly probe
the gravitational potential of the host galaxies, with the hope that the
corresponding sensitive tracers (stars, gas) will deliver convincing evidence
for a kinematic signature associated with the AGN. This is the motivation for
an on-going survey of 50 galaxies, for which the two-dimensional kinematics of
the (neutral, ionised and molecular) gas and stellar components are being
obtained (see Dumas et al., this conference). With only 10 to 15% of Seyfert
galaxies in the local Universe, we must also acknowledge the possibility that
this activity is a recurrent (but short) process, and that signatures of recent
gas accretion associated with the onset of the central activity should be
detectable. This paper is a short report on the detection and study of
sigma--drops which we believe are the result of past gas accretion followed by
subsequent star formation.
