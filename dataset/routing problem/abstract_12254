We study a singular limit for the compressible Navier-Stokes system when the
Mach and Rossby numbers are proportional to certain powers of a small parameter
$\ep$. If the Rossby number dominates the Mach number, the limit problem is
represented by the 2-D incompressible Navier-Stokes system describing the
horizontal motion of vertical averages of the velocity field. If they are of
the same order then the limit problem turns out to be a linear, 2-D equation
with a unique radially symmetric solution. The effect of the centrifugal force
is taken into account.
