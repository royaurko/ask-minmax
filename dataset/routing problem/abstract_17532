In the Interval Completion problem we are given a graph G and an integer k,
and the task is to turn G using at most k edge additions into an interval
graph, i.e., a graph admitting an intersection model of intervals on a line.
Motivated by applications in sparse matrix multiplication and molecular
biology, Kaplan, Shamir and Tarjan [FOCS 1994; SIAM J. Comput. 1999] asked for
a fixed-parameter algorithm solving this problem. This question was answer
affirmatively more than a decade later by Villanger at el. [STOC 2007; SIAM J.
Comput. 2009], who presented an algorithm with running time $O(k^{2k}n^3m)$. We
give the first subexponential parameterized algorithm solving Interval
Completion in time $k^{O(\sqrt{k})} n^{O(1)}$. This adds Interval Completion to
a very small list of parameterized graph modification problems solvable in
subexponential time.
