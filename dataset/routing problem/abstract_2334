Strain can tune desirable electronic behavior in graphene, but there has been
limited progress in controlling strain in graphene devices. In this paper, we
study the mechanical response of graphene on substrates patterned with arrays
of mesoscale pyramids. Using atomic force microscopy, we demonstrate that the
morphology of graphene can be controlled from conformal to suspended depending
on the arrangement of pyramids and the aspect ratio of the array. Non-uniform
strains in graphene suspended across pyramids are revealed by Raman
spectroscopy and supported by atomistic modeling, which also indicates strong
pseudomagnetic fields in the graphene. Our results suggest that incorporating
mesoscale pyramids in graphene devices is a viable route to achieving
strain-engineering of graphene.
