In this paper we consider the robust secure beamformer design for MISO
wiretap channels. Assume that the eavesdroppers' channels are only partially
available at the transmitter, we seek to maximize the secrecy rate under the
transmit power and secrecy rate outage probability constraint. The outage
probability constraint requires that the secrecy rate exceeds certain threshold
with high probability. Therefore including such constraint in the design
naturally ensures the desired robustness. Unfortunately, the presence of the
probabilistic constraints makes the problem non-convex and hence difficult to
solve. In this paper, we investigate the outage probability constrained secrecy
rate maximization problem using a novel two-step approach. Under a wide range
of uncertainty models, our developed algorithms can obtain high-quality
solutions, sometimes even exact global solutions, for the robust secure
beamformer design problem. Simulation results are presented to verify the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithms.
