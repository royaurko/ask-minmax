There are several methods for proving the existence of the solution to the
elliptic boundary problem $Lu=f \text{\,\, in\,\,} D,\quad u|_S=0,\quad (*)$.
Here $L$ is an elliptic operator of second order, $f$ is a given function, and
uniqueness of the solution to problem (*) is assumed. The known methods for
proving the existence of the solution to (*) include variational methods,
integral equation methods, method of upper and lower solutions. In this paper a
method based on functional analysis is proposed. This method is conceptually
simple and technically is easy. It requires some known a priori estimates and a
continuation in a parameter method.
