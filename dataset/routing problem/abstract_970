The MPB composition, Na0.88Li0.12NbO3 (commonly known as LNN-12) has been
synthesized by adopting recently developed low-cost citrate-gel route where
Nb2O5 acts as source of Nb. During synthesis, Nb2O5 transforms into a stable
and soluble chelate complex an alternative of expensive metal alkoxides.
Thermal decomposition process and phase formation of the as prepared gel were
studied using thermo-gravimetry (TG) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). The gels
were calcined in the temperature range 500-800 oC and a pure perovskite phase
was obtained at 700 oC, which is 200 oC below the conventional ceramics route
(900 oC). Morphology of the phase pure powders was characterized using scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM). The compacted samples showed high sintered density at < 1200 oC. This
has been attributed to small particle size and homogeneity. The lower sintering
temperature eliminates the possibility of alkali elements loss, leading to
exact MPB composition and enhancement in the electrical properties.
