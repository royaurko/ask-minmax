We prove a Noether type symmetry theorem to fractional problems of the
calculus of variations with classical and Riemann-Liouville derivatives. As
result, we obtain constants of motion (in the classical sense) that are valid
along the mixed classical/fractional Euler-Lagrange extremals. Both Lagrangian
and Hamiltonian versions of the Noether theorem are obtained. Finally, we
extend our Noether's theorem to more general problems of optimal control with
classical and Riemann-Liouville derivatives.
