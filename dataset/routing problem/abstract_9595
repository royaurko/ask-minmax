The intention of the present study is to establish general framework for
automated problem solving by approaching the task universal algebraically
introducing knowledge as realizations of generalized free algebra based nets,
graphs with gluing forms connecting in- and out-edges to nodes. Nets are caused
to undergo transformations in conceptual level by type wise differentiated
intervening net rewriting systems dispersing problems to abstract parts,
matching being determined by substitution relations. Achieved sets of
conceptual nets constitute congruent classes. New results are obtained within
construction of problem solving systems where solution algorithms are derived
parallel with other candidates applied to the same net classes. By applying
parallel transducer paths consisting of net rewriting systems to net classes
congruent quotient algebras are established and the manifested class rewriting
comprises all solution candidates whenever produced nets are in anticipated
languages liable to acceptance of net automata.
