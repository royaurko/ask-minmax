We classify the complexity of the LTL satisfiability and model checking
problems for several standard parameterisations. The investigated parameters
are temporal depth, number of propositional variables and formula treewidth,
resp., pathwidth. We show that all operator fragments of LTL under the
investigated parameterisations are intractable in the sense of parameterised
complexity.
