Starting from a basic Unit Commitment problem as published in
[Carri\'on2006], we develop a fully functional, running implementation for
Xpress Mosel, useable in power market modeling. The constraints of the model
are discussed in details and solutions to left open implementation problems are
presented, guidelines on how to handle data input (from both, databases and
Excel), as well as data output (to Excel) are given.
