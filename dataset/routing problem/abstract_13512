An adaptive algorithm, based on residual type a posteriori indicators of
errors measured in $L^{\infty}(L^2)$ and $L^2(L^2)$ norms, for a numerical
scheme consisting of implicit Euler method in time and discontinuous Galerkin
method in space for linear parabolic fourth order problems is presented. The a
posteriori analysis is performed for convex domains in two and three space
dimensions for local spatial polynomial degrees $r\ge 2$. The a posteriori
estimates are then used within an adaptive algorithm, highlighting their
relevance in practical computations, which results into substantial reduction
of computational effort.
