Ultracold gases of interacting spin-orbit coupled fermions are predicted to
display exotic phenomena such as topological superfluidity and its associated
Majorana fermions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a route to
strongly-interacting single-component atomic Fermi gases by combining an s-wave
Feshbach resonance (giving strong interactions) and spin-orbit coupling
(creating an effective p-wave channel). We identify the Feshbach resonance by
its associated atomic loss feature and show that, in agreement with our
single-channel scattering model, this feature is preserved and shifted as a
function of the spin-orbit coupling parameters.
