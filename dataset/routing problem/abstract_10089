We consider two classes of linear kinetic equations: with constant collision
frequency and constant mean free path of gas molecules (i.e., frequency of
molecular collisions, proportional to the modulus molecular velocity). Based
homogeneous Riemann boundary value problem with a coefficient equal to the
ratio of the boundary values dispersion function, develops the theory of the
half-space orthogonality of generalized singular eigenfunctions corresponding
characteristic equations, which leads separation of variables. And in this two
boundary value problems of the kinetic theory (diffusion light component of a
binary gas and Kramers problem about isothermal slip) shows the application of
the theory orthogonality eigenfunctions for analytical solutions these tasks.
