Motivated by tug-of-war games and asymptotic analysis of certain variational
problems, we consider a gradient constraint problem involving the infinity
Laplace operator. We prove that this problem always has a solution that is
unique if a certain regularity condition on the constraint is satisfied. If
this regularity condition fails, then solutions obtained from game theory and
$L^p$-approximation need not coincide.
