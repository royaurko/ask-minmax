In this article we extend the modern, powerful and simple abstract Hilbert
space strategy for proving hypocoercivity that has been developed originally by
Dolbeault, Mouhot and Schmeiser. As well-known, hypocoercivity methods imply an
exponential decay to equilibrium with explicit computable rate of convergence.
Our extension is now made for studying the long-time behavior of some strongly
continuous semigroup generated by a (degenerate) Kolmogorov backward operator
L. Additionally, we introduce several domain issues into the framework.
Necessary conditions for proving hypocoercivity need then only to be verified
on some fixed operator core of L. Furthermore, the setting is also suitable for
covering existence and construction problems as required in many applications.
The methods are applicable to various, different, Kolmogorov backward evolution
problems. As a main part, we apply the extended framework to the (degenerate)
spherical velocity Langevin equation. The latter can be seen as some kind of an
analogue to the classical Langevin equation in case spherical velocities are
required. This model is of important industrial relevance and describes the
fiber lay-down in the production process of nonwovens. For the construction of
the strongly continuous contraction semigroup we make use of modern
hypoellipticity tools and pertubation theory.
