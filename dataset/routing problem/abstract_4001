In this article we study the numerical approximation of incompressible
miscible displacement problems with a linearised Crank-Nicolson time
discretisation, combined with a mixed finite element and discontinuous Galerkin
method. At the heart of the analysis is the proof of convergence under low
regularity requirements. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method exhibits second-order convergence for smooth and robustness for rough
problems.
