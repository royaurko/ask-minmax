For the linear baryon string model with three massive points (three quarks)
connected sequentially by the relativistic strings the initial-boundary value
problem is stated and solved in general. This problem implies defining a
classical motion of the system on the base of given initial position and
initial velocities of string points. The given solution work reduces the
initial-boundary value problem for the considered model to the system of
ordinary differential equations that can be integrated numerically in general.
The examples of numerical simulation of the system motion are considered,
which, in particular, allow to answer to the old question about stability of a
flat uniform rotation of the linear string configuration.
