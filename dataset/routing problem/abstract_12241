We consider probabilistic automata on infinite words with acceptance defined
by safety, reachability, B\"uchi, coB\"uchi, and limit-average conditions. We
consider quantitative and qualitative decision problems. We present extensions
and adaptations of proofs for probabilistic finite automata and present a
complete characterization of the decidability and undecidability frontier of
the quantitative and qualitative decision problems for probabilistic automata
on infinite words.
