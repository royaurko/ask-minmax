We consider the problem of the motion of $N$ bodies in a self-gravitating
system in two spacetime dimensions. We point out that this system can be mapped
onto the quantum-mechanical problem of an N-body generalization of the problem
of the H$_{2}^{+}$ molecular ion in one dimension. The canonical gravitational
N-body formalism can be extended to include electromagnetic charges. We derive
a general algorithm for solving this problem, and show how it reduces to known
results for the 2-body and 3-body systems.
