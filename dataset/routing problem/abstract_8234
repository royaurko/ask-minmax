In this work we consider the Fu\u{c}ik problem for a family of weights
depending on $\ve$ with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. We study the
homogenization of the spectrum. We also deal with the special case of periodic
homogenization and we obtain the rate of convergence of the first non-trivial
curve of the spectrum.
