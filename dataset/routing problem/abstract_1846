The metal-insulator transition (MIT) is one of the most dramatic
manifestations of electron correlations in materials. Various mechanisms
producing MITs have been extensively considered, including the Mott (electron
localization via Coulomb repulsion), Anderson (localization via disorder) and
Peierls (localization via distortion of a periodic 1D lattice). One additional
route to a MIT proposed by Slater, in which long-range magnetic order in a
three dimensional system drives the MIT, has received relatively little
attention. Using neutron and X-ray scattering we show that the MIT in NaOsO3 is
coincident with the onset of long-range commensurate three dimensional magnetic
order. Whilst candidate materials have been suggested, our experimental
methodology allows the first definitive demonstration of the long predicted
Slater MIT. We discuss our results in the light of recent reports of a Mott
spin-orbit insulating state in other 5d oxides.
