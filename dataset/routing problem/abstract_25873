For the model of so-called coherent computing recently proposed by Yamamoto
et al. [Y. Yamamoto et al., New Gen. Comput. 30 (2012) 327-355], a theoretical
analysis of the success probability is given. Although it was claimed as their
prospect that the Ising spin configuration problem would be efficiently
solvable in the model, here it is shown that the probability of finding a
desired spin configuration decreases exponentially in the number of spins for
certain hard instances. The model is thus physically unfeasible for solving the
problem within a polynomial cost.
