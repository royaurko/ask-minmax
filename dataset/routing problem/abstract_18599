Besides the singularity problem, the famous Oppenheimer and Snyder solution
is discovered to be of deficiency in two aspects: the internal Friedmann
space-time does not have the inherent symmetry and cannot connect to the
external Schwarzschild space-time. So the process of gravitational collapse
described by this solution is doubtful. The deficiency, together with the
singularity problem, result from the imperfection of the field theory in
continuous space-time, which is expressed by the infinite precision function
theory. The space-time structure of the Oppenheimer and Snyder dust ball is
founded to be discrete rather than continuous, and to describe the field theory
in discrete space-time it requires a function theory with finite precision.
Based on the i order real number and its equivalence class, which is defined in
the real number field, the infinite precision function theory is extended to
the finite precision function theory. The Einstein field equations are
expressed in the form of finite precision, and then the collapsing dust ball
solution in continuous space-time is modified to a static ball solution in
discrete space-time. It solves all the problems of Oppenheimer and Snyder
solution and shows that, with Planck length and Planck time as space-time
quantum, a mechanism to resist the gravitational collapse could be obtained by
the discretization of space-time.
