We develop protocols that circumvent the laser noise limit in the stability
of optical clock comparisons by synchronous probing of two clocks using
phase-locked local oscillators. This allows for probe times longer than the
laser coherence time, avoids the Dick effect, and supports Heisenberg-limited
scaling of measurement precision. We present a model for such frequency
comparisons and develop numerical simulations of the protocol with realistic
noise sources. This provides a route to reduce frequency ratio measurement
durations by more than an order of magnitude as clock inaccuracies reach
1x10^-18.
