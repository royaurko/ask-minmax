In this paper, based on real-time nonlinear receding horizon control
methodology, a novel approach is developed for parameter estimation of time
invariant and time varying nonlinear dynamical systems in chaotic environ-
ments. Here, the parameter estimation problem is converted into a family of
?nite horizon optimization control problems. The corresponding receding hori-
zon control problem is then solved numerically, in real-time, without recourse
to any iterative approximation methods by introducing the stabilized continu-
ation method and backward sweep algorithm. The signi?cance of this work lies in
its real-time nature and its powerful results on nonlinear chaotic systems with
time varying parameters. The e?ective nature of the proposed method is
demonstrated on two chaotic systems, with time invariant and time varying
parameters. At the end, robustness performance of the proposed algorithm
against bounded noise is investigated.
