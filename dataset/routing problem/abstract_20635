We consider the problem of communicating over a channel for which no
mathematical model is specified. We present achievable rates as a function of
the channel input and output sequences known a-posteriori for discrete and
continuous channels. Furthermore we present a rate-adaptive scheme employing
feedback which achieves these rates asymptotically without prior knowledge of
the channel behavior.
