An inverse source problem for the heat equation is considered. Extraction
formulae for information about the time and location when and where the unknown
source of the equation firstly appeared are given from a single lateral
boundary measurement. New roles of the plane progressive wave solutions or
their complex versions for the backward heat equation are given.
