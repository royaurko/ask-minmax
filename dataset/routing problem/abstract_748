Traffic is essential for many dynamic processes on real networks, such as
internet and urban traffic systems. The transport efficiency of the traffic
system can be improved by taking full advantage of the resources in the system.
In this paper, we propose a dual-strategy routing model for network traffic
system, to realize the plenary utility of the whole network. The packets are
delivered according to different "efficient routing strategies" [Yan, et al,
Phys. Rev. E 73, 046108 (2006)]. We introduce the accumulate rate of packets,
{\eta} to measure the performance of traffic system in the congested phase, and
propose the so-called equivalent generation rate of packet to analyze the
jamming processes. From analytical and numerical results, we find that, for
suitable selection of strategies, the dual- strategy system performs better
than the single-strategy system in a broad region of strategy mixing ratio. The
analytical solution to the jamming processes is verified by estimating the
number of jammed nodes, which coincides well with the result from simulation.
