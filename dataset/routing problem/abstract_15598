The problem of relativistic stellar pulsations is studied in a somewhat ad
hoc approximation that ignores all fluid motions. This {\em Inverse Cowling
Approximation} (ICA) is motivated by two observations: 1) For highly damped
($w$-mode) oscillations the fluid plays very little role. 2) If the fluid
motion is neglected the problem for polar oscillation modes becomes similar to
that for axial modes. Using the ICA we find a polar mode spectrum that has all
features of the $w$-mode spectrum of the full problem. Moreover, in the limit
of superdense stars, we find the ICA spectrum to be qualitatively similar to
that of the axial modes. These results clearly show the importance of general
relativity for the pulsation modes of compact stars, and that there are modes
whose existence do not depend on motions of the fluid at all; pure
``spacetime'' modes.
