We discuss the problem of gauge invariance of the vector meson
photoproduction at small $x$ within the two-gluon exchange model. It is found
that the gauge invariance is fulfilled if one includes the graphs with higher
Fock states in the meson wave function. Obtained results are used to estimate
the amplitudes with longitudinal and transverse photon and vector meson
polarization.
