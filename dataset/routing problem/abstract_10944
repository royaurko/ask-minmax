We investigate variational methods for finding approximate solutions to the
Fokker-Planck equation, especially in cases lacking detailed balance. These
schemes fall into two classes: those in which a Hermitian operator is
constructed from the (non-Hermitian) Fokker-Planck operator, and those which
are based on soluble approximations to this operator. The various approaches
are first tested on a simple quantum-mechanical problem and then applied to a
toy Fokker-Planck equation. The problem of a particle moving in a potential and
subject to external non-white noise is then investigated using the formalism
developed earlier on in the paper.
