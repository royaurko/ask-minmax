Localization in wireless sensor networks not only provides a node with its
geographical location but also a basic requirement for other applications such
as geographical routing. Although a rich literature is available for
localization in static WSN, not enough work is done for mobile WSNs, owing to
the complexity due to node mobility. Most of the existing techniques for
localization in mobile WSNs uses Monte-Carlo localization, which is not only
time-consuming but also memory intensive. They, consider either the unknown
nodes or anchor nodes to be static. In this paper, we propose a technique
called Dead Reckoning Localization for mobile WSNs. In the proposed technique
all nodes (unknown nodes as well as anchor nodes) are mobile. Localization in
DRLMSN is done at discrete time intervals called checkpoints. Unknown nodes are
localized for the first time using three anchor nodes. For their subsequent
localizations, only two anchor nodes are used. The proposed technique estimates
two possible locations of a node Using Bezouts theorem. A dead reckoning
approach is used to select one of the two estimated locations. We have
evaluated DRLMSN through simulation using Castalia simulator, and is compared
with a similar technique called RSS-MCL proposed by Wang and Zhu .
