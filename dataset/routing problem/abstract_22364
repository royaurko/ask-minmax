We introduce a notion of variable quasi-Bregman monotone sequence which
unifies the notion of variable metric quasi-Fej\'er monotone sequences and that
of Bregman monotone sequences. The results are applied to analyze the
asymptotic behavior of proximal iterations based on variable Bregman distance
and of algorithms for solving convex feasibility problems in reflexive real
Banach spaces.
