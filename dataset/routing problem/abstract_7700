The relationship between entropy and information is reviewed, taking into
account that information is stored in macroscopic degrees of freedom, such as
the order parameter in a system exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is
shown that most problems of the relationship between entropy and information,
embodied in a variety of Maxwell demons, are also present in any symmetry
breaking transition.
