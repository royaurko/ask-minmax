We consider the Vertex Cover problem in intersection graphs of axis-parallel
rectangles on the plane. We present two algorithms: The first is an EPTAS for
non-crossing rectangle families, rectangle families $\calR$ where $R_1
\setminus R_2$ is connected for every pair of rectangles $R_1,R_2 \in \calR$.
This algorithm extends to intersection graphs of pseudo-disks. The second
algorithm achieves a factor of $(1.5 + \varepsilon)$ in general rectangle
families, for any fixed $\varepsilon > 0$, and works also for the weighted
variant of the problem. Both algorithms exploit the plane properties of
axis-parallel rectangles in a non-trivial way.
