When a strict local martingale is projected onto a subfiltration to which it
is not adapted, the local martingale property may be lost, and the finite
variation part of the projection may have singular paths. This phenomenon has
consequences for arbitrage theory in mathematical finance. In this paper it is
shown that the loss of the local martingale property is related to a measure
extension problem for the associated F\"{o}llmer measure. When a solution
exists, the finite variation part of the projection can be interpreted as the
compensator, under the extended measure, of the explosion time of the original
local martingale. In a topological setting, this leads to intuitive conditions
under which its paths are singular. The measure extension problem is then
solved in a Brownian framework, allowing an explicit treatment of several
interesting examples.
