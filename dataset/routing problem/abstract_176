This paper introduces a multi-period inspector scheduling problem (MPISP),
which is a new variant of the multi-trip vehicle routing problem with time
windows (VRPTW). In the MPISP, each inspector is scheduled to perform a route
in a given multi-period planning horizon. At the end of each period, each
inspector is not required to return to the depot but has to stay at one of the
vertices for recuperation. If the remaining time of the current period is
insufficient for an inspector to travel from his/her current vertex $A$ to a
certain vertex B, he/she can choose either waiting at vertex A until the start
of the next period or traveling to a vertex C that is closer to vertex B.
Therefore, the shortest transit time between any vertex pair is affected by the
length of the period and the departure time. We first describe an approach of
computing the shortest transit time between any pair of vertices with an
arbitrary departure time. To solve the MPISP, we then propose several local
search operators adapted from classical operators for the VRPTW and integrate
them into a tabu search framework. In addition, we present a constrained
knapsack model that is able to produce an upper bound for the problem. Finally,
we evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm with extensive experiments based
on a set of test instances. Our computational results indicate that our
approach generates high-quality solutions.
