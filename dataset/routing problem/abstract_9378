This paper addresses the problem of approximate MAP-MRF inference in general
graphical models. Following [36], we consider a family of linear programming
relaxations of the problem where each relaxation is specified by a set of
nested pairs of factors for which the marginalization constraint needs to be
enforced. We develop a generalization of the TRW-S algorithm [9] for this
problem, where we use a decomposition into junction chains, monotonic w.r.t.
some ordering on the nodes. This generalizes the monotonic chains in [9] in a
natural way. We also show how to deal with nested factors in an efficient way.
Experiments show an improvement over min-sum diffusion, MPLP and subgradient
ascent algorithms on a number of computer vision and natural language
processing problems.
