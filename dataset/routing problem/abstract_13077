In this paper, we propose a method to obtain a constrained approximation of a
rational B\'{e}zier curve by a polynomial B\'{e}zier curve. This problem is
reformulated as an approximation problem between two polynomial B\'{e}zier
curves based on weighted least-squares method, where weight functions
$\rho(t)=\omega(t)$ and $\rho(t)=\omega(t)^{2}$ are studied respectively. The
efficiency of the proposed method is tested using some examples.
