We propose a recursive least-squares method with multiple forgetting schemes
to track time-varying model parameters which change with different rates. Our
approach hinges on the reformulation of the classic recursive least-squares
with forgetting scheme as a regularized least squares problem. A simulation
study shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.
