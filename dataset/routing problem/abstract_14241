Given a non-deterministic timed automaton with silent transitions (eNTA), we
compute its timestamp: the set of all time values on which any observable
transition occurs, and also a deterministic timed automaton with the same
timestamp. The timestamp is eventually periodic and is constructed via a finite
periodic augmented region automaton. A consequence of this construction is the
periodicity of the language of timed automata with respect to suffixes.
Applications include the decidability of the 1-bounded language inclusion
problem for eNTA, and a partial method, not bounded by time or number of steps,
for the general language non-inclusion problem for eNTA.
