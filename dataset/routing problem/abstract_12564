This paper studies the current "identity crisis" caused by the substantial
security, privacy and usability shortcomings encountered in existing systems
for identity management. Some of these issues are well known, while others are
much less understood. This paper brings them together in a single,
comprehensive study and proposes recommendations to resolve or to mitigate the
problems. Some of these problems cannot be solved without substantial research
and development effort.
