We show that the problem of analyzing the outage probability in cellular
systems affected by co-channel interference and background noise is
mathematically equivalent to the problem of analyzing the wireless
information-theoretic security in terms of the maximum secrecy rate in fading
channels. Hence, these both apparently unrelated problems can be addressed by
using a common approach. We illustrate the applicability of the connection
unveiled herein to provide new results for the secrecy outage probability in
different scenarios.
