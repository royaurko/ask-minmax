We consider the well-posedness of models involving age structure and
non-linear diffusion. Such problems arise in the study of population dynamics.
It is shown how diffusion and age boundary conditions can be treated that
depend non-linearly and possibly non-locally on the density itself. The
abstract approach is depicted with examples.
