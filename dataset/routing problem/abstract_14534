We study here the Mobius type solutions for the n-body problem in a two
dimensional positive space form M^2_R. With methods of Mobius geometry and
using the Iwasawa decomposition of the Mobius group of automorphisms Mob_2
(M^2_R), we state algebraic functional conditions for the existence of such
type of solutions in M^2_R. We mention some examples of these type of
solutions.
