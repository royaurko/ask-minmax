To our best knowledge, there are no problem books on cosmology yet, that
would include its spectacular recent achievements. We believe there is a strong
need for such now, when cosmology is swiftly becoming a strict and vast
science, and the book would be extremely useful for the youth pouring in this
area of research. Indeed, the only way to rise over the popular level in any
science is to master its alphabet, that is, to learn to solve problems.
  Of course, most of modern textbooks on cosmology include problems. However, a
reader, exhausted by high theory, may often be thwarted by the lack of time and
strength to solve them. Might it be worth sometimes to change the tactics and
just throw those who wish to learn to swim into the water? We present an
updated version of the "Dynamics of the Universe in Problems" We have the
following new sections, 'Gravitational Waves', "Interactions in the Dark
Sector", "Horizons" and "Quantum Cosmology" . A number of new problems have
been added to almost every section. The total number of problems exceeds
fifteen hundred. Solutions to all the problems can be found at
