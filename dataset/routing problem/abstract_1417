We present a general model of disorder in Kondo alloys that, under certain
conditions, leads to non-Fermi liquid behavior. The central underlying idea is
the presence of a distribution of local Kondo temperature scales. If this
distribution is broad enough, such that there are sites with arbitrarily low
Kondo temperatures, a non-Fermi liquid phase is formed. We analyze
thermodynamics and transport in this approach and show it is consistent with a
number of Kondo alloys. We also compare the predictions of this model with the
measured dynamical magnetic response of these systems.
