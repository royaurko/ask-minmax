We consider radial solutions to the Cauchy problem for the linear wave
equation with a small short-range electromagnetic potential (the "square
version" of the massless Dirac equation with a potential) and zero initial
data. We prove two a priori estimates that imply, in particular, a dispersive
estimate.
