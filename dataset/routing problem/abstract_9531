In this work we study the problem of one-dimensional elastic collisions of
billiard balls, considered as rigid bodies, in a framework very different from
the classical one presented in text books. Implementing the notion of impedance
matching as a way to understand eficiency of energy transmission in elastic
collisions, we find a solution which frames the problem in terms of this
conception. We show that the mass of the ball can be seen as a measure of its
impedance and verify that the problem of maximum energy transfer in elastic
collisions can be thought of as a problem of impedance matching between
different media. This approach extends the concept of impedance, usually
associated with oscillatory systems, to system of rigid bodies.
