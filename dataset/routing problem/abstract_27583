In this paper we derive the symplectic framework for field theories defined
by higher-order Lagrangians. The construction is based on the symplectic
reduction of suitable spaces of iterated jets. The possibility of reducing a
higher-order system of PDEs to a constrained first-order one, the symplectic
structures naturally arising in the dynamics of a first-order Lagrangian
theory, and the importance of the Poincar\'e-Cartan form for variational
problems, are all well-established facts. However, their adequate combination
corresponding to higher-order theories is missing in the literature. Here we
obtain a consistent and truly finite-dimensional canonical formalism, as well
as a higher-order version of the Poincar\'e-Cartan form. In our exposition, the
rigorous global proofs of the main results are always accompanied by their
local coordinate descriptions, indispensable to work out practical examples.
