In this paper, we investigate the problem of designing the mobile elements
tours such that the length of each tour is below a per-determined length and
the depth of the multi-hop routing trees bounded by k. The path of the mobile
element is designed to visit subset of the nodes (cache points). These cache
points store other nodes data. To address this problem, we propose two
heuristic-based solutions. Our solutions take into consideration the
distribution of the nodes during the establishment of the tour. The results of
our experiments indicate that our schemes significantly outperforms the best
comparable scheme in the literature.
