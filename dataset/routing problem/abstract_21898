The method of alternating projections is a classical tool to solve
feasibility problems. Here we prove local convergence of alternating
projections between subanalytic sets $A,B$ under a mild regularity hypothesis
on one of the sets. We show that the speed of convergence is O$(k^{-\rho})$ for
some $\rho\in (0,\infty)$.
