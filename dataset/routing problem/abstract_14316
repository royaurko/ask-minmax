We study analytic surfaces in 3-dimensional Euclidean space containing two
circular arcs through each point. The problem of finding such surfaces traces
back to the works of Darboux from XIXth century. We reduce finding all such
surfaces to the algebraic problem of finding all Pythagorean 6-tuples of
polynomials. The reduction is based on the Schicho parametrization of surfaces
containing two conics through each point and a new approach using quaternionic
rational parametrization.
