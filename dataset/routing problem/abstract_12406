A transfer matrix function representation of the fundamental solution of the
general-type discrete Dirac system, corresponding to rectangular Schur
coefficients and Weyl functions, is obtained. Connections with Szeg\"o
recurrence, Schur coefficients and structured matrices are treated.
Borg-Marchenko-type uniqueness theorem is derived. Inverse problems on the
interval and semiaxis are solved.
