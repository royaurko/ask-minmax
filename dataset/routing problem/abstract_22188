Precise complexity results are derived for the model checking problems for
MTL (metric temporal logic) and TPTL (timed propositional temporal logic) on
(in)finite data words and deterministic one-counter machines. Depending on the
number of register variables and the encoding of numbers in constraints (unary
or binary), the complexity is either P-complete or PSPACE-complete.
