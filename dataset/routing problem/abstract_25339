The two dimensional directed sandpile with dissipation is transformed into a
(1+1) dimensional problem with discrete space and continuous `time'. The master
equation for the conditional probability that K grains preserve their initial
order during an avalanche can thereby be solved exactly, and an explicit
expression is given for the asymptotic form of the solution for an infinite as
well as for a semi-infinite lattice in the horizontal direction. Non-trivial
scaling is found in both cases. This conditional probability of the sandpile
model is shown to be equal to a K-spin correlation function of the Heisenberg
XX spin chain, and the sandpile problem is also shown to be equivalent to the
`random-turns' version of vicious walkers.
