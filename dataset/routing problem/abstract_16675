Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave activity is ubiquitous in the solar
atmosphere. MHD seismology aims to determine difficult to measure physical
parameters in solar atmospheric magnetic and plasma structures by a combination
of observed and theoretical properties of MHD waves and oscillations. This
technique, similar to seismology or helio-seismology, demands the solution of
two problems. The direct problem involves the computation of wave properties of
given theoretical models. The inverse problem implies the calculation of
unknown physical parameters, by means of a comparison of observed and
theoretical wave properties. Solar atmospheric seismology has been successfully
applied to different structures such as coronal loops, prominence fine
structures, spicules, or jets. However, it is still in its infancy. Far more is
there to come. We present an overview of recent results, with particular
emphasis in the inversion procedure.
