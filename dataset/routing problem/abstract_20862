Brownian motion of particle interacting with atoms of ideal gas is discussed
as a key problem of kinetics lying at the border between ``dead'' systems like
the Lorentz gas or formal constructs of conceptual Boltzmannian kinetics and
actual ``alive'' systems like mere gas possessing scaleless (1/f) fluctuations
in their kinetic characteristics (e.g. in diffusuvity and mobility of the
``Brownian particle'').
