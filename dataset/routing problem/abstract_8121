We enhance the analogy between field extensions and covering spaces by
introducing the concept of splitting covering which correspondences to the
splitting field in Galois theory. We define semi-topological Galois groups for
Weierstrass polynomials and prove the existence of a Galois correspondence.
This new tool enables us to study the inverse Galois problem from a new
viewpoint.
