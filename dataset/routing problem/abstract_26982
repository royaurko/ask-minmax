We consider the problem of computing the distance-dependent two-point
function of general planar maps and hypermaps, i.e. the problem of counting
such maps with two marked points at a prescribed distance. The maps considered
here may have faces of arbitrarily large degree, which requires new bijections
to be tackled. We obtain exact expressions for the following cases: general and
bipartite maps counted by their number of edges, 3-hypermaps and
3-constellations counted by their number of dark faces, and finally general and
bipartite maps counted by both their number of edges and their number of faces.
