Quantum field theory predicts that vacuum energy (or what is the same,
cosmological constant) should be 50-100 orders of magnitude larger than the
existing astronomical limit. A very brief review of possible solutions of this
problem is presented. A mechanism of adjustment of vacuum energy down to
(almost) zero by the back-reaction of massless vector or second rank tensor
fields is discussed.
