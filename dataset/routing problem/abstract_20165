We consider the problem of Arnold Diffusion for nearly integrable partially
isochronous Hamiltonian systems with three time scales. By means of a careful
shadowing analysis, based on a variational technique, we prove that, along
special directions, Arnold diffusion takes place with fast (polynomial) speed,
even though the ``splitting determinant'' is exponentially small.
