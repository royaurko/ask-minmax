We present the conditions under which probabilistic error-free discrimination
of mixed states is possible, and provide upper and lower bounds on the maximum
probability of success for the case of two mixed states. We solve certain
special cases exactly, and demonstrate how the problems of state filtering and
state comparison can be recast as problems of mixed state unambiguous
discrimination.
