An optimized broadcast protocol is proposed for VANETs. It is based on two
key information: the direction to the destination and the beamforming angle
{\theta}. The efficiency of this technique is demonstrated in terms of packet
delivery, bandwidth gain and probability of transmission success. An analytical
model is developed to calculate the transmission area. This model allows
capturing the propagation shape of the forwarding area. Comparisons with
simulations show that the analytical model is precise.
