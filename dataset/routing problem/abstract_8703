In this paper, by using the theory of elliptic curves, we discuss several
Diophantine equations related with the so-called figurate primes. Meanwhile, we
raise several conjectures related with figurate primes and Hilbert's 8th
problem, including Goldbach's conjecture, twin primes conjecture and Catalan's
conjecture as well.
