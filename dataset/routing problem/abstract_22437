Inspired by a classic paper by Knuth, we revisit the problem of drawing
flowcharts of loop-free algorithms, that is, degree-three series-parallel
digraphs. Our drawing algorithms show that it is possible to produce Knuthian
drawings of degree-three series-parallel digraphs with good aspect ratios and
small numbers of edge bends.
