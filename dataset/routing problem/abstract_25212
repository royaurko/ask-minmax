We show that the degree of the images of the moduli space of (principally
polarized) abelian varieties A_g and of the moduli space of curves M_g in the
projective space under the theta constant embedding are equal to the top
self-intersection numbers of one half the first Hodge class on them. This
allows us to obtain an explicit formula for the degree of A_g, and an explicit
upper bound for the degree of M_g.
  Knowing the degree of A_g allows us to effectively determine the subvariety
itself, i.e. to effectively obtain all polynomial equations satisfied by theta
constants. Furthermore, combining the bound on the degree of M_g with effective
Nullstellensatz allows us to rewrite the Kadomtsev-Petvsiashvili (KP) partial
differential equation as a system of algebraic equations for theta constants,
and thus obtain an effective algebraic solution to the Schottky problem.
