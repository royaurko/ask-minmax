The conditions that lead to self-regulated star formation, star bursts and
the formation of massive stellar clusters are discussed. Massive stars have a
strong impact on their environment, especially on the evolution of dwarf
galaxies which are the building blocks of giant galaxies. Energy input by
massive young clusters might help to solve some of the most important puzzles
of galaxy formation: the cosmological substructure problem and the angular
momentum problem.
