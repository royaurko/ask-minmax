We propose a minimal modification of the standard model, remarkable in its
simplicity, which may solve the strong CP problem. It employs three Higgs
doublets with interactions taken to be invariant under a flavor symmetry. Both
CP and the flavor symmetry are softly broken by Higgs boson mass terms. In tree
approximation, quark mass matrices are triangular and arg det M vanishes,
Radiative corrections yield a tiny and tolerable value of theta-bar.
