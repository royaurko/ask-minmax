A lattice version of the Dirac-Kaehler equation (DKE) describing fermions was
discussed in articles by Becher and Joos. The decomposition of lattice
Dirac-Kaehler fields (inhomogeneous cochains) to lattice Dirac fields remained
as an open problem. I show that it is possible to extract Dirac fields from the
DKE and discuss the resulting lattice Dirac equation.
