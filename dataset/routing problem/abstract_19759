I discuss possible implications a symmetry relating gravity with antigravity
might have for smoothing out of the cosmological constant puzzle. For this
purpose, a very simple model with spontaneous symmetry breaking is explored,
that is based on Einstein-Hilbert gravity with two self-interacting scalar
fields. The second (exotic) scalar particle with negative energy density, could
be interpreted, alternatively, as an antigravitating particle with positive
energy.
