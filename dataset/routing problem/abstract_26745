If $G$ is a Lie group, $H\subset G$ is a closed subgroup, and $\tau$ is a
unitary representation of $H$, then the contributors give a sufficient condition on
$\xi\in i\mathfrak{g}^*$ to be in the wave front set of
$\operatorname{Ind}_H^G\tau$. In the special case where $\tau$ is the trivial
representation, this result was conjectured by Howe. If $G$ is a real,
reductive algebraic group and $\pi$ is a unitary representation of $G$ that is
weakly contained in the regular representation, then the contributors give a
geometric description of $\operatorname{WF}(\pi)$ in terms of the direct
integral decomposition of $\pi$ into irreducibles. Special cases of this result
were previously obtained by Kashiwara-Vergne, Howe, and Rossmann. The contributors
give applications to harmonic analysis problems and branching problems.
