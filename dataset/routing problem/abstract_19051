We give an overview of recent developments in Sturm-Liouville theory
concerning operators of transmutation (transformation) and spectral parameter
power series (SPPS). The possibility to write down the dispersion
(characteristic) equations corresponding to a variety of spectral problems
related to Sturm-Liouville equations in an analytic form is an attractive
feature of the SPPS method. It is based on a computation of certain systems of
recursive integrals. Considered as families of functions these systems are
complete in the $L_{2}$-space and result to be the images of the nonnegative
integer powers of the independent variable under the action of a corresponding
transmutation operator. This recently revealed property of the Delsarte
transmutations opens the way to apply the transmutation operator even when its
integral kernel is unknown and gives the possibility to obtain further
interesting properties concerning the Darboux transformed Schr\"{o}dinger
operators.
  We introduce the systems of recursive integrals and the SPPS approach,
explain some of its applications to spectral problems with numerical
illustrations, give the definition and basic properties of transmutation
operators, introduce a parametrized family of transmutation operators, study
their mapping properties and construct the transmutation operators for Darboux
transformed Schr\"{o}dinger operators.
