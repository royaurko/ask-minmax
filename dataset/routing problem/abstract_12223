.i.e., User System Communication / Human Machine Interface, Meta Data
extraction, Information processing & management and Data representation are
discussed in this research paper. To contribute in the field we have proposed
and described an intelligent semantic oriented agent based search engine
including the concepts of intelligent graphical user interface, natural
language based information processing, data management and data reconstruction
