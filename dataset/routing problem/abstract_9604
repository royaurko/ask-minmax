The Nonlinear stability of triangular equilibrium points has been discussed
in the generalised photogravitational restricted three body problem with
Poynting-Robertson drag. The problem is generalised in the sense that smaller
primary is supposed to be an oblate spheroid. The bigger primary is considered
as radiating. We have performed first and second order normalization of the
Hamiltonian of the problem. We have applied KAM theorem to examine the
condition of non-linear stability. We have found three critical mass ratios.
Finally we conclude that triangular points are stable in the nonlinear sense
except three critical mass ratios at which KAM theorem fails.
