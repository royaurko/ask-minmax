We reconsider the massless up quark solution of the strong CP problem. We
show that an anomaly free horizontal symmetry can naturally lead to a massless
up quark and to a corresponding accidental anomalous symmetry. Reviewing the
controversy about the phenomenological viability of $m_u=0$ we conclude that
this possiblity is still open and can solve the strong CP problem. To appear in
