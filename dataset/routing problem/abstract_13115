After reviewing the Hermitian one matrix model, we will give a brief
introduction to the Hermitian two matrix model and present a summary of some
recent results on the asymptotic behavior of the two matrix model with a
quartic potential. In particular, we will discuss a limiting kernel in the
quartic/quadratic case that is constructed out of a $4\times 4$ Riemann-Hilbert
problem related to Painlev\'e II equation. Also an open problem will be
presented.
