We study a two-phase modified Stefan problem modeling solid combustion and
nonequilibrium phase transition. The problem is known to exhibit a variety of
non-trivial dynamical scenarios. We develop a priori estimates and establish
well-posedness of the problem in weighted spaces of continuous functions. The
estimates secure sufficient decay of solutions that allows for an analysis in
Hilbert spaces. We demonstrate existence of compact attractors in the weighted
spaces and prove that the attractor consists of sufficiently regular functions.
This allows us to show that the Hausdorff dimension of the attractor is finite.
