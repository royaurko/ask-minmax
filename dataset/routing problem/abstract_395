Organization, scalability and routing have been identified as key problems
hindering viability and commercial success of mobile ad hoc networks.
Clustering of mobile nodes among separate domains has been proposed as an
efficient approach to address those issues. In this work, we introduce an
efficient distributed clustering algorithm that uses both location and energy
metrics for cluster formation. Our proposed solution mainly addresses cluster
stability, manageability and energy efficiency issues. Also, unlike existing
active clustering methods, our algorithm relieves the network from the
unnecessary burden of control messages broadcasting, especially for relatively
static network topologies. This is achieved through adapting broadcast period
according to mobile nodes mobility pattern. The efficiency, scalability and
competence of our algorithm against alternative approaches have been
demonstrated through simulation results.
