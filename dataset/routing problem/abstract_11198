The Weyl anomaly problem is treated within a purely geometrical context.
Arguments are given that hint at a possible classical origin of the conformal
anomaly in the Riemannian nature of the background geometry where the matter
fields play out their dynamics. Some considerations allowing for a possible
resolution of the Weyl anomaly problem are briefly outlined. Following the
spirit of the standard model of the fundamental interactions, it is argued that
the Weyl anomaly should be a consequence of the breaking of the gauge symmetry
at some stage during the evolution of the universe.
