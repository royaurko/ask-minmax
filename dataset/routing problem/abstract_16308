The Heston stochastic volatility process is a degenerate diffusion process
where the degeneracy in the diffusion coefficient is proportional to the square
root of the distance to the boundary of the half-plane. The generator of this
process with killing, called the elliptic Heston operator, is a second-order,
degenerate-elliptic partial differential operator, where the degeneracy in the
operator symbol is proportional to the distance to the boundary of the
half-plane. In mathematical finance, solutions to obstacle problem for the
elliptic Heston operator correspond to value functions for perpetual
American-style options on the underlying asset. With the aid of weighted
Sobolev spaces and weighted Holder spaces, we establish the optimal $C^{1,1}$
regularity (up to the boundary of the half-plane) for solutions to obstacle
problems for the elliptic Heston operator when the obstacle functions are
sufficiently smooth.
