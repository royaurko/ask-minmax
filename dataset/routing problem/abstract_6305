By a recent result obtained by R. Howlett and the contributor considerable
progress has been made towards a complete solution of the isomorphism problem
for Coxeter groups. In this paper we give a survey on the isomorphism problem
and explain in particular how the result mentioned above reduces it to its
`reflection preserving' version. Furthermore we desrcibe recent developments
concerning the solution of the latter.
