We characterize methods of dividing a cake between two bidders in a way that
is incentive-compatible and Pareto-efficient. In our cake cutting model, each
bidder desires a subset of the cake (with a uniform value over this subset),
and is allocated some subset. Our characterization proceeds via reducing to a
simple one-dimensional version of the problem, and yields, for example, a tight
bound on the social welfare achievable.
