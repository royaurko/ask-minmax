In the constraint programming framework, state-of-the-art static and dynamic
decomposition techniques are hard to apply to problems with complete initial
constraint graphs. For such problems, we propose a hybrid approach of these
techniques in the presence of global constraints. In particular, we solve the
subgraph isomorphism problem. Further we design specific heuristics for this
hard problem, exploiting its special structure to achieve decomposition. The
underlying idea is to precompute a static heuristic on a subset of its
constraint network, to follow this static ordering until a first problem
decomposition is available, and to switch afterwards to a fully propagated,
dynamically decomposing search. Experimental results show that, for sparse
graphs, our decomposition method solves more instances than dedicated,
state-of-the-art matching algorithms or standard constraint programming
approaches.
