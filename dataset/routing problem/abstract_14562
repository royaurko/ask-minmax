On a Kahler manifold there is a clear connection between the complex
geometry and underlying Riemannian geometry. However, in the non-Kahler
setting, such a link is not so obvious. We study the existence of non-Kahler
Hermitian metrics for which a certain relationship between the Riemannian and
Chern scalar curvatures holds allowing a simple and intuitive geometric picture
to be drawn from the Chern scalar curvature. Additionally, this relationship
motivates the question of existence for non-csc-Kahler simultaneous solutions
to the Riemannian (classical) and Chern Yamabe problems, and we prove a
non-existence result which indicates a lack of such solutions.
