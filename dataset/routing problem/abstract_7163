It was the problem of finding the minimum value of the sum of the distances
of the path through all cities Overview TSP. We propose an authentication with
the problem that the deformation sum of the distances of the path to be a
constant value. In this document, it is intended to construct an authentication
function robust implementation is easy and the Blog. After it was shown that
the first, to determine the replacement group and path are the same, we propose
the authentication method to consider the deformation of the traveling salesman
problem in the directed graph, using a sequence of bytes. Instead of providing
illumination mathematically rigorous, describes a verifiable algorithm.
