We study the problem of selecting a member of a set of agents based on
impartial nominations by agents from that set. The problem was studied
previously by Alon et al. and Holzman and Moulin and has important applications
in situations where representatives are selected from within a group or where
publishing or funding decisions are made based on a process of peer review. Our
main result concerns a randomized mechanism that in expectation awards the
prize to an agent with at least half the maximum number of nominations. Subject
to impartiality, this is best possible.
