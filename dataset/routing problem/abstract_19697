First order perturbations for the fields with spin on the background metric
of the gravitational shock waves are discussed. Applying the Newman -- Penrose
formalism, exact solutions of the perturbation equations are obtained. For
particle physics, this would be one approach to the problem of scattering
paticle at Planck energy.
