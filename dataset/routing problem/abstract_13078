In this tutorial, we illustrate through examples how we can combine two
classical models, namely those of pushdown automata (PDA) and timed automata,
in order to obtain timed pushdown automata (TPDA). Furthermore, we describe how
the reachability problem for TPDAs can be reduced to the reachability problem
for PDAs.
