It is a longstanding problem whether every contractible Banach algebra is
necessarily finite-dimensional. In this note, we confirm this for Banach
algebras acting on Banach spaces with the uniform approximation property. This
generalizes a result of Paulsen and Smith who proved the same for Banach
algebras acting on Hilbert spaces.
