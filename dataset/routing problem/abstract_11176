We suggest a method of construction of general diffeomorphism invariant
boundary conditions for metric fluctuations. The case of $d+1$ dimensional
Euclidean disk is studied in detail. The eigenvalue problem for the Laplace
operator on metric perturbations is reduced to that on $d$-dimensional vector,
tensor and scalar fields. Explicit form of the eigenfunctions of the Laplace
operator is derived. We also study restrictions on boundary conditions which
are imposed by hermiticity of the Laplace operator.
