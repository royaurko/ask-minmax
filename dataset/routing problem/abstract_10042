In this paper a class of single machine scheduling problems is discussed. It
is assumed that job parameters, such as processing times, due dates, or weights
are uncertain and their values are specified in the form of a discrete scenario
set. The Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) aggregation operator is used to
choose an optimal schedule. The OWA operator generalizes traditional criteria
in decision making under uncertainty, such as the maximum, average, median or
Hurwicz criterion. It also allows us to extend the robust approach to
scheduling by taking into account various attitudes of decision makers towards
the risk. In this paper a general framework for solving single machine
scheduling problems with the OWA criterion is proposed and some positive and
negative computational results for two basic single machine scheduling problems
are provided.
