We prove the local-global principle holds for the problem of representations
of quadratic forms by quadratic forms, in codimension $\geq 7$. The proof uses
the ergodic theory of $p$-adic groups, together with a fairly general
observation on the structure of orbits of an arithmetic group acting on
integral points of a variety.
