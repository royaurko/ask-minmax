A generalization of the Gram-Schmidt procedure is achieved by providing
equations for updating and downdating oblique projectors. The work is motivated
by the problem of adaptive signal representation outside the orthogonal basis
setting. The proposed techniques are shown to be relevant to the problem of
discriminating signals produced by different phenomena when the order of the
signal model needs to be adjusted.
