General exact solution is obtained for the problem of the development of
arbitrary disturbances of the density and velocity in a (1+1)-dimensional
universe. This analytical solution may serve, particularly, as a test for
numerical methods. For an illustration, the nonlinear distortion of a
sinusoidal perturbation of the initial density is calculated.
