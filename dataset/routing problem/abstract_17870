This paper deals with the class of Q-tensors, that is, a Q-tensor is a real
tensor $\mathcal{A}$ such that the tensor complementarity problem $(\q,
\mathcal{A})$:
  $$\mbox{ finding } \x \in \mathbb{R}^n\mbox{ such that }\x \geq \0, \q +
\mathcal{A}\x^{m-1} \geq \0, \mbox{ and }\x^\top (\q + \mathcal{A}\x^{m-1}) =
0, $$ has a solution for each vector $\q \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Several subclasses
of Q-tensors are given: P-tensors, R-tensors, strictly semi-positive tensors
and semi-positive R$_0$-tensors. We prove that a nonnegative tensor is a
Q-tensor if and only if all of its diagonal entries are positive, and a
symmetric tensor is a Q-tensor if and only if it is strictly copositive. We
also show that the zero vector is the unique feasible solution of the tensor
complementarity problem $(\q, \mathcal{A})$ for $\q\geq\0$ if $\mathcal{A}$ is
a nonnegative Q-tensor.
