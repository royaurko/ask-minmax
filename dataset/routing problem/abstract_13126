A revised weight-coded evolutionary algorithm (RWCEA) is proposed for solving
multidimensional knapsack problems. This RWCEA uses a new decoding method and
incorporates a heuristic method in initialization. Computational results show
that the RWCEA performs better than a weight-coded evolutionary algorithm
proposed by Raidl (1999) and to some existing benchmarks, it can yield better
results than the ones reported in the OR-library.
