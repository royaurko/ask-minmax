In this invited contribution, we revisit the stochastic shortest path
problem, and show how recent results allow one to improve over the classical
solutions: we present algorithms to synthesize strategies with multiple
guarantees on the distribution of the length of paths reaching a given target,
rather than simply minimizing its expected value. The concepts and algorithms
that we propose here are applications of more general results that have been
obtained recently for Markov decision processes and that are described in a
series of recent papers.
