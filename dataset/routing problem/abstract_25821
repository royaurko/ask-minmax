Let $G$ be a finite group and $B_{0}(G)$ be its Bogomolov multiplier, i.e.,
the subgroup of the Schur multiplier $H^{2}(G,\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})$
consisting of cohomology classes whose restrictions to all bicyclic subgroups
are zero. This important invariant can be served as an obstruction to answer
the classical Noether's problem over $\mathbb{C}$. For instance, Bogomolov
\cite{Bog1988} found a group $G$ of order $p^{6}$ with $B_{0}(G)\neq 0$ for any
prime number $p$, so that the classical Noether's problem for $(G, \mathbb{C})$
has a negative answer. Recently, all nonabelian groups of order 64 with
nontrivial Bogomolov multiplier was classified by Chu et al. \cite{CHKK2010}.
In this paper, we will calculate the Bogomolov multiplier of some nonabelian
groups of order $p^{6}$ for any prime $p>3$.
