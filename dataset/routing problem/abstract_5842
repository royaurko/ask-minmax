The lifting problem that we consider asks: given a smooth curve in
characteristic p and a group of automorphisms, can we lift the curve, along
with the automorphisms, to characteristic zero? One can reduce this to a local
question (the so-called local lifting problem) involving continuous group
actions on formal power series rings. In this expository article, we overview
much of the progress that has been made toward determining when the local
lifting problem has a solution, and we give a taste of the work currently being
undertaken. Of particular interest is the case when the group of automorphisms
is cyclic. In this case the lifting problem is expected to be solvable---this
is the Oort conjecture.
