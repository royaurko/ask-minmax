We consider the problem of hypotheses testing with the basic simple
hypothesis: observed sequence of points corresponds to stationary Poisson
process with known intensity. The alternatives are stationary self-exciting
point processes. We consider one-sided parametric and one-sided nonparametric
composite alternatives and construct locally asymptotically uniformly most
powerful tests. The results of numerical simulations of the tests are
presented.
