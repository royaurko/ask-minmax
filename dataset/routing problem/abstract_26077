We study the dynamics of some uniform learning strategy limits or a
probabilistic version of the "Kolkata Paise Restaurant" problem, where N agents
choose among N equally priced but differently ranked restaurants every evening
such that each agent can get dinner in the best possible ranked restaurant
(each serving only one customer and the rest arriving there going without
dinner that evening). We consider the learning to be uniform among the agents
and assume that each follow the same probabilistic strategy dependent on the
information of the past successes in the game. The numerical results for
utilization of the restaurants in some limiting cases are analytically
examined.
