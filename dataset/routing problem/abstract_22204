In this paper we study spectral function for a nonsymmetric differential
operator on the half line. Two cases of the coefficient matrix are considered,
and for each case we prove by Marchenko's method that, to the boundary value
problem, there corresponds a spectral function related to which a
Marchenko-Parseval equality and an expansion formula are established. Our
results extend the classical spectral theory for self-adjoint Sturm-Liouville
operators and Dirac operators.
