In this survey, we report on progress concerning families of projective
curves with fixed number and fixed (topological or analytic) types of
singularities. We are, in particular, interested in numerical, universal and
asymptotically proper sufficient conditions to guarantee the nonemptyness,
T-smoothness and irreducibility of the variety of all projective curves with
prescribed singularities in a fixed linear system. We also discuss the
analogous problem for hypersurfaces of arbitrary dimension with isolated
singularities, and we close with a section on open problems and conjectures.
