An exact analytical method for determining the Lagrangian velocity
correlation and the diffusion coefficient for particles moving in a stochastic
velocity field is derived. It applies to divergence-free 2-dimensional Gaussian
stochastic fields which are stationary, homogeneous and have factorized
Eulerian correlations.
