The linear magnetoelectric (ME) effect provides a special route for linking
magnetic and electric properties. In microwaves, a local ME effect appears due
to the dynamical symmetry breakings of magnetic-dipolar modes (MDMs) in a
ferrite disk particle. The fact that for MDMs in a ferrite disk one has evident
both classical and quantum-like attributes, puts special demands on the methods
used for study of interacting ME particles. A proper model for coupled
particles should be based on the spectral characteristics of MDM oscillations
and an analysis of the overlap integrals for interacting eigen oscillating ME
elements. In this paper, we present theoretical studies of spectral properties
of literally coupled of MDM ME disks. We show that there exists the "exchange"
mechanism of interaction between the particles, which is distinctive from the
magnetostatic interaction between magnetic dipoles. The spectral method
proposed in this paper may further the development of a theory of ME
"molecules" and realization of local ME composites.
