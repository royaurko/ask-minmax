Agents' judgment depends on perception and previous knowledge. Assuming that
previous knowledge depends on perception, we can say that judgment depends on
perception. So, if judgment depends on perception, can agents judge that they
have the same perception? In few words, this is the addressed paradox through
this document. While illustrating on the paradox, it's found that to reach
agreement in communication, it's not necessary for parties to have the same
perception however the necessity is to have perception correspondence. The
attempted solution to this paradox reveals a potential uncertainty in judging
the matter thus supporting the skeptical view of the problem. Moreover,
relating perception to intelligence, the same uncertainty is inherited by
judging the level of intelligence of an agent compared to others not
necessarily from the same kind (e.g. machine intelligence compared to human
intelligence). Using a proposed simple mathematical model for perception and
action, a tool is developed to construct scenarios, and the problem is
addressed mathematically such that conclusions are drawn systematically based
on mathematically defined properties. When it comes to formalization,
philosophical arguments and views become more visible and explicit.
