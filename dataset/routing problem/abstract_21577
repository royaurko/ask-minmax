This paper investigates self-maps T from X to X which satisfy a distance
constraint in a metric space which mixed point-dependent non-expansive
properties, or in particular contractive ones, and potentially expansive
properties related to some distance threshold. The above mentioned constraint
is feasible in certain real -world problems.
