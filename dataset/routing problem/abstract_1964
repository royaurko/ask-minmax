We demonstrate a cascaded optical link for ultrastable frequency
dissemination comprised of two compensated links of 150 km and a repeater
station. Each link includes 114 km of Internet fiber simultaneously carrying
data traffic through a dense wavelength division multiplexing technology, and
passes through two routing centers of the telecommunication network. The
optical reference signal is inserted in and extracted from the communication
network using bidirectional optical add-drop multiplexers. The repeater station
operates autonomously ensuring noise compensation on the two links and the
ultra-stable signal optical regeneration. The compensated link shows a
fractional frequency instability of 3 \times 10-15 at one second measurement
time and 5 \times 10-20 at 20 hours. This work paves the way to a wide
dissemination of ultra-stable optical clock signals between distant
laboratories via the Internet network.
