In this paper, we consider robust stability analysis of large-scale sparsely
interconnected uncertain systems. By modeling the interconnections among the
subsystems with integral quadratic constraints, we show that robust stability
analysis of such systems can be performed by solving a set of sparse linear
matrix inequalities. We also show that a sparse formulation of the analysis
problem is equivalent to the classical formulation of the robustness analysis
problem and hence does not introduce any additional conservativeness. The
sparse formulation of the analysis problem allows us to apply methods that rely
on efficient sparse factorization techniques, and our numerical results
illustrate the effectiveness of this approach compared to methods that are
based on the standard formulation of the analysis problem.
