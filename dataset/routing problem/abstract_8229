We study the existence of positive increasing radial solutions for
superlinear Neumann problems in the ball. We do not impose any growth condition
on the nonlinearity at infinity and our assumptions allow for interactions with
the spectrum. In our approach we use both topological and variational
arguments, and we overcome the lack of compactness by considering the cone of
nonnegative, nondecreasing radial functions of H^1.
