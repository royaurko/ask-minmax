In recent years, information security essential in various arenas like
internet communication, multimedia systems, medical imaging, tele-medicine and
military communication. However, most of them faced with some problems such as
the lack of robustness and security. In this letter, after reviewing the main
points of the chaotic trigonometric maps and the coupled map lattices, we
introduce the scheme of chaos-based image encryption based on coupled map lat
tices. The scheme decreases periodic effect of the ergodic dynamical systems in
the chaos-based image encryption. To evaluate the security of the encrypted
image of this scheme, the key space analysis, the correlation of two adjacent
pixels and differential attack were performed. This scheme tries to improve the
problem of failure of encryption such as small key space and level of security.
