Acceptable but due to extensive usage of a computer rather unpleasant proof
of the famous four color map problem of Francis Guthrie were settled eventually
by W. Appel and K. Haken in 1976. Using the same method but shortening the
proof twenty years later by another team, namely N. Robertson, D.P. Sanders,
P.D. Seymour and R. Thomas would not improve considerably the readability of
the proof either. Thus it has been widely accepted the need of more elegant and
readable proof. There are considerable number of equivalent formulations of the
problem but none of them promising for a possible non-computer proofs. On the
other hand known proofs are used the concept of Kempe chain and reducibility of
the configurations which were a century old ideas. With these in mind we have
introduced a new concept which we call "spiral chains" in the maximal planar
graphs. We have shown that for any maximal graph as long as spiral chains are
being used we do not need the fifth color. Henceforth this paper offers another
proof to the four color theorem which is not based on deep and abstract
theories from the other branches of mathematics or using computing power of
computers, but rather completely on a new idea in graph theory.
