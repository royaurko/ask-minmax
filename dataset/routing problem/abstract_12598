We study the inverse boundary value problems for the Schr\"{o}dinger
equations with Yang-Mills potentials in a bounded domain $\Omega_0\subset\R^n$
containing finite number of smooth obstacles $\Omega_j,1\leq j \leq r$. We
prove that the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator on $\partial\Omega_0$ determines
the gauge equivalence class of the Yang-Mills potentials. We also prove that
the metric tensor can be recovered up to a diffeomorphism that is identity on
$\partial\Omega_0$.
