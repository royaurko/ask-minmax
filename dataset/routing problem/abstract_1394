We study three new versions of the All-Ones Problem and the Minimum All-Ones
Problem. The original All-Ones Problem is simply called the Vertex-Vertex
Problem, and the three new versions are called the Vertex-Edge Problem, the
Edge-Vertex Problem and the Edge-Edge Problem, respectively. The Vertex-Vertex
Problem has been studied extensively. For example, existence of solutions and
efficient algorithms for finding solutions were obtained, and the Minimum
Vertex-Vertex Problem for general graphs was shown to be NP-complete and for
trees it can be solved in linear time, etc. In this paper, for the Vertex-Edge
Problem, we show that a graph has a solution if and only if it is bipartite,
and therefore it has only two possible solutions and optimal solutions. A
linear program version is also given. For the Edge-Vertex Problem, we show that
a graph has a solution if and only if it contains even number of vertices. By
showing that the Minimum Edge-Vertex Problem can be polynomially transformed
into the Minimum Weight Perfect Matching Problem, we obtain that the Minimum
Edge-Vertex Problem can be solved in polynomial time in general. The Edge-Edge
Problem is reduced to the Vertex-Vertex Problem for the line graph of a graph.
