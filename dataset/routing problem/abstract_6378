The Coulomb problem for continuous charge distributions is a central problem
in physics. Powerful methods, that scale linearly with system size and that
allow us to use different resolutions in different regions of space are
therefore highly desirable. Using wavelet based Multi Resolution Analysis we
derive for the first time a method which has these properties. The power and
accuracy of the method is illustrated by applying it to the calculation of of
the electrostatic potential of a full three-dimensional all-electron Uranium
dimer.
