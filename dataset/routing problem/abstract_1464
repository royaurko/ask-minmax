There are numerous potential applications for superconducting tapes, based on
YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO) films coated onto metallic substrates. A long established
goal of more than 15 years has been to understand the magnetic flux pinning
mechanisms which allow films to maintain high current densities out to high
magnetic fields. In fact, films carry 1-2 orders of magnitude higher current
densities than any other form of the material. For this reason, the idea of
further improving pinning has received little attention. Now that
commercialisation of conductors is much closer, for both better performance and
lower fabrication costs, an important goal is to achieve enhanced pinning in a
practical way. In this work, we demonstrate a simple and industrially scaleable
route which yields a 1.5 to 5-fold improvement in the in-field current
densities of already-high-quality conductors.
