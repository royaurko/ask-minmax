We consider the inverse problem of determining the Winkler subgrade reaction
coefficient of a slab foundation modelled as a thin elastic plate clamped at
the boundary. The plate is loaded by a concentrated force and its transversal
deflection is measured at the interior points. We prove a global H\"{o}lder
stability estimate under (mild) regularity assumptions on the unknown
coefficient.
