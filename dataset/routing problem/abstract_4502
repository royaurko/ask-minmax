In the problem {\sc Min-DESC}, we are given a digraph $D$ and an integer $k$,
and asked if there exists a set $A'$ of at most $k$ arcs in $D$, such that if
we remove the arcs of $A'$, in the resulting digraph every strong component is
Eulerian. {\sc Min-DESC} is NP-hard; Cechl\'{a}rov\'{a} and Schlotter (IPEC
2010) asked if the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by
$k$. We consider the subproblem of{\sc Min-DESC} when $D$ is a tournament. We
show that this problem is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to $k$.
