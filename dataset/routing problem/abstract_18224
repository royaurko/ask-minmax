The Clar number of a (hydro)carbon molecule, introduced by Clar [E. Clar,
\emph{The aromatic sextet}, (1972).], is the maximum number of mutually
disjoint resonant hexagons in the molecule. Calculating the Clar number can be
formulated as an optimization problem on 2-connected planar graphs. Namely, it
is the maximum number of mutually disjoint even faces a perfect matching can
simultaneously alternate on. It was proved by Abeledo and Atkinson [H. G.
Abeledo and G. W. Atkinson, \emph{Unimodularity of the clar number problem},
Linear algebra and its applications \textbf{420} (2007), no. 2, 441--448] that
the Clar number can be computed in polynomial time if the plane graph has even
faces only. We prove that calculating the Clar number in general 2-connected
plane graphs is NP-hard. We also prove NP-hardness of the maximum independent
set problem for 2-connected plane graphs with odd faces only, which may be of
independent interest. Finally, we give an FPT algorithm that determines the
Clar number of a given 2-connected plane graph. The parameter of the algorithm
is the length of the shortest odd join in the planar dual graph. For fullerenes
this is not yet a polynomial algorithm, but for certain carbon nanotubes it
gives an efficient algorithm.
