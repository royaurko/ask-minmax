The compound, Fe2TiO5 (FTO)is a well-known uniaxial anisotropic spin-glass
insulator with two successive glassy freezing temperatures i.e. transverse
(TTF= 9K) and longitudinal (TLF= 55 K). In this article, we present the results
of measurements of complex dielectric behavior, electric polarization as a
function of temperature (T), in addition to characterization by magnetic
susceptibility and heat-capacity, primarily to explore magnetoelectric (ME)
coupling and multiglass properties in uniaxial anisotropic spin cluster-glass
FTO. The existence of two magnetic transitions is reflected in the isothermal
magnetodielectric (MD) behavior in the sense that the sign of MD is different
in the T regime T<TTF and T>TTF.The data in addition provide evidence for the
glassy dynamics of electric-dipoles; interestingly, this occurs at much higher
temperature (~100-150 K) than TLF with high remnant polarization at 10 K( 4000
micro C/m2) attributable to short-range magnetic correlations, thereby offering
a route to attain ME coupling above 77 K.
