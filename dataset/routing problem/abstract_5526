Global mobile robot localization is the problem of determining a robot's pose
in an environment, using sensor data, when the starting position is unknown. A
family of probabilistic algorithms known as Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) is
currently among the most popular methods for solving this problem. MCL
algorithms represent a robot's belief by a set of weighted samples, which
approximate the posterior probability of where the robot is located by using a
Bayesian formulation of the localization problem. This article presents an
extension to the MCL algorithm, which addresses its problems when localizing in
highly symmetrical environments; a situation where MCL is often unable to
correctly track equally probable poses for the robot. The problem arises from
the fact that sample sets in MCL often become impoverished, when samples are
generated according to their posterior likelihood. Our approach incorporates
the idea of clusters of samples and modifies the proposal distribution
considering the probability mass of those clusters. Experimental results are
presented that show that this new extension to the MCL algorithm successfully
localizes in symmetric environments where ordinary MCL often fails.
