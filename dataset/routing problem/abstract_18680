Accurate reconstruction of phylogenies remains a key challenge in
evolutionary biology. Most biologically plausible formulations of the problem
are formally NP-hard, with no known efficient solution. The standard in
practice are fast heuristic methods that are empirically known to work very
well in general, but can yield results arbitrarily far from optimal. Practical
exact methods, which yield exponential worst-case running times but generally
much better times in practice, provide an important alternative. We report
progress in this direction by introducing a provably optimal method for the
weighted multi-state maximum parsimony phylogeny problem. The method is based
on generalizing the notion of the Buneman graph, a construction key to
efficient exact methods for binary sequences, so as to apply to sequences with
arbitrary finite numbers of states with arbitrary state transition weights. We
implement an integer linear programming (ILP) method for the multi-state
problem using this generalized Buneman graph and demonstrate that the resulting
method is able to solve data sets that are intractable by prior exact methods
in run times comparable with popular heuristics. Our work provides the first
method for provably optimal maximum parsimony phylogeny inference that is
practical for multi-state data sets of more than a few characters.
