We consider the problem of incrementally solving a sequence of quantified
Boolean formulae (QBF). Incremental solving aims at using information learned
from one formula in the process of solving the next formulae in the sequence.
Based on a general overview of the problem and related challenges, we present
an approach to incremental QBF solving which is application-independent and
hence applicable to QBF encodings of arbitrary problems. We implemented this
approach in our incremental search-based QBF solver DepQBF and report on
implementation details. Experimental results illustrate the potential benefits
of incremental solving in QBF-based workflows.
