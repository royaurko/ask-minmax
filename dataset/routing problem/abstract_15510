New services for Clusters of Galaxies Database created in the Astronomical
Institute of SPbU have been constructed. The detailed description of database
and its content is available at http://www.astro.spbu.ru/CLUSTERS/. The
information contained in the database can be used for solution of the specific
astronomical problems. One of these problems is the researches of radio
emission spectra of clusters' objects. The researches can give help in solution
of the problems of origin and evolution of extragalactic radio sources. Spectra
of radio galaxies contain important information about radio power in the
processes responsible for their activity. This report presents the software for
the database that provides work with radio spectra of extragalactic sources.
This client-application has been released as the Java-applet and thus provides
a Web based interface that is supported on many operating systems. The
facilities of the applet such as approximations of spectra measurement points
and calculation of spectral parameters are illustrated in the report. Also we
demonstrate new version of the application that realized on Java2 and gave
access to additional functions such as printing.
