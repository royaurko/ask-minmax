It is now possible to estimate black hole masses across cosmic time, using
broad emission lines in active galaxies. This technique informs our views of
how galaxies and their central black holes coevolve. Unfortunately, there are
many outstanding uncertainties associated with these "virial" mass estimates.
One of these comes from using the accretion luminosity to infer a size for the
broad-line region. Incorporating the new sample of low-luminosity active
galaxies from our recent monitoring campaign at Lick Observatory, we
recalibrate the radius-luminosity relation with tracers of the accretion
luminosity other than the optical continuum. We find that the radius of the
broad-line region scales as the square root of the X-ray and Hbeta
luminosities, in agreement with recent optical studies. On the other hand, the
scaling appears to be marginally steeper with narrow-line luminosities. This is
consistent with a previously observed decrease in the ratio of narrow-line to
X-ray luminosity with increasing total luminosity. The radius of the broad-line
region correlates most tightly with Hbeta luminosity, while the X-ray and
narrow-line relations both have comparable scatter of a factor of two. These
correlations provide useful alternative virial BH masses in objects with no
detectable optical/UV continuum emission, such as high-redshift galaxies with
broad emission lines, radio-loud objects, or local active galaxies with
galaxy-dominated continua.
