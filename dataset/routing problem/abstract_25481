We discuss various lifting and reduction problems for bundles and gerbes in
the context of a strict Lie 2-group. We obtain a geometrical formulation (and a
new proof) for the exactness of Breen's long exact sequence in non-abelian
cohomology. We use our geometrical formulation in order to define a
transgression map in non-abelian cohomology. This transgression map relates the
degree one non-abelian cohomology of a smooth manifold (represented by
non-abelian gerbes) with the degree zero non-abelian cohomology of the free
loop space (represented by principal bundles). We prove several properties for
this transgression map. For instance, it reduces - in case of a Lie 2-group
with a single object - to the ordinary transgression in ordinary cohomology. We
describe applications of our results to string manifolds: first, we obtain a
new comparison theorem for different notions of string structures. Second, our
transgression map establishes a direct relation between string structures and
spin structure on the loop space.
