We define and study a class of (random) Boolean constraint satisfaction
problems representing minimal feasibility constraints for networks of chemical
reactions. The constraints we consider encode, respectively, for hard
mass-balance conditions (where the consumption and production fluxes of each
chemical species are matched) and for soft mass-balance conditions (where a net
production of compounds is in principle allowed). We solve these constraint
satisfaction problems under the Bethe approximation and derive the
corresponding Belief Propagation equations, that involve 8 different messages.
The statistical properties of ensembles of random problems are studied via the
population dynamics methods. By varying a chemical potential attached to the
activity of reactions, we find first order transitions and strong hysteresis,
suggesting a non-trivial structure in the space of feasible solutions.
