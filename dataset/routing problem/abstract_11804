It is argued that Weinberg's approach to the nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction
problem within effective field theory provides a consistent power counting for
renormalized diagrams. Within this scheme the NN potential is organized as an
expansion in terms of small quantities like small external momenta and the pion
mass (divided by the characteristic large scale of the effective theory).
Physical observables to any given order in these small quantities are
calculated from the solutions of the Lippmann-Schwinger (or Schr\" odinger)
equation.
