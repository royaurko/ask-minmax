Numerous entropy-type characteristics (functionals) generalizing R\'enyi
entropy are widely used in mathematical statistics, physics, information
theory, and signal processing for characterizing uncertainty in probability
distributions and distribution identification problems. We consider estimators
of some entropy (integral) functionals for discrete and continuous
distributions based on the number of epsilon-close vector records in the
corresponding independent and identically distributed samples from two
distributions. The estimators form a triangular scheme of generalized
U-statistics. We show the asymptotic properties of these estimators (e.g.,
consistency and asymptotic normality). The results can be applied in various
problems in computer science and mathematical statistics (e.g., approximate
matching for random databases, record linkage, image matching).
