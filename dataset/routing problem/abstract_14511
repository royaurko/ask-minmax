We answer in this paper the open question on simultaneous diagonalization
(SD) posted in [6] by giving a necessary and sufficient SD condition for any
two real symmetric matrices and offering a necessary and sufficient condition
of SD for any finite collection of real symmetric matrices under the existence
assumption of a semi-definite pencil. With this result, we answered the problem
when the matrices in a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP)
problems with one or two quadratic constraints [2] are SD and then we can use
their results to solve the new reformulation of QCQP.
