It is pointed out that the usual derivation of the well-known Maxwell
electromagnetic equations holds only for a medium at rest. A way in which the
equations may be modified for the case when the mean flow of the medium is
steady and uniform is proposed. The implication of this for the problem of the
origin of planetary magnetic fields is discussed.
