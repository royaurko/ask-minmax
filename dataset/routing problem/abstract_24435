Abduction is a fundamental and important form of non-monotonic reasoning.
Given a knowledge base explaining how the world behaves it aims at finding an
explanation for some observed manifestation. In this paper we focus on
propositional abduction, where the knowledge base and the manifestation are
represented by propositional formulae. The problem of deciding whether there
exists an explanation has been shown to be SigmaP2-complete in general. We
consider variants obtained by restricting the allowed connectives in the
formulae to certain sets of Boolean functions. We give a complete
classification of the complexity for all considerable sets of Boolean
functions. In this way, we identify easier cases, namely NP-complete and
polynomial cases; and we highlight sources of intractability. Further, we
address the problem of counting the explanations and draw a complete picture
for the counting complexity.
