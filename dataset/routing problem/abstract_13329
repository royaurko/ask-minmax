The paper introduces the recent results related to an entropy functional on
trajectories of a controlled diffusion process, and the information path
functional (IPF), analyzing their connections to the Kolmogorov's entropy,
complexity and the Lyapunov's characteristics. Considering the IPF's essentials
and specifics, the paper studies the singularities of the IPF extremal
equations and the created invariant relations, which both are useful for the
solution of important mathematical and applied problems.
