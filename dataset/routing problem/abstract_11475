Linde in hep-th/0611043 shows that some (though not all) versions of the
global (volume-weighted) description avoid the "Boltzmann brain" problem raised
in hep-th/0610079 if the universe does not have a decay time less than 20 Gyr.
Here I give an apparently natural version of the volume-weighted description in
which the problem persists, highlighting the ambiguity of taking the ratios of
infinite volumes that appear to arise from eternal inflation.
