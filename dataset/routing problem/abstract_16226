The Lempel-Ziv universal coding scheme is asymptotically optimal for the
class of all stationary ergodic sources. A problem of robustness of this
property under small violations of ergodicity is studied. A notion of
deficiency of algorithmic randomness is used as a measure of disagreement
between data sequence and probability measure. We prove that universal
compressing schemes from a large class are non-robust in the following sense:
if the randomness deficiency grows arbitrarily slowly on initial fragments of
an infinite sequence then the property of asymptotic optimality of any
universal compressing algorithm can be violated. Lempel-Ziv compressing
algorithms are robust on infinite sequences generated by ergodic Markov chains
when the randomness deficiency of its initial fragments of length $n$ grows as
$o(n)$.
