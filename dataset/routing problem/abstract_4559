Using measure theoretic arguments, we provide a general framework for
describing and studying the general linear inverse dispersion problem where no
a priori assumptions on the source function has been made. We investigate the
source-sensor relationship and rigorously state solvability conditions for when
the inverse problem can be solved using a least-squares optimisation method.
That is, we derive conditions for when the least-squares problem is
well-defined.
