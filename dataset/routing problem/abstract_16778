In this paper we construct and analyse a level-dependent coarsegrid
correction scheme for indefinite Helmholtz problems. This adapted multigrid
method is capable of solving the Helmholtz equation on the finest grid using a
series of multigrid cycles with a grid-dependent complex shift, leading to a
stable correction scheme on all levels. It is rigourously shown that the
adaptation of the complex shift throughout the multigrid cycle maintains the
functionality of the two-grid correction scheme, as no smooth modes are
amplified in or added to the error. In addition, a sufficiently smoothing
relaxation scheme should be applied to ensure damping of the oscillatory error
components. Numerical experiments on various benchmark problems show the method
to be competitive with or even outperform the current state-of-the-art
multigrid-preconditioned Krylov methods, like e.g. CSL-preconditioned GMRES or
BiCGStab.
