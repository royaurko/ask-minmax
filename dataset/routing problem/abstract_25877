We review the Bayesian theory of semiparametric inference following Bickel
and Kleijn (2012) and Kleijn and Knapik (2013). After an overview of efficiency
in parametric and semiparametric estimation problems, we consider the
Bernstein-von Mises theorem (see, e.g., Le Cam and Yang (1990)) and generalize
it to (LAN) regular and (LAE) irregular semiparametric estimation problems. We
formulate a version of the semiparametric Bernstein-von Mises theorem that does
not depend on least-favourable submodels, thus bypassing the most restrictive
condition in the presentation of Bickel and Kleijn (2012). The results are
applied to the (regular) estimation of the linear coefficient in partial linear
regression (with a Gaussian nuisance prior) and of the kernel bandwidth in a
model of normal location mixtures (with a Dirichlet nuisance prior), as well as
the (irregular) estimation of the boundary of the support of a monotone family
of densities (with a Gaussian nuisance prior).
