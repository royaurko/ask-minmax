We discuss the gravitational self-force on a particle in a black hole
space-time. For a point particle, the full (bare) self-force diverges. The
metric perturbation induced by a particle can be divided into two parts, the
direct part (or the S part) and the tail part (or the R part), in the harmonic
gauge, and the regularized self-force is derived from the R part which is
regular and satisfies the source-free perturbed Einstein equations. But this
formulation is abstract, so when we apply to black hole-particle systems, there
are many problems to be overcome in order to derive a concrete self-force.
These problems are roughly divided into two parts. They are the problem of
regularizing the divergent self-force, i.e., ``subtraction problem'' and the
problem of the singularity in gauge transformation, i.e., ``gauge problem''. In
this paper, we discuss these problems in the Schwarzschild background and
report some recent progress.
