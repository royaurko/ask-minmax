The technique of reduction of order developed by Nucci ({\it J Math Phys}
{\bf 37} (1996) 1772-1775) is used to produce nonlocal symmetries additional to
those reported by Krause ({\it J Math Phys} {\bf 35} (1994) 5734-5748) in his
study of the complete symmetry group of the Kepler Problem. The technique is
shown to be applicable to related problems containing a drag term which have
been used to model the motion of low altitude satellites in the Earth's
atmosphere and further generalisations. A consequence of the application of
this technique is the demonstration of the group theoretical relationship
between the simple harmonic oscillator and the Kepler and related problems.
