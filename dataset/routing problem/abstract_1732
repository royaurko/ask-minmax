Graphene has been known for a long time but only recently has its potential
for electronics been recognized. Its history is recalled starting from early
graphene studies. A critical insight in June, 2001 brought to light that
graphene could be used for electronics. This was followed by a series of
proposals and measurements. The Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT) graphene
electronics research project was first funded, by Intel in 2003, and later by
the NSF in 2004 and the Keck foundation in 2008. The GIT group selected
epitaxial graphene as the most viable route for graphene based electronics and
their seminal paper on transport and structural measurements of epitaxial
graphene was published in 2004. Subsequently, the field rapidly developed and
multilayer graphene was discovered at GIT. This material consists of many
graphene layers but it is not graphite: each layer has the electronic structure
of graphene. Currently the field has developed to the point where epitaxial
graphene based electronics may be realized in the not too distant future.
