We define an (r,s)-coloring of an abstract simplicial complex to be a
coloring using r colors of the vertices so that in any simplex at most s
vertices have the same color. We translate the problem of finding an
(r,s)-coloring of a given simplex to a topological problem and to a ring
theoretic problem. The topological version involves vector bundles over
Davis--Januszkiewicz spaces and the algebraic one involves factorizations in
Stanley-Reisner rings.
