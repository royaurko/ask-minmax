We formulate and discuss a necessary and sufficient condition for polynomials
to be dense in a space of continuous functions on the real line, with respect
to Bernstein's weighted uniform norm. Equivalently, for a positive finite
measure $\mu$ on the real line we give a criterion for density of polynomials
in $L^p(\mu)$.
