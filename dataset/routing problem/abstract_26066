We study the g-modes of fast rotating stratified neutron stars in the general
relativistic Cowling approximation, where we neglect metric perturbations and
where the background models take into account the buoyant force due to
composition gradients. This is the first paper studying this problem in a
general relativistic framework. In a recent paper by Passamonti et al.(2009), a
similar study was performed within the Newtonian framework, where the contributors
presented results about the onset of CFS-unstable g-modes and the close
connection between inertial- and gravity-modes for sufficiently high rotation
rates and small composition gradients. This correlation arises from the
interplay between the buoyant force which is the restoring force for g-modes
and the Coriolis force which is responsible for the existence of inertial
modes. In our relativistic treatment of the problem, we find an excellent
qualitatively agreement with respect to the Newtonian results.
