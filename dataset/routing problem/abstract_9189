The paper addresses the problem of learning a regression model parameterized
by a fixed-rank positive semidefinite matrix. The focus is on the nonlinear
nature of the search space and on scalability to high-dimensional problems. The
mathematical developments rely on the theory of gradient descent algorithms
adapted to the Riemannian geometry that underlies the set of fixed-rank
positive semidefinite matrices. In contrast with previous contributions in the
literature, no restrictions are imposed on the range space of the learned
matrix. The resulting algorithms maintain a linear complexity in the problem
size and enjoy important invariance properties. We apply the proposed
algorithms to the problem of learning a distance function parameterized by a
positive semidefinite matrix. Good performance is observed on classical
benchmarks.
