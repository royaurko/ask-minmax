Although its practical efficiency is unquestionable, it is well known that
thermodynamics presents conceptual difficulties from the theoretical point of
view. It is shown that the problem comes from an imperfect compatibility
between the first law and the second law. The solution suggested consists of
connecting thermodynamics with relativity (and, by extension, with gravitation)
through the Einstein mass-energy relation.
