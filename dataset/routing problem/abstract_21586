The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm introduced by Dempster et al in
1977 is a very general method to solve maximum likelihood estimation problems.
In this informal report, we review the theory behind EM as well as a number of
EM variants, suggesting that beyond the current state of the art is an even
much wider territory still to be discovered.
