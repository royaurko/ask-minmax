The macroscopic quantizations of matter into macro-atoms and radiant and
thermal energies into r- and k-energy packets initiated in Paper I is completed
with the definition of transition probabilities governing energy flows to and
from the thermal pool. The resulting Monte Carlo method is then applied to the
problem of computing the hydrogen spectrum of a Type II supernova. This test
problem is used to demonstrate the scheme's consistency as the number of energy
packets N -> infinity, to investigate the accuracy of Monte Carlo estimators of
radiative rates, and to illustrate the convergence characteristics of the
geometry-independent, constrained Lambda-iteration method employed to obtain
the NLTE stratifications of temperature and level populations. In addition, the
method's potential, when combined with analytic ionization and excitation
formulae, for obtaining useful approximate NLTE solutions is emphasized.
