Bulk superconductor samples of YBa2Cu3-xZnxO7-{\delta} with x = 0, 0.01, 0.03
are synthesized by solid-state reaction route. The structural characterisation
of all samples has been carried out by x-ray-diffraction (XRD) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The x-ray diffraction patterns indicate
that the gross structure/phase of YBa2Cu3-xZnxO7-{\delta} do not change with
the substitution of Zn up to x=0.03. In TEM investigations of Zn-doped Y-based
cuprates a number of ZnO nano-flower and nano-rod of Y-211 phase are found
dispersed in regular YBa2Cu3-xZnxO7 matrix. These dispersed nano-flowers of ZnO
and nano-rods of Y-211 phase may serve as flux-pinning centers. These pinning
centers enhance critical current density (Jc) value of these HTSC samples.
