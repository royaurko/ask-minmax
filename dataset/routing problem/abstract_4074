We extend a previous statistical mechanical treatment of the traveling
salesman problem by defining a discrete "site disordered'' problem in which
fluctuations about saddle points can be computed. The results clarify the basis
of our original treatment, and illuminate but do not resolve the difficulties
of taking the zero temperature limit to obtain minimal path lengths.
