Low-rank tensor methods for the approximate solution of second-order elliptic
partial differential equations in high dimensions have recently attracted
significant attention. A critical issue is to rigorously bound the error of
such approximations, not with respect to a fixed finite dimensional discrete
background problem, but with respect to the exact solution of the continuous
problem. While the energy norm offers a natural error measure corresponding to
the underlying operator considered as an isomorphism from the energy space onto
its dual, this norm requires a careful treatment in its interplay with the
tensor structure of the problem. In this paper we build on our previous work on
energy norm-convergent subspace-based tensor schemes contriving, however, a
modified formulation which now enforces convergence only in $L_2$. In order to
still be able to exploit the mapping properties of elliptic operators, a
crucial ingredient of our approach is the development and analysis of a
suitable asymmetric preconditioning scheme. We provide estimates for the
computational complexity of the resulting method in terms of the solution error
and study the practical performance of the scheme in numerical experiments. In
both regards, we find that controlling solution errors in this weaker norm
leads to substantial simplifications and to a reduction of the actual numerical
work required for a certain error tolerance.
