We prove that the homotopy class of a Morin mapping f: P^p --> Q^q with p-q
odd contains a cusp mapping. This affirmatively solves a strengthened version
of the Chess conjecture [DS Chess, A note on the classes [S_1^k(f)], Proc.
Symp. Pure Math., 40 (1983) 221-224] and [VI Arnol'd, VA Vasil'ev, VV Goryunov,
OV Lyashenko, Dynamical systems VI. Singularities, local and global theory,
Encyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences - Vol. 6 (Springer, Berlin, 1993)]. Also,
in view of the Saeki-Sakuma theorem [O Saeki, K Sakuma, Maps with only Morin
singularities and the Hopf invariant one problem, Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc.
124 (1998) 501-511] on the Hopf invariant one problem and Morin mappings, this
implies that a manifold P^p with odd Euler characteristic does not admit Morin
mappings into R^{2k+1} for p > 2k not equal to 1,3 or 7.
