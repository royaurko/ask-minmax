In this paper, we view the Internet under a game-theoretic lens in an effort
to explain and overcome the Internet's innovation slump. Game Theory is used to
model Internet environments as problems of technological competition toward the
end of understanding their emergent phenomena and the evolutionary forces that
shape them. However, our results extend beyond understanding the Internet
architecture toward helping the Internet population achieve socially desirable
outcomes.
