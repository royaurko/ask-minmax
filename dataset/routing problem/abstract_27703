In the Euclidean space of any dimension d, we consider the heat semigroup
generated by the magnetic Schroedinger operator from which an inverse-square
potential is subtracted in order to make the operator critical in the
magnetic-free case. Assuming that the magnetic field is compactly supported, we
show that the polynomial large-time behaviour of the heat semigroup is
determined by the eigenvalue problem for a magnetic Schroedinger operator on
the (d-1)-dimensional sphere whose vector potential reflects the behaviour of
the magnetic field at the space infinity. From the spectral problem on the
sphere, we deduce that in d=2 there is an improvement of the decay rate of the
heat semigroup by a polynomial factor with power proportional to the distance
of the total magnetic flux to the discrete set of flux quanta, while there is
no extra polynomial decay rate in higher dimensions. To prove the results, we
establish new magnetic Hardy-type inequalities for the Schroedinger operator
and develop the method of self-similar variables and weighted Sobolev spaces
for the associated heat equation.
