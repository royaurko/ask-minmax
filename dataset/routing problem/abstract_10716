In the (parameterized) Ordered List Subgraph Embedding problem (p-OLSE) we
are given two graphs $G$ and $H$, each with a linear order defined on its
vertices, a function $L$ that associates with every vertex in $G$ a list of
vertices in $H$, and a parameter $k$. The question is to decide if we can embed
(one-to-one) a subgraph $S$ of $G$ of $k$ vertices into $H$ such that: (1)
every vertex of $S$ is mapped to a vertex from its associated list, (2) the
linear orders inherited by $S$ and its image under the embedding are respected,
and (3) if there is an edge between two vertices in $S$ then there is an edge
between their images. If we require the subgraph $S$ to be embedded as an
induced subgraph, we obtain the Ordered List Induced Subgraph Embedding problem
(p-OLISE). The p-OLSE and p-OLISE problems model various problems in
Bioinformatics related to structural comparison/alignment of proteins.
  We investigate the complexity of p-OLSE and p-OLISE with respect to the
following structural parameters: the width $\Delta_L$ of the function $L$ (size
of the largest list), and the maximum degree $\Delta_H$ of $H$ and $\Delta_G$
of $G$. In terms of the structural parameters under consideration, we draw a
complete complexity landscape of p-OLSE and p-OLISE (and their optimization
versions) with respect to the computational frameworks of classical complexity,
parameterized complexity, and approximation.
