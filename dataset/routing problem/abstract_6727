We consider the problem of separability: decide whether a Hermitian operator
on a finite dimensional Hilbert tensor product is separable or entangled. We
show that the tensor convolution defined for certain mappings on an almost
arbitrary locally compact abelian group, give rise to formulation of an
equivalent problem to the separability one.
