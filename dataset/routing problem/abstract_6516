The paper deals with homogenization problem for nonlinear elliptic and
parabolic equations in a periodically perforated domain, a nonlinear Fourier
boundary conditions being imposed on the perforation border. Under the
assumptions that the studied differential equation satisfies monotonicity and
2-growth conditions and that the coefficient of the boundary operator is
centered at each level set of unknown function, we show that the problem under
consideration admits homogenization and derive the effective model.
