We determine the secure degrees of freedom region of the point to point and
the two-transmitter Gaussian broadcast wiretap channels with multiple antennas
at the legitimate receivers and the eavesdroppers with unknown eavesdroppers'
CSI. The existence of unknown number of eavesdroppers is assumed but with
maximum number of antennas at any eavesdropper is limited to a known value
$N_E$. The channel matrices between the transmitters and the receiver is
available everywhere, while the legitimate pair have no information about the
eavesdroppers channels. A new upperbound is established and The DoF region is
characterized. It is important to note that the same problem was studied with
arbitrarily varying eavesdropper channels, our region is larger than their
upperbound. It is important to note that the same problem has been studied
recently with arbitrarily varying eavesdropper channels and an upperbound has
been derived. However, our achievable sum secure DoF exceeds their previously
derived upperbound. Consequently, we revisited the uppperbound derivation and
we re-derived a new mathematically robust upperbound.
