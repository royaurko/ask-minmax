We extend the second Noether theorem to fractional variational problems which
are invariant under infinitesimal transformations that depend upon $r$
arbitrary functions and their fractional derivatives in the sense of Caputo.
Our main result is illustrated using the fractional Lagrangian density of the
electromagnetic field.
