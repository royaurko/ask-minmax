Driven by green communications, energy efficiency (EE) has become a new
important criterion for designing wireless communication systems. However, high
EE often leads to low spectral efficiency (SE), which spurs the research on
EE-SE tradeoff. In this paper, we focus on how to maximize the utility in
physical layer for an uplink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output
(MU-MIMO) system, where we will not only consider EE-SE tradeoff in a unified
way, but also ensure user fairness. We first formulate the utility maximization
problem, but it turns out to be non-convex. By exploiting the structure of this
problem, we find a convexization procedure to convert the original non-convex
problem into an equivalent convex problem, which has the same global optima
with the original problem. Following the convexization procedure, we present a
centralized algorithm to solve the utility maximization problem, but it
requires the global information of all users. Thus we propose a primal-dual
distributed algorithm which does not need global information and just consumes
a small amount of overhead. Furthermore, we have proved that the distributed
algorithm can converge to the global optima. Finally, the numeric results show
that our approach can both capture user diversity for EE-SE tradeoff and ensure
user fairness, and they also validate the effectiveness of our primal-dual
distributed algorithm.
