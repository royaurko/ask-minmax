In this paper, we construct a Rabinowitz-Floer type homology for a class of
non-linear problems having a \emph{starshaped} potential; we consider some
equivariant cases as well. We give an explicit computation of the homology and
we apply it to obtain results of existence and multiplicity of solutions for
several model equations.
