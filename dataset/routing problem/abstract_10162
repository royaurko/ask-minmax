A finite difference numerical method is investigated for fractional order
diffusion problems in one space dimension. For this, a mathematical model is
developed to incorporate homogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann type boundary
conditions. The models are based on an appropriate extension of the initial
values. The well-posedness of the obtained initial value problems is proved and
it is pointed out that the extensions are compatible with the above boundary
conditions. Accordingly, a finite difference scheme is constructed for the
Neumann problem using the shifted Gr\"unwald--Letnikov approximation of the
fractional order derivatives, which is based on infinite many basis points. The
corresponding matrix is expressed in a closed form and the convergence of an
appropriate implicit Euler scheme is proved.
