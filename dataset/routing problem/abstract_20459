A class of one-dimensional Fokker-Plank equations having a common stationary
solution, which is a power function of the state of the process, was found. We
prove that these equations also have generalized self-similar solutions which
describe the temporary transition from one stationary state to another. The
study was motivated by problems arising in mathematical modeling of genome size
evolution.
