The field equation of orthodox general relativity are written in the context
of a geometry with non-vanishing torsion, the Absolute Parallelism (AP)
geometry. An AP-structure, with homogeneity and isotropy, is used for
cosmological applications. The resulting dynamical equations are those of
FRW-Standard cosmology, which have many problems e.g. singularity, particle
horizons, ...etc. We suggest a new scheme for investigating the effect of
torsion on the dynamics of FRW-Cosmology, without changing the basic structure
of general relativity. It is shown that some of these problems will disappear
if the torsion, associated with AP-structure used, is inserted in to the
dynamical equations. Diagnose shows that problems arise when GR is written in
the context of a geometry with vanishing torsion, the Riemannian geometry. This
reflects the importance of using more wider geometries in studying physical
phenomena.
