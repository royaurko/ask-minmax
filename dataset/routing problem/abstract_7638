In a recent work of Bei, Chen and Zhang (STOC 2013), a trial and error model
of computing was introduced, and applied to some constraint satisfaction
problems. In this model the input is hidden by an oracle which, for a candidate
assignment, reveals some information about a violated constraint if the
assignment is not satisfying. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of
constraint satisfaction problems in the trial and error model. To achieve this,
we first adopt a formal framework for CSPs, and based on this framework we
define several types of revealing oracles. Our main contribution is to develop
a transfer theorem for each type of the revealing oracle, under a broad class
of parameters. To any hidden CSP with a specific type of revealing oracle, the
transfer theorem associates another, potentially harder CSP in the normal
setting, such that their complexities are polynomial time equivalent. This in
principle transfers the study of a large class of hidden CSPs, possibly with a
promise on the instances, to the study of CSPs in the normal setting. We then
apply the transfer theorems to get polynomial-time algorithms or hardness
results for hidden CSPs, including satisfaction problems, monotone graph
properties, isomorphism problems, and the exact version of the Unique Games
problem.
