Thermodynamic consistency of the Mean Spherical Approximation as well as the
Self-Consistent Ornstein-Zernike Approximation (SCOZA) with the virial route to
thermodynamics is analyzed in terms of renormalized gamma-ordering. For
continuum fluids this suggests the addition of a short-range contribution to
the usual SCOZA direct correlation function, and the shift of the adjustable
parameter from the potential term to this new term. The range of this
contribution is fixed by imposing consistency with the virial route at the
critical point. Comparison of the results of our theory for the hard-core
Yukawa potential with simulation data show very good agreement for cases where
the liquid-vapor transition is stable or not too far into the metastable region
with respect to the solid state. In the latter case for extremely short-ranged
interactions discrepancies arise.
