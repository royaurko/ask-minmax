In this lecture we review several cosmological issues associated with the
axion. Axion solves the strong CP problem and is a good candidate for the dark
matter. Limits, which are imposed by the value of isocurvature fluctuations
fraction in the observed CMBR from WMAP data and the domain wall problem are
discussed in a supersymmetric flat direction axion model.
