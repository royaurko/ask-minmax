We propose distributed link reversal algorithms to circumvent communication
voids in geographic routing. We also solve the attendant problem of integer
overflow in these algorithms. These are achieved in two steps. First, we derive
partial and full link reversal algorithms that do not require one-hop neighbor
information, and convert a destination-disoriented directed acyclic graph (DAG)
to a destination-oriented DAG. We embed these algorithms in the framework of
Gafni and Bertsekas ("Distributed algorithms for generating loop-free routes in
networks with frequently changing topology", 1981) in order to establish their
termination properties. We also analyze certain key properties exhibited by our
neighbor oblivious link reversal algorithms, e.g., for any two neighbors, their
t-states are always consecutive integers, and for any node, its t-state size is
upper bounded by log(N). In the second step, we resolve the integer overflow
problem by analytically deriving one-bit full link reversal and two-bit partial
link reversal versions of our neighbor oblivious link reversal algorithms.
