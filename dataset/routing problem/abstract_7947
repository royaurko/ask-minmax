We study the homogenization of an obstacle problem in a perforated domain.
The holes are periodically distributed but have random size and shape. The
capacity of the holes is assumed to be stationary ergodic. As in the periodic
case, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the solutions is described by an
elliptic equation involving an additional term that takes into account the
effects of the obstacle.
