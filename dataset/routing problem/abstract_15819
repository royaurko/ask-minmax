Let us fix a conformal class $[g_0]$ and a spin structure $\sigma$ on a
compact manifold $M$. For any $g\in [g_0]$, let $\lambda^+_1(g)$ be the
smallest positive eigenvalue of the Dirac operator $D$ on $(M,g,\sigma)$. In a
previous paper we have shown that
  $$\lambda_{min}(M,g_0,\sigma):=\inf_{g\in [g_0]}
\lambda_1^+(g)\vol(M,g)^{1/n}>0.$$ In the present article, we enlarge the
conformal class by certain singular metrics. We will show that if
$\lambda_{min}(M,g_0,\sigma)<\lambda_{min}(S^n)$, then the infimum is attained
on the enlarged conformal class. For proving this, we have to solve a system of
semi-linear partial differential equations involving a nonlinearity with
critical exponent:
  $$D\phi= \lambda |\phi|^{2/(n-1)}\phi.$$ The solution of this problem has
many analogies to the solution of the Yamabe problem. However, our reasoning is
more involved than in the Yamabe problem as the eigenvalues of the Dirac
operator tend to $+\infty$ and $-\infty$.
  Using the Weierstra\ss{} representation, the solution of this equation in
dimension 2 provides a tool for constructing new periodic constant mean
curvature surfaces.
