In this paper, we present a mathematically rigorous quantum-mechanical
treatment of a one-dimensional motion of a particle in the Calogero potential
$\alpha x^{-2}$. Although the problem is quite old and well-studied, we believe
that our consideration, based on a uniform approach to constructing a correct
quantum-mechanical description for systems with singular potentials and/or
boundaries, proposed in our previous works, adds some new points to its
solution. To demonstrate that a consideration of the Calogero problem requires
mathematical accuracy, we discuss some "paradoxes" inherent in the "naive"
quantum-mechanical treatment. We study all possible self-adjoint operators
(self-adjoint Hamiltonians) associated with a formal differential expression
for the Calogero Hamiltonian. In addition, we discuss a spontaneous
scale-symmetry breaking associated with self-adjoint extensions. A complete
spectral analysis of all self-adjoint Hamiltonians is presented.
