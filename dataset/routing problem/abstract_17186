The behavior composition problem involves automatically building a controller
that is able to realize a desired, but unavailable, target system (e.g., a
house surveillance) by suitably coordinating a set of available components
(e.g., video cameras, blinds, lamps, a vacuum cleaner, phones, etc.) Previous
work has almost exclusively aimed at bringing about the desired component in
its totality, which is highly unsatisfactory for unsolvable problems. In this
work, we develop an approach for approximate behavior composition without
departing from the classical setting, thus making the problem applicable to a
much wider range of cases. Based on the notion of simulation, we characterize
what a maximal controller and the "closest" implementable target module
(optimal approximation) are, and show how these can be computed using ATL model
checking technology for a special case. We show the uniqueness of optimal
approximations, and prove their soundness and completeness with respect to
their imported controllers.
