The type of business relationships between the Internet autonomous systems
(AS) determines the BGP inter-domain routing. Previous works on inferring AS
relationships relied on the connectivity information between ASes. In this
paper we infer AS relationships by analysing the routing polices of ASes
encoded in the BGP attributes Communities and the Locpref. We accumulate BGP
data from RouteViews, RIPE RIS and the public Route Servers in August 2010 and
February 2011. Based on the routing policies extracted from data of the two BGP
attributes, we obtain AS relationships for 39% links in our data, which include
all links among the Tier-1 ASes and most links between Tier-1 and Tier-2 ASes.
We also reveal a number of special AS relationships, namely the hybrid
relationship, the partial-transit relationship, the indirect peering
relationship and the backup links. These special relationships are relevant to
a better understanding of the Internet routing. Our work provides a profound
methodological progress for inferring the AS relationships.
