We formulate Lehmer's Problem about the Mahler measure of polynomials for
general compact abelian groups, introducing a Lehmer constant for each such
group. We show that all nontrivial connected compact groups have the same
Lehmer constant, and conjecture the value of the Lehmer constant for finite
cyclic groups. We also show that if a group has infinitely many connected
components then its Lehmer constant vanishes.
