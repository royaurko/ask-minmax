In this paper, we propose a 2D based partition method for solving the problem
of Ranking under Team Context(RTC) on datasets without a priori. We first map
the data into 2D space using its minimum and maximum value among all
dimensions. Then we construct window queries with consideration of current team
context. Besides, during the query mapping procedure, we can pre-prune some
tuples which are not top ranked ones. This pre-classified step will defer
processing those tuples and can save cost while providing solutions for the
problem. Experiments show that our algorithm performs well especially on large
datasets with correctness.
