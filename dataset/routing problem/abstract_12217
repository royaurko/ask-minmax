This work is motivated by two problems: 1) The approach of manifolds and
spaces by triangulations. 2) The complexity growth in sequences of polyhedra.
Considering both problems as related, new criteria and methods for
approximating smooth manifolds are deduced. When the sequences of polyhedra are
obtained by the action of a discrete group or semigroup, further control is
given by geometric, topologic and complexity observables. We give a set of
relevant examples to illustrate the results, both in infinite and finite
dimensions.
