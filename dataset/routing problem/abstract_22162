Let $\Omega$ be a bounded pseudoconvex Hartogs domain. There exists a natural
complete K\"ahler metric $g^{\Omega}$ in terms of its defining function. In
this paper, we study two problems. The first one is determining when
$g^{\Omega}$ is Einstein or extremal. The second one is the existence of
holomorphic isometric immersions of $(\Omega, g^{\Omega})$ into finite or
infinite dimensional complex space forms.
