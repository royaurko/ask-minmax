We consider the problem of modeling multivariate time series with
parsimonious dynamical models which can be represented as sparse dynamic
Bayesian networks with few latent nodes. This structure translates into a
sparse plus low rank model. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian regression
approach to identify such a model.
