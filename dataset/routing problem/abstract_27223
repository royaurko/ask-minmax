In this work, we study the problem of online mechanism design for resources
allocation and pricing in cloud computing (RAPCC). We show that in general the
allocation problems in RAPCC are NP-hard, and therefore we focus on designing
dominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) mechanisms with good competitive
ratios compared to the offline optimal allocation (with the prior knowledge
about the future jobs). We propose two kinds of DSIC online mechanisms. The
first mechanism, which is based on a greedy allocation rule and leverages a
priority function for allocation, is very fast and has a tight competitive
bound. We discuss several priority functions including exponential and linear
priority functions, and show that the former one has a better competitive
ratio. The second mechanism, which is based on a dynamic program for
allocation, also has a tight competitive ratio and performs better than the
first one when the maximum demand of cloud customers is close to the capacity
of the cloud provider.
