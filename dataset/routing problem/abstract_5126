We use the technique developed in [32]-[33] to construct the upper and the
lower bounds for classes of problems containing non-local terms, including
problems in micromagnetics and problems arising in the variational study of the
Method of Vanishing Viscosity for systems of conservation laws. We reduced
these problems to the problems considered in [32]-[33], with the appropriate
prescribed differential constraint.
