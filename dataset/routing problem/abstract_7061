In this article, we address the control problem of unicycle path following,
using a rigidly attached target point. The initial path following problem has
been transformed into a reference trajectory following problem, using saturated
control laws and a geometric characterization hypothesis, which links the
curvature of the path to be followed with the target point. The proposed
controller allows global stabilization without restrictions on initial
conditions. The effectiveness of this controller is illustrated through
simulations.
