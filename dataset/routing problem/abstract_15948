This is a survey article dedicated mostly to the theory of real regular
"finite-gap" (algebro-geometrical) periodic and quasiperiodic Sine-Gordon
solutions. Long period this theory remained unfinished and ineffective, and by
that reason practically had no applications. Even for such simple physical
quantity as "Topological Charge" no formulas existed expressing it through the
"Inverse Spectral Data". Few years ago the present contributors solved this problem
and made this theory effective. This article contains description of the
history and recent achievements. It describes also the reality problems for
several other fundamental soliton systems.
