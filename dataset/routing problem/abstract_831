We consider a single-server system with stations in each point of the circle.
Customers arrive after exponential times, at uniformly-distributed locations.
The server moves at finite speed and adopts a greedy routing mechanism. For any
value of the speed, we prove that the system is stable as long as the service
rate exceeds the arrival rate.
