Network-Wide Broadcast (NWB) is a common operation in Mobile Ad hoc Networks
(MANETs) used by routing protocols to discover routes and in group
communication operations. NWB is commonly performed via flooding, which has
been shown to be expensive in dense MANETs because of its high redundancy.
Several efforts have targeted reducing the redundancy of floods. In this work,
we target another problem that can substantially impact the success of NWBs:
since MAC level broadcasts are unreliable, it is possible for critical
rebroadcasts to be lost, leading to a significant drop in the node coverage.
This is especially true under heavy load and in sparse topologies. We show that
the techniques that target reducing the overhead of flooding, reduce its
inherent redundancy and harm its reliability. In addition, we show that static
approaches are more vulnerable to this problem. We then present a selective
rebroadcast approach to improve the robustness of NWBs. We show that our
approach leads to considerable improvement in NWB coverage relative to a
recently proposed solution to this problem, with a small increase in overhead.
The proposed approaches do not require proactive neighbor discovery and are
therefore resilient to mobility. Finally, the solution can be added to
virtually all NWB approaches to improve their reliability.
