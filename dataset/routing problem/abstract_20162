We define a convolution operation on the set of polyominoes and use it to
obtain a criterion for a given polyomino not to tile the plane (rotations and
translations allowed). We apply the criterion to several families of
polyominoes, and show that the criterion detects some cases that are not
detectable by generalized coloring arguments.
