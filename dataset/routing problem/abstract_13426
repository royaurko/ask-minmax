This paper is concerned with the existence, uniqueness and nonlinear
stability of stationary solutions to the Cauchy problem of the full
compressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system effected by external force of
general form in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Based on the weighted-$L^2$ method and some
elaborate $L^\infty$ estimates of solutions to the linearized problem, the
existence and uniqueness of stationary solution are obtained by the contraction
mapping principle. The proof of the stability result is given by an elementary
energy method and relies on some intrinsic properties of the full compressible
Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system.
