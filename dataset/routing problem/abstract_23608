We consider the family B-tilde of bounded nonvanishing analytic functions
  f(z) = a_0 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2 + ...
 in the unit disk. The coefficient problem had been extensively investigated,
and it is known that |a_n| <= 2/e for n=1,2,3, and 4. That this inequality may
hold for n in N, is know as the Kry\.z conjecture. It turns out that for f in
B-tilde with a_0 = e^-t,
  f(z) << e^{-t (1+z)/(1-z)}
 so that the superordinate functions e^{-t (1+z)/(1-z)} = sum F_k(t) z^k are
of special interest. The corresponding coefficient function F_k(t) had been
independently considered by Bateman [3] who had introduced them with the aid
of the integral representation
  F_k(t) = (-1)^k 2/pi int_0^pi/2 cos(t tan theta - 2 k theta) d theta .
  We study the Bateman function and formulate properties that give insight in
the coefficient problem in B-tilde.
