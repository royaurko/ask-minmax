A new speculative model for the expansion of our universe has been under
development by the contributor for the last two decades, which correctly predicts
astronomical measurements with no dark matter or dark energy. This new closed
model (no free parameters) correctly predicts that time increases without limit
into the future. By contrast, a seldom mentioned future-problem in relativity
theory is shown in this paper. Any acceleration of the expansion rate of our
universe destroys the proper behavior of time into the future. The goal of this
paper is to present this problem of relativity theory and remind the reader of
the success of the new model
