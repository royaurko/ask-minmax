In Stackelberg v/s Stackelberg games a collection of leaders compete in a
Nash game constrained by the equilibrium conditions of another Nash game
amongst the followers. The resulting equilibrium problems are plagued by the
nonuniqueness of follower equilibria and nonconvexity of leader problems
whereby the problem of providing sufficient conditions for existence of global
or even local equilibria remains largely open. Indeed available existence
statements are restrictive and model specific. In this paper, we present what
is possibly the first general existence result for equilibria for this class of
games. Importantly, we impose no single-valuedness assumption on the
equilibrium of the follower-level game. Specifically, under the assumption that
the objectives of the leaders admit a quasi-potential function, a concept we
introduce in this paper, the global and local minimizers of a suitably defined
optimization problem are shown to be the global and local equilibria of the
game. In effect existence of equilibria can be guaranteed by the solvability of
an optimization problem, which holds under mild and verifiable conditions. We
motivate quasi- potential games through an application in communication
networks.
