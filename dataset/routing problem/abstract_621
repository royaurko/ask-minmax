Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs) are leaving the confines of research
laboratories, to find place in real-world deployments. Outside specialized
domains (military, vehicular, etc.), city-wide communitynetworks are emerging,
connecting regular Internet users with each other, and with the Internet, via
MANETs. Growing to encompass more than a handful of "trusted participants", the
question of preserving the MANET network connectivity, even when faced with
careless or malicious participants, arises, and must be addressed. A first step
towards protecting a MANET is to analyze the vulnerabilities of the routing
protocol, managing the connectivity. By understanding how the algorithms of the
routing protocol operate, and how these can be exploited by those with ill
intent, countermeasures can be developed, readying MANETs for wider deployment
and use. This paper takes an abstract look at the algorithms that constitute
the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2), and identifies
for each protocol element the possible vulnerabilities and attacks -- in a
certain way, provides a "cookbook" for how to best attack an operational OLSRv2
network, or for how to proceed with developing protective countermeasures
against these attacks.
