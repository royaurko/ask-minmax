Analysis of cluster and field star uvby data demonstrates the existence of a
previously undetected discrepancy in a widely used photometric metallicity
calibration for G dwarfs. The discrepancy is systematic and strongly
color-dependent, reducing the estimated [Fe/H] for stars above [Fe/H] ~ -0.2 by
between +0.1 and +0.4 dex, and creating a deficit of metal-rich stars among
dwarfs of mid-G and later spectral type. The source of the problem, triggered
for stars with b-y greater than about 0.47, appears to be an enhanced
metallicity dependence for the c1 index that increases as temperature declines.
The link between c1, normally a surface gravity indicator, and metallicity
produces two secondary effects. The deficit in the photometric abundance for a
cool dwarf is partially compensated by some degree of evolution off the main
sequence and cool dwarfs with metallicities significantly above the Hyades are
found to have c1 indices that classify them as giants. The potential impact of
the problem on stellar population studies is discussed.
