In this work we address the problem of blindly reconstructing compressively
sensed signals by exploiting the co-sparse analysis model. In the analysis
model it is assumed that a signal multiplied by an analysis operator results in
a sparse vector. We propose an algorithm that learns the operator adaptively
during the reconstruction process. The arising optimization problem is tackled
via a geometric conjugate gradient approach. Different types of sampling noise
are handled by simply exchanging the data fidelity term. Numerical experiments
are performed for measurements corrupted with Gaussian as well as impulsive
noise to show the effectiveness of our method.
