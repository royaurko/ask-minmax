Within a supersymmetric (SUSY) type-I seesaw framework with flavor-blind
universal boundary conditions, we study the consequences of requiring that the
observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe be explained by either thermal or
non-thermal leptogenesis. In the former case, we find that the parameter space
is very constrained. In the bulk and stop-coannihilation regions of mSUGRA
parameter space (that are consistent with the measured dark matter abundance),
lepton flavor-violating (LFV) processes are accessible at MEG and future
experiments. However, the very high reheat temperature of the Universe needed
after inflation (of about 10^{12} GeV) leads to a severe gravitino problem,
which disfavors either thermal leptogenesis or neutralino dark matter.
Non-thermal leptogenesis in the preheating phase from SUSY flat directions
relaxes the gravitino problem by lowering the required reheat temperature. The
baryon asymmetry can then be explained while preserving neutralino dark matter,
and for the bulk or stop-coannihilation regions LFV processes should be
observed in current or future experiments.
