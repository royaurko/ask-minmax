This work deals with the problem of photon detection generated from the
mirror-induced Dynamical Casimir Effect. Particularly we are interested in
measurement of those statistical characteristics of a generated intracavity
field which may confirm its nonthermal properties. Here an indirect protocol
for quadrature dispersion measurement is presented.
