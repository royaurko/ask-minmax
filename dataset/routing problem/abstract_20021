The theory of permutation orbifolds is reviewed and applied to the study of
symmetric product orbifolds and the congruence subgroup problem. The issue of
discrete torsion, the combinatorics of symmetric products, the Galois action
and questions related to the classification of RCFTs are also discussed.
