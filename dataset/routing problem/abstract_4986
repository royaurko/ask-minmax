We study the problem of a boundary magnetic impurity coupled with the
solvable $t-J$ chains. Our model provides a good start point to understand the
Kondo problem in a Luttinger liquid as well as in a strongly correlated host.
The Kondo coupling constant $J$ can take arbitrary values, which allows us to
study the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kondo problems simultaneously. It
is shown that both the Kondo coupling and the scalar potential effectively
reconcile the spin dynamics at low temperatures. Generally, the impurity spin
is split into two ghost spins via coupling effect. The residual entropy, which
can be exactly derived for the present model, is strongly
interaction-dependent. This hints the local spin configuration is very
complicated and very different from that in the conventional Kondo problem. An
unscreening phenomenon in the antiferromagnetic regime is found, which reveals
the impurity potential plays an important role for the Kondo problem in a
strongly correlated host. The low temperature specific heat is calculated in
the framework of local Landau-Luttinger liquid theory.
