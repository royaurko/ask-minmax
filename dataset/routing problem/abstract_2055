The fluctuations of the charge on an electrode contain information on the
microscopic correlations within the adjacent fluid and their effect on the
electronic properties of the interface. We investigate these fluctuations using
molecular dynamics simulations in a constant-potential ensemble with histogram
reweighting techniques. This approach offers in particular an efficient,
accurate and physically insightful route to the differential capacitance that
is broadly applicable. We demonstrate these methods with three different
capacitors: pure water between platinum electrodes, and a pure as well as a
solvent-based organic electrolyte each between graphite electrodes. The total
charge distributions with the pure solvent and solvent-based electrolytes are
remarkably Gaussian, while in the pure ionic liquid the total charge
distribution displays distinct non-Gaussian features, suggesting significant
potential-driven changes in the organization of the interfacial fluid.
