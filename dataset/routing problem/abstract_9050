We develop a new asymptotic method for the analysis of matrix Riemann-Hilbert
problems. Our method is a generalization of the steepest descent method first
proposed by Deift and Zhou; however our method systematically handles jump
matrices that need not be analytic. The essential technique is to introduce
nonanalytic extensions of certain functions appearing in the jump matrix, and
to therefore convert the Riemann-Hilbert problem into a dbar problem. We use
our method to study several asymptotic problems of polynomials orthogonal with
respect to a measure given on the unit circle, obtaining new detailed uniform
convergence results, and for some classes of nonanalytic weights, complete
information about the asymptotic behavior of the individual zeros.
