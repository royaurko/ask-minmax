The time-dependent local-density approximation (TDLDA) is shown to remain
accurate in describing the atomic response of IB elements under the additional
approximation of using pseudopotentials to treat the effects of core electrons.
This extends the work of Zangwill and Soven who showed the utility of the
all-electron TDLDA in the atomic response problem.
