In the contexts of automated reasoning (AR) and formal verification (FV),
important decision problems are effectively encoded into Satisfiability Modulo
Theories (SMT). In the last decade efficient SMT solvers have been developed
for several theories of practical interest (e.g., linear arithmetic, arrays,
bit-vectors). Surprisingly, little work has been done to extend SMT to deal
with optimization problems; in particular, we are not aware of any previous
work on SMT solvers able to produce solutions which minimize cost functions
over arithmetical variables. This is unfortunate, since some problems of
interest require this functionality.
  In the work described in this paper we start filling this gap. We present and
discuss two general procedures for leveraging SMT to handle the minimization of
linear rational cost functions, combining SMT with standard minimization
techniques. We have implemented the procedures within the MathSAT SMT solver.
Due to the absence of competitors in the AR, FV and SMT domains, we have
experimentally evaluated our implementation against state-of-the-art tools for
the domain of linear generalized disjunctive programming (LGDP), which is
closest in spirit to our domain, on sets of problems which have been previously
proposed as benchmarks for the latter tools. The results show that our tool is
very competitive with, and often outperforms, these tools on these problems,
clearly demonstrating the potential of the approach.
