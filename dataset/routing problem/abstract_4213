In this article we give an extention of the L^2-theory of anisotropic
singular perturbations for elliptic problems. We study a linear and some
nonlinear problems involving L^p data (1<p<2). Convergences in pseudo Sobolev
spaces are proved for weak and entropy solutions, and rate of convergence is
given in cylindrical domains
