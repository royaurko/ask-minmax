We discuss a rather general condition under which the inequality of Jensen
works for certain convex combinations of points not all in the domain of
convexity of the function under attention. Based on this fact, an extension of
the Hardy-Littlewood-P\'olya theorem of majorization is proved and new insight
is given into the problem of risk aversion in mathematical finance.
