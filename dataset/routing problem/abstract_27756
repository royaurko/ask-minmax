A general, fast, and effective approach is developed for numerical
calculation of kinetic plasma dispersion relations. The plasma dispersion
function is approximated by $J$-pole expansion. Subsequently, the dispersion
relation is transformed to a standard matrix eigenvalue problem of an
equivalent linear system. The result is accurate for $J=8$ except the solutions
that are the little interesting heavily damped modes. In contrast to
conventional approaches, such as Newton's iterative method, this approach can
give either all the solutions in the system or a few solutions around the
initial guess. It is also free from convergent problems. The approach is
demonstrated from electrostatic one-dimensional and three-dimensional
dispersion relations, to electromagnetic kinetic magnetized plasma dispersion
relation for bi-Maxwellian distribution with parallel velocity drift.
