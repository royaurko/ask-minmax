Let Z(X) be the number of degree-d extensions of F_q(t) with bounded
discriminant and some specified Galois group. The problem of computing Z(X) can
be related to a problem of counting F_q-rational points on certain Hurwitz
spaces. Ellenberg and Venkatesh used this idea to develop a heuristic for the
asymptotic behavior of Z'(X), the number of -geometrically connected-
extensions, and showed that this agrees with the conjectures of Malle for
function fields. We extend Ellenberg-Venkatesh's argument to handle the more
complicated case of covers of P^1 which may not be geometrically connected, and
show thatthe resulting heuristic suggests a natural modification to Malle's
conjecture which avoids the counterexamples, due to Kl\"uners, to the original
conjecture.
