Our aim is to study the problem of existence of orbits connecting stationary
points for the nonlinear heat and strongly damped wave equations being at
resonance at infinity. The main difficulty lies in the fact that these problem
may not have solutions for general nonlinearity. To address this question we
introduce the geometrical assumptions characterizing the nonlinear term and use
them to prove index formulas expressing the Conley index of associated
semiflows. We also prove that the geometrical assumptions are generalization of
well known Landesman-Lazer and strong resonance conditions. Obtained index
formulas are used to derive the criteria determining the existence of orbits
connecting stationary points for heat and strongly damped wave equation.
