Over the past thirty years, there has been considerable progress in the
design of natural language interfaces to databases. Most of this work has
concerned snapshot databases, in which there are only limited facilities for
manipulating time-varying information. The database community is becoming
increasingly interested in temporal databases, databases with special support
for time-dependent entries. We have developed a framework for constructing
natural language interfaces to temporal databases, drawing on research on
temporal phenomena within logic and linguistics. The central part of our
framework is a logic-like formal language, called TOP, which can capture the
semantics of a wide range of English sentences. We have implemented an
HPSG-based sentence analyser that converts a large set of English queries
involving time into TOP formulae, and have formulated a provably correct
procedure for translating TOP expressions into queries in the TSQL2 temporal
database language. In this way we have established a sound route from English
to a general-purpose temporal database language.
