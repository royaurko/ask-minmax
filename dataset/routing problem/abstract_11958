The recent significant enrichment of the Order Completion Method for
nonlinear Systems of PDEs resulted in the global existence of generalized
solutions to a large class of such equations. In this paper we investigate the
existence and regularity of the generalized solutions to a family of nonlinear
first order Cauchy problems. The spaces of generalized solutions are obtained
as the completions of suitably constructed uniform convergence spaces.
