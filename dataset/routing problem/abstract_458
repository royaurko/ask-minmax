The Internet provides physical path diversity between a large number of
hosts, making it possible for networks to use alternative paths when one path
fails to deliver the required Quality of Service. However, for various reasons,
many established protocols (e.g. de facto Internet inter-domain routing
protocol, Border-Gateway Protocol - BGP) do not fully exploit such alternate
paths. This paper surveys research into techniques for discovering end-to-end
alternate paths, including those based on monitoring path performance, choosing
paths that are maximally disjoint, and in routing across multiple paths. It
surveys proposals for making BGP better able to exploit multiple paths and how
multi-homing can create alternate paths. It also describes how alternate paths
can be realized through detour routing (application layer mechanisms) and
routing deflections (network layer mechanisms). It also discusses Fast Re-Route
techniques for construction of backup routes. It concludes by surveying open
research issues into the discovery and use of alternate paths in the Internet.
