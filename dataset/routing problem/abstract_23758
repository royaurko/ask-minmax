We describe the ring structure of the cohomology of the Hilbert scheme of
points for a smooth surface X. When the canonical class K_X = 0, this was done
by Lehn and Sorger, extending earlier work when X = C^2. Their approach does
not generalize.
  Instead we recast this problem as a question of finding integrals of motion
for a Hamiltonian which describes ``intersection with the boundary''. To do so,
we use the identification of the cohomology of the Hilbert schemes with a Fock
space modelled on the lattice H(X). With this identification, Lehn computed the
operator of intersection with the boundary. It is essentially the
Calogero-Sutherland Hamiltonian.
  We then solve the problem of finding integrals of motion by using the
Dunkl-Cherednik operators to find an explicit commuting family of differential
operators; these operators represent cup product on the Hilbert scheme.
  We provide two characterizations of the Hilbert scheme multiplication
operators; the first as an algebra of operators that can be inductively built
from functions and the CS Hamiltonian, and the second in terms of the
centralizer of the CS Hamiltonian inside an appropriate ring of differential
operators.
