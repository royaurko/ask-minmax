The stationary states of boundary driven zero-range processes in random media
with quenched disorder are examined, and the motion of a tagged particle is
analyzed. For symmetric transition rates, also known as the random barrier
model, the stationary state is found to be trivial in absence of boundary
drive. Out of equilibrium, two further cases are distinguished according to the
tail of the disorder distribution. For strong disorder, the fugacity profiles
are found to be governed by the paths of normalized $\alpha$-stable
subordinators. The expectations of integrated functions of the tagged particle
position are calculated for three types of routes.
