We derive the Helmholtz theorem for stochastic Hamiltonian systems.
Precisely, we give a theorem characterizing Stratonovich stochastic
differential equations, admitting a Hamiltonian formulation. Moreover, in the
affirmative case, we give the associated Hamiltonian. This result show
coherence with the approach of \cite{milstein} where the contributors answered to
this problem through the preservation of the symplectic form but without
providing the Hamiltonian associated.
