Let $\A_0, \A_1, \ldots, \A_n$ be given square matrices of size $m$ with
rational coefficients. The paper focuses on the exact computation of one point
in each connected component of the real determinantal variety $\{\X \in\RR^n \:
:\: \det(\A_0+x_1\A_1+\cdots+x_n\A_n)=0\}$. Such a problem finds applications
in many areas such as control theory, computational geometry, optimization,
etc. Using standard complexity results this problem can be solved using
$m^{O(n)}$ arithmetic operations. Under some genericity assumptions on the
coefficients of the matrices, we provide an algorithm solving this problem
whose runtime is essentially quadratic in ${{n+m}\choose{n}}^{3}$. We also
report on experiments with a computer implementation of this algorithm. Its
practical performance illustrates the complexity estimates. In particular, we
emphasize that for subfamilies of this problem where $m$ is fixed, the
complexity is polynomial in $n$.
