We propose to solve any algorithm on discrete variables by a technique of
statistical estimation using deterministic convex analysis. In this framework,
the variables are represented by their probability and the distinction between
the complexity classes vanishes. The method is illustrated by solving the 3-SAT
problem in polynomial time.
