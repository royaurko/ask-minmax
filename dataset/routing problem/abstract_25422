Kochen-Specker (KS) vector systems are sets of vectors in R^3 with the
property that it is impossible to assign 0s and 1s to the vectors in such a way
that no two orthogonal vectors are assigned 0 and no three mutually orthogonal
vectors are assigned 1. The existence of such sets forms the basis of the
Kochen-Specker and Free Will theorems. Currently, the smallest known KS vector
system contains 31 vectors. In this paper, we establish a lower bound of 18 on
the size of any KS vector system. This requires us to consider a mix of
graph-theoretic and topological embedding problems, which we investigate both
from theoretical and practical angles. We propose several algorithms to tackle
these problems and report on extensive experiments. At the time of writing, a
large gap remains between the best lower and upper bounds for the minimum size
of KS vector systems.
