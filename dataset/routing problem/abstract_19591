The Sudden Approximation is applied to invert structural data on randomly
corrugated surfaces from inert atom scattering intensities. Several expressions
relating experimental observables to surface statistical features are derived.
The results suggest that atom (and in particular He) scattering can be used
profitably to study hitherto unexplored forms of complex surface disorder.
