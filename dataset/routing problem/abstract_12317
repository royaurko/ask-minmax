Generalizing a classical problem in enumerative combinatorics, Mansour and
Sun counted the number of subsets of $\Z_n$ without certain separations. Chen,
Wang, and Zhang then studied the problem of partitioning $\Z_n$ into
arithmetical progressions of a given type under some technical conditions. In
this paper, we improve on their main theorems by applying a convolution formula
for cyclic multinomial coefficients due to Raney-Mohanty.
