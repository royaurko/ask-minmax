Nowadays, multimedia and real-time applications consume much network
resources and so, need high flow rates and very small transfer delay. The
current ad hoc networks (MANETs), in their original state, are not able to
satisfy the requirements of quality of service (QoS). Researches for improving
QoS in these networks are main topics and a subject of intensive researches. In
Adhoc networks, the routing phase plays an important role for improving QoS.
Numerous routing protocols (proactive, reactive and hybrid) were proposed. AODV
(Adhoc On demand Distance Vector) is probably the more treated in literature In
this article, we propose a new variant based on the AODV which gives better
results than the original AODV protocol with respect of a set of QoS parameters
and under different constraints, taking into account the limited resources of
mobile environments (bandwidth, energy, etc...). The proposed variant (M-AODV)
suggests that the discovering operation for paths reconstruction should be done
from the source. It also defines a new mechanism for determining multiple
disjoint (separated) routes. To validate our solution, simulations were made
under Network Simulator (NS2). We measure traffic control and packet loss rate
under diverse constraints (mobility, energy and scale).
