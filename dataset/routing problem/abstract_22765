We review work on the problem of disorder in the 2D d-wave superconducting
state, and show that the symmetries of the normal state and the disorder
distribution are vital for understanding the low-energy behavior. Most previous
theoretical results for the density of states (DOS) are reconciled by a
combination of exact numerical solutions of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations
and weak localization calculations, which suggest that a novel diffusive mode
with momentum $(\pi ,\pi)$ is responsible for a divergence of the DOS in the
globally particle-hole symmetric case. We note briefly that the simple problem
of a disordered tight-binding band of normal electrons displays some similar
effects, which have been overlooked in the literature. Finally, in the
physically realistic case of binary alloy disorder, no particle-hole symmetry,
and an order parameter which is supressed around each impurity site, a power
law with nonuniversal exponent is predicted.
