Stability analysis and control of linear impulsive systems is addressed in a
hybrid framework, through the use of continuous-time time-varying discontinuous
Lyapunov functions. Necessary and sufficient conditions for stability of
impulsive systems with periodic impulses are first provided in order to set up
the main ideas. Extensions to stability of aperiodic systems under minimum,
maximum and ranged dwell-times are then derived. By exploiting further the
particular structure of the stability conditions, the results are
non-conservatively extended to quadratic stability analysis of linear uncertain
impulsive systems. These stability criteria are, in turn, losslessly extended
to stabilization using a particular, yet broad enough, class of state-feedback
controllers, providing then a convex solution to the open problem of robust
dwell-time stabilization of impulsive systems using hybrid stability criteria.
Relying finally on the representability of sampled-data systems as impulsive
systems, the problems of robust stability analysis and robust stabilization of
periodic and aperiodic uncertain sampled-data systems are straightforwardly
solved using the same ideas. Several examples are discussed in order to show
the effectiveness and reduced complexity of the proposed approach.
