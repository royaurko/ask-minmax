The fixed point property for finite posets of width 3 and 4 is studied in
terms of forbidden retracts. The ranked forbidden retracts for width 3 and 4
are determined explicitly. The ranked forbidden retracts for the width 3 case
that are linearly indecomposable are examined to see which are minimal
automorphic. Part of a problem of Niederle from 1989 is thus solved.
