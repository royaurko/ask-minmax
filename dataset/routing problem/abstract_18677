Our preceding paper introduced a method to compute Casimir forces in
arbitrary geometries and for arbitrary materials that was based on a
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) scheme. In this manuscript, we focus on
the efficient implementation of our method for geometries of practical interest
and extend our previous proof-of-concept algorithm in one dimension to problems
in two and three dimensions, introducing a number of new optimizations. We
consider Casimir piston-like problems with nonmonotonic and monotonic force
dependence on sidewall separation, both for previously solved geometries to
validate our method and also for new geometries involving magnetic sidewalls
and/or cylindrical pistons. We include realistic dielectric materials to
calculate the force between suspended silicon waveguides or on a suspended
membrane with periodic grooves, also demonstrating the application of PML
absorbing boundaries and/or periodic boundaries. In addition we apply this
method to a realizable three-dimensional system in which a silica sphere is
stably suspended in a fluid above an indented metallic substrate. More
generally, the method allows off-the-shelf FDTD software, already supporting a
wide variety of materials (including dielectric, magnetic, and even anisotropic
materials) and boundary conditions, to be exploited for the Casimir problem.
