We compute a recently introduced geometric invariant of stricly pseudoconvex
CR 3-manifolds for certain circle invariant spherical CR structures on Seifert
manifolds. We give applications to the problem of filling the CR manifold by a
complex hyperbolic manifold, and more generally by a Kaehler-Einstein or an
Einstein metric.
