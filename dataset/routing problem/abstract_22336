In this paper we deal with semilinear problems at resonance. We present a
sufficient condition for the existence of a weak solution in terms of the
asymptotic properties of nonlinearity. Our condition generalizes the classical
Landesman-Lazer condition but it also covers the cases of vanishing and
oscillating nonlinearities.
