We investigate channel equalization for Rayleigh fading channels under
bounded channel uncertainties. We analyze three robust methods to estimate an
unknown signal transmitted through a Rayleigh fading channel, where we avoid
directly tuning the equalizer parameters to the available inaccurate channel
information. These methods are based on minimizing certain mean-square error
criteria that incorporate the channel uncertainties into the problem
formulations. We present closed-form solutions to the channel equalization
problems for each method and for both zero mean and nonzero mean signals. We
illustrate the performances of the equalization methods through simulations.
