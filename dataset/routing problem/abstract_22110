Within a Markovian complete financial market, we consider the problem of
hedging a Bermudan option with a given probability. Using stochastic target and
duality arguments, we derive a backward numerical scheme for the Fenchel
transform of the pricing function. This algorithm is similar to the usual
American backward induction, except that it requires two additional Fenchel
transformations at each exercise date. We provide numerical illustrations.
