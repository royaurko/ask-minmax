The cosmological constant problem is usually considered an inevitable feature
of any effective theory capturing well-tested gravitational and matter physics,
without regard to the details of short-distance gravitational couplings. In
this paper, a subtle effective description avoiding the problem is presented in
a first quantized language, consistent with experiments and the Equivalence
Principle. First quantization allows a minimal domain of validity to be carved
out by cutting on the proper length of particle worldlines. This is facilitated
by working in (locally) Euclidean spacetime, although considerations of
unitarity are still addressed by analytic continuation from Lorentzian
spacetime. The new effective description demonstrates that the cosmological
constant problem {\it is} sensitive to short-distance details of gravity, which
can be probed experimentally. ``Fat Gravity'' toy models are presented,
illustrating how gravity might shut off at short but testable distances, in a
generally covariant manner that suppresses the cosmological constant. This
paper improves on previous work by allowing generalizations to massless matter,
non-trivial spins, non-perturbative phenomena, and multiple (metastable) vacua.
