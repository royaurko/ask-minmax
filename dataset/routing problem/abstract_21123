We consider the algebraization problem for principal bundles with reductive
structure group, defined on the complement of a closed subset Z in a proper
formal scheme. We show that, when Z is of codimension at least 3, an
algebraization always exists. For codimension 2 we show that an algebraization
exists precisely when a certain additional condition is satisfied.
