Given a finite set of arbitrarily distributed points in affine space with
arbitrary multiplicity structures, we present an algorithm to compute the
reduced Groebner basis of the vanishing ideal under the lexicographic ordering.
Our method discloses the essential geometric connection between the relative
position of the points with multiplicity structures and the quotient basis of
the vanishing ideal, so we will explicitly know the set of leading terms of
elements of I. We split the problem into several smaller ones which can be
solved by induction over variables and then use our new algorithm for
intersection of ideals to compute the result of the original problem. The new
algorithm for intersection of ideals is mainly based on the Extended Euclidean
Algorithm.
