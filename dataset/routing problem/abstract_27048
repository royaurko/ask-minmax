Ryser's Conjecture states that any $r$-partite $r$-uniform hypergraph has a
vertex cover of size at most $r - 1$ times the size of the largest matching.
For $r = 2$, the conjecture is simply K\"onig's Theorem. It has also been
proven for $r = 3$ by Aharoni using a beautiful topological argument. This
paper is the first part of the proof of a characterization of those $3$-uniform
hypergraphs for which Aharoni's Theorem is tight. It turns out that these
hypergraphs are far from being unique; for any given integer $k$ there are
infinitely many of them with matching number $k$.
  Our proof of this characterization is also based on topological machinery. It
turns out that the link graphs of Ryser-extremal $3$-uniform hypergraphs are
extremal for a natural graph theoretic problem of a topological sort: the
independence complexes of their line graphs have minimum (topological)
connectedness as a function of their dimension. In this paper we prove a
characterization of the bipartite graphs extremal for this problem. This
characterization will provide us with valuable structural information for our
characterization of Ryser-extremal $3$-uniform hypergraphs.
