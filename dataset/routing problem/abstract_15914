We consider a singular perturbed eigenvalue problem for Laplace operator in a
cylinder with frequent interchange of type of boundary condition on a lateral
surface. These boundary conditions are prescribed by partition of lateral
surface in a great number of narrow strips on those the Dirichlet and Neumann
conditions are imposed by turns. We study the case of the homogenized problem
containing Dirichlet condition on the lateral surface. When the width of strips
varies slowly, we construct the leading terms of eigenelements' asymptotics
expansions. We also estimate the degree of convergence for eigenvalues if the
strips' width varies rapidly.
