We use a deterministic particle method to produce numerical approximations to
the solutions of an evolution cross-diffusion problem for two populations.
  According to the values of the diffusion parameters related to the intra and
inter-population repulsion intensities, the system may be classified in terms
of an associated matrix. When the matrix is definite positive, the problem is
well posed and the Finite Element approximation produces convergent
approximations to the exact solution.
  A particularly important case arises when the matrix is only positive
semi-definite and the initial data are segregated: the contact inhibition
problem. In this case, the solutions may be discontinuous and hence the
(conforming) Finite Element approximation may exhibit instabilities in the
neighborhood of the discontinuity.
  In this article we deduce the particle method approximation to the general
cross-diffusion problem and apply it to the contact inhibition problem. We then
provide some numerical experiments comparing the results produced by the Finite
Element and the particle method discretizations.
