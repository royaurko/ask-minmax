For each n,N>0 we construct a set of points x_1,...,x_M in D^n with the
following property: if f is a rational inner function on D^n of degree strictly
less than N and g is an analytic function mapping D^n to D that satisfies
g(x_i)=f(x_i) for each i=1,...,M, then g=f on D^n. In terms of the Pick problem
on D^n, our result implies that for any rational inner f of degree less than N,
the Pick problem with data x_1,...,x_M and f(x_1),...,f(x_M) has a unique
solution.
