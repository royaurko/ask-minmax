Finding the eigenvalues of a Sturm-Liouville problem can be a computationally
challenging task, especially when a large set of eigenvalues is computed, or
just when particularly large eigenvalues are sought. This is a consequence of
the highly oscillatory behaviour of the solutions corresponding to high
eigenvalues, which forces a naive integrator to take increasingly smaller
steps. We will discuss some techniques that yield uniform approximation over
the whole eigenvalue spectrum and can take large steps even for high
eigenvalues. In particular, we will focus on methods based on coefficient
approximation which replace the coefficient functions of the Sturm-Liouville
problem by simpler approximations and then solve the approximating problem. The
use of (modified) Magnus or Neumann integrators allows to extend the
coefficient approximation idea to higher order methods.
