Three- and four-nucleon reactions are discussed. The focus is on the notion
of nuclear potentials, on conceptual and technical issues of calculations and
on unresolved problems between existing theoretical predictions and
experimental data. The special focus is on some historic aspects of the
evolution of the field. The views presented have a strong personal bias.
