Optimally selecting a subset of targets from a larger catalog is a common
problem in astronomy and cosmology. A specific example is the selection of
targets from an imaging survey for multi-object spectrographic follow-up. We
present a new heuristic algorithm, HYBRID, for this purpose and undertake
detailed studies of its performance. HYBRID combines elements of the simulated
annealing, MCMC and particle-swarm methods and is particularly successful in
cases where the survey landscape has multiple curvature or clustering scales.
HYBRID consistently outperforms the other methods, especially in
high-dimensionality spaces with many extrema. This means many fewer simulations
must be run to reach a given performance confidence level and implies very
significant advantages in solving complex or computationally expensive
optimisation problems.
