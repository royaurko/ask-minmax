In this paper, we consider in $R^n$ the Cauchy problem for nonlinear
Schr\"odinger equation with initial data in Sobolev space $W^{s,p}$ for $p<2$.
It is well known that this problem is ill posed. However, We show that after a
linear transformation by the linear semigroup the problem becomes locally well
posed in $W^{s,p}$ for $\frac{2n}{n+1}<p<2$ and $s>n(1-\frac{1}{p})$. Moreover,
we show that in one space dimension, the problem is locally well posed in $L^p$
for any $1<p<2$.
