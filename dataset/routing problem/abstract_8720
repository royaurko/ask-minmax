The Cartan's method of equivalence and moving coframe method has been applied
to solve the local equivalence problem for KDV-type equations under the action
of a pseudo-group of contact transformations. The structure equations, the sets
of differential invariants for symmetry groups and equivalent conditions of
these equations are found.
