A new approach to Poisson approximation is proposed. The basic idea is very
simple and based on properties of the Charlier polynomials and the Parseval
identity. Such an approach quickly leads to new effective bounds for several
Poisson approximation problems. A selected survey on diverse Poisson
approximation results is also given.
