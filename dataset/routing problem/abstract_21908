The review of existence theorems of bifurcation points of solutions for
nonlinear operator equation in Banach spaces is presented.
  The sufficient conditions of bifurcation of solutions of boundary-value
problem for Vlasov-Maxwell system are considered. The analytical method of
Lyapunov-Schmidt-Trenogin is employed.
