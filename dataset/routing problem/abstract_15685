In the present lectures the following topics are considered: general
properties of neutrinos, neutrino mass phenomenology (Dirac and Majorana
masses), neutrino masses in the simplest extensions of the standard model
(including the seesaw mechanism), neutrino oscillations in vacuum, neutrino
oscillations in matter (the MSW effect) in 2- and 3-flavour schemes,
implications of CP, T and CPT symmetries for neutrino oscillations, double beta
decay, solar neutrino oscillations and the solar neutrino problem, and
atmospheric neutrinos. We also give a short overview of the results of the
accelerator and reactor neutrino experiments and of future projects. Finally,
we discuss how the available experimental data on neutrino masses and lepton
mixing can be summarized in the phenomenologically allowed forms of the
neutrino mass matrix.
