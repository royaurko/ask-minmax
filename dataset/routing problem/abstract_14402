This paper deals with the rotation synchronization problem, which arises in
global registration of 3D point-sets and in structure from motion. The problem
is formulated in an unprecedented way as a "low-rank and sparse" matrix
decomposition that handles both outliers and missing data. A minimization
strategy, dubbed R-GoDec, is also proposed and evaluated experimentally against
state-of-the-art algorithms on simulated and real data. The results show that
R-GoDec is the fastest among the robust algorithms.
