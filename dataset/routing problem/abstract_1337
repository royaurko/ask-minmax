We propose a description of nonequilibrium systems via a simple protocol that
combines DFT-exchange-correlation potentials with self-energies of many-body
perturbation theory. The approach, aimed to avoid double counting of
interactions, is tested against exact results in Hubbard-type systems, with
respect to interaction strength, perturbation speed/inhomogeneity, and system
dimensionality/size. In many regimes, we find significant improvement over
adiabatic TDDFT or second-Born NEGF approximations. We briefly discuss the
reasons for the residual discrepancies, and directions for future work.
