We consider the initial-boundary value problem for the coupled
Navier-Stokes-Keller-Segel-Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov system in two-
and three-dimensional domains. The problem describes oxytaxis and growth of
Bacillus subtilis in moving water. We prove existence of global weak solutions
to the problem. We distinguish between two cases determined by the cell
diffusion term and the space dimension, which are referred as the supercritical
and subcritical ones. At the first case, the choice of the growth function
enjoys wide range of possibilities: in particular, it can be zero. Our results
are new even at the absence of the growth term. At the second case, the
restrictions on the growth function are less relaxed: for instance, it cannot
be zero but can be Fisher-like. In the case of linear cell diffusion, the
solution is regular and unique provided the domain is the whole plane. In
addition, we study the long-time behaviour of the problem, find dissipative
estimates, and construct attractors.
