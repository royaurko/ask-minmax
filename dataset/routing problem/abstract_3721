We present a new approach to convexification of the Tikhonov regularization
using a continuation method strategy. We embed the original minimization
problem into a one-parameter family of minimization problems. Both the penalty
term and the minimizer of the Tikhonov functional become dependent on a
continuation parameter.
  In this way we can independently treat two main roles of the regularization
term, which are stabilization of the ill-posed problem and introduction of the
a priori knowledge. For zero continuation parameter we solve a relaxed
regularization problem, which stabilizes the ill-posed problem in a weaker
sense. The problem is recast to the original minimization by the continuation
method and so the a priori knowledge is enforced.
  We apply this approach in the context of topology-to-shape geometry
identification, where it allows to avoid the convergence of gradient-based
methods to a local minima. We present illustrative results for magnetic
induction tomography which is an example of PDE constrained inverse problem.
