We propose a method to reconstruct the density of an optical source in a
highly scattering medium from ultrasound-modulated optical measurements. Our
approach is based on the solution to a hybrid inverse source problem for the
radiative transport equation (RTE). A controllability result for the RTE plays
an essential role in the analysis.
