Interpolation theory for complex polynomials is well understood. In the
non-commutative quaternionic setting, the polynomials can be evaluated "on the
left" and "on the right". If the interpolation problem involves interpolation
conditions of the same (left or right) type, the results are very much similar
to the complex case: a consistent problem has a unique solution of a low degree
(less than the number of interpolation conditions imposed), and the solution
set of the homogeneous problem is an ideal in the ring ${\mathbb H}[z]$. The
problem containing both "left" and "right" interpolation conditions is quite
different: there may exist infinitely many low-degree solutions and the
solution set of the homogeneous problem is a quasi-ideal in ${\mathbb H}[z]$.
