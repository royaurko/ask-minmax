We discuss a mechanical model which mimics the main features of the radiation
matter interaction in the black body problem. The pure classical dynamical
evolution, with a simple discretization of the action variables, leads to the
Stefan- Boltzmann law and to the Planck distribution without any additional
statistical assumption.
