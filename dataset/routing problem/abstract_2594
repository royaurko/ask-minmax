Junctions of doped Mott insulators offer a route to rectification at
frequencies beyond the terahertz range. Mott insulators have strong electronic
correlations and therefore short timescales for electron-electron scattering.
It is this short time scale that allows for the possibility of rectification at
frequencies higher than those of semiconductor devices that are limited by the
slow diffusion of charge carriers. We model a junction by a one dimensional
chain of electrons with p- and n-doping on the two halves of the chain. Two
types of systems are investigated: spin polarized electrons with
nearest-neighbor interaction, and spin-half electrons that interact via on-site
repulsion (the Hubbard model). For short chains the many-body Schrodinger
equation can be integrated numerically exactly, and when driven by an
oscillating electromagnetic field such idealized junctions rectify, showing a
preferred direction for charge transfer. Longer chains are studied by the
time-dependent density-matrix renormalization-group method, and also shown to
rectify.
