In this paper, we give an overview of the various general methods in
computing the zeta function of an algebraic variety defined over a finite
field, with an emphasis on computing the reduction modulo $p^m$ of the zeta
function of a hypersurface, where $p$ is the characteristic of the finite
field. In particular, this applies to the problem of counting rational points
of an algebraic variety over a finite field.
