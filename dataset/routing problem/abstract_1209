Exciton bound states in solids between electrons and holes are predicted to
form a superfluid at high temperatures. We show that by employing atomically
thin crystals such as a pair of adjacent bilayer graphene sheets, equilibrium
superfluidity of electron-hole pairs should be achievable for the first time.
The transition temperatures are well above liquid helium temperatures. Because
the sample parameters needed for the device have already been attained in
similar graphene devices, our work suggests a new route towards realizing
high-temperature superfluidity in existing quality graphene samples.
