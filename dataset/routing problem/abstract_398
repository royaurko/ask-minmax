We investigate the secular dynamics of two-planet coplanar systems evolving
under mutual gravitational interactions and dissipative forces. We consider two
mechanisms responsible for the planetary migration: star-planet (or
planet-satellite) tidal interactions and interactions of a planet with a
gaseous disc. We show that each migration mechanism is characterized by a
specific law of orbital angular momentum exchange. Calculating stationary
solutions of the conservative secular problem and taking into account the
orbital angular momentum leakage, we trace the evolutionary routes followed by
the planet pairs during the migration process. This procedure allows us to
recover the dynamical history of two-planet systems and constrain parameters of
the involved physical processes.
