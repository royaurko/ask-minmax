In a recent article [1], the FEAST algorithm has been presented as a general
purpose eigenvalue solver which is ideally suited for addressing the numerical
challenges in electronic structure calculations. Here, FEAST is presented
beyond the "black-box" solver as a fundamental modeling framework which can
naturally address the original numerical complexity of the electronic structure
problem as formulated by Slater in 1937 [2]. The non-linear eigenvalue problem
arising from the muffin-tin decomposition of the real-space domain is first
derived and then reformulated to be solved exactly within the FEAST framework.
This new framework is presented as a fundamental and practical solution for
performing both accurate and scalable electronic structure calculations,
bypassing the various issues of using traditional approaches such as
linearization and pseudopotential techniques. A finite element implementation
of this FEAST framework along with simulation results for various molecular
systems are also presented and discussed.
