Over the past few years the arithmetic Langlands program has found
applications in two quite different problems that arise in string physics. The
first of these is concerned with the fundamental problem of deriving the
geometry of spacetime from the worldsheet dynamics, leading to a realization of
the notion of an emergent spacetime in string theory. The second problem is
concerned with the idea of using automorphic black holes as probes of
spacetime. In this article both of these applications of the Langlands program
are described.
