In the original Art Gallery Problem (AGP), one seeks the minimum number of
guards required to cover a polygon $P$. We consider the Chromatic AGP (CAGP),
where the guards are colored. As long as $P$ is completely covered, the number
of guards does not matter, but guards with overlapping visibility regions must
have different colors. This problem has applications in landmark-based mobile
robot navigation: Guards are landmarks, which have to be distinguishable (hence
the colors), and are used to encode motion primitives, \eg, "move towards the
red landmark". Let $\chi_G(P)$, the chromatic number of $P$, denote the minimum
number of colors required to color any guard cover of $P$. We show that
determining, whether $\chi_G(P) \leq k$ is \NP-hard for all $k \geq 2$. Keeping
the number of colors minimal is of great interest for robot navigation, because
less types of landmarks lead to cheaper and more reliable recognition.
