So far, it is not well known how to deal with dissipative systems. There are
many paths of investigation in the literature and none of them present a
systematic and general procedure to tackle the problem. On the other hand, it
is well known that the fractional formalism is a powerful alternative when
treating dissipative problems. In this paper we propose a detailed way of
attacking the issue using fractional calculus to construct an extension of the
Dirac brackets in order to carry out the quantization of nonconservative
theories through the standard canonical way. We believe that using the extended
Dirac bracket definition it will be possible to analyze more deeply gauge
theories starting with second-class systems.
