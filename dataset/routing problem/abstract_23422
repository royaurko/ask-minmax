We consider the constraints that can be imposed on a wide class of Inflation
models in modified gravity scenarios in which the Friedmann equation is
modified by the inclusion of $\rho^2$ terms, where $\rho$ is the total energy
density. In particular we obtain the reheating temperature and gravitino
abundance associated with the end of inflation. Whereas models of chaotic
inflation and natural inflation can easily avoid the conventional gravitino
overproduction problem, we show that supersymmetric hybrid inflation models
(driven by both F and D-terms) do not work in the $\rho^2$ dominated era. We
also study inflation driven by exponetial potentials in this modified
background, and show that the gravitino production is suppressed enough to
avoid there being a problem, although other conditions severely constrain these
models.
