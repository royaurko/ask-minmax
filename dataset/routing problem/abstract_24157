We address the following problem: Given a complete $k$-partite geometric
graph $K$ whose vertex set is a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, compute a
spanner of $K$ that has a ``small'' stretch factor and ``few'' edges. We
present two algorithms for this problem. The first algorithm computes a
$(5+\epsilon)$-spanner of $K$ with O(n) edges in $O(n \log n)$ time. The second
algorithm computes a $(3+\epsilon)$-spanner of $K$ with $O(n \log n)$ edges in
$O(n \log n)$ time. The latter result is optimal: We show that for any $2 \leq
k \leq n - \Theta(\sqrt{n \log n})$, spanners with $O(n \log n)$ edges and
stretch factor less than 3 do not exist for all complete $k$-partite geometric
graphs.
