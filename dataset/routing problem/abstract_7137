The present study gives a mathematical framework for self-evolution within
autonomous problem solving systems. Special attention is set on universal
abstraction, thereof generation by net block homomorphism, consequently
multiple order solving systems and the overall decidability of the set of the
solutions. By overlapping presentation of nets new abstraction relation among
nets is formulated alongside with consequent alphabetical net block renetting
system proportional to normal forms of renetting systems regarding the
operational power. A new structure in self-evolving problem solving is
established via saturation by groups of equivalence relations and iterative
closures of generated quotient transducer algebras over the whole evolution.
