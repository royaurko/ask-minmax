In the standard formulation of the occupancy problem one considers the
distribution of r balls in n cells, with each ball assigned independently to a
given cell with probability 1/n. Although closed form expressions can be given
for the distribution of various interesting quantities (such as the fraction of
cells that contain a given number of balls), these expressions are often of
limited practical use. Approximations provide an attractive alternative, and in
the present paper we consider a large deviation approximation as r and n tend
to infinity. In order to analyze the problem we first consider a dynamical
model, where the balls are placed in the cells sequentially and ``time''
corresponds to the number of balls that have already been thrown. A complete
large deviation analysis of this ``process level'' problem is carried out, and
the rate function for the original problem is then obtained via the contraction
principle. The variational problem that characterizes this rate function is
analyzed, and a fairly complete and explicit solution is obtained. The
minimizing trajectories and minimal cost are identified up to two constants,
and the constants are characterized as the unique solution to an elementary
fixed point problem. These results are then used to solve a number of
interesting problems, including an overflow problem and the partial coupon
collector's problem.
