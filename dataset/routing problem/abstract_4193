A cactus graph is a connected graph in which every block is either an edge or
a cycle. In this paper, we consider several problems of graph theory and
developed optimal algorithms to solve such problems on cactus graphs. The
running time of these algorithms is O(n), where n is the total number of
vertices of the graph. The cactus graph has many applications in real life
problems, especially in radio communication system.
