Analogy-Based (or Analogical) and Case-Based Reasoning (ABR and CBR) are two
similar problem solving processes based on the adaptation of the solution of
past problems for use with a new analogous problem. In this paper we review
these two processes and we give some real world examples with emphasis to the
field of Medicine, where one can find some of the most common and useful CBR
applications. We also underline the differences between CBR and the classical
rule-induction algorithms, we discuss the criticism for CBR methods and we
focus on the future trends of research in the area of CBR.
