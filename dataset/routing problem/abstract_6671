We give a general method for finding an exact analytical solution for the two
state curve crossing problem. The solution requires the knowledge of the
Green's function for the motion on the uncoupled potential. We use the method
to find the solution of the problem in the case of parabolic potentials coupled
by Gaussian interaction. Our method is applied to this model system to
calculate the effect of curve crossing on electronic absorption spectrum and
resonance Raman excitation profile.
