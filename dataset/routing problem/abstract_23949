Various solutions are displayed and analyzed (both analytically and
numerically) of arecently-introduced many-body problem in the plane which
includes both integrable and nonintegrable cases (depending on the values of
the coupling constants); in particular the origin of certain periodic behaviors
is explained. The light thereby shone on the connection among
\textit{integrability} and \textit{analyticity} in (complex) time, as well as
on the emergence of a \textit{chaotic} behavior (in the guise of a sensitive
dependance on the initial data) not associated with any local exponential
divergence of trajectories in phase space, might illuminate interesting
phenomena of more general validity than for the particular model considered
herein.
