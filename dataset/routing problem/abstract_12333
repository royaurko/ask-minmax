The category of modules over a string algebra is equipped with a tensor
product defined point-wise and arrow-wise in terms of the underlying quiver. In
the present article we investigate how this tensor product interacts with the
classification of indecomposables. We apply the results obtained to solve the
Clebsch-Gordan problem for string algebras. Moreover, we describe the
corresponding representation ring and tensor ideals in the module category.
