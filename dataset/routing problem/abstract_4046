In this work we examine the properties of a recently described ordinary
differential equation that relates the age-specific prevalence of a chronic
disease with the incidence and mortalities of the diseased and healthy persons.
The equation has been used to estimate the incidence from prevalence data,
which is an inverse problem. The ill-posedness of this problem is proven, too.
