The new concept of fuzzy interval matrices has been introduced in this book
for the first time.
  The contributors have not only introduced the notion of fuzzy interval matrices,
interval neutrosophic matrices and fuzzy neutrosophic interval matrices but
have also demonstrated some of its applications when the data under study is an
unsupervised one and when several experts analyze the problem. Further, the
contributors have introduced in this book multiexpert models using these three new
types of interval matrices. The new multi expert models dealt in this book are
FCIMs, FRIMs, FCInMs, FRInMs, IBAMs, IBBAMs, nIBAMs, FAIMs, FAnIMS, etc.
Illustrative examples are given so that the reader can follow these concepts
easily. This book has three chapters. The first chapter is introductory in
nature and makes the book a self-contained one. Chapter two introduces the
concept of fuzzy interval matrices. Also the notion of fuzzy interval matrices,
neutrosophic interval matrices and fuzzy neutrosophic interval matrices, can
find applications to Markov chains and Leontief economic models. Chapter three
gives the application of fuzzy interval matrices and neutrosophic interval
matrices to real-world problems by constructing the models already mentioned.
Further these models are mainly useful when the data is an unsupervised one and
when one needs a multi-expert model. The new concept of fuzzy interval matrices
and neutrosophic interval matrices will find their applications in engineering,
medical, industrial, social and psychological problems. We have given a long
list of references to help the interested reader.
