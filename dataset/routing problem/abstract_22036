We focus on the family of $(k,l)$-unambiguous automata that encompasses the
one of deterministic $k$-lookahead automata introduced by Han and Wood. We show
that this family presents nice theoretical properties that allow us to compute
quasi-deterministic structures. These structures are smaller than DFAs and can
be used to solve the membership problem faster than NFAs.
