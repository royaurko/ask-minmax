The subject matter of this paper concerns anisotropic diffusion equations: we
consider heat equations whose diffusion matrix have disparate eigenvalues. We
determine first and second order approximations, we study the well-posedness of
them and establish convergence results. The analysis relies on averaging
techniques, which have been used previously for studying transport equations
whose advection fields have disparate components.
