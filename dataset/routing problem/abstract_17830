In an era where learning is considered a problem, we decided to go for
problems for the sake of learning! The purpose of this study was to throw light
on the issues involved in two forms of PBL viz., Case Study Based PBL and
Research Based PBL The influence of course and subject on the learning method
was investigated. Students perceptions and concerns were analyzed using
questionnaires. A slight variation was found among the different courses of
Engineering, Business and IT, as also among the sample subjects considered. It
is concluded that careful and systematic introduction to the case study based
learning can be progressively led to the Research based learning as the student
progresses from the first semester to the final semester of a graduate degree
course or from graduate degree course to post graduate degree course.
