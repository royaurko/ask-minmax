It has been suggested that the Dark Energy Coincidence Problem could be
interpreted as a possible link between the cosmological constant and a massive
graviton. We show that by using that link and models for the graviton mass a
dark energy density can be obtained that is indeed very close to measurements
by WMAP. As a consequence of the models, the cosmological constant was found to
depend on the density of matter. A brief outline of the cosmological
consequences such as the effect on the black hole solution is given.
