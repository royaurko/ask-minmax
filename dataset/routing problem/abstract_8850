We prove that the proof of existence of weighted local median order of
weighted tournaments is wrong and that the proof of the correct statement which
asserts that every digraph obtained from a tournament by deleting a set of arcs
incident to the same vertex contains a mistake, in the paper entitled "Remarks
on the second neighborhood problem". We introduce correct proofs of each.
