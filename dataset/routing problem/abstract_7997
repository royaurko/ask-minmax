We use recent results regarding the geometry of the U(3) bosonic algebraic
model to motivate a hybrid algebraic-Schr\"odinger approach to the 2D
Franck-Condon problem analogous to 1D approaches. This approach allows one to
analyze bent to linear Franck-Condon transitions of triatomic molecules as well
as clarifies the angular momentum dependance of the Franck-Condon intensities.
