We consider the problem of maximizing expected utility for a power investor
who can allocate his wealth in a stock, a defaultable security, and a money
market account. The dynamics of these security prices are governed by geometric
Brownian motions modulated by a hidden continuous time finite state Markov
chain. We reduce the partially observed stochastic control problem to a
complete observation risk sensitive control problem via the filtered regime
switching probabilities. We separate the latter into pre-default and
post-default dynamic optimization subproblems, and obtain two coupled
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equations. We prove
existence and uniqueness of a globally bounded classical solution to each HJB
equation, and give the corresponding verification theorem. We provide a
numerical analysis showing that the investor increases his holdings in stock as
the filter probability of being in high growth regimes increases, and decreases
his credit risk exposure when the filter probability of being in high default
risk regimes gets larger.
