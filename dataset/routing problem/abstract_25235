In this paper we give a short theoretical description of the general
predictive adaptive arithmetic coding technique. The links between this
technique and the works of J. Rissanen in the 80's, in particular the BIC
information criterion used in parametrical model selection problems, are
established. We also design lossless and lossy coding techniques of images. The
lossless technique uses a mix between fixed-length coding and arithmetic coding
and provides better compression results than those separate methods. That
technique is also seen to have an interesting application in the domain of
statistics since it gives a data-driven procedure for the non-parametrical
histogram selection problem. The lossy technique uses only predictive adaptive
arithmetic codes and shows how a good choice of the order of prediction might
lead to better results in terms of compression. We illustrate those coding
techniques on a raw grayscale image.
