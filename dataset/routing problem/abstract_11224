The introduction of an interaction for dark energy to the standard cosmology
offers a potential solution to the cosmic coincidence problem. We examine the
conditions on the dark energy density that must be satisfied for this scenario
to be realized. Under some general conditions we find a stable attractor for
the evolution of the Universe in the future. Holographic conjectures for the
dark energy offer some specific examples of models with the desired properties.
