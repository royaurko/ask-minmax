The Hierarchical Reference Theory (HRT) and the Self-Consistent
Ornstein-Zernike Approximation (SCOZA) are two liquid state theories that both
furnish a largely satisfactory description of the critical region as well as
phase separation and the equation of state in general. Furthermore, there are a
number of similarities that suggest the possibility of a unification of both
theories. As a first step towards this goal we consider the problem of
combining the lowest order gamma expansion result for the incorporation of a
Fourier component of the interaction with the requirement of consistency
between internal and free energies, leaving aside the compressibility relation.
For simplicity we restrict ourselves to a simplified lattice gas that is
expected to display the same qualitative behavior as more elaborate models. It
turns out that the analytically tractable Mean Spherical Approximation is a
solution to this problem, as are several of its generalizations. Analysis of
the characteristic equations shows the potential for a practical scheme and
yields necessary conditions any closure to the Ornstein Zernike relation must
fulfill for the consistency problem to be well posed and to have a unique
differentiable solution. These criteria are expected to remain valid for more
general discrete and continuous systems, even if consistency with the
compressibility route is also enforced where possible explicit solutions will
require numerical evaluations.
