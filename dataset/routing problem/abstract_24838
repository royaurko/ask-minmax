We consider the problem of efficiently learning optimal control policies and
value functions over large state spaces in an online setting in which estimates
must be available after each interaction with the world. This paper develops an
explicitly model-based approach extending the Dyna architecture to linear
function approximation. Dynastyle planning proceeds by generating imaginary
experience from the world model and then applying model-free reinforcement
learning algorithms to the imagined state transitions. Our main results are to
prove that linear Dyna-style planning converges to a unique solution
independent of the generating distribution, under natural conditions. In the
policy evaluation setting, we prove that the limit point is the least-squares
(LSTD) solution. An implication of our results is that prioritized-sweeping can
be soundly extended to the linear approximation case, backing up to preceding
features rather than to preceding states. We introduce two versions of
prioritized sweeping with linear Dyna and briefly illustrate their performance
empirically on the Mountain Car and Boyan Chain problems.
