We consider the problem of estimating the perimeter of a smooth domain in the
plane based on a sample from the uniform distribution over the domain. We study
the performance of the estimator defined as the perimeter of the alpha-shape of
the sample. Some numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings.
