Covariance is used as an inner product on a formal vector space built on n
random variables to define measures of correlation Md across a set of vectors
in a d-dimensional space. For d = 1, one has the diameter; for d = 2, one has
an area. These concepts are directly applied to correlation studies in climate
science.
