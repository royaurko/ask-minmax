We establish the binary nonlinearization approach of the spectral problem of
the super AKNS system, and then use it to obtain the super finite-dimensional
integrable Hamiltonian system in supersymmetry manifold $\mathbb{R}^{4N|2N}$.
The super Hamiltonian forms and integrals of motion are given explicitly.
