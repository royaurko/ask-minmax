We present the evolution equation describing MSW conversion, derived in the
framework of the Schr\"odinger approach, in the presence of matter density
fluctuations. Then we analyse the effect of such fluctuations in the MSW
scenario as a solution to the solar neutrino problem. It is shown that the
non-adiabatic MSW parameter region is rather stable (especially in $\delta
m^2$) for matter density noise at the few percent level. We also discuss the
possibility to probe solar matter density fluctuations at the future Borexino
experiment.
