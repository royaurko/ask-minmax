We consider the computational aspects of lossy data compression problem,
where the compression error is determined by a cover of the data space. We
propose an algorithm which reduces the number of partitions needed to find the
entropy with respect to the compression error. In particular, we show that, in
the case of finite cover, the entropy is attained on some partition. We give an
algorithmic construction of such partition.
