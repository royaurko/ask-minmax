The legality of the "rooting trick" in dynamical staggered fermion
simulations is discussed, i.e. whether the theory with the Boltzmann weight
$\det^{1/4}(D_\mathrm{st})$ yields the right continuum limit. Since the problem
is unsolved, pieces of evidence in favor and against are collected and
examined.
