The Lipschitz multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem generalizes the classical
multi-armed bandit problem by assuming one is given side information consisting
of a priori upper bounds on the difference in expected payoff between certain
pairs of strategies. Classical results of (Lai and Robbins 1985) and (Auer et
al. 2002) imply a logarithmic regret bound for the Lipschitz MAB problem on
finite metric spaces. Recent results on continuum-armed bandit problems and
their generalizations imply lower bounds of $\sqrt{t}$, or stronger, for many
infinite metric spaces such as the unit interval. Is this dichotomy universal?
We prove that the answer is yes: for every metric space, the optimal regret of
a Lipschitz MAB algorithm is either bounded above by any $f\in \omega(\log t)$,
or bounded below by any $g\in o(\sqrt{t})$. Perhaps surprisingly, this
dichotomy does not coincide with the distinction between finite and infinite
metric spaces; instead it depends on whether the completion of the metric space
is compact and countable. Our proof connects upper and lower bound techniques
in online learning with classical topological notions such as perfect sets and
the Cantor-Bendixson theorem. Among many other results, we show a similar
dichotomy for the "full-feedback" (a.k.a., "best-expert") version.
