In this paper, we investigate the Cauchy problem for the Ostrovsky equation
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \partial_{x}\left(u_{t}-\beta \partial_{x}^{3}u
  +\frac{1}{2}\partial_{x}(u^{2})\right)
  -\gamma u=0, \end{eqnarray*} in the Sobolev space $H^{-3/4}(\R)$,
$\beta>0,\gamma >0$. From the result of \cite{IM1,IM3,Tsu}, we know that
$s=-\frac{3}{4}$ is the critical Sobolev index for the Ostrovsky equation. By
using some modified Besov spaces, we prove that the Cauchy problem for the
Ostrovsky equation with positive dispersion is locally well-posed in
$H^{-3/4}(\R).$ The new ingredient that we introduce in this paper is Lemmas
2.1-2.2 which are used to overcome the difficulty caused by the singularity of
the phase function at the zero point.
