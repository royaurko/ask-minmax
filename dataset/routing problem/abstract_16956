We study two weighted graph coloring problems, in which one assigns $q$
colors to the vertices of a graph such that adjacent vertices have different
colors, with a vertex weighting $w$ that either disfavors or favors a given
color. We exhibit a weighted chromatic polynomial $Ph(G,q,w)$ associated with
this problem that generalizes the chromatic polynomial $P(G,q)$. General
properties of this polynomial are proved, and illustrative calculations for
various families of graphs are presented. We show that the weighted chromatic
polynomial is able to distinguish between certain graphs that yield the same
chromatic polynomial. We give a general structural formula for $Ph(G,q,w)$ for
lattice strip graphs $G$ with periodic longitudinal boundary conditions. The
zeros of $Ph(G,q,w)$ in the $q$ and $w$ planes and their accumulation sets in
the limit of infinitely many vertices of $G$ are analyzed. Finally, some
related weighted graph coloring problems are mentioned.
