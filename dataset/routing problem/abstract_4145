In this note we set up the elliptic and the parabolic Dirichlet problem for
linear nonlocal operators. As opposed to the classical case of second order
differential operators, here the "boundary data" are prescribed on the
complement of a given bounded set. We formulate the problem in the classical
framework of Hilbert spaces and prove unique solvability using standard
techniques like the Fredholm alternative.
