In an inverse problem, such as the determination of brain activity given
magnetic field measurements outside the head, the main quantity of interest is
often the power associated with a source. The `standard' way to determine this
has been to find the best linear estimate of the source and calculate the power
associated with this. This paper proposes an alternative method and then
relationship to this previous method of estimation is explored both
algebraically and by numerical simulation.
  In abstract terms the problem can be stated as follows. Let H be a Hilbert
space with inner product <, >. Let L be a linear map: H->R^n. Suppose that we
are a given data vector b in R^n such that b=Lx+e where e is a vector of random
variables with zero mean and given covariance matrix that represents
measurement errors. The problem that is addressed in this paper is to estimate
<x,Xx> where X is an operator on H (e.g. the characteristic function of a
region of interest).
