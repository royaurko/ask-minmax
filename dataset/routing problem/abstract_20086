We find a natural class of transformations ("flattened perturbations") of a
norming M-basis in a Banach space X, which give a strong norming M-basis in X.
This simplifies and generalizes the positive answer to the "strong M-basis
problem" solved by P. Terenzi. We also show that in general one cannot achieve
uniformly minimality applying standard transformations to a given norming
M-basis, despite of the existence in X a uniformly minimal strong M-bases.
