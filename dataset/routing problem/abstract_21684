In the presence of a layer of metaprobabilities (from uncertainty concerning
the parameters), the asymptotic tail exponent corresponds to the lowest
possible tail exponent regardless of its probability. The problem explains
"Black Swan" effects, i.e., why measurements tend to chronically underestimate
tail contributions, rather than merely deliver imprecise but unbiased
estimates.
