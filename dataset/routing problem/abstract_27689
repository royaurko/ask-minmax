This paper presents a variational based approach to fusing hyperspectral and
multispectral images. The fusion process is formulated as an inverse problem
whose solution is the target image assumed to live in a much lower dimensional
subspace. A sparse regularization term is carefully designed, relying on a
decomposition of the scene on a set of dictionaries. The dictionary atoms and
the corresponding supports of active coding coefficients are learned from the
observed images. Then, conditionally on these dictionaries and supports, the
fusion problem is solved via alternating optimization with respect to the
target image (using the alternating direction method of multipliers) and the
coding coefficients. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the
proposed algorithm when compared with the state-of-the-art fusion methods.
