We show global uniqueness of the solution to a class of constrained
variational problems, using scaling properties. This is used to establish the
essential uniqueness of solutions of a large deviations problem in multiple
dimensions. The result is motivated by models of buffers, and in particular the
probability of, and typical path to overflow in the limit of small buffers,
which we analyze.
