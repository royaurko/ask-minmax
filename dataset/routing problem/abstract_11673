The paper introduces a general strategy for identifying strong local
minimizers of variational functionals. It is based on the idea that any
variation of the integral functional can be evaluated directly in terms of the
appropriate parameterized measures. We demonstrate our approach on a problem of
W^{1,infinity} weak-* local minima--a slight weakening of the classical notion
of strong local minima. We obtain the first quasiconvexity-based set of
sufficient conditions for W^{1,infinity} weak-* local minima.
