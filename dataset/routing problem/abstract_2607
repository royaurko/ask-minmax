We assess the potential of planet formation instigating the early formation
of a photoevaporation driven gap, up to radii larger than typical for
photoevaporation alone. For our investigation we make use of hydrodynamics
models of photoevaporating discs with a giant planet embedded. We find that, by
reducing the mass accretion flow onto the star, discs that form giant planets
will be dispersed at earlier times than discs without planets by X-ray
photoevaporation. By clearing the portion of the disc inner of the planet
orbital radius, planet formation induced photoevaporation (PIPE) is able to
produce transition disc that for a given mass accretion rate have larger holes
when compared to standard X-ray photoevaporation. This constitutes a possible
route for the formation of the observed class of accreting transition discs
with large holes, which are otherwise difficult to explain by planet formation
or photoevaporation alone. Moreover, assuming that a planet is able to filter
dust completely, PIPE produces a transition disc with a large hole and may
provide a mechanism to quickly shut down accretion. This process appears to be
too slow however to explain the observed desert in the population of transition
disc with large holes and low mass accretion rates.
