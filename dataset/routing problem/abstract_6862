This presentation will introduce the audience to a new, emerging body of
research on sequential Monte Carlo techniques in robotics. In recent years,
particle filters have solved several hard perceptual robotic problems. Early
successes were limited to low-dimensional problems, such as the problem of
robot localization in environments with known maps. More recently, researchers
have begun exploiting structural properties of robotic domains that have led to
successful particle filter applications in spaces with as many as 100,000
dimensions. The presentation will discuss specific tricks necessary to make
these techniques work in real - world domains,and also discuss open challenges
for researchers IN the UAI community.
