The inclusion of gauge messengers in models of gauge mediation allows for
more general predictions that those described by the framework of general gauge
mediation. Motivated by this, we explore some models of gauge mediation with
gauge messengers in SU(5) GUTs. In most previous attempts of building viable
models where gauge messengers play a role in determining the soft terms, squark
and/or slepton masses turned out to be tachyonic. The objective of this paper
is to address this problem and propose two possible solutions, one of which has
a natural realization in the solution of the doublet-triplet problem. Another
interesting result is that in these models the association of SUSY breaking
with the breaking of the GUT group provides a simple mechanism that can explain
why $SU(5)\rightarrow SU(3)\times SU(2) \times U(1)$ is preferred over other
symmetry breaking patterns.
