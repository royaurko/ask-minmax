We study the problem of recovering the phase from magnitude measurements;
specifically, we wish to reconstruct a complex-valued signal x of C^n about
which we have phaseless samples of the form y_r = |< a_r,x >|^2, r = 1,2,...,m
(knowledge of the phase of these samples would yield a linear system). This
paper develops a non-convex formulation of the phase retrieval problem as well
as a concrete solution algorithm. In a nutshell, this algorithm starts with a
careful initialization obtained by means of a spectral method, and then refines
this initial estimate by iteratively applying novel update rules, which have
low computational complexity, much like in a gradient descent scheme. The main
contribution is that this algorithm is shown to rigorously allow the exact
retrieval of phase information from a nearly minimal number of random
measurements. Indeed, the sequence of successive iterates provably converges to
the solution at a geometric rate so that the proposed scheme is efficient both
in terms of computational and data resources. In theory, a variation on this
scheme leads to a near-linear time algorithm for a physically realizable model
based on coded diffraction patterns. We illustrate the effectiveness of our
methods with various experiments on image data. Underlying our analysis are
insights for the analysis of non-convex optimization schemes that may have
implications for computational problems beyond phase retrieval.
