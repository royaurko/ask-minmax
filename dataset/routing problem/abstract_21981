The relation of the shell, collective and cluster models of the atomic nuclei
is discussed from the viewpoint of symmetries. In the fifties the U(3) symmetry
was found as their common part for a single shell problem. For multi
major-shell excitations, considered here, the U(3)$\otimes$U(3) dynamical
symmetry turns out to be their intersection.
