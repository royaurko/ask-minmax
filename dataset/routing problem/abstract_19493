Recently, there has been great interest in the application of composition
laws to problems in enumerative geometry. Using the moduli space of stable
maps, we compute the number of irreducible, reduced, nodal, degree-$d$
genus-$2$ plane curves whose normalization has a fixed complex structure and
which pass through $3d - 2$ general points in $\Bbb P^2$.
