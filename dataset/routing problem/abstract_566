In this paper we place our arguments on two related issues in the design of
generalized structured peer-to-peer overlays. First, we argue that for the
large-scale content-sharing applications, lookup and content transport
functions need to be treated separately. Second, to create a location-based
routing overlay suitable for content sharing and other applications, we argue
that off-the-shelf geographic coordinates of Internet-connected hosts can be
used as a basis. We then outline the design principles and present a design for
the generalized routing overlay based on adaptive hierarchical partitioning of
the geographical space.
