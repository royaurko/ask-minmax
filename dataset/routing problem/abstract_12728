A simple text book problem in mechanics\cite{klep}, describes a massive
horizontal bar placed on two oppositely rotating rollers, kept at a fixed
center to center distance. Subsequent motion is to be found out in presence of
kinetic frictions at the point of contacts of the two rollers\cite{demo}.
Introducing bulk rolling friction effects, through the contact planes and
considering viscoelastic rollers, we find that the inverse of the square of the
oscillation frequency of the bar has a linear relationship with the center to
center distance. The gradient and intercept of the linear relation together
with observations about two consecutive positions of the bar, determine the
rolling friction coefficient of the viscoelastic materials of the two rollers
fully.
