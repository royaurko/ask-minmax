In this work, we prove a generalization of Osgood's test for the explosion of
the solutions of initial-value problems. We also establish a comparison
criterion for the solution of integral equations with noise, and provide
estimations of the time of explosion of problems arising in the investigation
of crack failures where the noise is the absolute value of the Brownian motion
