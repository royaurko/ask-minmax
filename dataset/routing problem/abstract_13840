We establish the existence of multi-bump solutions for the following class of
quasilinear problems $$
  - \Delta_{ p(x) } u + \big( \lambda V(x) + Z(x) \big) u ^{ p(x)-1 } = f(x,u)
\text{ in } \mathbb R^N, \, u \ge 0 \text{ in } \mathbb R^N, $$ where the
nonlinearity $ f \colon \mathbb R^N \times \mathbb R \to \mathbb R $ is a
continuous function having a subcritical growth and potentials $ V, Z \colon
\mathbb R^N \to \mathbb R $ are continuous functions verifying some hypotheses.
The main tool used is the variational method.
