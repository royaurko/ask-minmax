We examine the linear convergence rates of variants of the proximal point
method for finding zeros of maximal monotone operators. We begin by showing how
metric subregularity is sufficient for linear convergence to a zero of a
maximal monotone operator. This result is then generalized to obtain
convergence rates for the problem of finding a common zero of multiple monotone
operators by considering randomized and averaged proximal methods.
