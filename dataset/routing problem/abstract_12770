We present a direct reduction from k-player games to 2-player games that
preserves approximate Nash equilibrium. Previously, the computational
equivalence of computing approximate Nash equilibrium in k-player and 2-player
games was established via an indirect reduction. This included a sequence of
works defining the complexity class PPAD, identifying complete problems for
this class, showing that computing approximate Nash equilibrium for k-player
games is in PPAD, and reducing a PPAD-complete problem to computing approximate
Nash equilibrium for 2-player games. Our direct reduction makes no use of the
concept of PPAD, thus eliminating some of the difficulties involved in
following the known indirect reduction.
