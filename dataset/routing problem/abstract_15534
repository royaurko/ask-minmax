Cosmological consequences of a strictly valid total energy conservation for
the whole universe are investigated in this paper. Interestingly enough as one
consequence of ergodically behaving universes very specific scaling laws with
the diameter R of the universe can be derived for relevant cosmic quantities.
Especially the 1/R^2- scaling of mass - and vacuum energy - density then
automatically leads to a vanishing cosmic curvature parameter k=0 and also
reveals, that for such universes no horizon problem occurs. In addition the
longstanding problem of observationally indicated very low cosmic vacuum
energies in contrast to the very large quantumfield estimates is easily solved
when the vacuum energy density decay with 1/R^2 is taken into account
reconciling presently observed vacuum energy density values with those from
theoretical expectations. We also suggest why the mass of the universe can
permanently increase and can in fact grow up from a Planck mass as a pure
vacuum fluctuation.
