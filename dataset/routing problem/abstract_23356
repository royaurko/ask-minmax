The semi-simple unification model based on SU(5)_GUT \times U(3)_H gauge
group is an interesting extension of the minimal SU(5)_GUT grand unification
theory (GUT), since it solves the two serious problems in the standard GUT: the
triplet-doublet splitting problem and the presence of dangerous dimension five
operators for proton decay. Here, the extra U(3)_H gauge interaction plays a
crucial role on the GUT breaking. In this paper, we show that the full
multiplet structure of the U(3)_H sector required for the desired GUT breaking
is reproduced naturally on T^6/Z_12 orientifold in the type IIB supergravity
with a D3-D7 system. The SU(5)_GUT vector multiplet lives on D7-branes and the
U(3)_H sector resides on D3-branes. We also show that various interesting
features in the original SU(5)_GUT \times U(3)_H model are explained in the
present brane-world scenario. A possible extension to the type IIB string
theory is also discussed.
