In this paper a numerical meshless method for solving the radiative transfer
equations in a slab medium with an isotropic scattering is considered. The
method is based on radial basis functions to approximate the solution of an
integral-partial differential equation by using collocation method. For this
purpose different applications of RBFs are used. To this end the numerical
solutions are obtained without any mesh generation into the domain of the
problems. The results of numerical experiments are compared with the existing
results in illustrative examples to confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the
presented scheme. Also the norm of the residual functions are obtained to show
the convergence of the method.
