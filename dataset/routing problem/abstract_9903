Moore introduced a method for graduate mathematics instruction that consisted
primarily of individual student work on challenging proofs (Jones, 1977). Cohen
(1982) described an adaptation with less explicit competition suitable for
undergraduate students at a liberal arts college. This paper details an
adaptation of this modified Moore-method to teach mathematical statistics, and
describes ways that such an approach helps engage students and foster the
teaching of statistics.
  Groups of students worked a set of 3 difficult problems (some theoretical,
some applied) every two weeks. Class time was devoted to coaching sessions with
the instructor, group meeting time, and class presentations. R was used to
estimate solutions empirically where analytic results were intractable, as well
as to provide an environment to undertake simulation studies with the aim of
deepening understanding and complementing analytic solutions. Each group
presented comprehensive solutions to complement oral presentations. Development
of parallel techniques for empirical and analytic problem solving was an
explicit goal of the course, which also attempted to communicate ways that
statistics can be used to tackle interesting problems. The group problem
solving component and use of technology allowed students to attempt much more
challenging questions than they could otherwise solve.
