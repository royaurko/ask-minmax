A statistical decision problem is hidden in the core of option pricing. A
simple form for the price C of a European call option is obtained via the
minimum Bayes risk, R_B, of a 2-parameter estimation problem, thus justifying
calling C Bayes (B-)price. The result provides new insight in option pricing,
among others obtaining C for some stock-price models using the underlying
probability instead of the risk neutral probability and giving R_B an economic
interpretation. When logarithmic stock prices follow Brownian motion, discrete
normal mixture and hyperbolic Levy motion the obtained B-prices are "fair"
prices. A new expression for the price of American call option is also obtained
and statistical modeling of R_B can be used when pricing European and American
call options.
