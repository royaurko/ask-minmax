I review recent progress in the determination of the parton structure of the
nucleon, in particular from deep-inelastic structure functions. I explain how
the needs of current and future precision phenomenology, specifically at the
LHC, have turned the determination of parton distributions into a quantitative
problem. I describe the results and difficulties of current approaches and
ideas to go beyond them.
