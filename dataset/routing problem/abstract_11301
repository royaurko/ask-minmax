We study the solar neutrino problem within the framework of a parametrized
post-Newtonian formulation for the gravitational interaction of the neutrinos,
which incorporates a violation to the equivalence principle (VEP). Using the
current data on the rates and the energy spectrum we find two possible
oscillation solutions, both for a large mixing angle. One of them involves the
MSW effect in matter and the other corresponds to vacuum oscillations. An
interesting characteristic of this mechanism is that it predicts a semi-annual
variation of the neutrino flux. Our analysis provides new constraints for some
VEP parameters.
