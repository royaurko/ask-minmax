One of the most significant problems which inhibits further developments in
the areas of Knowledge Representation and Artificial Intelligence is a problem
of semantic alignment or knowledge mapping. The progress in its solution will
be greatly beneficial for further advances of information retrieval, ontology
alignment, relevance calculation, text mining, natural language processing etc.
In the paper the concept of multidimensional global knowledge map, elaborated
through unsupervised extraction of dependencies from large documents corpus, is
proposed. In addition, the problem of direct Human - Knowledge Representation
System interface is addressed and a concept of adaptive decoder proposed for
the purpose of interaction with previously described unified mapping model. In
combination these two approaches are suggested as basis for a development of a
new generation of knowledge representation systems.
