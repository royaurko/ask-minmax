This note is a description of some of the results obtained by the contributors in
connection with the problem in the title. These, discussed following a summary
of background material concerning wedge differential operators, consist of the
notion of trace bundle, an extension of the Douglis-Nirenberg calculus to
handle spaces of anisotropic varying regularity and associated
pseudodifferential operators, and boundary value problems proper, the latter in
the first order case. The concepts concerning the main results are illustrated
with simple examples.
