We generalize the fractional variational problem by allowing the possibility
that the lower bound in the fractional derivative does not coincide with the
lower bound of the integral that is minimized. Also, for the standard case when
these two bounds coincide, we derive a new form of Euler-Lagrange equations. We
use approximations for fractional derivatives in the Lagrangian and obtain the
Euler-Lagrange equations which approximate the initial Euler-Lagrange equations
in a weak sense.
