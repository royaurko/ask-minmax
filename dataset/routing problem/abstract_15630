We will address the question of the consistency of teleparallel theories in
presence of spinning matter which has been a controversial subject of
discussion over the last twenty years. We argue that the origin of the problem
is not simply the symmetry or asymmetry of the stress-energy tensor of the
matter fields, which has been recently analyzed by several contributors, but arises
at a more fundamental level, namely from the invariance of the field equatins
under a frame change, a problem that has been discussed long time ago by
Kopczynski in the framework of the teleparallel equivalent of general
relativity. More importantly, we show that the problem is not only confined to
the purely teleparallel theory but arises actually in every Poincare gauge
theory that admits a teleparallel geometry in the absence of spinning sources,
i.e. in its classical limit.
