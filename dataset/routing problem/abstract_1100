We introduce a novel concept for optical frequency measurement and division
which employs a Kerr-lens mode-locked laser as a transfer oscillator whose
noise properties do not enter the measurement process. We experimentally
demonstrate, that this method opens up the route to phase-link signals with
arbitrary frequencies in the optical or microwave range while their frequency
stability is preserved.
