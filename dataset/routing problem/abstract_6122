In this paper a new approach to solving the 2D and 3D Ising models in
external magnetic field $H\neq0$ is developed. The general formalism for the
approach to the problem is presented on the example of the 2D Ising model in
the external magnetic field. The paper presents a new method obtaining the
Onsager solution and computations of asymptotic forms of low-temperature free
energy for the 2D Ising model in the external magnetic field $(H)$. The free
energy in the limiting case of the magnetic field tending to zero $(H\to 0,
N,M\to\infty)$ at arbitrary temperature is also considered $(T\neq 0)$.
