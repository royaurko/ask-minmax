We consider first the zero-nonzero determination problem, which consists in
determining the list of zero-nonzero conditions realized by a finite list of
polynomials on a finite set Z included in C^k with C an algebraic closed field.
We describe an algorithm to solve the zero-nonzero determination problem and we
perform its bit complexity analysis. This algorithm, which is in many ways an
adaptation of the methods used to solve the more classical sign determination
problem, presents also new ideas which can be used to improve sign
determination. Then, we consider the real-nonreal sign determination problem,
which deals with both the sign determination and the zero-nonzero determination
problem. We describe an algorithm to solve the real-nonreal sign determination
problem, we perform its bit complexity analysis and we discuss this problem in
a parametric context.
