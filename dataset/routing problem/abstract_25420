In this paper, we propose a new method for Salt-and-Pepper noise removal from
images. Whereas most of the existing methods are based on Ordered Statistics
filters, our method is based on the growing theory of Sparse Signal Processing.
In other words, we convert the problem of denoising into a sparse signal
reconstruction problem which can be dealt with the corresponding techniques. As
a result, the output image of our method is preserved from the undesirable
opacity which is a disadvantage of most of the other methods. We also introduce
an efficient reconstruction algorithm which will be used in our method.
Simulation results indicate that our method outperforms the other best-known
methods both in term of PSNR and visual criterion. Furthermore, our method can
be easily used for reconstruction of missing samples in erasure channels.
