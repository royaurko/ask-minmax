The regular finite initial value problem at infinity is used to obtain
regularity conditions on the freely specifiable parts of initial data for the
vacuum Einstein equations with non-vanishing second fundamental form. These
conditions ensure that the solutions of the propagation equations implied by
the conformal Einstein equations at the cylinder at spatial infinity extend
smoothly (and in fact analytically) through the critical sets where spatial
infinity touches null infinity. In order to ease the analysis the conformal
metric is assumed to be analytic, although the results presented here could be
generalised to a setting where the conformal metric is only smooth. The
analysis given here is a generalisation of the analysis on the regular finite
initial value problem first carried out by Friedrich, for initial data sets
with non-vanishing second fundamental form.
