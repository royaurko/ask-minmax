This paper is devoted to studying the initial value problem for a third-order
dispersive equation for closed curves into K\"ahler manifolds. This equation is
a geometric generalization of a two-sphere valued system modeling the motion of
vortex filament. We prove the local existence theorem by using geometric
analysis and classical energy method.
