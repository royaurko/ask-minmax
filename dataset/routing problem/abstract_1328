Nyquist White noise derivation based on blackbody radiation interacting with
electrons in a transmission line is revisited and is shown to possibly pave the
way toward secure noise-based communication systems. Encrypting a message for
secure transmission might be performed by combining it with controlled noise as
performed in Spread-Spectrum communication that are presently used in
Telecommunication systems. Quantum communication using entanglement is another
route for secure communications as demonstrated by several important
experiments. Classical and Quantum noise are compared and discussed as a major
constituent of secure communication.
