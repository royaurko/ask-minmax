In the present work we investigate temperature effects on the spinor and
scalar effetive QED in the context of Thermo Field Dynamics. Following
Weisskopf's zero-point energy method, the problem of charge renormalization is
reexamined and high temperature contributions are extracted from the thermal
correction for the Lagrangian densities.
