We show that an intermediate scale supersymmetric left-right seesaw scenario
with automatic R-parity conservation can cure the problem of tachyonic slepton
masses that arises when supersymmetry is broken by anomaly mediation, while
preserving ultraviolet insensitivity. The reason for this is the existence of
light B - L = 2 higgses with yukawa couplings to the charged leptons. We find
these theories to have distinct predictions compared to the usual mSUGRA and
gauge mediated models as well as the minimal AMSB models. Such predictions
include a condensed gaugino mass spectrum and possibly a correspondingly
condensed sfermion spectrum.
