We present an O(n^3 log^2 n)-time algorithm for the following problem: given
a finite metric space X, create a star-topology network with the points of X as
its leaves, such that the distances in the star are at least as large as in X,
with minimum dilation. As part of our algorithm, we solve in the same time
bound the parametric negative cycle detection problem: given a directed graph
with edge weights that are increasing linear functions of a parameter lambda,
find the smallest value of lambda such that the graph contains no
negative-weight cycles.
