Modified Rayleigh conjecture (MRC) in scattering theory is proposed and
justified. MRC allows one to develop numerical algorithms for solving direct
scattering problems related to acoustic wave scattering by soft and hard
obstacles of arbitrary shapes. It gives an error estimate for solving the
direct scattering problem. It suggests a numerical method for finding the shape
of a starshaped obstacle from the scattering data.
