In this paper, norm estimates are obtained for the problem of minimal-norm
tangential interpolation by vector-valued analytic functions in weighted H^p
spaces, expressed in terms of the Carleson constants of related scalar
measures. Applications are given to the notion of p-controllability properties
of linear semigroup systems and controllability by functions in certain Sobolev
spaces.
