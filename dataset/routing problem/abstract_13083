In this paper, we investigate the Mill's ratio estimation problem and get two
new inequalities. Compared to the well known results obtained by Gordon, they
becomes tighter. Furthermore, we also discuss the inverse Q-function
approximation problem and present some useful results on the inverse solution.
Numerical results confirm the validness of our theoretical analysis. In
addition, we also present a conjecture on the bounds of inverse solution on
Q-function.
