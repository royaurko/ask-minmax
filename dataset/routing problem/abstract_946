As the demand for Internet expands significantly in numbers of users,
servers, IP addresses, switches and routers, the IP based network architecture
must evolve and change. The design of domain specific processors that require
high performance, low power and high degree of programmability is the
bottleneck in many processor based applications. This paper describes the
design of ethernet packet processor for system-on-chip (SoC) which performs all
core packet processing functions, including segmentation and reassembly,
packetization classification, route and queue management which will speedup
switching/routing performance. Our design has been configured for use with
multiple projects ttargeted to a commercial configurable logic device the
system is designed to support 10/100/1000 links with a speed advantage. VHDL
has been used to implement and simulated the required functions in FPGA.
