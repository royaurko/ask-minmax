In the context of a Planck scale underpinning for the universe, we argue that
both gravitation and electromagnetism can be characterized in a unified way, in
a Sakharov like description. We also consider the issue of observed gamma
radiation, which recent observations seem to indicate are caused by the
annihilation of exotic $Mev$ particles, as indeed was theoretically predicted
earlier. Some other problems are also considered.
