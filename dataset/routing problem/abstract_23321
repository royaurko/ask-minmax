We show that the neutrino mixing pattern with the large mixing required for
the atmospheric neutrino problem and the small mixing angle MSW solution for
the solar neutrino problem can be naturally generated through radiative
magnification, even though all the mixing angles at the seesaw scale may be
small. This can account for the neutrino anomalies as well as the CHOOZ
constraints in the context of quark-lepton unified theories, where the quark
and lepton mixing angles are expected to be similar in magnitude at the high
scale. We also indicate the 4$\nu$ mixing scenarios for which this mechanism of
radiative magnification can provide a natural explanation.
