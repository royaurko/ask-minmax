We derive inequality [\int_{\r} |f^{'}(x)|^ph(f(x))dx \le
(\sqrt{p-1})^p\int_{\r}(\sqrt{|f^{"}(x){\cal T}_h(f(x))|})^ph(f(x))dx,] where
$f$ belongs locally to Sobolev space $W^{2,1}$ and $f^{'}$ has bounded support.
Here $h(...)$ is a given function and ${\cal T}_h(...)$ is its given transform,
it is independent of $p$. In case when $h\equiv 1$ we retrieve the well known
inequality: (\int_{\r} |f^{'}(x)|^pdx \le (\sqrt{p-1})^p
\int_{\r}(\sqrt{|f^{"}(x)f(x)|})^pdx.) Our inequalities have form similar to
the classical second order Oppial inequalites. They also extend certain class
of inequalities due to Mazya, used to obtain second order isoperimetric
inequalities and capacitary estimates. We apply them to obtain new apriori
estimates for nonlinear eigenvalue problems.
