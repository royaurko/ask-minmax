In this article, we present various numerical methods to solve multi-contact
problems within the Non-Smooth Discrete Element Method. The techniques
considered to solve the frictional unilateral conditions are based both on the
bi-potential theory and the Augmented Lagrangian theory. A new Newton method is
developed to improve the classical algorithms.
