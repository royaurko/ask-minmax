The rank of a finite algebraic structure with a single binary operation is
the minimum number of elements needed to express every other element under the
closure of the operation. In the case of groups, the previous best algorithm
for computing rank used polylogarithmic space. We reduce the best upper bounds
on the complexity of computing rank for quasigroups and for groups, and provide
a theoretically efficient algorithm for the latter. This paper proves that with
short certificates of correctness, the rank problem for these algebraic
structures can be verified by highly restricted models of computation.
  Specifically, we prove that the problem of deciding whether the rank of a
finite quasigroup, given as a Cayley table, is smaller than a specified number
is decidable by a circuit of depth $O(\log \log n)$ augmented with $O(\log^2
n)$ nondeterministic bits. Furthermore, if the quasigroup is a group, then the
problem is also decidable by a Turing machine using $O(\log n)$ space and
$O(\log^2 n)$ bits of nondeterminism. These are great improvements on the upper
bounds for these problems, and for groups, this upper bound implies a
deterministic polynomial time algorithm. The lens of limited nondeterminism
provides an easy way to improve many simple algorithms, like the ones presented
here, and we suspect it will be especially useful for other algebraic
algorithms.
