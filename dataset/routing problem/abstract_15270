Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is an imaging technique used to measure the
magnetic field outside the human head produced by the electrical activity
inside the brain. The MEG inverse problem, identifying the location of the
electrical sources from the magnetic signal measurements, is ill-posed, that
is, there are an infinite number of mathematically correct solutions. Common
source localization methods assume the source does not vary with time and do
not provide estimates of the variability of the fitted model. Here, we
reformulate the MEG inverse problem by considering time-varying locations for
the sources and their electrical moments and we model their time evolution
using a state space model. Based on our predictive model, we investigate the
inverse problem by finding the posterior source distribution given the multiple
channels of observations at each time rather than fitting fixed source
parameters. Our new model is more realistic than common models and allows us to
estimate the variation of the strength, orientation and position. We propose
two new Monte Carlo methods based on sequential importance sampling. Unlike the
usual MCMC sampling scheme, our new methods work in this situation without
needing to tune a high-dimensional transition kernel which has a very high
cost. The dimensionality of the unknown parameters is extremely large and the
size of the data is even larger. We use Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) to speed
up the computation.
