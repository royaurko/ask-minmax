With the advent of wide security platforms able to express simultaneously all
the policies comprising an organization's global security policy, the problem
of inconsistencies within security policies become harder and more relevant.
  We have defined a tool based on the CHR language which is able to detect
several types of inconsistencies within and between security policies and other
specifications, namely workflow specifications.
  Although the problem of security conflicts has been addressed by several
contributors, to our knowledge none has addressed the general problem of security
inconsistencies, on its several definitions and target specifications.
