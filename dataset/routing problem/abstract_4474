We study the approximability of a number of graph problems: treewidth and
pathwidth of graphs, one-shot black (and black-white) pebbling costs of
directed acyclic graphs, and a variety of different graph layout problems such
as minimum cut linear arrangement and interval graph completion. We show that,
assuming the recently introduced Small Set Expansion Conjecture, all of these
problems are hard to approximate within any constant factor.
