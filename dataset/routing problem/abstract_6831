We present explicit analytical solution for the problem of minimization of
the function $ F(x,y)= \sum_{j=1}^3 m_j \sqrt{(x-x_j)^2+(y-y_j)^2} $, i.e. we
find the coordinates of stationary point and the corresponding critical value
of $ F(x,y) $ as functions of $ {m_j,x_j,y_j}_{j=1}^3 $. In addition, we also
discuss inverse problem of finding such values of $ m_1,m_2,m_3 $ with the aim
for the corresponding function $ F $ to posses a prescribed position of
stationary point.
