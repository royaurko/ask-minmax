We study the deformation theory of nonsigular projective curves defined over
algebraic closed fields of positive characteristic. We show that under some
assumptions the local deformation problem for automorphisms of powerseries can
be reduced to a deformation problem for matrix representations. We study both
equicharacteristic and mixed deformations in the case of two dimensional
representations.
