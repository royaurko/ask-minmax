The purpose of this paper is to do a general survey on the existing
communication modes inside a smart grid, the existing security loopholes and
their countermeasures. Then we suggest a detailed countermeasure, building upon
the Jigsaw based secure data transfer [8] for enhanced security of the data
flow inside the communication system of a smart grid. The paper has been
written without the consideration of any factor of inoperability between the
various security techniques inside a smart grid
