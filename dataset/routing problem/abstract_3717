In the early 17th century, Pierre de Fermat proposed the following problem:
given three points in the plane, find a point such that the sum of its
Euclidean distances to the three given points is minimal. This problem was
solved by Evangelista Torricelli and was named the Fermat-Torricelli problem. A
more general version of the Fermat-Torricelli problem asks for a point that
minimizes the sum of the distances to a finite number of given points in $\Bbb
R^n$. This is one of the main problems in location science. In this paper, we
revisit the Fermat-Torricelli problem from both theoretical and numerical
viewpoints using some ingredients of of convex analysis and optimization.
