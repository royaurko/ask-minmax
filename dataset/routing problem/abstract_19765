We look for the global in time solution of the Cauchy problem corresponding
to the asymptotically flat spherically symmetric EVM system with small initial
data. Using an estimate, we also prove that if solution of the system stated
above develops a singularity at all time, then the first one has to appear at
the center of symmetry.
