Sensor placement for the purpose of detecting/tracking news outbreak and
preventing rumor spreading is a challenging problem in a large scale online
social network (OSN). This problem is a kind of subset selection problem:
choosing a small set of items from a large population so to maximize some
prespecified set function. However, it is known to be NP-complete. Existing
heuristics are very costly especially for modern OSNs which usually contain
hundreds of millions of users. This paper aims to design methods to find
\emph{good solutions} that can well trade off efficiency and accuracy. We first
show that it is possible to obtain a high quality solution with a probabilistic
guarantee from a "{\em candidate set}" of the underlying social network. By
exploring this candidate set, one can increase the efficiency of placing social
sensors. We also present how this candidate set can be obtained using "{\em
graph sampling}", which has an advantage over previous methods of not requiring
the prior knowledge of the complete network topology. Experiments carried out
on two real datasets demonstrate not only the accuracy and efficiency of our
approach, but also effectiveness in detecting and predicting news outbreak.
