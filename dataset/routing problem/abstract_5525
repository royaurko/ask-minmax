For a given finite class of finite graphs H, a graph G is called a
realization of H if the neighbourhood of its any vertex induces the subgraph
isomorphic to a graph of H. We consider the following problem known as the
Generalized Neighbourhood Problem (GNP): given a finite class of finite graphs
H, does there exist a non-empty graph G that is a realization of H? In fact,
there are two modifications of that problem, namely the finite (the existence
of a finite realization is required) and infinite one (the realization is
required to be infinite). In this paper we show that GNP and its modifications
for all finite classes H of finite graphs are reduced to the same problems with
an additional restriction on H. Namely, the orders of any two graphs of H are
equal and every graph of H has exactly s dominating vertices.
