The analysis of the most general second-order superintegrable system in two
dimensions: the generic 3-parameter model on the 2-sphere, is cast in the
framework of the Racah problem for the su(1,1) algebra. The Hamiltonian of the
3-parameter system and the generators of its quadratic symmetry algebra are
seen to correspond to the total and intermediate Casimir operators of the
combination of three su(1,1) algebras, respectively. The construction makes
explicit the isomorphism between the Racah-Wilson algebra, which is the
fundamental algebraic structure behind the Racah problem for su(1,1), and the
invariance algebra of the generic 3-parameter system. It also provides an
explanation for the occurrence of the Racah polynomials as overlap coefficients
in this context. The irreducible representations of the Racah-Wilson algebra
are reviewed as well as their connection with the Askey scheme of classical
orthogonal polynomials.
