We study the random link traveling salesman problem, where lengths l_ij
between city i and city j are taken to be independent, identically distributed
random variables. We discuss a theoretical approach, the cavity method, that
has been proposed for finding the optimal tour length over this random
ensemble, given the assumption of replica symmetry. Using finite size scaling
and a renormalized model, we test the cavity predictions against the results of
simulations, and find excellent agreement over a range of distributions. We
thus provide numerical evidence that the replica symmetric solution to this
problem is the correct one. Finally, we note a surprising result concerning the
distribution of kth-nearest neighbor links in optimal tours, and invite a
theoretical understanding of this phenomenon.
