Attention is given to surface waves of shear-horizontal modes in
piezoelectric crystals permitting the decoupling between an elastic in-plane
Rayleigh wave and a piezoacoustic anti-plane Bleustein-Gulyaev wave.
Specifically, the crystals possess $\bar{4}$ symmetry (inclusive of
$\bar{4}2$m, $\bar{4}3$m, and 23 classes) and the boundary is any plane
containing the normal to a symmetry plane (rotated $Y$-cuts about the $Z$
axis). The secular equation is obtained explicitly as a polynomial not only for
the metallized boundary condition but, in contrast to previous studies on the
subject, also for other types of boundary conditions. For the metallized
surface problem, the secular equation is a quadratic in the squared wave speed;
for the un-metallized surface problem, it is a sextic in the squared wave
speed; for the thin conducting boundary problem, it is of degree 16 in the
speed. The relevant root of the secular equation can be identified and the
complete solution is then found (attenuation factors, field profiles, etc.).
The influences of the cut angle and of the conductance of the adjoining medium
are illustrated numerically for GaAs ($\bar{4}3$m), BaLaGa$_3$O$_7$
($\bar{4}2$m) and Bi$_{12}$GeO$_{20}$ (23). Indications are given on how to
apply the method to crystals with 222 symmetry.
