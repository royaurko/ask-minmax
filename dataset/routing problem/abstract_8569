The purpose of this article is to deal with the multiple values and
uniqueness problem of meromorphic mappings from $\mathbb{C}^{m}$ into the
complex projective space $\mathbb{P}^{n}(\mathbb{C})$ sharing fixed and moving
hypersurfaces. We obtain several uniqueness theorems which improve and extend
some known results.
