Metal melting on release after explosion is a physical system far from
quilibrium. A complete physical model of this system does not exist, because
many interrelated effects have to be considered. General methodology needs to
be developed so as to describe and understand physical phenomena involved.
  The high noise of the data, moving blur of images, the high degree of
uncertainty due to the different types of sensors, and the information
entangled and hidden inside the noisy images makes reasoning about the physical
processes very difficult. Major problems include proper information extraction
and the problem of reconstruction, as well as prediction of the missing data.
In this paper, several techniques addressing the first problem are given,
building the basis for tackling the second problem.
