This paper contains two results on the $L^p$ regularity problem on Lipschitz
domains. For second order elliptic systems and $1<p<\infty$, we prove that the
solvability of the $L^p$ regularity problem is equivalent to that of the
$L^{p^\prime}$ Dirichlet problem. For higher order elliptic equations and
systems, we show that if $p>2$, the solvability of the $L^p$ regularity problem
is equivalent to a weak reverse H\"older condition with exponent $p$.
