We consider the inverse problem of designing an array of superconducting
Josephson junctions that has a given maximum static current pattern as function
of the applied magnetic field. Such devices are used for magnetometry and as
Terahertz oscillators. The model is a 2D semilinear elliptic operator with
Neuman boundary conditions so the direct problem is difficult to solve because
of the multiplicity of solutions. For an array of small junctions in a passive
region, the model can be reduced to a 1D linear partial differential equation
with Dirac distribution sine nonlinearities. For small junctions and a
symmetric device, the maximum current is the absolute value of a cosine Fourier
series whose coefficients (resp. frequencies) are proportional to the areas
(resp. the positions) of the junctions. The inverse problem is solved by
inverse cosine Fourier transform after choosing the area of the central
junction. We show several examples using combinations of simple three junction
circuits. These new devices could then be tailored to meet specific
applications.
