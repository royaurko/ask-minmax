This paper addresses a new vehicle routing problem that simultaneously
involves time windows, split collection and linear weight-related cost, which
is a generalization of the split delivery vehicle routing problem with time
windows (SDVRPTW). This problem consists of determining least-cost vehicle
routes to serve a set of customers while respecting the restrictions of vehicle
capacity and time windows. The travel cost per unit distance is a linear
function of the vehicle weight and the customer demand can be fulfilled by
multiple vehicles. To solve this problem, we propose a exact
branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm, where the pricing subproblem is a
resource-constrained elementary least-cost path problem. We first prove that at
least an optimal solution to the pricing subproblem is associated with an
extreme collection pattern, and then design a tailored and novel label-setting
algorithm to solve it. Computational results show that our proposed algorithm
can handle both the SDVRPTW and our problem effectively.
