Motivated by the problem to approximate all feasible schedules by one
schedule in a given scheduling environment, we introduce in this paper the
concepts of strong simultaneous approximation ratio (SAR) and weak simultaneous
approximation ratio (WAR). Then we study the two parameters under various
scheduling environments, such as, non-preemptive, preemptive or fractional
scheduling on identical, related or unrelated machines.
