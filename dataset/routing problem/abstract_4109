In this paper, an analytical method that solves the forward displacement
problem of several common spherical parallel manipulators (SPMs) is presented.
The method uses the the quaternion algebra to restate the problem as a system
of four quadrics in four variables and uses an algebraic geometry result by
Dixon from 1908 to solve. In addition, a case study is presented for a specific
SPM.
