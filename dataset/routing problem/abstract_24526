We introduce partially ordered two-way B\"uchi automata and characterize
their expressive power in terms of fragments of first-order logic FO[<].
Partially ordered two-way B\"uchi automata are B\"uchi automata which can
change the direction in which the input is processed with the constraint that
whenever a state is left, it is never re-entered again. Nondeterministic
partially ordered two-way B\"uchi automata coincide with the first-order
fragment Sigma2. Our main contribution is that deterministic partially ordered
two-way B\"uchi automata are expressively complete for the first-order fragment
Delta2. As an intermediate step, we show that deterministic partially ordered
two-way B\"uchi automata are effectively closed under Boolean operations.
  A small model property yields coNP-completeness of the emptiness problem and
the inclusion problem for deterministic partially ordered two-way B\"uchi
automata.
