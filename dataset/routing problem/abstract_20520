A hierarchy of first-degree time-dependent symmetries is proposed for Dirac
soliton hierarchy and their commutator relations with time-dependent symmetries
are exhibited. Meantime, a hereditary structure of Dirac soliton hierarchy is
elucidated and a Lax operator algebra associated with Virasoro symmetry algebra
is given.
