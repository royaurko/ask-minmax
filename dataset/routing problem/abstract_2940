We explore phase transitions of plan modification, which mainly focus on the
conformant planning problems. By analyzing features of plan modification in
conformant planning problems, quantitative results are obtained. If the number
of operators is less than, almost all conformant planning problems can't be
solved with plan modification. If the number of operators is more than, almost
all conformant planning problems can be solved with plan modification. The
results of the experiments also show that there exists an experimental
threshold of density (ratio of number of operators to number of propositions),
which separates the region where almost all conformant planning problems can't
be solved with plan modification from the region where almost all conformant
planning problems can be solved with plan modification.
