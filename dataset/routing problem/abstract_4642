The problem of separation of variables in some coordinate systems obtained
with the use of $L$-transformations is studied. Potentials are shown that allow
separation of regular variables in a perturbed two-body problem. The potential
contains two arbitrary smooth functions. An example of a potential is
considered allowing explicit solution of the problem in terms of elliptic
functions. The cases of bounded and unbounded motion are shown. The results of
numerical experiments are given.
