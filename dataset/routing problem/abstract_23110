In Newtonian and relativistic hydrodynamics the Riemann problem consists of
calculating the evolution of a fluid which is initially characterized by two
states having different values of uniform rest-mass density, pressure and
velocity. When the fluid is allowed to relax, one of three possible
wave-patterns is produced, corresponding to the propagation in opposite
directions of two nonlinear hydrodynamical waves. New effects emerge in a
special relativistic Riemann problem when velocities tangential to the initial
discontinuity surface are present. We show that a smooth transition from one
wave-pattern to another can be produced by varying the initial tangential
velocities while otherwise maintaining the initial states unmodified. These
special relativistic effects are produced by the coupling through the
relativistic Lorentz factors and do not have a Newtonian counterpart.
