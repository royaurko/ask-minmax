This paper studies the strong observability property and the reduced-order
dead-beat observer design problem for a continuous bioreactor. New
relationships between coexistence and strong observability, and checkable
sufficient conditions for strong observability, are established for a chemostat
with two competing microbial species. Furthermore, the dynamic output feedback
stabilization problem is solved for the case of one species.
