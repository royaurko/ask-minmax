We investigate scattering properties of a Moyal deformed version of the
nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in an even number of space dimensions. With
rather weak conditions on the degree of nonlinearity, the Cauchy problem for
general initial data has a unique globally defined solution, and also has
soliton solutions if the interaction potential is suitably chosen. We
demonstrate how to set up a scattering framework for equations of this type,
including appropriate decay estimates of the free time evolution and the
construction of wave operators defined for small scattering data in the general
case and for arbitrary scattering data in the rotationally symmetric case.
