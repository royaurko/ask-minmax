In this article we prove convergence of adaptive finite element methods for
second order elliptic eigenvalue problems. We consider Lagrange finite elements
of any degree and prove convergence for simple as well as multiple eigenvalues
under a minimal refinement of marked elements, for all reasonable marking
strategies, and starting from any initial triangulation.
