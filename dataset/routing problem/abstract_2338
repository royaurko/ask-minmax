Line Speed Publish/Subscribe Inter-networking (LIPSIN) is one of the proposed
forwarding mechanisms in Information Centric Networking (ICN). It is a
stateless source-routing approach based on Bloom filters. However, it has been
shown that LIPSIN is vulnerable to brute-force attacks which may lead to
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and unsolicited messages. In this
work, we propose a new forwarding approach that maintains the advantages of
Bloom filter based forwarding while allowing forwarding nodes to statelessly
verify if packets have been previously contributorized, thus preventing attacks on
the forwarding mechanism. Analysis of the probability of attack, derived
analytically, demonstrates that the technique is highly-resistant to
brute-force attacks.
