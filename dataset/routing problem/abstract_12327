We address problems arising in supersaturated systems of small atomic
particles in solids. Nucleation processes in such systems do not seem to follow
the classical interpretation but may be indicative of quantal nucleation
partucularly at higher supersaturations. We reconcile Gibbs' free energy DeltaG
vs. particle radius r dependence with the double-well oscillator energy vs.
configurational coordinate q dependence to take advantage of the solution of a
well-known eigenvalue problem. Theoretical results are presented and compared
with experimental data.
