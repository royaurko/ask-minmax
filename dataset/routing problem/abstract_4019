This paper is a review of recent mathematical and computational advances in
optical tomography. We discuss the physical foundations of forward models for
light propagation on microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic scales. We also
consider direct and numerical approaches to the inverse problems that arise at
each of these scales. Finally, we outline future directions and open problems
in the field.
