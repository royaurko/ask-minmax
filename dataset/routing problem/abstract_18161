We study the uniqueness, existence, and properties of bounded distributional
solutions of the initial value problem problem for the anomalous diffusion
equation $\partial_tu-\mathcal{L}^\mu [\varphi (u)]=0$. Here $\mathcal{L}^\mu$
can be any nonlocal symmetric degenerate elliptic operator including the
fractional Laplacian and numerical discretizations of this operator. The
function $\varphi:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is only assumed to be continuous
and nondecreasing. The class of equations include nonlocal (generalized) porous
medium equations, fast diffusion equations, and Stefan problems. In addition to
very general uniqueness and existence results, we obtain $L^1$-contraction and
a priori estimates. We also study local limits, continuous dependence, and
properties and convergence of a numerical approximation of our equations.
