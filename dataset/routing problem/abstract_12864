We start with some global Maxwellian function $M$, which is a stationary
solution (with the constant total density $\rho$) of the Boltzmann equation,
and we denote the number of the corresponding space variables by $n$. The
notion of distance between the global Maxwellian function and an arbitrary
solution $f$ (with the same total density $\rho$ at the fixed moment $t$) of
the Boltzmann equation is introduced. In this way we essentially generalize the
important Kullback-Leibler distance, which was used before. An extremal problem
to find a solution of the Boltzmann equation, such that $\dist\{M,f\}$ is
minimal in the class of solutions with the fixed values of energy and of $n$
moments, is solved.
