Integer factorization is a very hard computational problem. Currently no
efficient algorithm for integer factorization is publicly known. However, this
is an important problem on which it relies the security of many real world
cryptographic systems.
  I present an implementation of a fast factorization algorithm on MapReduce.
MapReduce is a programming model for high performance applications developed
originally at Google. The quadratic sieve algorithm is split into the different
MapReduce phases and compared against a standard implementation.
