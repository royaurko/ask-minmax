One of the key problems in migrating multi-component enterprise applications
to Clouds is selecting the best mix of VM images and Cloud infrastructure
services. A migration process has to ensure that Quality of Service (QoS)
requirements are met, while satisfying conflicting selection criteria, e.g.
throughput and cost. When selecting Cloud services, application engineers must
consider heterogeneous sets of criteria and complex dependencies across
multiple layers impossible to resolve manually. To overcome this challenge, we
present the generic recommender framework CloudGenius and an implementation
that leverage well known multi-criteria decision making technique Analytic
Hierarchy Process to automate the selection process based on a model, factors,
and QoS requirements related to enterprise applications. In particular, we
introduce a structured migration process for multi-component enterprise
applications, clearly identify the most important criteria relevant to the
selection problem and present a multi-criteria-based selection algorithm.
Experiments with the software prototype CumulusGenius show time complexities.
