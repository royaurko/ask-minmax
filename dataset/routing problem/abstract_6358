A GBDT version of the Backlund-Darboux transformation is constructed for a
non-isospectral canonical system, which plays essential role in the theory of
random matrix models. The corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem is treated and
some explicit formulas are obtained. A related inverse problem is formulated
and solved.
