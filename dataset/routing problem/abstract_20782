Bag-of-words model is implemented and tried on 10-class visual concept
detection problem. The experimental results show that "DURF+ERT+SVM"
outperforms "SIFT+ERT+SVM" both in detection performance and computation
efficiency. Besides, combining DURF and SIFT results in even better detection
performance. Real-time object detection using SIFT and RANSAC is also tried on
simple objects, e.g. drink can, and good result is achieved.
