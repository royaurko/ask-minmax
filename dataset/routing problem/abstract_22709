We review recent theoretical progress on glassy dynamics, with special
emphasis on the importance and universality of the ``aging regime'', which is
relevant to many experimental situations. The three main subjects which we
address are: (i) Phenomenological models of aging (coarsening, trap models),
(ii) Analytical results for the low-temperature dynamics of mean-field models
(corresponding to the mode-coupling equations); and (iii) Simple non-disordered
models with glassy dynamics. We discuss the interrelation between these
approaches, and also with previous work in the field. Several open problems are
underlined -- in particular the precise relation between mean-field like (or
mode-coupling) descriptions and finite dimensional problems.
