The traditional nuclear pairing problem is shown to be in one-to-one
correspondence with a classical electrostatic problem in two dimensions. We
make use of this analogy in a series of calculations in the Tin region, showing
that the extremely rich phenomenology that appears in this classical problem
can provide interesting new insights into nuclear superconductivity.
