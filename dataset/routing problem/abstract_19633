The magnitude of the staggered field is calculated from the EPR data for
CuGeO3 doped with Co and Fe magnetic impurities. It is found that this
parameter demonstrate an anomalous temperature and magnetic field dependence
probably due to (i) the specific mechanism of the staggered field generation in
doped CuGeO3 and (ii) a competition between antiferromagnetic interchain
exchange and staggered Zeeman energy.
