We incorporate the behaviour of tax evasion into the standard two-dimensional
Ising model and augment it by providing policy-makers with the opportunity to
curb tax evasion via an appropriate enforcement mechanism. We discuss different
network structures in which tax evasion may vary greatly over time if no
measures of control are taken. Furthermore, we show that even minimal
enforcement levels may help to alleviate this problem substantially.
