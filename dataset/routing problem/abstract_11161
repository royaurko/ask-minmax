We introduce O-systems (Definition \ref{DO}) of orthogonal transformations of
${\Bbb R}^{m}$, and establish $1-1$ correspondences both between equivalence
classes of Clifford systems and that of O-systems, and between O-systems and
orthogonal multiplications of the form $\mu :{\Bbb R}^{n} \times {\Bbb R}^{m}
\longrightarrow {\Bbb R}^{m} $, which allow us to solve the existence problems
both for O-systems and for umbilical quadratic harmonic morphisms (Theorems
\ref{ES} and \ref{EU}) simultaneously. The existence problem for general
quadratic harmonic morphisms is then solved (Theorem \ref{EG}) by the Splitting
Lemma (Lemma \ref{Split}). We also study properties (see, e.g., Theorems
\ref{single} and \ref{TL}) possessed by all quadratic harmonic morphisms for
fixed pairs of domain and range spaces (\S5).
