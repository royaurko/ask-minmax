Block elimination algorithms for solving sparse discrete optimization
problems are considered. The numerical example is provided. The benchmarking is
done in order to define real computational capabilities of block elimination
algorithms combined with SYMPHONY solver. Analysis of the results show that for
sufficiently large number of blocks and small enough size of separators between
the blocks for staircase integer linear programming problem the local
elimination algorithms in combination with a solver for solving subproblems in
blocks allow to solve such problems much faster than used solver itself for
solving the whole problem. Also the capabilities of postoptimal analysis (warm
starting) are considered for solving packages of integer linear programming
problems for corresponding blocks.
