Presentation of a Method for determining whether a problem 3Sat has solution,
and if yes to find one, in time max O(n^15). Is thus proved that the problem
3Sat is fully resolved in polynomial time and therefore that it is in P, by the
work of Cook and Levin, and can transform a SAT problem in a 3Sat in polynomial
time (ref. Karp), it follows that P = NP. Open Source program is available at
