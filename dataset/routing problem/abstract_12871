We consider an inverse spectral problem for infinite linear mass-spring
systems with different configurations obtained by changing the first mass. We
give results on the reconstruction of the system from the spectra of two
configurations. Necessary and sufficient conditions for two real sequences to
be the spectra of two modified systems are provided.
