The combined absence of physical realizations of the UA(1) symmetry possessed
by the classical QCD action in the chiral limit, and of an isoscalar Goldstone
boson associated with its spontaneous breakdown, has been dubbed the UA(1)
problem. A formal resolution of this problem proposed by 't Hooft relies on
instantons to provide a mass to the would-be Goldstone boson (eta '). An
alternate scheme for the generation of an eta ' mass proposed by Kogut and
Susskind derives from quark annihilation into gluons and a strong infrared
singularity in the gluon propagator associated with confinement. We demonstrate
here how such diagrams are generated in quark based effective theories by
including a certain class of diagrams which arise from correlated q qbar
exchange and are of higher order 1/N_c. A low energy energy expansion of this
corrections is of the form discussed by Witten, di Vecchia and Veneziano.
