Most generic models of hidden sector supersymmetry breaking do not feature
singlets, and gauginos obtain masses from anomaly mediated supersymmetry
breaking. If one desires a natural model, then the dominant contribution to
scalar masses should be of the same order, i.e. also from AMSB. However, pure
AMSB models suffer from the tachyonic slepton problem. Moreover, there is a
large splitting between the gluino and the wino LSP masses resulting in tight
exclusion limits from typical superpartner searches. We introduce messenger
fields into this framework to obtain a hybrid theory of gauge and anomaly
mediation, solving both problems simultaneously. Specifically, we find any
number of vector-like messenger fields (allowed by GUT unification) compress
the predicted gaugino spectrum when their masses come from the Giudice-Masiero
mechanism. This more compressed spectrum is less constrained by LHC searches
and allows for lighter gluinos. In addition to the model, we present gaugino
pole mass equations that differ from (and correct) the original literature.
