We study a family of binary state, socially-inspired contagion models which
incorporate imitation limited by an aversion to complete conformity. We uncover
rich behavior in our models whether operating with either probabilistic or
deterministic individual response functions on both dynamic and fixed random
networks. In particular, we find significant variation in the limiting behavior
of a population's infected fraction, ranging from steady-state to chaotic. We
show that period doubling arises as we increase the average node degree, and
that the universality class of this well known route to chaos depends on the
interaction structure of random networks rather than the microscopic behavior
of individual nodes. We find that increasing the fixedness of the system tends
to stabilize the infected fraction, yet disjoint, multiple equilibria are
possible depending solely on the choice of the initially infected node.
