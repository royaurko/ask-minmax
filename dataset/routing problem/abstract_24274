Many recent papers have questioned Irving and Kirkwood's atomistic expression
for stress. In Irving and Kirkwood's approach both interatomic forces and
atomic velocities contribute to stress. It is the velocity-dependent part that
has been disputed. To help clarify this situation we investigate [1] a fluid in
a gravitational field and [2] a steadily rotating solid. For both problems we
choose conditions where the two stress contributions, potential and kinetic,
are significant. The analytic force-balance solutions of both these problems
agree very well with a smooth-particle interpretation of the atomistic
Irving-Kirkwood stress tensor.
