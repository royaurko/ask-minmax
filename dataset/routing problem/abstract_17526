In this paper, we continue the development of the Direct Meshless Local
Petrov-Galerkin (DMLPG) method for elasto-static problems. This method is based
on the generalized moving least squares approximation. The computational
efficiency is the most significant advantage of the new method in comparison
with the original MLPG. Although, the "Petrov-Galerkin" strategy is used to
build the primary local weak forms, the role of trial space is ignored and
direct approximations for local weak forms and boundary conditions are
performed to construct the final stiffness matrix. In this modification the
numerical integrations are performed over polynomials instead of complicated
MLS shape functions. In this paper, DMLPG is applied for two and three
dimensional problems in elasticity. Some variations of the new method are
developed and their efficiencies are reported. Finally, we will conclude that
DMLPG can replace the original MLPG in many situations.
