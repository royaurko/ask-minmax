In this paper we consider the electromagnetic scattering problem by an
obstacle characterised by a Generalized Impedance Boundary Condition in the
harmonic regime. These boundary conditions are well known to provide accurate
models for thin layers or imperfectly conducting bodies. We give two different
formulations of the scattering problem and we provide some general assumptions
on the boundary condition under which the scattering problem has at most one
solution. We also prove that it is well-posed for three different boundary
conditions which involve second order surface differential operators under weak
sign assumptions on the coefficients defining the surface operators.
