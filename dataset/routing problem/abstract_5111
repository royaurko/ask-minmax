Since its introduction by Gauss, Matrix Algebra has facilitated understanding
of scientific problems, hiding distracting details and finding more elegant and
efficient ways of computational solving. Today's largest problems, which often
originate from multidimensional data, might profit from even higher levels of
abstraction. We developed a framework for solving tensor structured problems
with tensor algebra that unifies concepts from tensor analysis, multilinear
algebra and multidimensional signal processing. In contrast to the conventional
matrix approach, it allows the formulation of multidimensional problems, in a
multidimensional way, preserving structure and data coherence; and the
implementation of automated optimizations of solving algorithms, based on the
commutativity of all tensor operations. Its ability to handle large scientific
tasks is showcased by a real-world, 4D medical imaging problem, with more than
30 million unknown parameters solved on a current, inexpensive hardware. This
significantly surpassed the best published matrix-based approach.
