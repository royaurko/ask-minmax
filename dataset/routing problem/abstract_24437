In the multiuser downlink, power allocation for linear precoders that
minimize the sum of mean squared errors under a sum power constraint is a
non-convex problem. Many existing algorithms solve an equivalent convex problem
in the virtual uplink and apply a transformation based on uplink-downlink
duality to find a downlink solution. In this letter, we analyze the optimality
criteria for the power allocation subproblem in the virtual uplink, and
demonstrate that the optimal solution leads to identical power allocations in
the downlink and virtual uplink. We thus extend the known duality results and,
importantly, simplify the existing algorithms used for iterative transceiver
design.
