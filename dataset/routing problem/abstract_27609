A distributed adaptive algorithm is proposed to solve a node-specific
parameter estimation problem where nodes are interested in estimating
parameters of local interest, parameters of common interest to a subset of
nodes and parameters of global interest to the whole network. To address the
different node-specific parameter estimation problems, this novel algorithm
relies on a diffusion-based implementation of different Least Mean Squares
(LMS) algorithms, each associated with the estimation of a specific set of
local, common or global parameters. Coupled with the estimation of the
different sets of parameters, the implementation of each LMS algorithm is only
undertaken by the nodes of the network interested in a specific set of local,
common or global parameters. The study of convergence in the mean sense reveals
that the proposed algorithm is asymptotically unbiased. Moreover, a
spatial-temporal energy conservation relation is provided to evaluate the
steady-state performance at each node in the mean-square sense. Finally, the
theoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed technique are
validated through computer simulations in the context of cooperative spectrum
sensing in Cognitive Radio networks.
