Licklider advocated in 1960 the construction of computers capable of working
symbiotically with humans to address problems not easily addressed by humans
working alone. Since that time, many of the advances that he envisioned have
been achieved, yet the time spent by human problem solvers in mundane
activities remains large. I propose here four areas in which improved tools can
further advance the goal of enhancing human intellect: services, provenance,
knowledge communities, and automation of problem-solving protocols.
