We present a family of nonconforming vector finite elements of arbitrary
order for problems posed on the space (curl) intersected with H(div) on a
bidimensional domain. This result was first stated as a conjecture by Brenner
and Sung. In contrast an extension of the same conjecture to three dimensional
domains is disproved.
