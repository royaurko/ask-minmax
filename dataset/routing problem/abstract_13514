The adaptive Thouless-Anderson-Palmer equation is derived for inverse Ising
problems in the presence of quenched random fields. We test the proposed scheme
on Sherrington-Kirkpatrick, Hopfield, and random orthogonal models and find
that the adaptive Thouless-Anderson-Palmer approach allows surprisingly
accurate inference of quenched random fields whose distribution can be either
Gaussian or bimodal, compared with other existing mean-field methods.
