In this paper, using the theory developed in [8], we obtain some results of a
totally new type about a class of non-local problems. Here is a sample:
  Let $\Omega\subset {\bf R}^n$ be a smooth bounded domain, with $n\geq 4$, let
$a, b, \nu\in {\bf R}$, with $a\geq 0$ and $b>0$, and let $p\in \left ]
0,{{n+2}\over {n-2}}\right [$.
  Then, for each $\lambda>0$ large enough and for each convex set $C\subseteq
L^2(\Omega)$ whose closure in $L^2(\Omega)$ contains $H^1_0(\Omega)$, there
exists $v^*\in C$ such that the problem $$\cases {-\left (
a+b\int_{\Omega}|\nabla u(x)|^2dx\right )\Delta u
=\nu|u|^{p-1}u+\lambda(u-v^*(x)) & in $\Omega$\cr & \cr u=0 & on
$\partial\Omega$\cr}$$ has at least three weak solutions, two of which are
global minima in $H^1_0(\Omega)$ of the corresponding energy functional.
