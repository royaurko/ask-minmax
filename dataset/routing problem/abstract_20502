The Dirac equation is compared with the Klein-Gordon one. Unlike the Dirac
case, it is proved that the Klein-Gordon equation has problems with the
Hamiltonian operator of the Schroedinger picture. A special discussion of the
Pauli-Weisskopf article and that of Feshbach-Villars proves that their theories
of a charged Klein-Gordon particle lack a self consistent expression for this
Hamiltonian. Related difficulties are pointed out.
