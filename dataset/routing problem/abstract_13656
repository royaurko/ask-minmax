In the present study the software CrackComput, based on the Xfem and Xcrack
libraries has been used for three problems- to experiment on the convergence
properties of the method applied to elasto-statics crack problems, comparison
of stress intensity factors to simplified analytical results and study of the
Brazilian fracture test. All the problems are treated in two dimensions under
plane strain assumption and the material is supposed elastic and isotropic. For
the first example, comparison for different parameter-enrichment type and
radius, degree of polynomial has been performed. Second example convergence of
SIF with the L/h ratio has been performed and compared with the analytical
solution. Third example is the study of snapback phenomenon.
