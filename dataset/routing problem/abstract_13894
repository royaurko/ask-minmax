In this work, we study the numerical solution for parabolic equations whose
solutions have a common property of blowing up in finite time and the equations
are invariant under the following scaling transformation $$u \mapsto
u_\lambda(x,t):= \lambda^{\frac{2}{p-1}}u(\lambda x, \lambda^2 t).$$ For that
purpose, we apply the rescaling method proposed by Berger and Kohn in 1988 to
such problems. The convergence of the method is proved under some regularity
assumption. Some numerical experiments are given to derive the blow-up profile
verifying henceforth the theoretical results.
