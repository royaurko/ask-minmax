We study the approximation of high-dimensional rank one tensors using point
evaluations and consider deterministic as well as randomized algorithms. We
prove that for certain parameters (smoothness and norm of the $r$th derivative)
this problem is intractable while for other parameters the problem is tractable
and the complexity is only polynomial in the dimension for every fixed
$\varepsilon>0$. For randomized algorithms we completely characterize the set
of parameters that lead to easy or difficult problems, respectively. In the
"difficult" case we modify the class to obtain a tractable problem: The problem
gets tractable with a polynomial (in the dimension) complexity if the support
of the function is not too small.
