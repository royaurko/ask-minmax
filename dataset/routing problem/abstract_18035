We consider a real-world cargo assembly planning problem arising in a coal
supply chain. The cargoes are built on the stockyard at a port terminal from
coal delivered by trains. Then the cargoes are loaded onto vessels. Only a
limited number of arriving vessels is known in advance. The goal is to minimize
the average delay time of the vessels over a long planning period. We model the
problem in the MiniZinc constraint programming language and design a large
neighbourhood search scheme. The effects of various optional constraints are
investigated. Some of the optional constraints expand the model's scope toward
a system view (berth capacity, port channel). An adaptive scheme for a greedy
heuristic from the literature is proposed and compared to the constraint
programming approach.
