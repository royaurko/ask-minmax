Today's propositional satisfiability (SAT) solvers are extremely powerful and
can be used as an efficient back-end for solving NP-complete problems. However,
many fundamental problems in knowledge representation and reasoning are located
at the second level of the Polynomial Hierarchy or even higher, and hence
polynomial-time transformations to SAT are not possible, unless the hierarchy
collapses. Recent research shows that in certain cases one can break through
these complexity barriers by fixed-parameter tractable (fpt) reductions which
exploit structural aspects of problem instances in terms of problem parameters.
  In this paper we develop a general theoretical framework that supports the
classification of parameterized problems on whether they admit such an
fpt-reduction to SAT or not. This framework is based on several new
parameterized complexity classes. As a running example, we use the framework to
classify the complexity of the consistency problem for disjunctive answer set
programming, with respect to various natural parameters. We underpin the
robustness of our theory by providing a characterization of the new complexity
classes in terms of weighted QBF satisfiability, alternating Turing machines,
and first-order model checking. In addition, we provide a compendium of
parameterized problems that are complete for the new complexity classes,
including problems related to Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Logic,
and Combinatorics.
