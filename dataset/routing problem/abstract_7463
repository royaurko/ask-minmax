Model predictive control (MPC) anticipates future events to take appropriate
control actions. Nonlinear MPC (NMPC) describes systems with nonlinear models
and/or constraints. Continuation MPC, suggested by T.~Ohtsuka in 2004, uses
Krylov-Newton iterations. Continuation MPC is suitable for nonlinear problems
and has been recently adopted for minimum time problems. We extend the
continuation MPC approach to a case where the state is implicitly constrained
to a smooth manifold. We propose an algorithm for on-line controller
implementation and demonstrate its numerical effectiveness for a test problem
on a hemisphere.
