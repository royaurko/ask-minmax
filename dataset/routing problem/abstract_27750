There is an avatar of the little hierarchy problem of the MSSM in
3-dimensional supersymmetry. We propose a solution to this problem in AdS$_3$
based on the AdS/CFT correspondence. The bulk theory is a supergravity theory
in which U(1) $\times$ U(1) R-symmetry is gauged by Chern-Simons fields. The
bulk theory is deformed by a boundary term quadratic in the gauge fields. It
breaks SUSY completely and sources an exactly marginal operator in the dual
CFT. SUSY breaking is communicated by gauge interactions to bulk scalar fields
and their spinor superpartners. Since the R-charges of scalar and spinor
differ, this generates a SUSY breaking shift of their masses. The Ward identity
facilitates the calculation of these mass shifts to any desired order in the
strength of the deformation. Moduli fields are massless $R$-neutral bulk
scalars with vanishing potential in the undeformed theory. These properties are
maintained to all orders in the deformation despite the fact that moduli couple
in the bulk to loops of R-charged fields.
