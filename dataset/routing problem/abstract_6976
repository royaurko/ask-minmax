In 1980, V.I. Arnold studied the classification problem for convex lattice
polygons of given area. Since then this problem and its analogues have been
studied by B'ar'any, Pach, Vershik, Liu, Zong and others. Upper bounds for the
numbers of non-equivalent ddimensional convex lattice polytopes of given volume
or cardinality have been achieved. In this paper, by introducing and studying
the unimodular groups acting on convex lattice polytopes, we obtain lower
bounds for the number of non-equivalent d-dimensional convex lattice polytopes
of bounded volume or given cardinality, which are essentially tight.
