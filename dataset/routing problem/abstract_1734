This paper reviews the constraints on the solar neutrino mixing parameters
with data collected by the Homestake, SAGE, GALLEX, Kamiokande,
SuperKamiokande, Borexino and SNO experiments. An emphasis will be given to the
global solar neutrino analyses in terms of matter-enhanced oscillation of two
and three active flavors. The results to-date, including both solar model
dependent and independent measurements, indicate that electron neutrinos are
changing to other active types on route to the Earth from the Sun. The total
flux of solar neutrinos is found to be in very good agreement with solar model
calculations. Today, solar neutrino measurements focus on greater accuracy for
mixing parameters and on better sensitivity to low neutrino energies. This
article also summarizes near future prospects in the field of solar neutrino
physics.
