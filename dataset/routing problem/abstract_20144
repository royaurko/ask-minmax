We approximate functionals depending on the gradient of $u$ and on the
behaviour of $u$ near the discontinuity points, by families of non-local
functionals where the gradient is replaced by finite differences. We prove
pointwise convergence, $\Gamma$-convergence, and a compactness result which
implies, in particular, the convergence of minima and minimizers.
