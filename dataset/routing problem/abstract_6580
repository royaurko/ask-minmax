In this paper we present efficient algorithmic solutions for several
constrained resource allocation, management and discovery problems. We consider
new types of resource allocation models and constraints, and we present new
geometric techniques which are useful when the resources are mapped to points
into a multidimensional feature space. We also consider a resource discovery
problem for which we present a guessing game theoretical model.
