We use a basic setup of two coupled exclusion processes to model a stylised
situation in evacuation dynamics, in which evacuees have to choose between two
escape routes. The coupling between the two processes occurs through one common
point at which particles are injected, the process can be controlled by
directing incoming individuals into either of the two escape routes. Based on a
mean-field approach we determine the phase behaviour of the model, and
analytically compute optimal control strategies, maximising the total current
through the system. Results are confirmed by numerical simulations. We also
show that dynamic intervention, exploiting fluctuations about the mean-field
stationary state, can lead to a further increase in total current.
