In this paper we study truncated moment problems for $J$-self-adjoint,
$J$-skew-self-adjoint and $J$-unitary operators. Conditions of the solvability
are given. Some canonical solutions of the moment problems are constructed. As
a by-product, some extension results for $J$-skew-symmetric and $J$-isometric
operators are obtained.
