We study the classic Vehicle Routing Problem in the setting of stochastic
optimization with recourse. StochVRP is a two-stage optimization problem, where
demand is satisfied using two routes: fixed and recourse. The fixed route is
computed using only a demand distribution. Then after observing the demand
instantiations, a recourse route is computed -- but costs here become more
expensive by a factor lambda.
  We present an O(log^2 n log(n lambda))-approximation algorithm for this
stochastic routing problem, under arbitrary distributions. The main idea in
this result is relating StochVRP to a special case of submodular orienteering,
called knapsack rank-function orienteering. We also give a better approximation
ratio for knapsack rank-function orienteering than what follows from prior
work. Finally, we provide a Unique Games Conjecture based omega(1) hardness of
approximation for StochVRP, even on star-like metrics on which our algorithm
achieves a logarithmic approximation.
