We propose a new algorithmic approach to the non-smooth and non-convex Potts
problem (also called piecewise-constant Mumford-Shah problem) for inverse
imaging problems. We derive a suitable splitting into specific subproblems that
can all be solved efficiently. Our method does not require a priori knowledge
on the gray levels nor on the number of segments of the reconstruction.
Further, it avoids anisotropic artifacts such as geometric staircasing. We
demonstrate the suitability of our method for joint image reconstruction and
segmentation. We focus on Radon data, where we in particular consider limited
data situations. For instance, our method is able to recover all segments of
the Shepp-Logan phantom from $7$ angular views only. We illustrate the
practical applicability on a real PET dataset. As further applications, we
consider spherical Radon data as well as blurred data.
