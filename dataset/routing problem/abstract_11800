We show that the use of wavelet bases for solving the momentum-space
scattering integral equation leads to sparse matrices which can simplify the
solution. Wavelet bases are applied to calculate the K-matrix for
nucleon-nucleon scattering with the s-wave Malfliet-Tjon V potential. We
introduce a new method, which uses special properties of the wavelets, for
evaluating the singular part of the integral. Analysis of this test problem
indicates that a significant reduction in computational size can be achieved
for realistic few-body scattering problems.
