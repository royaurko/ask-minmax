It has recently been argued that codimension-two braneworlds offer a
promising line of attack on the cosmological constant problem, since in such
models the Hubble rate is not directly related to the brane tension. We point
out challenges to building more general models where the brane content is not
restricted to pure tension. In order to address these challenges, we construct
a thick brane model which we linearize around a well known static solution. We
show that the model's cosmology does reduce to standard FRW behaviour, but find
no hint of a self-tuning mechanism which might help solve the cosmological
constant problem whithin the context of non-supersymmetric Einstein gravity.
