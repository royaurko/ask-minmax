In this paper, we establish a global Carleman estimate for stochastic
parabolic equations. Based on this estimate, we solve two inverse problems for
stochastic parabolic equations. One is concerned with a determination problem
of the history of a stochastic heat process through the observation at the
final time $T$, for which we obtain a conditional stability estimate. The other
is an inverse source problem with observation on the lateral boundary. We
derive the uniqueness of the source.
