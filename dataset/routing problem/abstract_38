In Colombia, there is an increasing interest about improving public
transportation. One of the proposed strategies in that way is the use battery
electric vehicles (BEVs). One of the new challenges is the BEVs routing
problem, which is subjected to the traditional issues of the routing problems,
and must also consider the particularities of autonomy, charge and battery
degradation of the BEVs. In this work, a scheme that coordinates the routing,
scheduling of charge and operating costs of BEVs is proposed. The simplified
operating costs have been modeled considering both charging fees and battery
degradation. A case study is presented, in order to illustrate the proposed
methodology. The given case considers an airport shuttle service scenario, in
which energy consumption of the BEVs is estimated based on experimentally
measured driving patterns.
