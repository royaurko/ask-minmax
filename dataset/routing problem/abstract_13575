This paper is addressed to studying the exact controllability for stochastic
Schr\"{o}dinger equations by two controls. One is a boundary control in the
drift term and the other is an internal control in the diffusion term. By means
of the standard duality argument, the control problem is converted into an
observability problem for backward stochastic Schr\"{o}dinger equations, and
the desired observability estimate is obtained by a global Carleman estimate.
At last, we give a result about the lack of exact controllability, which shows
that the action of two controls is necessary.
