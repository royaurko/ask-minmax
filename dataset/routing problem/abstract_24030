The life of a tsunami is usually divided into three phases: the generation
(tsunami source), the propagation and the inundation. Each phase is complex and
often described separately. A brief description of each phase is given. Model
problems are identified. Their formulation is given. While some of these
problems can be solved analytically, most require numerical techniques. The
inundation phase is less documented than the other phases. It is shown that
methods based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) are particularly
well-suited for the inundation phase. Directions for future research are
outlined.
