We present teraflop-scale calculations of biomolecular electrostatics enabled
by the combination of algorithmic and hardware acceleration. The algorithmic
acceleration is achieved with the fast multipole method (FMM) in conjunction
with a boundary element method (BEM) formulation of the continuum electrostatic
model, as well as the BIBEE approximation to BEM. The hardware acceleration is
achieved through graphics processors, GPUs. We demonstrate the power of our
algorithms and software for the calculation of the electrostatic interactions
between biological molecules in solution. The applications demonstrated include
the electrostatics of protein--drug binding and several multi-million atom
systems consisting of hundreds to thousands of copies of lysozyme molecules.
The parallel scalability of the software was studied in a cluster at the
Nagasaki Advanced Computing Center, using 128 nodes, each with 4 GPUs. Delicate
tuning has resulted in strong scaling with parallel efficiency of 0.8 for 256
and 0.5 for 512 GPUs. The largest application run, with over 20 million atoms
and one billion unknowns, required only one minute on 512 GPUs. We are
currently adapting our BEM software to solve the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann
equation for dilute ionic solutions, and it is also designed to be flexible
enough to be extended for a variety of integral equation problems, ranging from
Poisson problems to Helmholtz problems in electromagnetics and acoustics to
high Reynolds number flow.
