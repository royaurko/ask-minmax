Inspired by earlier work on the band-gap problem in insulators, we reexamine
the treatment of strongly correlated Hubbard-type models within
density-functional theory. In contrast to previous studies, the density is
fully parametrized by occupation numbers and overlap of orbitals centered at
neighboring atomic sites, as is the local potential by the hopping matrix. This
corresponds to a good formal agreement between density-functional theory in
real space and second quantization. It is shown that density-functional theory
is formally applicable to such systems and the theoretical framework is
provided. The question of noninteracting v representability is studied
numerically for finite one-dimensional clusters, for which exact results are
available, and qualitatively for infinite systems. This leads to the conclusion
that the electron density corresponding to interacting systems of the type
studied here is in fact not noninteracting v representable because the
Kohn-Sham electrons are unable to reproduce the correlation-induced
localization correctly.
