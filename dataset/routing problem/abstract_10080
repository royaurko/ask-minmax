We solve a long-standing open problem with its own long history dating back
to the celebrated works of Klein and Ramanujan. This problem concerns the
invariant decomposition formulas of the Hauptmodul for $\Gamma_0(p)$ under the
action of finite simple groups $PSL(2, p)$ with $p=5, 7, 13$. The cases of
$p=5$ and $7$ were solved by Klein and Ramanujan. Little was known about this
problem for $p=13$. Using our invariant theory for $PSL(2, 13)$, we solve this
problem. This leads to a new expression of the classical elliptic modular
function of Klein: $j$-function in terms of theta constants associated with
$\Gamma(13)$. Moreover, we find an exotic modular equation, i.e., it has the
same form as Ramanujan's modular equation of degree $13$, but with different
kinds of modular parametrizations, which gives the geometry of the classical
modular curve $X(13)$.
