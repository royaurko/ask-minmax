We consider the problem of computing the relative Brauer group of a torsor of
period 2 under an elliptic curve E. We show how this problem can be reduced to
finding a set of generators for the group of rational points on E. This extends
work of Haile and Han to the case of torsors with unequal period and index.
Several numerical examples are given.
