We sharpen a classical result on the spectral asymptotics of the boundary
value problems for self-adjoint ordinary differential operator. Using this
result we obtain the exact $L_2$-small ball asymptotics for a new class of zero
mean Gaussian processes. This class includes, in particular, integrated
generalized Slepian process, integrated centered Wiener process and integrated
centered Brownian bridge.
