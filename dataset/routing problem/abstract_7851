Let f be a newform of weight at least 2 and squarefree level with Fourier
coefficients in a number field K. We give explicit bounds, depending on
congruences of f with other newforms, on the set of primes lambda of K for
which the deformation problem associated to the mod lambda Galois
representation of f is obstructed. We include some explicit examples.
