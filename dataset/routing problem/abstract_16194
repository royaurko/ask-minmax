We study the wireless scheduling problem in the SINR model. More
specifically, given a set of $n$ links, each a sender-receiver pair, we wish to
partition (or \emph{schedule}) the links into the minimum number of slots, each
satisfying interference constraints allowing simultaneous transmission. In the
basic problem, all senders transmit with the same uniform power.
  We give a distributed $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm for the scheduling
problem, matching the best ratio known for centralized algorithms. It holds in
arbitrary metric space and for every length-monotone and sublinear power
assignment. It is based on an algorithm of Kesselheim and V\"ocking, whose
analysis we improve by a logarithmic factor. We show that every distributed
algorithm uses $\Omega(\log n)$ slots to schedule certain instances that
require only two slots, which implies that the best possible absolute
performance guarantee is logarithmic.
