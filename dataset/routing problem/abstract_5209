The real world scenario has changed from the wired connection to wireless
connection.Over the years software, development has responded to the increasing
growth of wireless connectivity in developing network enabled software.The
problem arises in the wireless domain due to random packet loss in transport
layer and as well as in data link layer for the end to end connection. The
basic problem has been considered in this work is to convert the real world
scenario of Vehicular ad hoc network into a lab oriented problem by used the
APS-system and study the result to achieve better performance in the wireless
domain. The real world physical problems map into analytical problem and
simulate that analytic problem with respect to real world scenario by Automated
Position System (APS) for antenna mounted over the mobile node in 2 Dimension
space. Here the methodology quantifies the performance and the impact of the
packet loss, delay, by the bit error rate and throughput with respect to the
real- world scenario of VANET in the MAC layer, data link layer and transport
layer. The result presents the Directional Antenna which is mounted over the
vehicle gives less bit error in comparison to Isotropic and Discone antenna.
