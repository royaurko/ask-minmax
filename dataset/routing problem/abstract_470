This paper is intended as an introductory survey of a newly emerging field: a
topological approach to the study of locally finite graphs that crucially
incorporates their ends. Topological arcs and circles, which may pass through
ends, assume the role played in finite graphs by paths and cycles.
  This approach has made it possible to extend to locally finite graphs many
classical theorems of finite graph theory that do not extend verbatim. The
shift of paradigm it proposes is thus as much an answer to old questions as a
source of new ones; many concrete problems of both types are suggested in the
paper.
  This paper attempts to provide an entry point to this field for readers that
have not followed the literature that has emerged in the last 10 years or so.
It takes them on a quick route through what appear to be the most important
lasting results, introduces them to key proof techniques, identifies the most
promising open problems, and offers pointers to the literature for more detail.
