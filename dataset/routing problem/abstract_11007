We apply a new technique for ab initio phase determination [Acta Crystallogr.
Sect. A, A55, 48 (1999)] to solve for the average structure of the icosahedral
(i) phase of AlPdMn. After an introduction to the crystallographic phase
problem and a description of the method, we present a brief report of our
findings for the structure of i(AlPdMn). Despite the use of data from extremely
high quality samples, we find strong evidence of disorder in the structure,
lending support to the random tiling model of quasicrystal stabilization.
