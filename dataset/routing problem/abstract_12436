The LIT approach is reviewed both for inclusive and exclusive reactions. It
is shown that the method reduces a continuum state problem to a
bound-state-like problem, which then can be solved with typical bound-state
techniques. The LIT approach opens up the possibility to perform ab initio
calculations of reactions also for those particle systems which presently are
out of reach in conventional approaches with explicit calculations of many-body
continuum wave functions. Various LIT applications are discussed ranging from
particle systems with two nucleons up to particle systems with seven nucleons.
