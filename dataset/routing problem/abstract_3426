We initiate a general study of what we call orientation completion problems.
For a fixed class C of oriented graphs, the orientation completion problem asks
whether a given partially oriented graph P can be completed to an oriented
graph in C by orienting the (non-oriented) edges in P. Orien- tation completion
problems commonly generalize several existing problems including recognition of
certain classes of graphs and digraphs as well as extending representations of
certain geometrically representable graphs. We study orientation completion
problems for various classes of oriented graphs, including k-arc- strong
oriented graphs, k-strong oriented graphs, quasi-transitive oriented graphs,
local tournament, acyclic local tournaments, locally transitive tournaments,
locally transitive local tournaments, in- tournaments, and oriented graphs
which have directed cycle factors. We show that the orientation completion
problem for each of these classes is either polynomial time solvable or
NP-complete. We also show that some of the NP-complete problems become
polynomial time solvable when the input oriented graphs satisfy certain extra
conditions. Our results imply that the representation extension problems for
proper interval graphs and for proper circular arc graphs are polynomial time
solvable, which generalize a previous result.
