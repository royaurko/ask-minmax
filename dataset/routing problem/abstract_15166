Folded concave penalization methods have been shown to enjoy the strong
oracle property for high-dimensional sparse estimation. However, a folded
concave penalization problem usually has multiple local solutions and the
oracle property is established only for one of the unknown local solutions. A
challenging fundamental issue still remains that it is not clear whether the
local optimum computed by a given optimization algorithm possesses those nice
theoretical properties. To close this important theoretical gap in over a
decade, we provide a unified theory to show explicitly how to obtain the oracle
solution via the local linear approximation algorithm. For a folded concave
penalized estimation problem, we show that as long as the problem is
localizable and the oracle estimator is well behaved, we can obtain the oracle
estimator by using the one-step local linear approximation. In addition, once
the oracle estimator is obtained, the local linear approximation algorithm
converges, namely it produces the same estimator in the next iteration. The
general theory is demonstrated by using four classical sparse estimation
problems, that is, sparse linear regression, sparse logistic regression, sparse
precision matrix estimation and sparse quantile regression.
