The control of small-scale helicopter is a MIMO problem. To use of classical
control approach to formally solve a MIMO problem, one needs to come up with
multidimensional Root Locus diagram to tune the control parameters. The problem
with the required dimension of the RL diagram for MIMO design has forced the
design procedure of classical approach to be conducted in cascaded multi-loop
SISO system starting from the innermost loop outward. To implement this control
approach for a helicopter, a pitch and roll attitude control system is often
subordinated to a, respectively, longitudinal and lateral velocity control
system in a nested architecture. The requirement for this technique to work is
that the inner attitude control loop must have a higher bandwidth than the
outer velocity control loop which is not the case for high performance mini
helicopter. To address the above problems, an algebraic design approach is
proposed in this work. The designed control using s-CDM approach is
demonstrated for hovering control of small-scale helicopter simultaneously
subjected to plant parameter uncertainties and wind disturbances.
