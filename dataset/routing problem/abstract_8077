Here we utilize operator--valued Lq-Lp Fourier multiplier theorems to
establish lower bound estimates for large class of elliptic
integro-differential equations in Rd. Moreover, we investigate separability
properties of parabolic convolution operator equations that arise in heat
conduction problems in materials with fading memory. Finally, we give some
remarks on optimal regularity of elliptic differential equations and Cauchy
problem for parabolic equations.
