The study of nonlinear dynamics or chaos theory has emerged in the last three
decades or so as an important interdisciplinary area of research encompassing a
wide range of fields like: fluids, plasmas, biomedical sciences, finance,
turbulence, astronomy, material sciences, etc. In plasma chaos was first
experimentally observed by Boswell. Different other nonlinear dynamics related
phenomena like, the intermittency route to a chaos, Homoclinic chaos, Period
adding route to chaos and period subtracting, mode locking, period pulling,
etc., had been observed by several researchers.
  In this thesis, we have presented (a) anode glow related observation of chaos
to order transition and homoclinic bifurcation; (b) coherence resonance and
stochastic resonance; and self organized criticality behavior in glow discharge
plasma.
