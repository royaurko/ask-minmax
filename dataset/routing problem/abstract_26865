An interesting approach to the cosmological coincidence problem is to allow
dark matter and dark energy interact with each other also nongravitationally.
We consider two general Ans\"{a}tze for such an interaction and appraise their
ability to address the coincidence problem. We determine the average accuracy
required on the cosmic expansion rate data to distinguish interacting
cosmological models from the conventional $\Lambda$CDM scenario. We find that
among the planned surveys the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope has the best
chance to detect an interaction, though at a low significance level. To
unambiguously determine the existence of an interaction one must, therefore,
combine the said expansion data with other probes.
