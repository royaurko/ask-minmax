It is shown that for graph groups (right-angled Artin groups) the conjugacy
problem as well as a restricted version of the simultaneous conjugacy problem
can be solved in polynomial time even if input words are represented in a
compressed form. As a consequence it follows that the word problem for the
outer automorphism group of a graph group can be solved in polynomial time.
