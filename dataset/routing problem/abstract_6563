In the helium case of the classical Coulomb three-body problem in two
dimensions with zero angular momentum, we develop a procedure to find periodic
orbits applying two symbolic dynamics for one-dimensional and planar problems.
A sequence of periodic orbits are predicted and are actually found numerically.
The results obtained here will be a cornerstone for finding the remaining
periodic orbits, which needed for semiclassical applications such as periodic
orbit quantization.
