In this article, we consider some problems in additive number theory.
Elementary solutions for the Goldbach-Euler conjecture and the twin primes
conjecture are presented. The method employed also makes it possible to obtain
some interesting results related to the densities of sequences and gaps between
primes. A stronger version of the Goldbach-Euler conjecture, in which the
strengthening is established by reducing the set of all primes to the set of
twin prime pairs, is also presented. The proof is based on the direct
construction of the double sieve and does not use heuristic methods.
