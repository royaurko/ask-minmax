We study the problem of maximizing the first nontrivial Steklov eigenvalue of
the Laplace-Beltrami Operator among subdomains of fixed volume of a Riemannian
manifold. More precisely, we study the expansion of the corresponding profile
of this isoperimetric (or isochoric) problem as the volume tends to zero. The
main difficulty encountered in our study is the lack of existence results for
maximizing domains and the possible degeneracy of the first nontrivial Steklov
eigenvalue, which makes it difficult to tackle the problem with domain
variation techniques. As a corollary of our results, we deduce local comparison
principles for the profile in terms of the scalar curvature on $\mathcal{M}$.
In the case where the underlying manifold is a closed surface, we obtain a
global expansion and thus a global comparison principle.
