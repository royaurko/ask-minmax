Recently, a flexible and stable algorithm was introduced for the computation
of 2D unstable manifolds of periodic solutions to systems of ordinary
differential equations. The main idea of this approach is to represent orbits
in this manifold as the solutions of an appropriate boundary value problem. The
boundary value problem is under determined and a one parameter family of
solutions can be found by means of arclength continuation. This family of
orbits covers a piece of the manifold. The quality of this covering depends on
the way the boundary value problem is discretised, as do the tractability and
accuracy of the computation. In this paper, we describe an implementation of
the orbit continuation algorithm which relies on multiple shooting and
Newton-Krylov continuation. We show that the number of time integrations
necessary for each continuation step scales only with the number of shooting
intervals but not with the number of degrees of freedom of the dynamical
system. The number of shooting intervals is chosen based on linear stability
analysis to keep the conditioning of the boundary value problem in check. We
demonstrate our algorithm with two test systems: a low-order model of shear
flow and a well-resolved simulation of turbulent plane Couette flow.
