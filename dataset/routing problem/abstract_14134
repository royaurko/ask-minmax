Mean dimension measures the size of an infinite dimensional dynamical system.
Brody curves are one-Lipschitz entire holomorphic curves in the projective
space, and they form a topological dynamical system. Gromov started the problem
of estimating its mean dimension in the paper of 1999. We solve this problem.
Namely we prove the exact mean dimension formula of the dynamical system of
Brody curves. Our formula expresses the mean dimension by the energy density of
Brody curves. The proof is based on a novel application of the metric mean
dimension theory of Lindenstrauss and Weiss.
