Uniqueness problems in the elliptic sector of constrained formulations of
Einstein equations have a dramatic effect on the physical validity of some
numerical solutions, for instance when calculating the spacetime of very
compact stars or nascent black holes. The fully constrained formulation (FCF)
proposed by Bonazzola, Gourgoulhon, Grandcl\'ement, and Novak is one of these
formulations. It contains, as a particular case, the approximation of the
conformal flatness condition (CFC) which, in the last ten years, has been used
in many astrophysical applications. The elliptic part of the FCF basically
shares the same differential operators as the elliptic equations in CFC scheme.
We present here a reformulation of the elliptic sector of CFC that has the
fundamental property of overcoming the local uniqueness problems. The correct
behavior of our new formulation is confirmed by means of a battery of numerical
simulations. Finally, we extend these ideas to FCF, complementing the
mathematical analysis carried out in previous studies.
