The problem of finding a longest common subsequence of two main sequences
with some constraint that must be a substring of the result (STR-IC-LCS) was
formulated recently. It is a variant of the constrained longest common
subsequence problem. As the known algorithms for the STR-IC-LCS problem are
cubic-time, the presented quadratic-time algorithm is significantly faster.
