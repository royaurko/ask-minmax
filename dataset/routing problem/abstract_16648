A positive definite completion problem pertains to determining whether the
unspecified positions of a partial (or incomplete) matrix can be completed in a
desired subclass of positive definite matrices. In this paper we study an
important and new class of positive definite completion problems where the
desired subclasses are the spaces of covariance and inverse-covariance matrices
of probabilistic models corresponding to directed acyclic graph models (also
known as Bayesian networks). We provide fast procedures that determine whether
a partial matrix can be completed in either of these spaces and thereafter
proceed to construct the completed matrices. We prove an analog of the positive
definite completion result for undirected graphs in the context of directed
acyclic graphs, and thus proceed to characterize the class of DAGs which can
always be completed. We also proceed to give closed form expressions for the
inverse and the determinant of a completed matrix as a function of only the
elements of the corresponding partial matrix.
