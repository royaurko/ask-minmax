There is a lot of statistical researches of Russian elections 04.12.2011. The
purpose of this activity is to give a mathematical proof of large
falsifications and to estimate possible 'real results of elections'. My purpose
is to show that
  1. Statistical argumentation allows to prove existence of falsifications and
to give a lower estimate of falsification, near 1-2 percents.
  2. Statistical proofs of stronger statements are incorrect from both points
of view of mathematics and of natural sciences.
  3. This problem is not a problem of pure mathematics (since it includes
strong indeterminacy of sociological nature).
