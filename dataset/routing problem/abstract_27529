The controlled branching process is a generalization of the classical
Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson branching process. It is a useful model for describing
the evolution of populations in which the population size at each generation
needs to be controlled. The maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of
interest for this process is addressed under various sample schemes. Firstly,
assuming that the entire family tree can be observed, the corresponding
estimators are obtained and their asymptotic properties investigated. Secondly,
since in practice it is not usual to observe such a sample, the maximum
likelihood estimation is initially considered using the sample given by the
total number of individuals and progenitors of each generation, and then using
the sample given by only the generation sizes. Expectation-maximization
algorithms are developed to address these problems as incomplete data
estimation problems. The accuracy of the procedures is illustrated by means of
a simulated example.
