We study the kinetics of competitive random sequential adsorption (RSA) of
particles of binary mixture of points and fixed-sized particles within the
mean-field approach. The present work is a generalization of the random car
parking problem in the sense that it considers the case when either a car of
fixed size is parked with probability q or the parking space is partitioned
into two smaller spaces with probability (1-q) at each time event. This
allows an interesting interplay between the classical RSA problem at one
extreme (q=1), and the kinetics of fragmentation processes at the other
extreme (q=0). We present exact analytical results for coverage for a whole
range of q values, and physical explanations are given for different aspects
of the problem. In addition, a comprehensive account of the scaling theory,
emphasizing on dimensional analysis, is presented, and the exact expression for
the scaling function and exponents are obtained.
