This survey treats the problem of ruin in a risk model when assets earn
investment income. In addition to a general presentation of the problem, topics
covered are a presentation of the relevant integro-differential equations,
exact and numerical solutions, asymptotic results, bounds on the ruin
probability and also the possibility of minimizing the ruin probability by
investment and possibly reinsurance control. The main emphasis is on continuous
time models, but discrete time models are also covered. A fairly extensive list
of references is provided, particularly of papers published after 1998. For
more references to papers published before that, the reader can consult [47].
