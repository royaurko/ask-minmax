In 2009, Kong, Wang, and Lee began work on the problem of finding the
edge-balanced index sets of complete bipartite graphs $K_{m,n}$ by solving the
cases where $n=1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $5$, and also the case where $m=n$. In an
article soon to be published, Krop, Minion, Patel, and Raridan concluded the
edge-balanced index set problem for complete bipartite graphs with both parts
of odd cardinality. In this paper, we conclude the problem for complete
bipartite graphs where the larger part is of odd cardinality and the smaller is
of even cardinality.
