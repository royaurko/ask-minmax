This paper deals with the homogenization problem for a one-dimensional
parabolic PDE with random stationary mixing coefficients in the presence of a
large zero order term. We show that under a proper choice of the scaling factor
for the said zero order terms, the family of solutions of the studied problem
converges in law, and describe the limit process. It should be noted that the
limit dynamics remain random.
