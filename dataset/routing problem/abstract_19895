This contribution to the proceedings collects new recent results on
preheating after inflation. We discuss tachyonic preheating in the SUSY
motivated hybrid inflation; development of equilibrium after preheating; theory
of fermionic preheating and the problem of gravitino overproduction from
preheating.
