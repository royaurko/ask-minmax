The direct and inverse spectral problems are solved for a wide subclass of
the class of Schwarz matrices. A connection between the Schwarz matrices and
the so-called generalized Hurwitz polynomials is found. The known results due
to H. Wall and O. Holtz are briefly reviewed and obtained as particular cases.
