A system of strongly interacting fermions in a solid state is discussed. A
structure of singlet and triplet coupled 2-particle states and their excitation
spectra are investigated. It is shown that an account of intersite fermion
interaction leads to new boson modes. A problem of interaction of pairs with
external fields are discussed. The same analysis can be performed for another
sorts of pairings like d-wave.
