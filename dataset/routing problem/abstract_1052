We study the Feshbach resonance assisted stimulated adiabatic passage of an
effective coupling field for creating stable molecules from atomic Bose
condensate. By exploring the properties of the coherent population trapping
state, we show that, contrary to the previous belief, mean-field shifts need
not to limit the conversion efficiency as long as one chooses an adiabatic
passage route that compensates the collision mean-field phase shifts and avoids
the dynamical unstable regime.
