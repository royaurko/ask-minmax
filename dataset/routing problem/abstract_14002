We deal with the existence of weak solutions for a mixed Neumann-Robin-Cauchy
problem. The existence results are based on global-in-time estimates of
approximating solutions, and the passage to the limit exploits compactness
techniques. We investigate explicit estimates for solutions of the parabolic
equations with nonhomogeneous boundary conditions and distributional right hand
sides. The parabolic equation is of divergence form with discontinuous
coefficients. We consider a nonlinear condition on a part of the boundary that
the power laws (and the Robin boundary condition) appear as particular cases.
