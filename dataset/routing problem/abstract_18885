We consider the problem where a network of sensors has to detect the presence
of targets at any of $n$ possible locations in a finite region. All such
locations may not be occupied by a target. The data from sensors is fused to
determine the set of locations that have targets. We term this the separability
problem. In this paper, we address the separability of an asymptotically large
number of static target locations by using binary proximity sensors. Two models
for target locations are considered: (i) when target locations lie on a
uniformly spaced grid; and, (ii) when target locations are i.i.d. uniformly
distributed in the area. Sensor locations are i.i.d uniformly distributed in
the same finite region, independent of target locations. We derive conditions
on the sensing radius and the number of sensors required to achieve
separability. Order-optimal scaling laws, on the number of sensors as a
function of the number of target locations, for two types of separability
requirements are derived. The robustness or security aspects of the above
problem is also addressed. It is shown that in the presence of adversarial
sensors, which toggle their sensed reading and inject binary noise, the scaling
laws for separability remain unaffected.
