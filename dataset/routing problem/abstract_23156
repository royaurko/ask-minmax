A new algorithm for solving the general relativistic MHD equations is
described in this paper. We design our scheme to incorporate black hole
excision with smooth boundaries, and to simplify solving the combined Einstein
and MHD equations with AMR. The fluid equations are solved using a finite
difference Convex ENO method. Excision is implemented using overlapping grids.
Elliptic and hyperbolic divergence cleaning techniques allow for maximum
flexibility in choosing coordinate systems, and we compare both methods for a
standard problem. Numerical results of standard test problems are presented in
two-dimensional flat space using excision, overlapping grids, and elliptic and
hyperbolic divergence cleaning.
