In the last decade, a number of public key cryptosystems based on com-
binatorial group theoretic problems in braid groups have been proposed. We
survey these cryptosystems and some known attacks on them.
  This survey includes: Basic facts on braid groups and on the Garside normal
form of its elements, some known algorithms for solving the word problem in the
braid group, the major public-key cryptosystems based on the braid group, and
some of the known attacks on these cryptosystems. We conclude with a discussion
of future directions (which includes also a description of cryptosystems which
are based on other non-commutative groups).
