This paper presents a means with time complexity of at worst O(n^3) to
compute the discrete logarithm on cyclic finite groups of integers modulo p.
The algorithm makes use of reduction of the problem to that of finding the
concurrent zeros of two periodic functions in the real numbers. The problem is
treated as an analog to a form of analog rotor-code computed cipher.
