A problem of recent interest has been to study how large subsets of the
natural numbers can be while avoiding 3-term geometric progressions. Building
on recent progress on this problem, we consider the analogous problem over
quadratic number fields. We first construct high-density subsets of the
algebraic integers of an imaginary quadratic number field that avoid 3-term
geometric progressions. When unique factorization fails or over a real
quadratic number field, we instead look at subsets of ideals of the ring of
integers. Our approach here is to construct sets "greedily," a generalization
of the greedy set of rational integers considered by Rankin. We then describe
the densities of these sets in terms of values of the Dedekind zeta function.
Next, we consider geometric-progression-free sets with large upper density. We
generalize an argument by Riddell to obtain upper bounds for the upper density
of geometric-progression-free subsets, and construct sets avoiding geometric
progressions with high upper density to obtain lower bounds for the supremum of
the upper density of all such subsets. Both arguments depend critically on the
elements with small norm in the ring of integers.
