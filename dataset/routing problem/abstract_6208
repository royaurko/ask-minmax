In the WKB approximation the $\nabla^2S$ term in Schrodinger's equation is
subordinate to the |\nabla S|^2 term. Here we study an anti-WKB approximation
in which the $\nabla^2 S$ term dominates (after a guess for S is supplied). Our
approximation produces only the nodeless ground state wavefunction, but it can
be used in potential problems where the potential is not symmetric, and in
problems where there are many degrees of freedom. As a test, we apply the
method to potential problems, including the hydrogen and helium atoms and to
$\phi^4$ field theory.
