We discuss derived categories of coherent sheaves on algebraic varieties. We
focus on the case of non-singular Calabi-Yau varieties and consider two
unsolved problems: proving that birational varieties have equivalent derived
categories, and computing the group of derived autoequivalences. We also
introduce the space of stability conditions on a triangulated category and
explain its relevance to these two problems.
