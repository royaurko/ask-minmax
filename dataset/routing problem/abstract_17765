We study reachability games on recursive timed automata (RTA) that generalize
Alur-Dill timed automata with recursive procedure invocation mechanism similar
to recursive state machines. It is known that deciding the winner in
reachability games on RTA is undecidable for automata with two or more clocks,
while the problem is decidable for automata with only one clock. Ouaknine and
Worrell recently proposed a time-bounded theory of real-time verification by
claiming that restriction to bounded-time recovers decidability for several key
decision problem related to real-time verification. We revisited games on
recursive timed automata with time-bounded restriction in the hope of
recovering decidability. However, we found that the problem still remains
undecidable for recursive timed automata with three or more clocks. Using
similar proof techniques we characterize a decidability frontier for a
generalization of RTA to recursive stopwatch automata.
