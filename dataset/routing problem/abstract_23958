We discuss the description of a many-body nuclear system using Hamiltonians
that contain the nucleon relativistic kinetic energy and potentials with
relativistic corrections. Through the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation, the
field theoretical problem of interacting nucleons and mesons is mapped to an
equivalent one in terms of relativistic potentials, which are then expanded at
some order in 1/m_N. The formalism is applied to the Hartree problem in nuclear
matter, showing how the results of the relativistic mean field theory can be
recovered over a wide range of densities.
