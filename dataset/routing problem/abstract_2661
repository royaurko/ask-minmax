Knowledge about the location of licensed primary-users (PU) could enable
several key features in cognitive radio (CR) networks including improved
spatio-temporal sensing, intelligent location-aware routing, as well as aiding
spectrum policy enforcement. In this paper we consider the achievable accuracy
of PU localization algorithms that jointly utilize received-signal-strength
(RSS) and direction-of-arrival (DoA) measurements by evaluating the Cramer-Rao
Bound (CRB). Previous works evaluate the CRB for RSS-only and DoA-only
localization algorithms separately and assume DoA estimation error variance is
a fixed constant or rather independent of RSS. We derive the CRB for joint
RSS/DoA-based PU localization algorithms based on the mathematical model of DoA
estimation error variance as a function of RSS, for a given CR placement. The
bound is compared with practical localization algorithms and the impact of
several key parameters, such as number of nodes, number of antennas and
samples, channel shadowing variance and correlation distance, on the achievable
accuracy are thoroughly analyzed and discussed. We also derive the closed-form
asymptotic CRB for uniform random CR placement, and perform theoretical and
numerical studies on the required number of CRs such that the asymptotic CRB
tightly approximates the numerical integration of the CRB for a given
placement.
