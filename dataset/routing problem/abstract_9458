The finite element method can be viewed as a machine that automates the
discretization of differential equations, taking as input a variational
problem, a finite element and a mesh, and producing as output a system of
discrete equations. However, the generality of the framework provided by the
finite element method is seldom reflected in implementations (realizations),
which are often specialized and can handle only a small set of variational
problems and finite elements (but are typically parametrized over the choice of
mesh).
  This paper reviews ongoing research in the direction of a complete automation
of the finite element method. In particular, this work discusses algorithms for
the efficient and automatic computation of a system of discrete equations from
a given variational problem, finite element and mesh. It is demonstrated that
by automatically generating and compiling efficient low-level code, it is
possible to parametrize a finite element code over variational problem and
finite element in addition to the mesh.
