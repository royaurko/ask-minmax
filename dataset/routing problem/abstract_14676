Weak scale supersymmetry has a generic problem of fine-tuning in reproducing
the correct scale for electroweak symmetry breaking. The problem is
particularly severe in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard
model (MSSM). We present a solution to this problem that does not require an
extension of the MSSM at the weak scale. Superparticle masses are generated by
a comparable mixture of moduli and anomaly mediated contributions, and the
messenger scale of supersymmetry breaking is effectively lowered to the TeV
region. Crucial elements for the solution are a large A term for the top
squarks and a small B term for the Higgs doublets. Requiring no fine-tuning
worse than 20%, we obtain rather sharp predictions on the spectrum. The gaugino
masses are almost universal at the weak scale with the mass between 450 and 900
GeV. The squark and slepton masses are also nearly universal at the weak scale
with the mass a factor of \sqrt{2} smaller than that of the gauginos. The only
exception is the top squarks whose masses split from the other squark masses by
about m_t/\sqrt{2}. The lightest Higgs boson mass is smaller than 120 GeV,
while the ratio of the vacuum expectation values for the two Higgs doublets,
tan\beta, is larger than about 5. The lightest superparticle is the neutral
Higgsino of the mass below 190 GeV, which can be dark matter of the universe.
The mass of the lighter top squark can be smaller than 300 GeV, which may be
relevant for Run II at the Tevatron.
