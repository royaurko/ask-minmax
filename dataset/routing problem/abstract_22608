The fact that the energy densities of dark energy and matter are similar
currently, known as the coincidence problem, is one of the main unsolved
problems of cosmology. We present here a model in which a spatial curvature of
the universe can lead to a transition in the present epoch from a matter
dominated universe to a scaling dark energy dominance in a very natural way. In
particular, we show that if the exponential potential of the dark energy field
depends linearly on the spatial curvature density of a closed universe, the
observed values of some cosmological parameters can be obtained assuming
acceptable values for the present spatial curvature of the universe, and
without fine tuning in the only parameter of the model. We also comment on
possible variations of this model, and realistic scenarios in which it could
arise.
