Let $X$ and $Y$ be finite simplicial sets (e.g. finite simplicial complexes),
both equipped with a free simplicial action of a finite group $G$. Assuming
that $Y$ is $d$-connected and $\dim X\le 2d$, for some $d\geq 1$, we provide an
algorithm that computes the set of all equivariant homotopy classes of
equivariant continuous maps $|X|\to|Y|$; the existence of such a map can be
decided even for $\dim X\leq 2d+1$. For fixed $G$ and $d$, the algorithm runs
in polynomial time. This yields the first algorithm for deciding topological
embeddability of a $k$-dimensional finite simplicial complex into
$\mathbb{R}^n$ under the conditions $k\leq\frac 23 n-1$.
  More generally, we present an algorithm that, given a lifting-extension
problem satisfying an appropriate stability assumption, computes the set of all
homotopy classes of solutions. This result is new even in the non-equivariant
situation.
