I briefly review the flatness problem within the context of classical
cosmology and examine some of the debate in the literature with regard to its
definition and even the question whether it exists. I then present some new
calculations for cosmological models which will collapse in the future;
together with previous work by others for models which will expand forever,
this allows one to examine the flatness problem quantitatively for all
cosmological models. This leads to the conclusion that the flatness problem
does not exist, not only for the cosmological models corresponding to the
currently popular values of lambda_0 and Omega_0 but indeed for all
Friedmann-Lema\^itre models.
