We prove a weak-strong convergence result for functionals of the form
$\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} j(x, u, Du)\,dx$ on $W^{1,p}$, along equiintegrable
sequences. We will then use it to study cases of equality in the extended
Polya-Szeg\"o inequality and discuss applications of such a result to prove the
symmetry of minimizers of a class of variational problems including nonlocal
terms under multiple constraints.
