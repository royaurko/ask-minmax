We consider the free boundary problem for two layers of immiscible, viscous,
incompressible fluid in a uniform gravitational field, lying above a rigid
bottom in a three-dimensional horizontally periodic setting. The effect of
surface tension is either taken into account at both free boundaries or
neglected at both. We are concerned with the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, so we
assume that the upper fluid is heavier than the lower fluid. When the surface
tension at the free internal interface is below a critical value, which we
identify, we establish that the problem under consideration is nonlinearly
unstable.
