In this paper, a boundary integral method is used to solve an inverse linear
heat conduction problem in two-dimensional bounded domain. An inverse problem
of measuring the heat flux from partial (on part of the boundary) dynamic
boundary measurements is considered. An algorithm is given by using the
fundamental solution.
