Electric-field-driven transport of electronic fluids in metallic glasses as
well as three-dimensional amorphous superconductors are investigated by using
the verified approach which has been successfully adopted to study the critical
transport of glassy solid helium in very low temperature environment. The
critical temperatures related to the nearly frictionless transport of
electronic fluids were found to be directly relevant to the superconducting
temperature of amorphous superconductors after selecting specific activation
energies. Our results imply that optimal shear-thinning is an effective way to
reach high-temperature charged superfluidity or superconductivity.
