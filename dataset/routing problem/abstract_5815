A graph G=(V,E) is a 3-leaf power iff there exists a tree T whose leaves are
V and such that (u,v) is an edge iff u and v are at distance at most 3 in T.
The 3-leaf power graph edge modification problems, i.e. edition (also known as
the closest 3-leaf power), completion and edge-deletion, are FTP when
parameterized by the size of the edge set modification. However polynomial
kernel was known for none of these three problems. For each of them, we provide
cubic kernels that can be computed in linear time for each of these problems.
We thereby answer an open problem first mentioned by Dom, Guo, Huffner and
Niedermeier (2005).
