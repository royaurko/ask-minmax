Exact analytic solutions are obtained in three-body problem for the
scattering of light particle on two fixed centers in the case when pair
potentials have a separable form. Solutions show an appearance of new
three-body resonance states that depend on distance between two fixed centers.
In the case when two-body neutron-nucleus amplitudes have the Breit-Wigner's
form and heavy nuclei fixed in nodes of crystalline lattice widths of new
resonance states can be equal to zero at certain values of the distance. It
gives the possibility of transitions between three-body resonance states
connected with process of electron capture by proton with formation of neutron
and emission of neutrino. This exoenergic process leading to the cooling of
star without nuclear reactions is discussed.
