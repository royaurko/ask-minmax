We will discuss an extension of the pseudospectral method developed by
Wineberg, McGrath, Gabl, and Scott for the numerical integration of the KdV
initial value problem. Our generalization of their algorithm can be used to
solve initial value problems for a wide class of evolution equations that are
"weakly nonlinear" in a sense that we will make precise. This class includes in
particular the other classical soliton equations (SGE and NLS). As well as
being very simple to implement, this method exhibits remarkable speed and
stability, making it ideal for use with visualization tools where it makes it
possible to experiment in real-time with soliton interactions and to see how a
general solution decomposes into solitons. We will analyze the structure of the
algorithm, discuss some of the reasons behind its robust numerical behavior,
and finally describe a fixed point theorem we have found that proves that the
pseudospectral stepping algorithm converges.
