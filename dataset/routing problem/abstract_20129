This article is devoted to the tactical game theoretical interpretation of
dialectics. Dialectical games are considered as abstractly as well as models of
the internal dialogue and reflection. The models related to the representation
theory (representative dynamics) are specially investigated in detail, they
correlate with the hypothesis on the dialectical features of human thinking in
general and mathematical thought (the constructing of a solution of
mathematical problem) in particular.
