A multidimensional field model describing the behaviour of (at most) one
Einstein space of non-zero curvature and n Ricci-flat internal spaces is
considered. The action contains several dilatonic scalar fields and
antisymmetric forms. The problem setting covers various problems with field
dependence on a single space-time coordinate, in particular, isotropic and
anisotropic homogeneous cosmologies. When the forms are chosen to be
proportional to volume forms of p-brane factor spaces, a Toda-like Lagrange
representation arises. Exact solutions are obtained when the p-brane dimensions
and the dilatonic couplings obey some orthogonality conditions. General
features and some special cases of cosmological solutions are discussed. It is
shown, in particular, that all hyperbolic models with a 3-dimensional external
space possess an asymptotic with the external scale factor a(t) is proportional
to |t| (the cosmic time), while all internal scale factors and all scalar
fields tend to finite limits. For D=11 a family of models with one 5-brane and
three 2-branes is described.
