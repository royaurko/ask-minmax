We investigate critical phenomena in colloids by means of the
renormalization-group based hierarchical reference theory of fluids (HRT). We
focus on three experimentally relevant model systems: namely, the
Asakura-Oosawa model of a colloidal dispersion under the influence of
polymer-induced attractive depletion forces; fluids with competing short-range
attractive and longer-range repulsive interactions; solutions of star-polymers
whose pair potential presents both an attractive well and an ultrasoft
repulsion at shorter distance. Our results show that the ability to tune the
effective interactions between colloidal particles allows one to generate a
variety of crossovers to the asymptotic critical behavior, which are not
observed in atomic fluids.
