Different relaxation approximations to partial differential equations,
including conservation laws, Hamilton-Jacobi equations, convection-diffusion
problems, gas dynamics problems, have been recently proposed. The present paper
focuses onto diffusive relaxed schemes for the numerical approximation of
nonlinear reaction diffusion equations. High order methods are obtained by
coupling ENO and WENO schemes for space discretization with IMEX schemes for
time integration, where the implicit part can be explicitly solved at a linear
cost. To illustrate the high accuracy and good properties of the proposed
numerical schemes, also in the degenerate case, we consider various examples in
one and two dimensions: the Fisher-Kolmogoroff equation, the porous-Fisher
equation and the porous medium equation with strong absorption.
