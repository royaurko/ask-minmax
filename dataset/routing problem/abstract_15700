We investigate the status of the neutrino decay solution to the solar
neutrino problem in the context of the recent results from Sudbury Neutrino
Observatory (SNO). We present the results of global $\chi^2$-analysis for both
two and three generation cases with one of the mass states being allowed to
decay and include the effect of both decay and mixing. We find that the Large
Mixing Angle (LMA) region which is the currently favoured solution of the solar
neutrino problem is affected significantly by decay. We present the allowed
areas in the $\Delta m^2-\tan^2\theta$ plane for different allowed values of
$\alpha$ and examine how these areas change with the inclusion of decay. We
obtain bounds on the decay constant $\alpha$ in this region which implies a
rest frame life time $\tau_0/m_{2} > 8.7 \times 10^{-5}$ sec/eV for the
unstable neutrino state. We conclude that the arrival of the neutral current
results from SNO further disfavors the neutrino decay solution to the solar
neutrino problem leaving a very small window for the decay constant $\alpha$
which could still be allowed.
