We numerically compute eigenvalues of the non-self-adjoint Zakharov--Shabat
problem in the semiclassical regime. In particular, we compute the eigenvalues
for a Gaussian potential and compare the results to the corresponding (formal)
WKB approximations used in the approach to the semiclassical or zero-dispersion
limit of the focusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation via semiclassical soliton
ensembles. This numerical experiment, taken together with recent numerical
experiments [17,18], speaks directly to the viability of this approach; in
particular, our experiment suggests a value for the rate of convergence of the
WKB eigenvalues to the true eigenvalues in the semiclassical limit. This
information provides some hint as to how these approximations might be
rigorously incorporated into the asymptotic analysis of the singular limit for
the associated nonlinear partial differential equation.
