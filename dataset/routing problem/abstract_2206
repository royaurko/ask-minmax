We report the realization of tunable spin-dependent splitting in intrinsic
photonic spin Hall effect. By breaking the rotational symmetry of a cylindrical
vector beam, the intrinsic vortex phases that the two spin components of the
vector beam carries, which is similar to the geometric Pancharatnam-Berry
phase, is no longer continuous in the azimuthal direction, and leads to
observation of spin accumulation at the opposite edge of the beam. Due to the
inherent nature of the phase and independency of light-matter interaction, the
observed photonic spin Hall effect is intrinsic. Modulating the topological
charge of the vector beam, the spin-dependent splitting can be enhanced and the
direction of spin accumulation is switchable. Our findings may provide a
possible route for generation and manipulation of spin-polarized photons, and
enables spin-based photonics applications.
