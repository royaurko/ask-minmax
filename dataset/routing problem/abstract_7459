We consider the well-studied cake cutting problem in which the goal is to
identify a fair allocation based on a minimal number of queries from the
agents. The problem has attracted considerable attention within various
branches of computer science, mathematics, and economics. Although, the elegant
Selfridge-Conway envy-free protocol for three agents has been known since 1960,
it has been a major open problem for the last fifty years to obtain a bounded
envy-free protocol for more than three agents. We propose a discrete and
bounded envy-free protocol for four agents.
