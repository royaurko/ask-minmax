In the development of a presumed asymptotic expansion for lambda_d in
previous work, a basic step involved extracting the asymptotic behavior of a
sum as being dominated by the largest term in the sum. But this argument only
is valid when the terms in the sum are positive. In the case terms in the sum
are not all positive (some of the J_n are negative) we replace the `largest
term' argument by the route of this paper. The sum is replaced by a contour
integral. We then find a stationary point of the integrand that we conjecture
dominates the asymptotic behavior of the integral.
