Planning in adversarial and uncertain environments can be modeled as the
problem of devising strategies in stochastic perfect information games. These
games are generalizations of Markov decision processes (MDPs): there are two
(adversarial) players, and a source of randomness. The main practical obstacle
to computing winning strategies in such games is the size of the state space.
In practice therefore, one typically works with abstractions of the model. The
diffculty is to come up with an abstraction that is neither too coarse to
remove all winning strategies (plans), nor too fine to be intractable. In
verification, the paradigm of counterexample-guided abstraction refinement has
been successful to construct useful but parsimonious abstractions
automatically. We extend this paradigm to probabilistic models (namely, perfect
information games and, as a special case, MDPs). This allows us to apply the
counterexample-guided abstraction paradigm to the AI planning problem. As
special cases, we get planning algorithms for MDPs and deterministic systems
that automatically construct system abstractions.
