Understanding the behavior of molecular systems under pressure is a
fundamental problem in condensed matter physics. In the case of nitrogen, the
determination of the phase diagram and in particular of the melting line, are
largely open problems. Two independent experiments have reported the presence
of a maximum in the nitrogen melting curve, below 90 GPa, however the position
and the interpretation of the origin of such maximum differ. By means of ab
initio molecular dynamics simulations based on density functional theory and
thermodynamic integration techniques, we have determined the phase diagram of
nitrogen in the range between 20 and 100 GPa. We find a maximum in the melting
line, related to a transformation in the liquid, from molecular N_2 to
polymeric nitrogen accompanied by an insulator-to-metal transition.
