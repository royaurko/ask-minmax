We study the uniqueness and regularity of the steady states of the
diffusively driven Boltzmann equation in the physically relevant case where the
restitution coefficient depends on the impact velocity including, in
particular, the case of viscoelastic hard-spheres. We adopt a strategy which is
novel in several aspects, in particular, the study of regularity does not
requires a priori knowledge of the time-dependent problem. Furthermore, the
uniqueness result is obtained in the small thermalization regime by studying
the so-called quasi-elastic limit for the problem. An important new aspect lies
in the fact that no entropy functional inequality is needed in the limiting
process.
