We investigate the integral cohomology ring and the Chow ring of the
classifying space of the complex projective linear group PGL_p, when p is an
odd prime. In particular, we determine its additive structure completely, and
we reduce the problem of determing its multiplicative structure to a problem in
invariant theory.
