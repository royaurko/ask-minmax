We develop a variable depth search heuristic for the quadratic assignment
problem. The heuristic is based on sequential changes in assignments analogous
to the Lin-Kernighan sequential edge moves for the traveling salesman problem.
We treat unstructured problem instances of sizes 60 to 400. When the heuristic
is used in conjunction with robust tabu search, we measure performance
improvements of up to a factor of 15 compared to the use of robust tabu alone.
The performance improvement increases as the problem size increases.
