We examine the incipient infinite cluster (IIC) of critical percolation in
regimes where mean-field behavior has been established, namely when the
dimension d is large enough or when d>6 and the lattice is sufficiently spread
out. We find that random walk on the IIC exhibits anomalous diffusion with the
spectral dimension d_s=4/3, that is, p_t(x,x)= t^{-2/3+o(1)}. This establishes
a conjecture of Alexander and Orbach. En route we calculate the one-arm
exponent with respect to the intrinsic distance.
