Inspired by recent experiments, we have theoretically explored the nature of
itineracy in CoV$_2$O$_4$ under pressure and investigated, using first
principles density functional theory calculations, if it has any magnetic and
orbital ordering. Our calculations indicate that there could be two possible
routes to obtain the experimentally observed pressure induced metallicity in
this system. One is the spin-orbit interaction coupled with Coulomb correlation
which can take the system from a semiconducting state at ambient pressure to a
metallic state under high pressure. The other mechanism, as indicated by our
GGA+U calculations, is based on the presence of two types of electrons in the
system: localized and itinerant. An effective Falicov-Kimball model could then
possibly explain the observed insulator to metal transition. Comparison of the
two scenarios with existing experimental observations leads us to believe that
the second scenario offers a better explanation for the mechanism of insulator
to metal transition in CoV$_2$O$_4$ under pressure.
