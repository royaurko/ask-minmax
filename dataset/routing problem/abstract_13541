We consider fractional linear programming production games for the
single-objective and multiobjective cases. We use the method of Chakraborty and
Gupta (2002) in order to transform the fractional linear programming problems
into linear programming problems. A cooperative game is attached and we prove
the non-emptiness of the core by using the duality theory from the linear
programming. In the multiobjective case, we give a characterization of the
Stable outcome of the associate cooperative game, which is balanced. We also
consider the cooperative game associated to an exchange economy with a finite
number of agents.
