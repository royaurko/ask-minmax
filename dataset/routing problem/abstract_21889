The equivalence between logarithmic Sobolev inequalities and
hypercontractivity of solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations has been proved in
[5]. We consider a semi-Lagrangian approximation scheme for the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation and we prove that the solution of the discrete problem satisfies a
hypercontractivity estimate. We apply this property to obtain an error estimate
of the set where the truncation error is concentrated.
