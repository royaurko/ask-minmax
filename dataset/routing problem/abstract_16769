In the present paper, we derive an adjunction formula for the
Grauert-Riemenschneider canonical sheaf of a singular hypersurface V in a
complex manifold M. This adjunction formula is used to study the problem of
extending L2-cohomology classes of dbar-closed forms from the singular
hypersurface V to the manifold M in the spirit of the Ohsawa-Takegoshi-Manivel
extension theorem. We do that by showing that our formulation of the
L2-extension problem is invariant under bimeromorphic modifications, so that we
can reduce the problem to the smooth case by use of an embedded resolution of V
in M. The smooth case has recently been studied by Berndtsson.
