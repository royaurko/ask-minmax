Stellar evolution models predict the existence of hybrid white dwarfs (WDs)
with a carbon-oxygen core surrounded by an oxygen-neon mantle. Being born with
masses ~1.1 Msun, hybrid WDs in a binary system may easily approach the
Chandrasekhar mass (MCh) by accretion and give rise to a thermonuclear
explosion. Here, we investigate an off-centre deflagration in a near-MCh hybrid
WD under the assumption that nuclear burning only occurs in carbon-rich
material. Performing hydrodynamics simulations of the explosion and detailed
nucleosynthesis post-processing calculations, we find that only 0.014 Msun of
material is ejected while the remainder of the mass stays bound. The ejecta
consist predominantly of iron-group elements, O, C, Si and S. We also calculate
synthetic observables for our model and find reasonable agreement with the
faint Type Iax SN 2008ha. This shows for the first time that deflagrations in
near-MCh WDs can in principle explain the observed diversity of Type Iax
supernovae. Leaving behind a near-MCh bound remnant opens the possibility for
recurrent explosions or a subsequent accretion-induced collapse in faint Type
Iax SNe, if further accretion episodes occur. From binary population synthesis
calculations, we find the rate of hybrid WDs approaching MCh to be on the order
of 1 percent of the Galactic SN Ia rate.
