In spite of its long history and classical character which goes back even to
d'Alembert and Lagrange, the problems of constraints in mechanics of continua
is still mysterious and full of misunderstandings. Let us mention the problem
of difference between special solutions of unconstrained systems and
constraints dynamics, holonomic and nonholonomic constrained, various versions
of so-called vakonomy, sub-Riemannian structures, servoconstraints, and
programme motion. There are some strange confusions between field theory and
mechanics of continua; many problems call for conceptual cleaning, although
both the mechanics of continua and field theory are formally based on partial
differential equations. The contributor is deeply indebted to professor Czes\law
Wo\'{z}niak for his help during many years, and deep understanding and support.
