Our purpose is to find positive solutions $u \in D^{1,2}(\rz^N)$ of the
semilinear elliptic problem $-\laplace u = h(x) u^{p-1}$ for $2<p$. The
function $h$ may have an indefinite sign. Key ingredients are a $h$-dependent
concentration-compactness Lemma and a characterization of compact embeddings of
$D^{1,2}(\rz^N)$ into weighted Lebesgue spaces.
