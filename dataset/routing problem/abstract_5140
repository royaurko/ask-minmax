Many complex questions in biology, physics, and mathematics can be mapped to
the graph isomorphism problem and the closely related graph automorphism
problem. In particular, these problems appear in the context of network
visualization, computational logic, structure recognition, and dynamics of
complex systems. Both problems have previously been suspected, but not proven,
to be NP-complete. In this paper we propose an algorithm that solves both graph
automorphism and isomorphism problems in polynomial time. The algorithm can be
easily implemented and thus opens up a wide range of applications.
