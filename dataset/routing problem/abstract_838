We are entering the era of ubiquitous genetic information for research,
clinical care, and personal curiosity. Sharing these datasets is vital for
rapid progress in understanding the genetic basis of human diseases. However,
one growing concern is the ability to protect the genetic privacy of the data
originators. Here, we technically map threats to genetic privacy and discuss
potential mitigation strategies for privacy-preserving dissemination of genetic
data.
