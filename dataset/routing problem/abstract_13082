Recently, Bie\~{n} [A. Bie\~{n}, The problem of singularity for planar grids,
Discrete Math. 311 (2011), 921--931] obtained a recursive formula for the
determinant of a grid. Also, recently, Pragel [D. Pragel, Determinants of box
products of paths, Discrete Math. 312 (2012), 1844--1847], independently,
obtained an explicit formula for this determinant. In this paper, we give a
short proof for this problem. Furthermore, applying the same technique, we get
explicit formulas for the determinant of a torus, a cylinder, and a M\"{o}bius
ladder.
