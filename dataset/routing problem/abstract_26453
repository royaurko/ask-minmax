In this paper, we consider pursuit-evasion and probabilistic consequences of
some geometric notions for bounded and suitably regular domains in Euclidean
space that are CAT(kappa) for some kappa > 0. These geometric notions are
useful for analyzing the related problems of (a) existence/nonexistence of
successful evasion strategies for the Man in Lion and Man problems, and (b)
existence/nonexistence of shy couplings for reflected Brownian motions. They
involve properties of rubber bands and the extent to which a loop in the domain
in question can be deformed to a point without, in between, increasing its loop
length. The existence of a stable rubber band will imply the existence of a
successful evasion strategy but, if all loops in the domain are
well-contractible, then no successful evasion strategy will exist and there can
be no co-adapted shy coupling. For example, there can be no shy couplings in
bounded and suitably regular star-shaped domains and so, in this setting, any
two reflected Brownian motions must almost surely make arbitrarily close
encounters as t tends to infinity.
