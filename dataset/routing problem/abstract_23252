We present a generalization of the resonant neutrino conversion in matter,
including a random component in the matter density profile. The study is
focused on the effect of such matter perturbations upon both large and small
mixing angle MSW solutions to the solar neutrino problem. This is carried out
both for the active-active $\nu_e \ra \nu_{\mu,\tau}$ as well as active-sterile
$\nu_e \ra \nu_s$ conversion channels. We find that the small mixing MSW
solution is much more stable (especially in $\delta m^2$) than the large mixing
solution. Future solar neutrino experiments, such as Borexino, could probe
solar matter density noise at the few percent level.
