The Alpha version of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam problem is revisited through direct
numerical simulations and an application of weak turbulence theory. The energy
spectrum, initialized with a large scale excitation, is traced through a series
of distinct qualitative phases en route to eventual equipartition. Weak
turbulence theory is applied in an attempt to provide and effective
quantitative description of the evolution of the energy spectrum. Some scaling
predictions are well-confirmed byt the numerical simulations.
