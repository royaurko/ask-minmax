We investigate the existence of non-constant uniformly-bounded minimal
solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation on a Gromov-hyperbolic group. We show that
whenever the Laplace term in the Allen-Cahn equation is small enough, there
exist minimal solutions satisfying a large class of prescribed asymptotic
behaviours. For a phase field model on a hyperbolic group, such solutions
describe phase transitions that asymptotically converge towards prescribed
phases, given by asymptotic directions. In the spirit of de Giorgi's
conjecture, we then fix an asymptotic behaviour and let the Laplace term go to
zero. In the limit we obtain a solution to a corresponding asymptotic Plateau
problem by $\Gamma$-convergence.
