Proton beam window (PBW) is a boundary wall between a high vacuum area in the
proton beam line and the helium atmosphere in a helium vessel at a high beam
power target. The thermal and mechanical problems of the PBW have been studied
in other spallation neutron sources; however, the scattering effect in PBW is
seldom reported in literature but it may pose serious problems for the target
design if not well treated. This paper will report the simulation studies of
the scattering effect in PBW. Different materials and different structures of
PBW are discussed. Taking CSNS as an example, a thin single-layer aluminum
alloy PBW with edge cooling has been chosen for CSNS-I and CSNS-II, and a
sandwiched aluminum alloy PBW has been chosen for CSNS-III. Simulations results
of the scattering effect in the presence of beam uniformization at target by
using non-linear magnets at the different CSNS PBWs are presented. The
simulations show that the scattering effect at PBW is very important in the
beam loss and the beam distribution at the target.
