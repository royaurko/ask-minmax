We consider construction of empirical formulas for predicting new averaged
experimental data from a finite number of the old ones so as to point out the
relevant technical problems. The main problem is that there is always only a
finite number of inaccurate data at our disposal. As an example, we construct
empirical formulas for describing Planck's law in terms of averaged
experimental data.
