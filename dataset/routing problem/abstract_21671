This paper presents the Euler-Lagrange equations for fractional variational
problems with multiple integrals. The fractional Noether-type theorem for
conservative and nonconservative generalized physical systems is proved. Our
approach uses well-known notion of the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative.
