In this paper, we present a new semi-decidable procedure to analyze
cryptographic protocols for secrecy based on a new class of functions that we
call: the Witness-Functions. A Witness-Function is a reliable function that
guarantees the secrecy in any protocol proved increasing once analyzed by it.
Hence, the problem of correctness becomes a problem of protocol growth. A
Witness-Function operates on derivative messages in a role-based specification
and introduces new derivation techniques. We give here the technical aspects of
the Witness-Functions and we show how to use them in a semi-decidable
procedure. Then, we analyze a variation of the Needham-Schroeder protocol and
we show that a Witness-Function can also help to teach about flaws. Finally, we
analyze the NSL protocol and we prove that it is correct with respect to
secrecy.
