Motivated by a possibility to optimize modelling of the population evolution
we postulate a generalization of the well-know logistic map. Generalized
difference equation reads: \begin{equation} x_{n+1}=rx^p_n(1-x^q_n),
\end{equation} $x\in[0,1],\;(p,q)>0,\;n=0,1,2,...$, where the two new
parameters $p$ and $q$ may assume any positive values. The standard logistic
map thus corresponds to the case $p=q=1$. For such a generalized equation we
illustrate the character of the transition from regularity to chaos as a
function of $r$ for the whole spectrum of $p$ and $q$ parameters. As an example
we consider the case for $p=1$ and $q=2$ both in the periodic and chaotic
regime. We focus on the character of the corresponding bifurcation sequence and
on the quantitative nature of the resulting attractor as well as its universal
attribute (Feigenbaum constant).
