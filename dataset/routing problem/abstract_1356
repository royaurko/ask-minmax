Performance evaluation of the routing node in terms of latency is the
characteristics of an efficient design of Buffer in input module. It is
intended to study and quantify the behavior of the single packet array design
in relation to the multiple packet array design. The utilization efficiency of
the packet buffer array improves when a common buffer is used instead of
individual buffers in each input port. First Poissons Queuing model was
prepared to manifest the differences in packet delays. The queuing model can be
classified as (M/M/1), (32/FIFO). Arrival rate has been assumed to be Poisson
distributed with a mean arrival rate of 10 x 1000000. The service rate is
assumed to be exponentially distributed with a mean service rate of 10.05 x
1000000. It has been observed that latency in Common Buffer improved by 46
percent over its distributed buffer. A Simulink model later simulated on MATLAB
to calculate the improvement in packet delay. It has been observed that the
delay improved by approximately 40 percent through the use of a common buffer.
A verilog RTL for both common and shared buffer has been prepared and later
synthesized using Design Compiler of SYNOPSYS. In distributed buffer, arrival
of data packet could be delayed by 2 or 4 clock cycles which lead to latency
improvement either by 17 percent or 34 percent in a common buffer
