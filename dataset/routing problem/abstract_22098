A common assumption in belief revision is that the reliability of the
information sources is either given, derived from temporal information, or the
same for all. This article does not describe a new semantics for integration
but the problem of obtaining the reliability of the sources given the result of
a previous merging. As an example, the relative reliability of two sensors can
be assessed given some certain observation, and allows for subsequent mergings
of data coming from them.
