The problem of (non)random distribution of points on the sphere is
investigated. Published procedures for obtaining preferred direction and
preferred plane for points on the sphere (in the sky) are discussed. It is
shown that the published methods are incorrect, and, as a consequence, the
results obtained by these methods cannot be considered to be significant. The
correct methods and their applications on real data will be presented in other
papers of this set of papers.
