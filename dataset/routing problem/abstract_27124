Lack of proper English pronunciations is a major problem for immigrant
population in developed countries like U.S. This poses various problems,
including a barrier to entry into mainstream society. This paper presents a
research study that explores the use of speech technologies merged with
activity-based and arcade-based games to do pronunciation feedback for Hispanic
children within the U.S. A 3-month long study with immigrant population in
California was used to investigate and analyze the effectiveness of computer
aided pronunciation feedback through games. In addition to quantitative
findings that point to statistically significant gains in pronunciation
quality, the paper also explores qualitative findings, interaction patterns and
challenges faced by the researchers in dealing with this community. It also
describes the issues involved in dealing with pronunciation as a competency.
