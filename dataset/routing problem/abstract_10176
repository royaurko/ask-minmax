Sequential rate-distortion (SRD) theory is concerned with the fundamental
trade-off between data-rate and data-quality in zero-delay transmission of
stochastic source signals. In this paper, we consider an SRD trade-off problem
for a multi-dimensional and time-varying Gauss-Markov source with a mean-square
distortion constraint. We first revisit the "sensor-estimator separation
principle," which asserts that a Gaussian SRD problem is equivalent to the
problem of designing the best linear sensor mechanism of the form {y_t=C_t
x_t+v_t}, and computing the least mean-square error estimate of {x_t} given the
history of {y_t} based on the Kalman filter. We then show that the optimal
matrix-valued signal-to-noise ratio the sensor mechanism can be efficiently
computed by semidefinite programming (SDP). This allows us to obtain an
SDP-based solution synthesis procedure for the Gaussian SRD problem and a
semidefinite representation of the corresponding SRD function, whose analytical
expression in the general case is not known in the literature. We also consider
applications of SRD theory in real-time communication theory and networked
control theory.
