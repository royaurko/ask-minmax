In this paper, we present a novel approach to the problem of merging of
B\'ezier curves with respect to the $L_2$-norm. We give illustrative examples
to show that the solution of the conventional merging problem may not be
suitable for further modification and applications. As in the case of the
degree reduction problem, we apply the so-called restricted area approach --
proposed recently in (P. Gospodarczyk, Computer-Aided Design 62 (2015),
143--151) -- to avoid certain defects and make the resulting curve more useful.
A method of solving the new problem is based on box-constrained quadratic
programming approach.
