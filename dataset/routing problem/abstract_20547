In this work we study possibility of chaos formation in the dynamics governed
by paradigmatic model of Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics, the so called
James-Cammings model. In particular we consider generalized JC model. It is
shown that even in the case of zero detuning dynamics is chaotic. Kinetic
approach for the problem under study has been applied.
