Compactifications of the heterotic string are a viable route to
phenomenologically realistic vacua and interesting new mathematics. While
supergravity aspects of heterotic compactifications are largely well-understood
their worldsheet description remains largely unexplored. We review recent work
in developing linear sigma model techniques aimed at elucidating the underlying
worldsheet description.
