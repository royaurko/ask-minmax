We give global error bounds for the nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP)
with P-tensors. Such a NCP is called tensor complementarity problem (TCP). We
obtain global upper and lower bounds of solution of TCP with P-tensors. We also
define two new constants associated with real eigenvalues of a P-tensor. With
the help of these two constants, in the case of P-tensors, we establish upper
bounds of two important quantities, whose positivity is a necessary and
sufficient condition for a general tensor to be a P-tensor.
