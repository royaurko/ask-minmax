Separability of multivariate function alleviates the difficulty in finding a
minimum or maximum value of a function such that an optimal solution can be
searched by solving several disjoint problems with lower dimensionalities. In
most of practical problems, however, a function to be optimized is black-box
and we hardly grasp its separability on ahead. In this study, we first describe
a general separability condition which a function defined over an arbitrary
domain must satisfy if and only if that function is separable with respect to
given disjoint subsets of variables. By introducing an alternative separability
condition, we propose a Monte Carlo-based algorithm to estimate the
separability of a function defined over unit cube with respect to given
disjoint subsets of variables. Moreover, we extend our algorithm to estimate
the number of disjoint subsets and disjoint subsets themselves such that a
function is separable with respect to them. Computational complexity of our
extended algorithm is function-dependent and varies from linear to exponential
in the dimension.
