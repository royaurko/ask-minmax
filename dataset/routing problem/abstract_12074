In this paper we consider the problem of anonymizing datasets in which each
individual is associated with a set of items that constitute private
information about the individual. Illustrative datasets include market-basket
datasets and search engine query logs. We formalize the notion of k-anonymity
for set-valued data as a variant of the k-anonymity model for traditional
relational datasets. We define an optimization problem that arises from this
definition of anonymity and provide O(klogk) and O(1)-approximation algorithms
for the same. We demonstrate applicability of our algorithms to the America
Online query log dataset.
