We analyze the multivariate generalization of Howgrave-Graham's algorithm for
the approximate common divisor problem. In the m-variable case with modulus N
and approximate common divisor of size N^beta, this improves the size of the
error tolerated from N^(beta^2) to N^(beta^((m+1)/m)), under a commonly used
heuristic assumption. This gives a more detailed analysis of the hardness
assumption underlying the recent fully homomorphic cryptosystem of van Dijk,
Gentry, Halevi, and Vaikuntanathan. While these results do not challenge the
suggested parameters, a 2^(n^epsilon) approximation algorithm with epsilon<2/3
for lattice basis reduction in n dimensions could be used to break these
parameters. We have implemented our algorithm, and it performs better in
practice than the theoretical analysis suggests.
  Our results fit into a broader context of analogies between cryptanalysis and
coding theory. The multivariate approximate common divisor problem is the
number-theoretic analogue of multivariate polynomial reconstruction, and we
develop a corresponding lattice-based algorithm for the latter problem. In
particular, it specializes to a lattice-based list decoding algorithm for
Parvaresh-Vardy and Guruswami-Rudra codes, which are multivariate extensions of
Reed-Solomon codes. This yields a new proof of the list decoding radii for
these codes.
