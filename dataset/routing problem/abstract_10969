The validity of the adiabatic approach to spin-Peierls transitions is
assessed. An alternative approach is developed which maps the initial
magneto-elastic problem to an effective magnetic problem only. Thus the
equivalence of magneto-elastic solitons and magnetic spinons is shown. No soft
phonon is required for the transition. Temperature dependent couplings are
predicted in accordance with the analysis of experimental data.
