The ICT industry today is placed as one of the major consumers of energy,
where recent reports have also shown that the industry is a major contributor
to global carbon emissions. While renewable energy-aware data centers have been
proposed, these solutions have certain limitations. The primary limitation is
due to the design of data centers which focus on large-size facilities located
in selected locations. This paper addresses this problem, by utilizing
in-network caching with each router having storage and being powered by
renewable energy sources (wind and solar). Besides placing contents closer to
end users, utilizing in-network caching could potentially increase probability
of capturing renewable energy in diverse geographical locations. Our proposed
solution is dual- layered: on the first layer a distributed gradient-based
routing protocol is used to discover the paths along routers that are powered
by the highest renewable energy, and on the second layer, a caching mechanism
will pull the contents from the data centre and place them on routers of the
paths that are discovered by our routing protocol. Through our experiments on a
testbed utilizing real meteorological data, our proposed solution has
demonstrated increased quantity of renewable energy consumption, while reducing
the workload on the data centers.
