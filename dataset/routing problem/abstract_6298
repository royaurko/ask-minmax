We solve the Kato square root problem for second order elliptic systems in
divergence form under mixed boundary conditions on Lipschitz domains. This
answers a question posed by J.-L. Lions in 1962. To do this we develop a
general theory of quadratic estimates and functional calculi for complex
perturbations of Dirac-type operators on Lipschitz domains.
