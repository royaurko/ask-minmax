We study the stable marriage problem from different points of view. We
proposed a microscopic dynamic that lead the system to a stationary state that
we are able to characterize analytically. Then, we derive a thermodynamical
description of the Nash equilibrium states of the system that agree very well
with the results of Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, through large scale
numerical simulations we compare the Global Optimum of the society with the
stable marriage of lower energy. We showed that both states are strongly
correlated and that the selffish attitude results in a benefit for most of the
practitioners belonging to blocking pairs in the Global Optimum of the society.
