Here we show how the recent exact determination of the bond percolation
threshold for the martini lattice can be used to provide approximations to the
unsolved kagom\'e and (3,12^2) lattices. We present two different methods, one
of which provides an approximation to the inhomogeneous kagom\'e and (3,12^2)
bond problems, and the other gives estimates of $p_c$ for the homogeneous
kagom\'e (0.5244088...) and (3,12^2) (0.7404212...) problems that respectively
agree with numerical results to five and six significant figures.
