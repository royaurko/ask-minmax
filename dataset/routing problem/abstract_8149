We find a kind of variations of Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci equations suitable for
Kaluza-Klein reduction and Cauchy problem. Especially the counterpart of
extrinsic curvature tensor has antisymmetric part as well as symmetric one. If
the dependence of metric tensor on reduced dimensions is negligible it becomes
a pure antisymmetric tensor.
