Propagation of unsteady waves under the effect of a step point load on a
square lattice of spring-connected masses is investigated. The problem is
solved by two methods. Asymptotic solutions at large time intervals, which
describe the behavior of long-wave perturbations, are derived analytically. The
solution over the whole time interval for the waves of the entire spectral
range is derived by the finite difference method. These solutions are compared,
and their good agreement is shown.
