This paper present a survey and discussion of the Reference Model for Open
Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) viewpoints; oriented approaches to requirements
engineering viewpoint and a presentation of new work in the application
wireless mobile phone, this area which has been designed with practical
application using the Unified Modelling Language (UML)/VHDL_AMS (VHSIC Hardware
Description Language Analog and Mixed-Signal). We mainly focus on rising and
fulling time, action, uplink behaviour constraints (sequentiality, non
determinism and concurrency constraints).We discuss the practical problems of
introducing viewpoint; oriented requirements engineering into industrial
software engineering practice and why these have prevented the widespread use
of existing approaches. The goal of this article is to check the uplink path
using the MIC (Microphone amplifier) with all analog inputs, and check the
amplifier gain. This paper provides an example of using the Uplink Framework to
build a comprehensive, good solution for Application Wireless Mobile Phone.
Finally, we discuss how well this approach addresses some outstanding problems
in requirements engineering (RE) and the practical industrial problems of
introducing new requirements engineering methods.
