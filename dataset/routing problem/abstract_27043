We study the design of sampling trajectories for stable sampling and the
reconstruction of bandlimited spatial fields using mobile sensors. The spectrum
is assumed to be a symmetric convex set. As a performance metric we use the
path density of the set of sampling trajectories that is defined as the total
distance traveled by the moving sensors per unit spatial volume of the spatial
region being monitored. Focussing first on parallel lines, we identify the set
of parallel lines with minimal path density that contains a set of stable
sampling for fields bandlimited to a known set. We then show that the problem
becomes ill-posed when the optimization is performed over all trajectories by
demonstrating a feasible trajectory set with arbitrarily low path density.
However, the problem becomes well-posed if we explicitly specify the stability
margins. We demonstrate this by obtaining a non-trivial lower bound on the path
density of an arbitrary set of trajectories that contain a sampling set with
explicitly specified stability bounds.
