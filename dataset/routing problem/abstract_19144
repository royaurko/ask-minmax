During the normal operation of a power system all the voltages and currents
are sinusoids with a frequency of 60 Hz in America and parts of Asia, or of
50Hz in the rest of the world. Forcing all the currents and voltages to be
sinusoids with the right frequency is one of the most important problems in
power systems. This problem is known as the transient stability problem in the
power systems literature.
  The classical models used to study transient stability are based on several
implicit assumptions that are violated when transients occur. One such
assumption is the use of phasors to study transients. While phasors require
sinusoidal waveforms to be well defined, there is no guarantee that waveforms
will remain sinusoidal during transients. In this paper, we use energy-based
models derived from first principles that are not subject to hard-to-justify
classical assumptions. In addition to eliminate assumptions that are known not
to hold during transient stages, we derive intuitive conditions ensuring the
transient stability of power systems with lossy transmission lines.
Furthermore, the conditions for transient stability are compositional in the
sense that one infers transient stability of a large power system by checking
simple conditions for individual generators.
