For a wide class of Hamiltonians, a novel method to obtain lower and upper
bounds for the lowest energy is presented. Unlike perturbative or variational
techniques, this method does not involve the computation of any integral (a
normalisation factor or a matrix element). It just requires the determination
of the absolute minimum and maximum in the whole configuration space of the
local energy associated with a normalisable trial function (the calculation of
the norm is not needed). After a general introduction, the method is applied to
three non-integrable systems: the asymmetric annular billiard, the many-body
spinless Coulombian problem, the hydrogen atom in a constant and uniform
magnetic field. Being more sensitive than the variational methods to any local
perturbation of the trial function, this method can used to systematically
improve the energy bounds with a local skilled analysis; an algorithm relying
on this method can therefore be constructed and an explicit example for a
one-dimensional problem is given.
