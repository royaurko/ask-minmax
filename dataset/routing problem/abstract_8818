In this paper we prove a Lyapunov type inequality for quasilinear problems
with indefinite weights. We show that the first eigenvalue is bounded below in
terms of the integral of the weight, instead of the integral of its positive
part. We apply this inequality to some eigenvalue homogenization problems with
indefinite weights.
