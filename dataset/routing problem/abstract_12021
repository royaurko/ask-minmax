We study the regularity of minimizers to the composite membrane problem in
the plane (ie given a domain omega and a positive number A, smaller than the
measure of omega, minimize the first Dirichlet eigenvalue for the Schrodinger
operator with potential equal to a fixed multiple of the characteristic
function of a subset D of omega, with measure A). We show that for minimizers,
the boundary of D is analytic.
