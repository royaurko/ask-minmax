The paper is devoted to the existence of positive solutions of nonlinear
elliptic equations with $p$-Laplacian. We provide a general topological degree
that detects solutions of the problem $$ \{{array}{l} A(u)=F(u) u\in M {array}.
$$ where $A:X\supset D(A)\to X^*$ is a maximal monotone operator in a Banach
space $X$ and $F:M\to X^*$ is a continuous mapping defined on a closed convex
cone $M\subset X$. Next, we apply this general framework to a class of partial
differential equations with $p$-Laplacian under Dirichlet boundary conditions.
