We present a parallel solver for numerical constraint satisfaction problems
(NCSPs) that can scale on a number of cores. Our proposed method runs worker
solvers on the available cores and simultaneously the workers cooperate for the
search space distribution and balancing. In the experiments, we attained up to
119-fold speedup using 256 cores of a parallel computer.
