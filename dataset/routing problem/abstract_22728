We investigate the use of renormalisation group methods to solve partial
differential equations (PDEs) numerically. Our approach focuses on
coarse-graining the underlying continuum process as opposed to the conventional
numerical analysis method of sampling it. We calculate exactly the
coarse-grained or `perfect' Laplacian operator and investigate the numerical
effectiveness of the technique on a series of 1+1-dimensional PDEs with varying
levels of smoothness in the dynamics: the diffusion equation, the
time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation, the Swift-Hohenberg equation and the
damped Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. We find that the renormalisation group is
superior to conventional sampling-based discretisations in representing
faithfully the dynamics with a large grid spacing, introducing no detectable
lattice artifacts as long as there is a natural ultra-violet cut off in the
problem. We discuss limitations and open problems of this approach.
