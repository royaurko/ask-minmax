We are concerned with a system of coupled Schr\"odinger equations $$-\Delta
u_i + V_i(x)u_i = \partial_{u_i}F(x,u)\hbox{ on }\mathbb{R}^N,\,i=1,2,...,K,$$
where $F$ and $V_i$ are periodic in $x$ and $0$ belongs to a spectral gap of
the Schr\"odinger operator $-\Delta+V_i(x)$ for any $i=1,2,...,K$. The problem
appears in nonlinear optics, where gap solitons in photonic crystals are
studied. Photonic crystals have a periodic nanostructure and the term $F$ is
due to the presence of nonlinear polarization. General assumptions on $F$ are
imposed and we find a ground state solution being a minimizer of the energy
functional associated with the system on a Nehari-Pankov manifold. If $0$ lies
below all the spectra $\sigma(-\Delta+V_i)$, then we admit a sign-changing
behaviour of $F$ and we are able to treat problems with the mixture of
self-focusing and defocusing nonlinearties. Our approach is based on a new
linking-type result involving the Nehari-Pankov manifold.
