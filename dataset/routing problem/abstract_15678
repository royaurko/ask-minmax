The SUSY CP problem in the framework of gauge mediated SUSY breaking model is
considered. We first discuss the electric dipole moments of the electron and
neutron, which are likely to be larger than the experimental upper bound if all
the phases in the Lagrangian are O(1). We derive a constraint on the phases in
the so-called $\mu$- and $B_\mu$-parameters and gaugino masses. Then, we
discuss a model in which the CP violating phase can be adequately suppressed.
If the $\mu$- and $B_\mu$-parameters originate from the same superpotential
interaction as the SUSY breaking field, the CP violating phase vanishes.
However, in this class of models, the ratio $B_\mu/\mu$ becomes too large, and
we discuss a possible scenario to fix this problem.
