Recently, Rips produced an example of a double of two free groups which has
unsolvable generalized word problem. In this paper, we show that Rips's example
fits into a large class of doubles of groups, each member of which contains F_2
x F_2 and therefore has unsolvable generalized word problem and is incoherent.
