Two polynomials $f, g \in \mathbb{F}[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ are called
shift-equivalent if there exists a vector $(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \in \mathbb{F}^n$
such that the polynomial identity $f(x_1+a_1, \ldots, x_n+a_n) \equiv
g(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ holds. Our main result is a new randomized algorithm that
tests whether two given polynomials are shift equivalent. Our algorithm runs in
time polynomial in the circuit size of the polynomials, to which it is given
black box access. This complements a previous work of Grigoriev (Theoretical
Computer Science, 1997) who gave a deterministic algorithm running in time
$n^{O(d)}$ for degree $d$ polynomials.
  Our algorithm uses randomness only to solve instances of the Polynomial
Identity Testing (PIT) problem. Hence, if one could de-randomize PIT (a
long-standing open problem in complexity) a de-randomization of our algorithm
would follow. This establishes an equivalence between de-randomizing
shift-equivalence testing and de-randomizing PIT (both in the black-box and the
white-box setting). For certain restricted models, such as Read Once Branching
Programs, we already obtain a deterministic algorithm using existing PIT
results.
