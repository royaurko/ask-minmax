We show that a ferromagnetic (FM) order in the orthorhombic CaRuO3, which is
a non-magnetic and iso-structural analog of FM system SrRuO3, can be
established and stabilized by the means of tensile epitaxial strain.
Investigations on the structural and magnetic property correlations in the
CaRuO3 films with different degrees of strain reveal that the FM moment
increases with increasing the tensile strain. This is an experimental
verification to the theoretical predictions of scaling of the tensile epitaxial
strain and the magnetic order in this system. Our studies further establish
that the tensile strain is more efficient than the chemical route to induce the
FM order in CaRuO3 as the magnetic moment in these strained films is larger
than that in chemically modified CaRu0.9Cr0.1O3 films.
