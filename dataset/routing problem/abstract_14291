In this paper we state necessary and sufficient conditions for equivalence of
the method of conjugate gradients and quasi-Newton methods on a quadratic
problem. We show that the set of quasi-Newton schemes that generate parallel
search directions to those of the method of conjugate gradients is strictly
larger than the one-parameter Broyden family. In addition, we show that this
set contains an infinite number of symmetric rank-one update schemes.
