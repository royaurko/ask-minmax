This paper investigates the problem of joint phase tracking and channel
decoding in OFDM based Physical-layer Network Coding (PNC) systems. OFDM
signaling can obviate the need for tight time synchronization among multiple
simultaneous transmissions in the uplink of PNC systems. However, OFDM PNC
systems are susceptible to phase drifts caused by residual carrier frequency
offsets (CFOs). In the traditional OFDM system in which a receiver receives
from only one transmitter, pilot tones are employed to aid phase tracking. In
OFDM PNC systems, multiple transmitters transmit to a receiver, and these pilot
tones must be shared among the multiple transmitters. This reduces the number
of pilots that can be used by each transmitting node. Phase tracking in OFDM
PNC is more challenging as a result. To overcome the degradation due to the
reduced number of per-node pilots, this work supplements the pilots with the
channel information contained in the data. In particular, we propose to solve
the problems of phase tracking and channel decoding jointly. Our solution
consists of the use of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for phase
tracking and the use of the belief propagation (BP) algorithm for channel
decoding. The two problems are solved jointly through iterative processing
between the EM and BP algorithms. Simulations and real experiments based on
software-defined radio show that the proposed method can improve phase tracking
as well as channel decoding performance.
