We investigate the emergence of target waves in a cyclic predator-prey model
incorporating a periodic current of the three competing species in a small area
situated at the center of the square lattice. The periodic current acts as a
pacemaker, trying to impose its rhythm on the overall spatiotemporal evolution
of the three species. We show that the pacemaker is able to nucleate target
waves that eventually spread across the whole population, whereby three routes
leading to this phenomenon can be distinguished depending on the mobility of
the three species and the oscillation period of the localized current. First,
target waves can emerge due to the synchronization between the periodic current
and oscillations of the density of the three species on the spatial grid. The
second route is similar to the first, the difference being that the
synchronization sets in only intermittently. Finally, the third route towards
target waves is realized when the frequency of the pacemaker is much higher
than that characterizing the oscillations of the overall density of the three
species. By considering mobility and the frequency of the current as variable
parameters, we thus provide insights into the mechanisms of pattern formation
resulting from the interplay between local and global dynamics in systems
governed by cyclically competing species.
