Using the probability theory-based approach, this paper reveals the
equivalence of an arbitrary NP-complete problem to a problem of checking
whether a level set of a specifically constructed harmonic cost function (with
all diagonal entries of its Hessian matrix equal to zero) intersects with a
unit hypercube in many-dimensional Euclidean space. This connection suggests
the possibility that methods of continuous mathematics can provide crucial
insights into the most intriguing open questions in modern complexity theory.
