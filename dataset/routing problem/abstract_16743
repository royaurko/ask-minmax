We consider a restricted $(N+1)$-body problem, with $N \geq 3$ and
homogeneous potentials of degree $-\a<0$, $\a \in [1,2)$. We prove the
existence of infinitely many collision-free periodic solutions with negative
and small Jacobi constant and small values of the angular velocity, for any
initial configuration of the centres. We will introduce a Maupertuis' type
variational principle in order to apply the broken geodesics technique
developed in the paper "N. Soave and S. Terracini. Symbolic dynamics for the
$N$-centre problem at negative energies. Discrete and Cont. Dynamical Systems
A, 32 (2012)". Major difficulties arise from the fact that, contrary to the
classical Jacobi length, the related functional does not come from a Riemaniann
structure but from a Finslerian one. Our existence result allows us to
characterize the associated dynamical system with a symbolic dynamics, where
the symbols are given partitions of the centres in two non-empty sets.
