The influence of water and radicals on SOAs produced by {\beta}-pinene
ozonolysis was investigated at 298 and 288 K using a laminar flow reactor. A
volatility tandem differential mobility analyzer (VTDMA) was used to measure
the evaporation of the SOA, enabling the parameterization of its volatility
properties. The parameters extracted included the temperature at which 50% of
the aerosol had evaporated (TVFR0.5) and the slope factor (SVFR). An increase
in SVFR indicates a broader distribution of vapor pressures for the aerosol
constituents. Reducing the reaction temperature increased SVFR and decreased
TVFR0.5 under humid conditions but had less effect on TVFR0.5 under dry
conditions. In general, higher water concentrations gave lower TVFR0.5 values,
more negative SVFR values, and a reduction in total SOA production. The radical
conditions were changed by introducing OH scavengers to generate systems with
and without OH radicals and with different [HO2]/[RO2] ratios. Presence of a
scavenger and lower [HO2]/[RO2] ratio reduced SOA production. Observed changes
in SVFR values could be linked to the more complex chemistry that occurs in the
absence of a scavenger, and indicated that additional HO2 chemistry gives
products with a wider range of vapor pressures. Updates to existing ozonolysis
mechanisms with routes that describe the observed responses to water and
radical conditions for monoterpenes with endocyclic and exocyclic double bonds
are discussed.
