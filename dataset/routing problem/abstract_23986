Density and temperature conditions in many stellar core (like the solar core)
imply the presence of nonideal plasma effects with memory and long-range
interactions between particles. This aspect suggests the possibility that the
stellar core could not be in a global thermodynamical equilibrium but satisfies
the conditions of a metastable state with a stationary (nonextensive) power law
distribution function among ions. The order of magnitude of the deviation from
the standard Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution can be derived microscopically by
considering the presence of random electrical microfields in the stellar
plasma. We show that such a nonextensive statistical effect can be very
relevant in many nuclear astrophysical problems.
