In this paper, we study the probability of successful deception of an
uncompressed biometric authentication system with side information at the
adversary. It represents the scenario where the adversary may have correlated
side information, e.g.,~a partial finger print or a DNA sequence of a relative
of the legitimate user. We find the optimal exponent of the deception
probability by proving both the achievability and the converse. Our proofs are
based on the connection between the problem of deception with side information
and the rate distortion problem with side information at both the encoder and
decoder.
