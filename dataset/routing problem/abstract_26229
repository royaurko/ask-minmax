We observe that a recently proposed supersymmetric model with Q6 flavor
symmetry admits a new CP violating ground state. A new sum rule for the quark
mixing parameters emerges, which is found to be consistent with data. Simple
extensions of the model to the neutrino sector suggest an inverted hierarchical
mass spectrum with nearly maximal CP violation (|delta_{MNS}| simeq pi/2).
Besides reducing the number of parameters in the fermion sector, these models
also provide solutions to the SUSY flavor problem and the SUSY CP problem. We
construct a renormalizable scalar potential that leads to the spontaneous
breaking of CP symmetry and the family symmetry.
