Convergence problems occur abundantly in all branches of mathematics or in
the mathematical treatment of the sciences. Sequence transformations are
principal tools to overcome convergence problems of the kind. They accomplish
this by converting a slowly converging or diverging input sequence $\{s_n
\}_{n=0}^{\infty}$ into another sequence $\{s^{\prime}_n \}_{n=0}^{\infty}$
with hopefully better numerical properties. Pad\'{e} approximants, which
convert the partial sums of a power series to a doubly indexed sequence of
rational functions, are the best known sequence transformations, but the
emphasis of the review will be on alternative sequence transformations which
for some problems provide better results than Pad\'{e} approximants.
