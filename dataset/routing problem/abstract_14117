We study the Signorini problem near a fixed boundary, where the solution is
"clamped down" or "glued." We show that in general the solutions are at least
$C^{1/2}$ regular and that this regularity is sharp. We prove that near the
actual points of contact of the free boundary with the fixed one the blowup
solutions must have homogeneity $\kappa\geq 3/2$, while at the non-contact
points the homogeneity must take one of the values: $1/2, 3/2, \ldots, m-1/2,
\ldots$.
