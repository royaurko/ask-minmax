This paper deals with the containment problem under homothetics which has the
minimal enclosing ball (MEB) problem as a prominent representative. We connect
the problem to results in classic convex geometry and introduce a new series of
radii, which we call core-radii. For the MEB problem, these radii have already
been considered from a different point of view and sharp inequalities between
them are known. In this paper sharp inequalities between core-radii for general
containment under homothetics are obtained. Moreover, the presented
inequalities are used to derive sharp upper bounds on the size of core-sets for
containment under homothetics. In the MEB case, this yields a tight (dimension
independent) bound for the size of such core-sets. In the general case, we show
that there are core-sets of size linear in the dimension and that this bound
stays sharp even if the container is required to be symmetric.
