One problem which plagues the numerical evaluation of one-loop Feynman
diagrams using recursive integration by part relations is a numerical
instability near exceptional momentum configurations. In this contribution we
will discuss a generic solution to this problem. As an example we consider the
case of forward light-by-light scattering.
