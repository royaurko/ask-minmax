We give a rigorous treatment to the thermodynamic limit of the 6-vertex
model. We prove that the unique solution of the Bethe-Ansatz equation exists
and the distribution of the roots converges to a continuum measure. We solve
this problem for $0<\Delta<1$ using convexity arguments and for large negative
$\Delta$ using the Fixed Point Theory of appropriately defined contracting
operator.
