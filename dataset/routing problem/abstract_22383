We consider parabolic stochastic partial differential equations driven by
multiplicative L\'evy noise of an affine type. For the second moment of the
mild solution, we derive a well-posed deterministic space-time variational
problem posed on tensor product spaces, which subsequently leads to a
deterministic equation for the covariance function.
