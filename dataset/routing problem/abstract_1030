We investigate the possibilities of generation of solitons and vortices in a
degenerate gas of neutral fermionic atoms. In analogy with, already
experimentally demonstrated, technique applied to gaseous Bose-Einstein
condensate we propose the phase engineering of a Fermi gas as a practical route
to excited states with solitons and vortices. We stress that solitons and
vortices appear even in a noninteracting fermionic gas. For solitons, in a
system with sufficiently large number of fermions and appropriate trap
configuration, the Pauli blocking acts as the interaction between particles.
