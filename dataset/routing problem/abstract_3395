Transportation Problem is an important aspect which has been widely studied
in Operations Research domain. It has been studied to simulate different real
life problems. In particular, application of this Problem in NP- Hard Problems
has a remarkable significance. In this Paper, we present a comparative study of
Transportation Problem through Probabilistic and Fuzzy Uncertainties. Fuzzy
Logic is a computational paradigm that generalizes classical two-valued logic
for reasoning under uncertainty. In order to achieve this, the notation of
membership in a set needs to become a matter of degree. By doing this we
accomplish two things viz., (i) ease of describing human knowledge involving
vague concepts and (ii) enhanced ability to develop cost-effective solution to
real-world problem. The multi-valued nature of Fuzzy Sets allows handling
uncertain and vague information. It is a model-less approach and a clever
disguise of Probability Theory. We give comparative simulation results of both
approaches and discuss the Computational Complexity. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work on comparative study of Transportation
Problem using Probabilistic and Fuzzy Uncertainties.
