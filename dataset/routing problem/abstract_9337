A comparison problem for volumes of convex bodies asks whether inequalities
$f_K(\xi)\le f_L(\xi)$ for all $\xi\in S^{n-1}$ imply that $\vol_n(K)\le
\vol_n(L),$ where $K,L$ are convex bodies in $\R^n,$ and $f_K$ is a certain
geometric characteristic of $K.$ By linear stability in comparison problems we
mean that there exists a constant $c$ such that for every $\e>0$, the
inequalities $f_K(\xi)\le f_L(\xi)+\e$ for all $\xi\in S^{n-1}$ imply that
$(\vol_n(K))^{\frac{n-1}n}\le (\vol_n(L))^{\frac{n-1}n}+c\e.$
  We prove such results in the settings of the Busemann-Petty and Shephard
problems and their generalizations. We consider the section function
$f_K(\xi)=S_K(\xi)=\vol_{n-1}(K\cap \xi^\bot)$ and the projection function
$f_K(\xi)=P_K(\xi)=\vol_{n-1}(K|\xi^\bot),$ where $\xi^\perp$ is the central
hyperplane perpendicular to $\xi,$ and $K|\xi^\bot$ is the orthogonal
projection of $K$ to $\xi^\bot.$ In these two cases we prove linear stability
under additional conditions that $K$ is an intersection body or $L$ is a
projection body, respectively. Then we consider other functions $f_K,$ which
allows to remove the additional conditions on the bodies in higher dimensions.
