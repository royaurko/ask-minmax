In many applications, input data are sampled functions taking their values in
infinite dimensional spaces rather than standard vectors. This fact has complex
consequences on data analysis algorithms that motivate modifications of them.
In fact most of the traditional data analysis tools for regression,
classification and clustering have been adapted to functional inputs under the
general name of functional Data Analysis (FDA). In this paper, we investigate
the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for functional data analysis and we
focus on the problem of curves discrimination. SVMs are large margin classifier
tools based on implicit non linear mappings of the considered data into high
dimensional spaces thanks to kernels. We show how to define simple kernels that
take into account the unctional nature of the data and lead to consistent
classification. Experiments conducted on real world data emphasize the benefit
of taking into account some functional aspects of the problems.
