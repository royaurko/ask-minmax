Whether or not the problem of finding maximal independent sets (MIS) in
hypergraphs is in (R)NC is one of the fundamental problems in the theory of
parallel computing. Unlike the well-understood case of MIS in graphs, for the
hypergraph problem, our knowledge is quite limited despite considerable work.
It is known that the problem is in \emph{RNC} when the edges of the hypergraph
have constant size. For general hypergraphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges,
the fastest previously known algorithm works in time $O(\sqrt{n})$ with
$\text{poly}(m,n)$ processors. In this paper we give an EREW PRAM algorithm
that works in time $n^{o(1)}$ with $\text{poly}(m,n)$ processors on general
hypergraphs satisfying $m \leq n^{\frac{\log^{(2)}n}{8(\log^{(3)}n)^2}}$, where
$\log^{(2)}n = \log\log n$ and $\log^{(3)}n = \log\log\log n$. Our algorithm is
based on a sampling idea that reduces the dimension of the hypergraph and
employs the algorithm for constant dimension hypergraphs as a subroutine.
