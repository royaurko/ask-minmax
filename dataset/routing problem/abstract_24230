We study eigenvibrations for inhomogeneous string consisting of two parts
with strongly contrasting stiffness and mass density. In this work we treat a
critical case for the high frequency approximations, namely the case when the
order of mass density inhomogeneity is the same as the order of stiffness
inhomogeneity, with heavier part being softer. The limit problem for high
frequency approximations depends nonlinearly on the spectral parameter. The
quantization of the spectral semiaxies is applied in order to get a close
approximations of eigenvalues as well as eigenfunctions for the prime problem
under perturbation.
