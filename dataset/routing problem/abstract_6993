We prove $L_p$ estimates of solutions to a conormal derivative problem for
divergence form complex-valued higher-order elliptic systems on a half space
and on a Reifenberg flat domain. The leading coefficients are assumed to be
merely measurable in one direction and have small mean oscillations in the
orthogonal directions on each small ball. Our results are new even in the
second-order case. The corresponding results for the Dirichlet problem were
obtained recently in [15].
