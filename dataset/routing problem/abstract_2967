This list of 10 problems and their subsequent discussion by prominent
scholars at the workshop in Geneva Observatory, 1993, were published in Lecture
Notes in Physics, 1994, not too reachable now. The problems cover Theory,
Computer Simulations (including regarding Lyapunov exponents and the search of
codes radically differing from standard N-body ones) and Observations. The
elapsed 20 year period enables to reveal the occurred developments, if any, on
each problem and the validity of predictions made by experts.
