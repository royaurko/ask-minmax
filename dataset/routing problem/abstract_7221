A matching in a graph is a set of edges no two of which share a common
vertex. A matching M is an induced matching if no edge connects two edges of M.
The problem of finding a maximum induced matching is known to be NP-hard in
general and specifically for bipartite graphs. Lozin has been proposed an
O(n^3) time algorithm for this problem on the class of bipartite
Star_123,Sun_4-free graphs. In this paper we improve and generalize this result
in presenting a simple O(n) time algorithm for maximum induced matching problem
in bipartite Star_123-free graphs.
