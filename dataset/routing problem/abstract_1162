We propose the left-side electrification of multilane motorways in suburban
areas as a practical way of implementing on-road charging in order to reduce
the weight and price of electrically-powered automobiles. These could then be
supplied energy en-route, significantly reducing the weight and cost of
vehicle-mounted batteries. Our theoretical study is based on the circumstances
of Madrid (Spain), a six million inhabitant region, but should be easily
adaptable to other metropolitan areas.
