In this paper, we investigate the hybridization of constraint programming and
local search techniques within a large neighbourhood search scheme for solving
highly constrained nurse rostering problems. As identified by the research, a
crucial part of the large neighbourhood search is the selection of the fragment
(neighbourhood, i.e. the set of variables), to be relaxed and re-optimized
iteratively. The success of the large neighbourhood search depends on the
adequacy of this identified neighbourhood with regard to the problematic part
of the solution assignment and the choice of the neighbourhood size. We
investigate three strategies to choose the fragment of different sizes within
the large neighbourhood search scheme. The first two strategies are tailored
concerning the problem properties. The third strategy is more general, using
the information of the cost from the soft constraint violations and their
propagation as the indicator to choose the variables added into the fragment.
The three strategies are analyzed and compared upon a benchmark nurse rostering
problem. Promising results demonstrate the possibility of future work in the
hybrid approach.
