It is shown that the Grayson motivic spectral sequence is isomorphic to the
motivic spectral sequence produced by the Voevodsky slice tower for the motivic
K-theory spectrum KGL. This solves Suslin's problem for these two spectral
sequences in the affirmative. To prove this, one has to solve the Voevodsky
problem for slices of KGL. The latter problem was first solved by Levine by
using the coniveau tower, but our methods are entirely different from Levine's
ones.
