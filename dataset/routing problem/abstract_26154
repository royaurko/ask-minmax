An effective-mass theory with a deformation-induced (an axial) gauge field is
proposed as a theoretical framework to study graphene edge. Though the gauge
field is singular at edge, it can represent the boundary condition and this
framework is adopted to solve the scattering problems for the zigzag and
armchair edges. Furthermore, we solve the scattering problem in the presence of
a mass term and an electromagnetic field. It is shown that the mass term makes
the standing wave at the Dirac point avoid the zigzag edge, by which the local
density of states disappears, and the lowest and first Landau states are
special near the zigzag edge. The (chiral) gauge theory framework provides a
useful description of graphene edge.
