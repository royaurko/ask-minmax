In this paper we consider stochastic differential equations with
non-negativity constraints, driven by a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst
parameter $H>\1/2$. We first study an ordinary integral equation where the
integral is defined in the Young sense and then we apply this result pathwise
to solve the stochastic problem.
