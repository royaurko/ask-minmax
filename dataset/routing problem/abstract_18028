In this paper, we address a collection of state space reachability problems,
for linear time-invariant systems, using a minimal number of actuators. In
particular, we design a zero-one diagonal input matrix B, with a minimal number
of non-zero entries, so that a specified state vector is reachable from a given
initial state. Moreover, we design a B so that a system can be steered either
into a given subspace, or sufficiently close to a desired state. This work
extends the recent results of Olshevsky and Pequito, where a zero-one diagonal
or column matrix B is constructed so that the involved system is controllable.
Specifically, we prove that the first two of our aforementioned problems are
NP-hard; these results hold for a zero-one column matrix B as well. Then, we
provide efficient polynomial time algorithms for their general solution, along
with their worst case approximation guarantees. Finally, we illustrate their
performance over large random networks.
