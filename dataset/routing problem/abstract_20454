Different generators of a deformed oscillator algebra give rise to
one-parameter families of $q$-exponential functions and $q$-Hermite polynomials
related by generating functions. Connections of the Stieltjes and Hamburger
classical moment problems with the corresponding resolution of unity for the
$q$-coherent states and with 'coordinate' operators - Jacobi matrices, are also
pointed out.
