This paper concerns the dynamics of two layers of compressible, barotropic,
viscous fluid lying atop one another. The lower fluid is bounded below by a
rigid bottom, and the upper fluid is bounded above by a trivial fluid of
constant pressure. This is a free boundary problem: the interfaces between the
fluids and above the upper fluid are free to move. The fluids are acted on by
gravity in the bulk, and at the free interfaces we consider both the case of
surface tension and the case of no surface forces. We prove that the problem is
locally well-posed. Our method relies on energy methods in Sobolev spaces for a
collection of related linear and nonlinear problems.
