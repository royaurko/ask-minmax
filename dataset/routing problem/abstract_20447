The maximum likelihood approach is adapted to the problem of estimation of
drift and diffusion functions of stochastic processes from measured time
series. We reconcile a previously devised iterative procedure [Kleinhans et
al., Physics Letters A (346), 2005] and put the application of the method on a
firm theoretical basis.
