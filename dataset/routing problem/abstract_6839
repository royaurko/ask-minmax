Bourgain posed the problem of calculating $$ \Sigma = \sup_{n \geq 1}
~\sup_{k_1 <... < k_n} \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\| \sum_{j=1}^n e^{2 \pi i k_j
\theta}\|_{L^1([0,1])}. $$ It is clear that $\Sigma \leq 1$; beyond that,
determining whether $\Sigma < 1$ or $\Sigma=1$ would have some interesting
implications, for example concerning the problem whether all rank one
transformations have singular maximal spectral type. In the present paper we
prove $\Sigma \geq \sqrt{\pi}/2 \approx 0.886$, by this means improving a
result of Karatsuba. For the proof we use a quantitative two-dimensional
version of the central limit theorem for lacunary trigonometric series, which
in its original form is due to Salem and Zygmund.
