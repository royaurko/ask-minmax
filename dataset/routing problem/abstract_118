In this paper we address an optimisation problem arising from city logistics.
The focus lies on a two-level transportation system to deliver goods to
customers within densely populated areas. The optimisation problem called the
Two-Echelon Vehicle Routing Problem seeks to produce vehicle itineraries to
deliver goods to customers with transit through intermediate facilities. A
local-search metaheuristic based on the principle of destroy and repair of a
Large Neighbourhood Search is developed and implemented to find high quality
solutions within limited computing time. For future reference we resolve
confusion with inconsistent versions of benchmark instances by explaining their
differences and provide all of them online. The proposed algorithm is tested
with those instances. It is able to find the currently best known solutions or
better ones for 95% of the benchmark instances. The computational experiments
show that this simple method achieves excellent solutions for the problem
within short computing times.
