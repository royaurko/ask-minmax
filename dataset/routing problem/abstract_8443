The purpose of this note is to show that the solution to the Kantorovich
optimal transportation problem is supported on a Lipschitz manifold, provided
the cost is $C^{2}$ with non-singular mixed second derivative. We use this
result to provide a simple proof that solutions to Monge's optimal
transportation problem satisfy a change of variables equation almost
everywhere.
