An explicit algorithm for the minimization of an $\ell_1$ penalized least
squares functional, with non-separable $\ell_1$ term, is proposed. Each step in
the iterative algorithm requires four matrix vector multiplications and a
single simple projection on a convex set (or equivalently thresholding).
Convergence is proven and a 1/N convergence rate is derived for the functional.
In the special case where the matrix in the $\ell_1$ term is the identity (or
orthogonal), the algorithm reduces to the traditional iterative
soft-thresholding algorithm. In the special case where the matrix in the
quadratic term is the identity (or orthogonal), the algorithm reduces to a
gradient projection algorithm for the dual problem. By replacing the projection
with a simple proximity operator, other convex non-separable penalties than
those based on an $\ell_1$-norm can be handled as well.
