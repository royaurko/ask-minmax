Analysis of the Stark-Einstein law as it applies to the retinal molecule,
which is part of the rhodopsin molecule within the rod cells of the retina,
reveals that it may provide the solution to the measurement problem from an
animate perspective. That it represents a natural boundary where the
Schroedinger equation or wave function automatically goes from linear to
nonlinear while remaining in a deterministic state. It will be possible in the
near future to subject this theory to empirical tests as has been previously
proposed. This analysis provides a contrast to the many decades well studied
and debated inanimate measurement problem and would represent an addition to
the Stark-Einstein law involving information carried by the photon.
