This paper addresses the problem of identifying a linear time-varying (LTV)
system characterized by a (possibly infinite) discrete set of delays and
Doppler shifts. We prove that stable identifiability is possible if the upper
uniform Beurling density of the delay-Doppler support set is strictly smaller
than 1/2 and stable identifiability is impossible for densities strictly larger
than 1/2. The proof of this density theorem reveals an interesting relation
between LTV system identification and interpolation in the Bargmann-Fock space.
Finally, we introduce a subspace method for solving the system identification
problem at hand.
