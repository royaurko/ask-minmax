I explore the possibility that the cosmos is fundamentally an equilibrium
system, and review the attractive features of such theories. Equilibrium
cosmologies are commonly thought to fail due to the ``Boltzmann Brain''
problem. I show that it is possible to evade the Boltzmann Brain problem if
there is a suitable coarse grained relationship between the fundamental degrees
of freedom and the cosmological observables. I make my main points with simple
toy models, and then review the de Sitter equilibrium model as an illustration.
