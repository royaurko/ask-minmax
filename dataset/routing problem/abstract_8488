This paper is concerned with the numerical minimization of energy functionals
in $BV(\Omega)$ (the space of bounded variation functions) involving total
variation for gray-scale 1-dimensional inpainting problem. Applications are
shown by finite element method and discontinuous Galerkin method for total
variation minimization. We include the numerical examples which show the
different recovery image by these two methods.
