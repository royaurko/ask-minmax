An action minimizing path between two given configurations, spatial or
planar, of the $n$-body problem is always a true -- collision-free -- solution.
Based on a remarkable idea of Christian Marchal, this theorem implies the
existence of new "simple" symmetric periodic solutions, among which the Eight
for 3 bodies, the Hip-Hop for 4 bodies and their generalizations.
