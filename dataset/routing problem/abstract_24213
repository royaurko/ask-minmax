Our research has shown that schedules can be built mimicking a human
scheduler by using a set of rules that involve domain knowledge. This chapter
presents a Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA) for the nurse scheduling
problem that chooses such suitable scheduling rules from a set for each nurses
assignment. Based on the idea of using probabilistic models, the BOA builds a
Bayesian network for the set of promising solutions and samples these networks
to generate new candidate solutions. Computational results from 52 real data
instances demonstrate the success of this approach. It is also suggested that
the learning mechanism in the proposed algorithm may be suitable for other
scheduling problems.
