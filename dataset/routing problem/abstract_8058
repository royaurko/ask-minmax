The Cauchy problem for the inelastic Boltzmann equation is studied for small
data. Existence and uniqueness of mild and weak solutions is obtained for
sufficiently small data that lies in the space of functions bounded by
Maxwellians. The technique used to derive the result is the well known
iteration process of Kaniel and Shinbrot.
