We have studied the concept of bipolarity of information in the soft sets. We
have defined bipolar soft sets and basic operations of union, intersection and
complementation for bipolar soft sets. Examples of bipolar soft sets and an
application of bipolar soft sets in a decision making problem with general
algorithms have also been presented at the end.
