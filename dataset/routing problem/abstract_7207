Interval-valued computing is a relatively new computing paradigm. It uses
finitely many interval segments over the unit interval in a computation as data
structure. The satisfiability of Quantified Boolean formulae and other hard
problems, like integer factorization, can be solved in an effective way by its
massive parallelism. The discrete logarithm problem plays an important role in
practice, there are cryptographical methods based on its computational
hardness. In this paper we show that the discrete logarithm problem is
computable by an interval-valued computing in a polynomial number of steps
(within this paradigm).
