We present a detailed analysis of one-dimensional N\'eel walls in thin
uniaxial ferromagnetic films in the presence of an in-plane applied external
field in the direction normal to the easy axis. Within the reduced
one-dimensional thin film model, we formulate a non-local variational problem
whose minimizers are given by one-dimensional N\'eel wall profiles. We prove
existence, uniqueness (up to translations and reflections), regularity, strict
monotonicity and the precise asymptotics of the decay of the minimizers in the
considered variational problem.
