In this paper we show the existence of two principal eigenvalues associated
to general non-convex fully nonlinear elliptic operators with Neumann boundary
conditions in a bounded $C^2$ domain. We study these objects and we establish
some of their basic properties. Finally, Lipschitz regularity, uniqueness and
existence results for the solution of the Neumann problem are given.
