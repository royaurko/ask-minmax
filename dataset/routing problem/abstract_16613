We give algorithms with constant-factor performance guarantees for several
capacity and throughput problems in the SINR model. The algorithms are all
based on a novel LP formulation for capacity problems. First, we give a new
constant-factor approximation algorithm for selecting the maximum subset of
links that can be scheduled simultaneously, under any non-decreasing and
sublinear power assignment. For the case of uniform power, we extend this to
the case of variable QoS requirements and link-dependent noise terms. Second,
we approximate a problem related to cognitive radio: find a maximum set of
links that can be simultaneously scheduled without affecting a given set of
previously assigned links. Finally, we obtain constant-factor approximation of
weighted capacity under linear power assignment.
