The supersymmetric ``shining'' of free massive chiral superfields in extra
dimensions from a distant source brane can trigger exponentially small
supersymmetry breaking on our brane of order e^{-2 pi R}, where R is the radius
of the extra dimensions. This supersymmetry breaking can be transmitted to the
superpartners in a number of ways, for instance by gravity or via the standard
model gauge interactions. The radius R can easily be stabilized at a size O(10)
larger that the fundamental scale. The models are extremely simple, relying
only on free, classical bulk dynamics to solve the hierarchy problem.
