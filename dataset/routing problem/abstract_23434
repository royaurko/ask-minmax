The cosmological moduli problem for relatively heavy moduli fields is
reinvestigated. For this purpose we examine the decay of a modulus field at a
quantitative level. The modulus dominantly decays into gauge bosons and
gauginos, provided that the couplings among them are not suppressed in the
gauge kinetic function. Remarkably the modulus decay into a gravitino pair is
unsuppressed generically, with a typical branching ratio of order 0.01. Such a
large gravitino yield after the modulus decay causes cosmological difficulties.
The constraint from the big-bang nucleosynthesis pushes up the gravitino mass
above 10^5 GeV. Furthermore to avoid the over-abundance of the stable
neutralino lightest superparticles (LSPs), the gravitino must weigh more than
about 10^6 GeV for the wino-like LSP, and even more for other neutralino LSPs.
This poses a stringent constraint on model building of low-energy
supersymmetry.
