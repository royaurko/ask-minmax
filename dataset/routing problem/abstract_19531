Cosmological N-body simulations with scale-invariant initial perturbations
show too many virialized objects of dwarf-galaxy masses in a typical galactic
halo in contradiction to observation and stability of galactic discs. We
present a model of double hybrid inflation which predicts density fluctuations
with a small-scale cutoff to account for the absence of these objects in
observations.
