A general view is presented on the problem of propagation of ultra
high-energy cosmic rays through the intergalactic and galactic magnetic fields.
Especial emphasis is given to the possibility of correlating the present events
with potential sources face to the uncertainties in the intervening magnetic
fields. Given high enough statistics, the latter problem can be transformed
into a powerful tool for the study of cosmic magnetic fields. Finally, the
three pairs of events pointed out by the AGASA collaboration as a possible
evidence for clustering are analyzed.
