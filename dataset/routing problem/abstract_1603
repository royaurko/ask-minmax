While obviously having a common root, solar and planetary dynamo theory have
taken increasingly divergent routes in the last two or three decades, and there
are probably few experts now who can claim to be equally versed in both.
Characteristically, even in the fine and comprehensive book "The magnetic
Universe" (Rudiger & Hollerbach 2004), the chapters on planets and on the Sun
were written by different contributors. Separate reviews written on the two topics
include Petrovay (2000}, Charbonneau (2005), Choudhuri (2008) on the solar
dynamo and Glatzmaier (2002), Stevenson (2003) on the planetary dynamo. In the
following I will try to make a systematic comparison between solar and
planetary dynamos, presenting analogies and differences, and highlighting some
interesting recent results.
