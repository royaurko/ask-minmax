We introduce complex intersection bodies and show that their properties and
applications are similar to those of their real counterparts. In particular, we
generalize Busemann's theorem to the complex case by proving that complex
intersection bodies of symmetric complex convex bodies are also convex. Other
results include stability in the complex Busemann-Petty problem for arbitrary
measures and the corresponding hyperplane inequality for measures of complex
intersection bodies.
