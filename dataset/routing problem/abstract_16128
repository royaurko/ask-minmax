We study the Dirichlet problem for subelliptic partial differential equations
of Monge-Ampere type involving the derivates with respect to a family X of
vector fields of Carnot type. The main result is a comparison principle among
viscosity subsolutions, convex with respect to X, and viscosity supersolutions
(in a weaker sense than usual), which implies the uniqueness of solution to the
Dirichlet problem. Its assumptions include the equation of prescribed
horizontal Gauss curvature in Carnot groups. By Perron method we also prove the
existence of a solution either under a growth condition of the nonlinearity
with respect to the gradient of the solution, or assuming the existence of a
subsolution attaining continuously the boundary data, therefore generalizing
some classical result for Euclidean Monge-Ampere equations.
