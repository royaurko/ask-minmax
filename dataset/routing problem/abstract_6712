Mapping workflow applications onto parallel platforms is a challenging
problem, even for simple application patterns such as pipeline graphs. Several
antagonist criteria should be optimized, such as throughput and latency (or a
combination). In this paper, we study the complexity of the bi-criteria mapping
problem for pipeline graphs on communication homogeneous platforms. In
particular, we assess the complexity of the well-known chains-to-chains problem
for different-speed processors, which turns out to be NP-hard. We provide
several efficient polynomial bi-criteria heuristics, and their relative
performance is evaluated through extensive simulations.
