The primal problem of multinomial likelihood maximization restricted to a
convex closed subset of the probability simplex is studied. Contrary to widely
held belief, a solution of this problem may assign a positive mass to an
outcome with zero count. Related flaws in the simplified Lagrange and Fenchel
dual problems, which arise because the recession directions are ignored, are
identified and corrected.
  A solution of the primal problem can be obtained by the PP (perturbed primal)
algorithm, that is, as the limit of a sequence of solutions of perturbed primal
problems. The PP algorithm may be implemented by the simplified Fenchel dual.
  The results permit us to specify linear sets and data such that the empirical
likelihood-maximizing distribution exists and is the same as the multinomial
likelihood-maximizing distribution. The multinomial likelihood ratio reaches,
in general, a different conclusion than the empirical likelihood ratio.
  Implications for minimum discrimination information, compositional data
analysis, Lindsay geometry, bootstrap with auxiliary information, and Lagrange
multiplier tests are discussed.
