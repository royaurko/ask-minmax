We study the problem of generating a sample from the stationary distribution
of a Markov chain, given a method to simulate the chain. We give an
approximation algorithm for the case of a random walk on a regular graph with n
vertices that runs in expected time O^*(\sqrt{n} x L^2-mixing time). This is
close to the best possible, since \sqrt{n} is a lower bound on the worst-case
expected running time of any algorithm.
