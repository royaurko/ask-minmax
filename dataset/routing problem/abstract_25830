We study the Anderson localization in systems, in which transport channels
with rather different properties are coupled together. This problem arises
naturally in systems of hybrid particles, such as exciton-polaritons, where it
is not obvious which transport channel dominates the coupled system. Here we
address the question of whether the coupling between a strongly and a weakly
disordered channel will result in localized (insulating) or delocalized
(metallic) behavior. Complementing an earlier study in 1D [H. Y. Xie, V. E.
Kravtsov, and M. M\"uller, Phys. Rev. B \textbf{86} 014205 (2012)], the problem
is solved here on a bilayer Bethe lattice with parametrically different
parameters. The comparison with the analytical solution in 1D shows that
dimensionality plays a crucial role. In D=1 localization is in general
dominated by the dirtier channel, which sets the backscattering rate. In
contrast, on the Bethe lattice a delocalized channel remains almost always
delocalized, even when coupled to strongly localized channels. We conjecture
that this phenomenology holds true for finite dimensions $D>2$ as well.
Possible implications for interacting many-body systems are discussed.
