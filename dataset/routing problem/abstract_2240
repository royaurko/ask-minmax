Optical transport represents a natural route towards fast communications, and
it is currently used in large scale data transfer. The progressive
miniaturization of devices for information processing calls for the microscopic
tailoring of light transport and confinement at length scales appropriate for
the upcoming technologies. With this goal in mind, we present a theoretical
analysis of a one-dimensional Fabry-Perot interferometer built with two highly
saturable nonlinear mirrors: a pair of two-level systems. Our approach captures
non-linear and non-reciprocal effects of light transport that were not reported
previously. Remarkably, we show that such an elementary device can operate as a
microscopic integrated optical rectifier.
