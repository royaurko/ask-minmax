The goal of this paper is to propose and test a new memetic algorithm for the
capacitated vehicle routing problem in parallel computing environment. In this
paper we consider simple variation of vehicle routing problem in which the only
parameter is the capacity of the vehicle and each client only needs one
package. We present simple reduction to prove the existence of polynomial-time
algorithm for capacity 2. We analyze the efficiency of the algorithm using
hierarchical Parallel Random Access Machine (PRAM) model and run experiments
with code written in CUDA (for capacities larger than 2).
