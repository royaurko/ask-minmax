The internal space for a molecule, atom, or other n-body system can be
conveniently parameterised by 3n-9 kinematic angles and three kinematic
invariants. For a fixed set of kinematic invariants, the kinematic angles
parameterise a subspace, called a kinematic orbit, of the n-body internal
space. Building on an earlier analysis of the three- and four-body problems, we
derive the form of these kinematic orbits (that is, their topology) for the
general n-body problem. The case n=5 is studied in detail, along with the
previously studied cases n=3,4.
