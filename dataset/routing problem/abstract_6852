We give logarithmic lower bounds for the approximability of the Minimum
Dominating Set problem in connected (alpha,beta)-Power Law Graphs. We give also
a best up to now upper approximation bound on the problem for the case of the
parameters beta>2. We develop also a new functional method for proving lower
approximation bounds and display a sharp phase transition between
approximability and inapproximability of the underlying problem. This method
could also be of independent interest.
