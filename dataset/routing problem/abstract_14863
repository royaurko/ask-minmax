The popular criteria of optimality for quickest change detection procedures
are the Lorden criterion, the Shiryaev-Roberts-Pollak criterion, and the
Bayesian criterion. In this paper a robust version of these quickest change
detection problems is considered when the pre-change and post-change
distributions are not known exactly but belong to known uncertainty classes of
distributions. For uncertainty classes that satisfy a specific condition, it is
shown that one can identify least favorable distributions (LFDs) from the
uncertainty classes, such that the detection rule designed for the LFDs is
optimal for the robust problem in a minimax sense. The condition is similar to
that required for the identification of LFDs for the robust hypothesis testing
problem originally studied by Huber. An upper bound on the delay incurred by
the robust test is also obtained in the asymptotic setting under the Lorden
criterion of optimality. This bound quantifies the delay penalty incurred to
guarantee robustness. When the LFDs can be identified, the proposed test is
easier to implement than the CUSUM test based on the Generalized Likelihood
Ratio (GLR) statistic which is a popular approach for such robust change
detection problems. The proposed test is also shown to give better performance
than the GLR test in simulations for some parameter values.
