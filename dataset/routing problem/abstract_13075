In this paper, an efficient algorithm to find the center of the biggest
circle inscribed in a given polygon is described. This work was inspired by the
publication of Daniel Garcia-Castellanos & Umberto Lombardo and their algorithm
used to find a landmass' poles of inaccessibility. Two more efficient
algorithms were found, one of them only applicable when the problem can be
described as a linear problem, like in the case of a convex polygon.
