Recently a class of supersymmetric gauge theories have been successfully
implemented on the lattice. However, there has been an ongoing debate on
whether lattice versions of some of these theories suffer from a sign problem,
with independent simulations for the ${\cal N} = (2, 2)$ supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theories in two dimensions yielding seemingly contradictory results.
Here, we address this issue from an interesting theoretical point of view. We
conjecture that the sign problem observed in some of the simulations is related
to the so called Neuberger 0/0 problem, which arises in ordinary
non-supersymmetric lattice gauge theories, and prevents the realization of
Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin symmetry on the lattice. After discussing why we
expect a sign problem in certain classes of supersymmetric lattice gauge
theories far from the continuum limit, we argue that these problems can be
evaded by use of a non-compact parametrization of the gauge link fields.
