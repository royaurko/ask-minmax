In this paper we propose a method to enhance the life time as well as improve
the performance of the mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). Since MANET consists of
devices that run on batteries, having limited amount of energy and due to the
self-configuring and dynamic change of topology, all operations are performed
by the node itself.
