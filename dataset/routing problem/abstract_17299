In this manuscript, we analyze the sparse signal recovery (compressive
sensing) problem from the perspective of convex optimization by stochastic
proximal gradient descent. This view allows us to significantly simplify the
recovery analysis of compressive sensing. More importantly, it leads to an
efficient optimization algorithm for solving the regularized optimization
problem related to the sparse recovery problem. Compared to the existing
approaches, there are two advantages of the proposed algorithm. First, it
enjoys a geometric convergence rate and therefore is computationally efficient.
Second, it guarantees that the support set of any intermediate solution
generated by the proposed algorithm is concentrated on the support set of the
optimal solution.
