In this paper, we present a 4-state solution to the Firing Squad
Synchronization Problem (FSSP) based on hybrid rule 60/102 Cellular
Automata(CA). This solution solves the problem on the line of length 2^n with
two generals. Previous work on FSSP for 4-state systems focused mostly on
linear cellular automata, where synchronizes an infinite number of lines but
not all possible lines. We give time-optimal solutions to synchronize an
infinite number of lines by rule 60 and rule 102 respectively, and construct a
hybrid rule 60 and 102 states transition table. Compared to the known solutions
of cellular automata, the hybrid CA way is simpler and faster, the minimal time
is (n-1) step.
