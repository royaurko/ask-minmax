We revisit the cell-based smoothed finite element method (SFEM) for
quadrilateral elements and extend it to arbitrary polygons and polyhedrons in
2D and 3D, respectively. We highlight the similarity between the SFEM and the
virtual element method (VEM). Based on the VEM, we propose a new stabilization
approach to the SFEM when applied to arbitrary polygons and polyhedrons. The
accuracy and the convergence properties of the SFEM are studied with a few
benchmark problems in 2D and 3D linear elasticity. Later, the SFEM is combined
with the scaled boundary finite element method to problems involving
singularity within the framework of the linear elastic fracture mechanics in
2D.
