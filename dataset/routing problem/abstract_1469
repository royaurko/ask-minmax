We present the theory of the effect of thermal fluctuations on commensurate
"p x p" density wave ordering on the square lattice (p >= 3, integer). For the
case in which this order is lost by a second order transition, we argue that
the adjacent state is generically an incommensurate striped state, with
commensurate p-periodic long range order along one direction, and
incommensurate quasi-long-range order along the orthogonal direction. We also
present the routes by which the fully disordered high temperature state can be
reached. For p=4, and at special commensurate densities, the "4 x 4"
commensurate state can melt directly into the disordered state via a self-dual
critical point with non-universal exponents.
