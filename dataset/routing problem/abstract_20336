We construct the Darboux-Backlund transformation for the sigma model
describing static configurations of the 2-dimensional classical continuum
Heisenberg chain. The transformation is characterized by a non-trivial
normalization matrix depending on the background solution. In order to obtain
the transformation we use a new, more general, spectral problem.
