The problem of maintaining a wireless communication link between a fixed base
station and an autonomous agent by means of a team of mobile robots is
addressed in this work. Such problem can be of interest for search and rescue
missions in post disaster scenario where the autonomous agent can be used for
remote monitoring and first hand knowledge of the aftermath, while the mobile
robots can be used to provide the agent the possibility to dynamically send its
collected information to an external base station. To study the problem, a
distributed multi-robot system with wifi communication capabilities has been
developed and used to implement a Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANET) to guarantee
the required multi-hop communication. None of the robots of the team possess
the knowledge of agent's movement, neither they hold a pre-assigned position in
the ad-hoc network but they adapt with respect to the dynamic environmental
situations. This adaptation only requires the robots to have the knowledge of
their position and the possibility to exchange such information with their
one-hop neighbours. Robots' motion is achieved by implementing a behavioural
control, namely the Null-Space based Behavioural control, embedding the
collective mission to achieve the required self-configuration. Validation of
the approach is performed by means of demanding experimental tests involving
five ground mobile robots capable of self localization and dynamic obstacle
avoidance.
