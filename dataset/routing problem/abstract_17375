A cosmological constant fits all current dark energy data, but requires two
extreme fine tunings, both of which are currently explained by anthropic
arguments. Here we discuss anti-anthropic solutions to one of these problems:
the cosmic coincidence problem- that today the dark energy density is nearly
equal to the matter density. We replace the ensemble of Universes used in the
anthropic solution with an ensemble of tracking scalar fields that do not
require fine-tuning. This not only does away with the coincidence problem, but
also allows for a Universe that has a very different future than the one
currently predicted by a cosmological constant. These models also allow for
transient periods of significant scalar field energy (SSFE) over the history of
the Universe that can give very different observational signatures as compared
with a cosmological constant, and so can be confirmed or disproved in current
and upcoming experiments.
