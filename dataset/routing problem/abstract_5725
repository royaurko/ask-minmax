In the present article, a modified Cauchy problem (problem C) for the
hyperbolic equation of the third order with the data on the equation's
coefficients singularity plane is solved by Riemann method. The special class
in which the solution of the problem C has more simple appearance is introduced
and the area of values of the parameter p entering into the equation is
considerably expanded. In the special class the mixed problem, which decision
was been reduced to the two-dimensional Volterra's integral equations of the
first order with uncurtailed operators, is considered. Authors found the unique
solution of these equations at various values of the parameter p.
