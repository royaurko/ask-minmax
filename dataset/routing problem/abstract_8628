This paper addresses to the problem of ?nding the (minimum) Euclidean
distance between two linear varieties. This problem is, usually, solved
minimising a target function. We propose a novel approach: to use the
Moore-Penrose generalised inverse of a matrix in order to ?nd the Euclidean
distance and, at the same time, going further by exhibiting the best
approximation pair of points.
