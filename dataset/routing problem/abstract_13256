In this paper, we are interested in the Cauchy problem for the Boltzmann-BGK
model for a general class of collision frequencies. We prove that the
Boltzmann-BGK model linearized around a global Maxwellian admits a unique
global smooth solution if the initial perturbation is sufficiently small in a
high order energy norm. We also establish an asymptotic decay estimate and
uniform $L^2$-stability for nonlinear perturbations.
