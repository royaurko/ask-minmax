The GRAPH MOTIF problem asks whether a given multiset of colors appears on a
connected subgraph of a vertex-colored graph. The fastest known parameterized
algorithm for this problem is based on a reduction to the $k$-Multilinear
Detection (k-MlD) problem: the detection of multilinear terms of total degree k
in polynomials presented as circuits. We revisit k-MLD and define k-CMLD, a
constrained version of it which reflects GRAPH MOTIF more faithfully. We then
give a fast algorithm for k-CMLD. As a result we obtain faster parameterized
algorithms for GRAPH MOTIF and variants of it.
