In this paper, we discuss the uniqueness in an integral geometry problem in a
strongly convex domain. Our problem is related to the problem of finding a
Riemannian metric by the distances between all pairs of the boundary points.
For the proof, the problem is reduced to an inverse source problem for a
kinetic equation on a Riemannian manifold and then the uniqueness theorem is
proved in semi-geodesic coordinates by using the tools of Fourier analysis.
