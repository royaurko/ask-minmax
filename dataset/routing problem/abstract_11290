We unravel the structure of the spectrum of the anomalous dimensions of the
quark-gluon twist-3 operators which are responsible for the multiparton
correlations in hadrons and enter as a leading contribution to several physical
cross sections. The method of analysis is bases on the recent finding of a
non-trivial integral of motion for the corresponding Hamiltonian problem in
multicolour limit which results into exact integrability of the three-particle
system. Quasiclassical expansion is used for solving the problem. We address
the chiral-odd sector as a case of study.
