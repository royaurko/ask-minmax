The sign problem is a major obstacle to our understanding of the phase
diagram of QCD at finite baryon density. Several numerical methods have been
proposed to tackle this problem, but a full solution to the sign problem is
still elusive. Motivated by this problem and by recent advances in diagrammatic
Monte Carlo methods, we find a new exact representation of the partition
function of pure lattice gauge theory that contains no link variables. This
approach can be easily extended to include staggered fermions, and results in a
diagrammatic representation of fermionic states as arrangements of monomers,
dimers, and fermionic loops saturating the spacetime lattice. Our
representations are exact for any value of the lattice coupling, and extend
previous representations that are only valid in the strong coupling limit and
at $O(\beta)$. As a concrete example, we construct a monomer-dimer-loop
representation of compact lattice QED.
