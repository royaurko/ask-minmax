Link prediction is an open problem in the complex network, which attracts
much research interest currently. However, little attention has been paid to
the relation between network structure and the performance of prediction
methods. In order to fill this vital gap, we try to understand how the network
structure affects the performance of link prediction methods in the view of
clustering. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks show that
as the clustering grows, the precision of these methods could be improved
remarkably, while for the sparse and weakly clustered network, they perform
poorly. We explain this through the distinguishment caused by increased
clustering between the score distribution of positive and negative instances.
Our finding also sheds light on the problem of how to select appropriate
approaches for different networks with various densities and clusterings.
