The problem of calculating the period of second order nonlinear autonomous
oscillators is formulated as an eigenvalue problem. We show that the period can
be obtained from two integral variational principles dual to each other. Upper
and lower bounds on the period can be obtained to any desired degree of
accuracy. The results are illustrated by an application to the Duffing
equation.
