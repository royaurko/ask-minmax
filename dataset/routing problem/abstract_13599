We provide a theory to establish the existence of nonzero solutions of
perturbed Hammerstein integral equations with deviated arguments, being our
main ingredient the theory of fixed point index. Our approach is fairly general
and covers a variety of cases. We apply our results to a periodic boundary
value problem with reflections and to a thermostat problem. In the case of
reflections we also discuss the optimality of some constants that occur in our
theory. Some examples are presented to illustrate the theory.
