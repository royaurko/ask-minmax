Graphene ranks highly as a possible material for future high-speed and
flexible electronics. Current fabrication routes, which rely on metal
substrates, require post synthesis transfer of the graphene onto a Si wafer or
in the case of epitaxial growth on SiC, temperatures above 1000 {\deg}C are
required. Both the handling difficulty and high temperatures are not best
suited to present day silicon technology. We report a facile chemical vapor
deposition approach in which nano-graphene and few layer graphene is directly
formed over magnesium oxide and can be achieved at temperatures as low as 325
{\deg}C.
