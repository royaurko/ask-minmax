In this paper, we propose a preconditioner based on the shift-splitting
method for generalized saddle point problems with nonsymmetric positive
definite (1,1)-block and symmetric positive semidefinite $(2,2)$-block. The
proposed preconditioner is obtained from an basic iterative method which is
unconditionally convergent. We also present a relaxed version of the proposed
method. Some numerical experiments are presented to show the effectiveness of
the method.
