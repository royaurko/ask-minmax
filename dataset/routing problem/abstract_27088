We find that minimizing the number of fine tuning relations in
non-supersymmetric models can determine the scales at which some gauge
symmetries beyond the standard model must break. We show that $SU(2)_R$ and
$B-L$ gauge symmetries of the minimal left-right symmetric model must break at
a scale $10^{15} GeV$ or higher, determined by the hierarchy problem and small
ratios of quark masses, if parameters that break chiral or $\mu$-symmetries
(and therefore can be naturally small), are not fine-tuned. This provides the
$raison \ d'\hat{e}tre$ for the seesaw scale $\sim 10^{15}GeV$ indicated by
neutrino experiments. Small ratios of fermion (quark) masses, which are natural
in the standard model due to approximate chiral symmetry, will have to be fine
tuned in minimal left right model if $SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ breaks at a
lower scale.
