We study the large N anomalous dimensions of operators in a Leigh-Strassler
deformation of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. The operators that we study have a
bare dimension of order N (so that the large N limit is not captured by planar
diagrams) and are AdS/CFT dual to giant gravitons. The diagonalization of the
dilatation operator factorizes into two problems. One of these problems is
solved using a double coset ansatz. The second problem is equivalent to a set
of decoupled harmonic oscillators.
