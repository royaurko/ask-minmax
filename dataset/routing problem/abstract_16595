The dicycle transversal number t(D) of a digraph D is the minimum size of a
dicycle transversal of D, i. e. a set T of vertices of D such that D-T is
acyclic. We study the following problem: Given a digraph D, decide if there is
a dicycle B in D and a cycle C in the underlying undirected graph of D such
such that B,C are disjoint. It is known that there is a polynomial time
algorithm for this problem when restricted to strongly connected graphs, which
actually finds B,C if they exist. We generalize this to any class of digraphs D
with either t(D) not equal to 1 or t(D)=1 and a bounded number of dicycle
transversals, and show that the problem is NP-complete for a special class of
digraphs D with t(D)=1 and, hence, in general.
