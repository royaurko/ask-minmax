Recent experiments on 2H-TaSe$_2$ contradict the long-held view of the charge
density wave arising from a nested band structure. An intrinsically strong
coupling view, involving a charge density wave state arising as a Bose
condensation of preformed excitons emerges as an attractive, albeit scantily
investigated alternative. Using local density approximation plus multiorbital
dynamic mean-field theory, we show that this scenario agrees with a variety of
normal state data for 2H-TaSe$_{2}$. Based thereupon, the ordered states in a
subset of dichalcogenides should be viewed as instabilities of a correlated,
preformed excitonic liquid.
