Considering the model heat conduction problem in the setting of Grad's moment
equations, we demonstrate a crossover in the structure of minima of the entropy
production within the boundary layer. Based on this observation, we formulate
and compare variation principles for solving the problem of boundary conditions
in nonequilibrium thermodynamics.
