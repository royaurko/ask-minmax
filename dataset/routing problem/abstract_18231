We continue the analysis of the two-phase free boundary problems initiated in
\cite{DK}, where we studied the linear growth of minimizers in a Bernoulli type
free boundary problem at the non-flat points and the related regularity of free
boundary. There, we also defined the functional
$$\phi_p(r,u,x_0)=\frac1{r^4}\int_{B_r(x_0)}\frac{|\nabla
u^+(x)|^p}{|x-x_0|^{N-2}}dx\int_{B_r(x_0)}\frac{|\nabla
u^-(x)|^p}{|x-x_0|^{N-2}}dx$$ where $x_0$ is a free boundary point, i.e.
$x_0\in\partial\{u>0\}$ and $u$ is a minimizer of the functional
$$J(u):=\int_{\Omega}|\nabla u|^p +\lambda_+^p\,\chi_{\{u>0\}}
+\lambda_-^p\,\chi_{\{u\le 0\}}, $$ for some bounded smooth domain
$\Omega\subset {\mathbb R}^N$ and positive constants $\lambda_\pm$ with
$\Lambda:=\lambda_+^p-\lambda^p_->0$.
  Here we show the discrete monotonicity of $\phi_p(r,u,x_0)$ in two spatial
dimensions at non-flat points, when $p$ is sufficiently close to 2, and then
establish the linear growth. A new feature of our approach is the anisotropic
scaling argument discussed in Section 4.
