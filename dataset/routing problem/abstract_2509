In multi-hop wireless systems, the need for cooperation among nodes to relay
each other's packets exposes them to a wide range of security attacks. A
particularly devastating attack is the wormhole attack, where a malicious node
records control traffic at one location and tunnels it to another compromised
node, possibly far away, which replays it locally. Routing security in ad hoc
networks is often equated with strong and feasible node authentication and
lightweight cryptography. Unfortunately, the wormhole attack can hardly be
defeated by crypto graphical measures, as wormhole attackers do not create
separate packets. They simply replay packets already existing on the network,
which pass the cryptographic checks. Existing works on wormhole detection have
often focused on detection using specialized hardware, such as directional
antennas, etc. In this paper, we present a cluster based counter-measure for
the wormhole attack, that alleviates these drawbacks and efficiently mitigates
the wormhole attack in MANET. Simulation results on MATLab exhibit the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in detecting wormhole attacks.
