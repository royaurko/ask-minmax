In this paper, we propose a strategy to determine the Dirichlet-to-Neumann
(DtN) operator for infinite, lossy and locally perturbed hexagonal periodic
media. We obtain a factorization of this operator involving two non local
operators. The first one is a DtN type operator and corresponds to a half-space
problem. The second one is a Dirichlet-to-Dirichlet (DtD) type operator related
to the symmetry properties of the problem. The half-space DtN operator is
characterized via Floquet-Bloch transform, a family of elementary strip
problems and a family of stationary Riccati equations. The DtD operator is the
solution of an affine operator valued equation which can be reformulated as a
non standard integral equation.
