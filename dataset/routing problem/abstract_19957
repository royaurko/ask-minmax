The particle detector model consisting of a harmonic oscillator coupled to a
scalar field in $1+1$ dimensions is investigated in the inertial case. The same
approach is then used in the accelerating case. The absence of radiation from a
uniformly accelerated detector in a stationnary state is discussed and
clarified.
