In this paper, we prove the asymptotic stability of nonlinear Schr\"odiger
equation on graphs, which partially solves an open problem in D. Noja
\cite{DN}. The essential ingredient of our proof is the dispersive estimate for
the linearized around the soliton with Kirchhoff boundary condition. In order
to obtain the dispersive estimates, we use the Born's series technique and
scattering theory for the linearized operator.
