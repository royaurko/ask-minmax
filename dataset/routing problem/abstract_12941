We briefly introduce the memory based approaches to emulate machine
intelligence in VLSI hardware, describing the challenges and advantages.
Implementation of artificial intelligence techniques in VLSI hardware is a
practical and difficult problem. Deep architectures, hierarchical temporal
memories and memory networks are some of the contemporary approaches in this
area of research. The techniques attempt to emulate low level intelligence
tasks and aim at providing scalable solutions to high level intelligence
problems such as sparse coding and contextual processing.
