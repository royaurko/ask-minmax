The nondegenerate Nevanlinna-Pick-Carath\'eodory-Fejer interpolation problem
with finitely many interpolation conditions always has infinitely many
solutions in a generalized Schur class $\cS_\kappa$ for every $\kappa\ge
\kappa_{\rm min}$ where the integer $\kappa_{\rm min}$ equals the number of
negative eigenvalues of the Pick matrix associated to the problem and
completely determined by interpolation data. A linear fractional description of
all $\cS_{\kappa_{\rm min}}$ solutions of the (nondegenerate) problem is well
known. In this paper, we present a similar result for an arbitrary $\kappa\ge
\kappa_{\rm min}$.
