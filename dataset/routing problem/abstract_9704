We prove a new global stability estimate for the Gel'fand-Calder\'on inverse
problem on a two-dimensional bounded domain or, more precisely, the inverse
boundary value problem for the equation $-\Delta \psi + v\, \psi = 0$ on $D$,
where $v$ is a smooth real-valued potential of conductivity type defined on a
bounded planar domain $D$. The principal feature of this estimate is that it
shows that the more a potential is smooth, the more its reconstruction is
stable, and the stability varies exponentially with respect to the smoothness
(in a sense to be made precise). As a corollary we obtain a similar estimate
for the Calder\'on problem for the electrical impedance tomography.
