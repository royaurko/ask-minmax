Given an integer $k \geq 2$, we consider the problem of computing the
smallest real number $t(k)$ such that for each set $P$ of points in the plane,
there exists a $t(k)$-spanner for $P$ that has chromatic number at most $k$. We
prove that $t(2) = 3$, $t(3) = 2$, $t(4) = \sqrt{2}$, and give upper and lower
bounds on $t(k)$ for $k>4$. We also show that for any $\epsilon >0$, there
exists a $(1+\epsilon)t(k)$-spanner for $P$ that has $O(|P|)$ edges and
chromatic number at most $k$. Finally, we consider an on-line variant of the
problem where the points of $P$ are given one after another, and the color of a
point must be assigned at the moment the point is given. In this setting, we
prove that $t(2) = 3$, $t(3) = 1+ \sqrt{3}$, $t(4) = 1+ \sqrt{2}$, and give
upper and lower bounds on $t(k)$ for $k>4$.
