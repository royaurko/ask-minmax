In a series of papers N. Ma and P. Ishwar (2011-13) considered a range of
distributed source coding problems that arise in the context of iterative
computation of functions, characterizing the region of achievable communication
rates. We consider the problems of interactive computation of functions by two
terminals and interactive computation in a collocated network, showing that the
rate regions for both these problems can be achieved using several rounds of
polar-coded transmissions.
