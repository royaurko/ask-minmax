We propose a discontinuous Galerkin method for convection-subdiffusion
equations with a fractional operator of order $\alpha (1<\alpha<2)$ defined
through the fractional Laplacian. The fractional operator of order $\alpha$ is
expressed as a composite of first order derivatives and fractional integrals of
order $2-\alpha$, and the fractional convection-diffusion problem is expressed
as a system of low order differential/integral equations and a local
discontinuous Galerkin method scheme is derived for the equations. We prove
stability and optimal order of convergence O($h^{k+1}$) for subdiffusion, and
an order of convergence of ${\cal O}(h^{k+1/2})$ is established for the general
fractional convection-diffusion problem. The analysis is confirmed by numerical
examples.
