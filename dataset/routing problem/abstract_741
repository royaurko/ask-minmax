At non-equilibrium phase transitions into absorbing (trapped) states, it is
well known that the directed percolation (DP) critical scaling is shared by two
classes of models with a single (S) absorbing state and with infinitely many
(IM) absorbing states. We study the crossover behavior in one dimension,
arising from a considerable reduction of the number of absorbing states
(typically from the IM-type to the S-type DP models), by following two
different (excitatory or inhibitory) routes which make the auxiliary field
density abruptly jump at the crossover. Along the excitatory route, the system
becomes overly activated even for an infinitesimal perturbation and its
crossover becomes discontinuous. Along the inhibitory route, we find continuous
crossover with the universal crossover exponent $\phi\simeq 1.78(6)$, which is
argued to be equal to $\nu_\|$, the relaxation time exponent of the DP
universality class on a general footing. This conjecture is also confirmed in
the case of the directed Ising (parity-conserving) class. Finally, we discuss
the effect of diffusion to the IM-type models and suggest an argument why
diffusive models with some hybrid-type reactions should belong to the DP class.
