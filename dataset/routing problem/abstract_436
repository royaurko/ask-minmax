Because of DNA appealing features as perfect material, including minuscule
size, defined structural repeat and rigidity, programmable DNA-mediated
processing is a promising computing paradigm, which employs DNAs as information
storing and processing substrates to tackle the computational problems. The
massive parallelism of DNA hybridization exhibits transcendent potential to
improve multitasking capabilities and yield a tremendous speed-up over the
conventional electronic processors with stepwise signal cascade. As an example
of multitasking capability, we present an in vitro programmable DNA-mediated
optimal route planning processor as a functional unit embedded in contemporary
navigation systems. The novel programmable DNA-mediated processor has several
advantages over the existing silicon-mediated methods, such as conducting
massive data storage and simultaneous processing via much fewer materials than
conventional silicon devices.
