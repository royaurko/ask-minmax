In this paper we consider the problem $$(P)\qquad \{{array}{rclll} u_t-\D
u^m&=&|\n u|^q +\,f(x,t),&\quad u\ge 0 \hbox{in} \Omega_T\equiv \Omega\times
(0,T), u(x,t)&=&0 &\quad \hbox{on} \partial\Omega\times (0,T)
u(x,0)&=&u_0(x),&\quad x\in \Omega {array}. $$ where $\O\subset \ren$, $N\ge
2$, is a bounded regular domain, $1<q\le 2$, and $f\ge 0$, $u_0\ge 0$ are in a
suitable class of functions.
  We obtain some results for elliptic-parabolic problems with measure data
related to problem $(P)$ that we use to study the existence of solutions to
problem $(P)$ according with the values of the parameters $q$ and $m$.
