We propose a concept of magnetic logic circuits engineering, which takes an
advantage of magnetization as a computational state variable and exploits spin
waves for information transmission. The circuits consist of magneto-electric
cells connected via spin wave buses. We present the result of numerical
modeling showing the magneto-electric cell switching as a function of the
amplitude as well as the phase of the spin wave. The phase-dependent switching
makes it possible to engineer logic gates by exploiting spin wave buses as
passive logic elements providing a certain phase-shift to the propagating spin
waves. We present a library of logic gates consisting of magneto-electric cells
and spin wave buses providing 0 or p phase shifts. The utilization of phases in
addition to amplitudes is a powerful tool which let us construct logic circuits
with a fewer number of elements than required for CMOS technology. As an
example, we present the design of the magnonic Full Adder Circuit comprising
only 5 magneto-electric cells. The proposed concept may provide a route to more
functional wave-based logic circuitry with capabilities far beyond the limits
of the traditional transistor-based approach.
