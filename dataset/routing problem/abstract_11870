Using measured instrumental response functions for data deconvolution is a
known source of uncertainty. This problem is revisited here with Bayesian data
analysis an Monte Carlo simulations. Noise correlation induced by the
convolution operator is identified as a major source of uncertainty which has
been neglected in previous treatments of this problem. Application to a
luminescence lifetime measurement setup shows that existing approximate
treatments are markedly defficient and that the correlation length of the noise
is directly related to the lifetime to be estimated. Simple counteractive
treatments are proposed to increase the accuracy of this procedure.
