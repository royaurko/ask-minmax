We solve the equivalence problem for the orthogonally separable webs on the
three-sphere under the action of the isometry group. This continues a classical
project initiated by Olevsky in which he solved the corresponding canonical
forms problem. The solution to the equivalence problem together with the
results by Olevsky forms a complete solution to the problem of orthogonal
separation of variables to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation defined on the
three-sphere via orthogonal separation of variables. It is based on invariant
properties of the characteristic Killing two-tensors in addition to properties
of the corresponding algebraic curvature tensor and the associated Ricci
tensor. The result is illustrated by a non-trivial application to a natural
Hamiltonian defined on the three-sphere.
