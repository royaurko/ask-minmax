In this paper we discuss our insights into several key problems in the
identification of the Red Rectangle Bands (RRBs). We have combined three
independent sets of observations in order to try to define the constraints
guiding the bands. We provide a summary of the general behavior of the bands
and review the evidence for a molecular origin of the bands. The extent,
composition, and possible absorption effects of the bands are discussed.
Comparison spectra of the strongest band obtained at three different spectral
resolutions suggests that an intrinsic line width of individual rotational
lines can be deduced. Spectroscopic models of several relatively simple
molecules were examined in order to investigate where the current data are
weak. Suggestions are made for future studies to enhance our understanding of
these enigmatic bands.
