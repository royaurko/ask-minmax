Noncommutative harmonic analysis is used to solve a nonparametric estimation
problem stated in terms of compound Poisson processes on compact Lie groups.
This problem of decompounding is a generalization of a similar classical
problem. The proposed solution is based on a char- acteristic function method.
The treated problem is important to recent models of the physical inverse
problem of multiple scattering.
