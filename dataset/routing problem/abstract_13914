Given any elliptic system with $t$-independent coefficients in the upper-half
space, we obtain representation and trace for the conormal gradient of
solutions in the natural classes for the boundary value problems of Dirichlet
and Neumann types with area integral control or non-tangential maximal control.
The trace spaces are obtained in a natural range of boundary spaces which is
parametrized by properties of some Hardy spaces. This implies a complete
picture of uniqueness vs solvability and well-posedness.
