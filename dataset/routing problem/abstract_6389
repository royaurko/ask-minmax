This project work report provides a full solution of simplified Navier Stokes
equations for The Incompressible Couette Problem. The well known analytical
solution to the problem of incompressible couette is compared with a numerical
solution. In that paper, I will provide a full solution with simple C code
instead of MatLab or Fortran codes, which are known. For discrete problem
formulation, implicit Crank-Nicolson method was used. Finally, the system of
equation (tridiagonal) is solved with both Thomas and simple Gauss Method.
Results of both methods are compared.
