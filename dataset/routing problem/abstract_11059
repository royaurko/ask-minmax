The classical Thomson problem of $n$ charged particles confined to the
surface of a sphere of radius $a$ is analyzed within the Darwin approximation
of electrodynamics. For $n<n_c(a)$ the ground state corresponds to a hexagonal
Wigner crystal with a number of topological defects. However, if $n>n_c(a)$ the
Wigner lattice is unstable with respect to small perturbations and the ground
state becomes spontaneously magnetized for finite $n$.
