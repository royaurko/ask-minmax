In this paper, we solve a problem posed by Rodica Simion regarding type B
Gram determinants. We present this in a fashion influenced by the work of
W.B.R.Lickorish on Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants of 3-manifolds. The
roots of the determinant were predicted by Dabkowski and Przytycki, and the
complete factorization was conjectured by Gefry Barad. We will give a detailed
history of this problem in a sequel paper in which we also plan to address
other related questions by Simion, and connect the problem to
Frenkel-Khovanov's work.
