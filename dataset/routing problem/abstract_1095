We study experimentally the interactions between normal solitons and tilted
beams in glass waveguide arrays. We find that as a tilted beam, traversing away
from a normally propagating soliton, coincides with the self-defocusing regime
of the array, it can be refocused and routed back into any of the intermediate
sites due to the interaction, as a function of the initial phase difference.
Numerically, distinct parameter regimes exhibiting this behavior of the
interaction are identified.
