After a brief introduction to the so-called flavour problem, we discuss the
role of rare K decays in probing the mechanism of quark-flavour mixing.
Particular attention is devoted to the formulation of the Minimal Flavour
Violation hypothesis, as a general and natural solution to the flavour problem,
and to the fundamental role of K -> pi nu nu-bar decays in testing this
scenario.
