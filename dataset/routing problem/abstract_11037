The problem of pseudo-gap formation in an electronic system, induced by the
fluctuations of the order parameter is revisited. We make the observation that
a large class of current theories are theoretically equivalent to averaging the
Free energy of the pseudo-gap system over a quenched-disordered distribution of
the order parameter. We examine the cases of both infinite and finite
correlation length, showing how the interplay of pseudo-gap formation and
superconductivity can be treated in this approach.
