The debts' clearing problem is about clearing all the debts in a group of $n$
entities (e.g. persons, companies) using a minimal number of money transaction
operations. In our previous works we studied the problem, gave a dynamic
programming solution solving it and proved that it is NP-hard. In this paper we
adapt the problem to dynamic graphs and give a data structure to solve it.
Based on this data structure we develop a new algorithm, that improves our
previous one for the static version of the problem.
