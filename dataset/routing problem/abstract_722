A Bus Route Model (BRM) can be defined on a one-dimensional lattice, where
buses are represented by "particles" that are driven forward from one site to
the next with each site representing a bus stop. We replace the random
sequential updating rules in an earlier BRM by parallel updating rules. In
order to elucidate the connection between the BRM with parallel updating
(BRMPU) and the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NaSch) model, we propose two alternative
extensions of the NaSch model with space-/time-dependent hopping rates.
Approximating the BRMPU as a generalization of the NaSch model, we calculate
analytically the steady-state distribution of the {\it time headways} (TH)
which are defined as the time intervals between the departures (or arrivals) of
two successive particles (i.e., buses) recorded by a detector placed at a fixed
site (i.e., bus stop) on the model route. We compare these TH distributions
with the corresponding results of our computer simulations of the BRMPU, as
well as with the data from the simulation of the two extended NaSch models. We
also investigate interesting kinetic properties exhibited by the BRMPU during
its time evolution from random initial states towards its steady-states.
