We consider the problem of reconstructing binary images from their horizontal
and vertical projections. We present a condition that the projections must
necessarily satisfy when there exist two disjoint reconstructions from those
projections. More generally, we derive an upper bound on the symmetric
difference of two reconstructions from the same projections. We also consider
two reconstructions from two different sets of projections and prove an upper
bound on the symmetric difference in this case.
