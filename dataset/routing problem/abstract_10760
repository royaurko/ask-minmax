Many maximum likelihood estimation problems are, in general, intractable
optimization problems. As a result, it is common to approximate the maximum
likelihood estimator (MLE) using convex relaxations. Semidefinite relaxations
are among the most popular. Sometimes, the relaxations turn out to be tight. In
this paper, we study such a phenomenon.
  The angular synchronization problem consists in estimating a collection of
$n$ phases, given noisy measurements of some of the pairwise relative phases.
The MLE for the angular synchronization problem is the solution of a (hard)
non-bipartite Grothendieck problem over the complex numbers. It is known that
its semidefinite relaxation enjoys worst-case approximation guarantees.
  In this paper, we consider a stochastic model on the input of that
semidefinite relaxation. We assume there is a planted signal (corresponding to
a ground truth set of phases) and the measurements are corrupted with random
noise. Even though the MLE does not coincide with the planted signal, we show
that the relaxation is, with high probability, tight. This holds even for high
levels of noise.
  This analysis explains, for the interesting case of angular synchronization,
a phenomenon which has been observed without explanation in many other
settings. Namely, the fact that even when exact recovery of the ground truth is
impossible, semidefinite relaxations for the MLE tend to be tight (in favorable
noise regimes).
