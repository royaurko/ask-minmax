This paper is concerned with the free boundary problem for the Navier Stokes
equations without surface tension in the $L_p$ in time and $L_q$ in space
setting with $2 < p < \infty$ and $N < q < \infty$. A local in time existence
theorem is proved in a uniform $W^{2-1/q}_q$ domain in the $N$-dimensional
Euclidean space ${\Bbb R}^N$ ($N \geq 2$) under the assumption that weak
Dirichlet-Neumann problem is uniquely solvable. Moreover, a global in time
existence theorem is proved for small initial data under the assumption that
$\Omega$ is bounded additionally. This was already proved by Solonnikov
\cite{Sol1} by using the continuation argument of local in time solutions which
are exponentially stable in the energy level under the assumption that the
initial data is orthogonal to the rigid motion.
  We also use the continuation argument and the same orthogonality for the
initial data. But, our argument about the continuation of local in time
solutions is based on some decay theorem for the linearized problem, which is a
different point than \cite{Sol1}.
