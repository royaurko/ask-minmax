An extensive survey of misinterpretations and misconceptions concerning
presentation of the hysteresis loop for ferromagnetic materials occurring in
undergraduate textbooks as well as in recent magnetism literature has been
carried out. This survey has also revealed a number of intricacies and
conceptual problems concerning the fundamental aspect of magnetism. This note
provides a critical analysis of these problems aimed at clarification of the
intricacies and preventing further proliferation of the confusion in question.
