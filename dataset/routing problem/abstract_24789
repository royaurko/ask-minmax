The fractional Laplacian can be obtained as a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map via an
extension problem to the upper half space. In this paper we prove the same type
of characterization for the fractional powers of second order partial
differential operators in some class. We also get a Poisson formula and a
system of Cauchy-Riemann equations for the extension. The method is applied to
the fractional harmonic oscillator $H^\sigma=(-\Delta+|x|^2)^\sigma$ to deduce
a Harnack's inequality. A pointwise formula for $H^\sigma f(x)$ and some
maximum and comparison principles are derived.
