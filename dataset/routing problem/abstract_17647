This paper is aimed to show the essential role played by the theory of
quasi-analytic functions in the study of the determinacy of the moment problem
on finite and infinite-dimensional spaces. In particular, the quasi-analytic
criterion of self-adjointness of operators and their commutativity are crucial
to establish whether or not a measure is uniquely determined by its moments.
Our main goal is to point out that this is a common feature of the determinacy
question in both the finite and the infinite-dimensional moment problem, by
reviewing some of the most known determinacy results from this perspective. We
also collect some properties of independent interest concerning the
characterization of quasi-analytic classes associated to log-convex sequences.
