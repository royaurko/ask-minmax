This paper presents the chief security officer (CSO) problem, defines its
scope, and investigates several important research questions related within the
scope. The CSO problem is defined based on the concept of secrecy capacity of
wireless communication channels. It is also related to the chief
Estimation/Executive Officer (CEO) problem that has been well studied in
information theory. The CSO problem consists of a CSO, several agents capable
of having two-way communication with the CSO, and a group of eavesdroppers.
There are two scenarios in the CSO problem; one in which agents are not allowed
to cooperate with one another and the other in which agents are allowed to
cooperate with one another. While there are several research questions relevant
to the CSO problem, this paper focusses on the following and provides answers:
(1) How much information can be exchanged back and forth between the CSO and
the agents without leaking any information to the eavesdroppers? (2) What is
the power allocation strategy that the CSO needs to follow so as to maximize
the secrecy capacity? (3) How can agents cooperate with one another in order to
increase the overall secrecy capacity?.
