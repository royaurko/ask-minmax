We give a new, sharpened version of the period theorem of Masser and
W\"ustholz, which is moreover totally explicit. We also present a new
formulation involving all archimedean places. We then derive new bounds for
elliptic isogenies, improving those of Pellarin. The small numerical constants
obtained allow an application to Serre's uniformity problem in the split Cartan
case, thanks to the work of Bilu, Parent and Rebolledo.
