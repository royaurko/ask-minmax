The parity of a bit string of length $N$ is a global quantity that can be
efficiently compute using a global counter in ${O} (N)$ time. But is it
possible to find the parity using cellular automata with a set of local rule
tables without using any global counter? Here, we report a way to solve this
problem using a number of $r=1$ binary, uniform, parallel and deterministic
cellular automata applied in succession for a total of ${O} (N^2)$ time.
