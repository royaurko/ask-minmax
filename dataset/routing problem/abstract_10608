A random walk on a directed graph gives a Markov chain on the vertices of the
graph. An important question that arises often in the context of Markov chain
is whether the uniform distribution on the vertices of the graph is a
stationary distribution of the Markov chain. Stationary distribution of a
Markov chain is a global property of the graph. In this paper, we prove that
for a regular directed graph whether the uniform distribution on the vertices
of the graph is a stationary distribution, depends on a local property of the
graph, namely if (u,v) is an directed edge then outdegree(u) is equal to
indegree(v).
  This result also has an application to the problem of testing whether a given
distribution is uniform or "far" from being uniform. This is a well studied
problem in property testing and statistics. If the distribution is the
stationary distribution of the lazy random walk on a directed graph and the
graph is given as an input, then how many bits of the input graph do one need
to query in order to decide whether the distribution is uniform or "far" from
it? This is a problem of graph property testing and we consider this problem in
the orientation model (introduced by Halevy et al.). We reduce this problem to
test (in the orientation model) whether a directed graph is Eulerian. And using
result of Fischer et al. on query complexity of testing (in the orientation
model) whether a graph is Eulerian, we obtain bounds on the query complexity
for testing whether the stationary distribution is uniform.
