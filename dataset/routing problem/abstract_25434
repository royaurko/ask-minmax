The problem on the minimal number (with respect to deformation) of
intersection points of two closed curves on a surface is solved. Following the
Nielsen approach, we define classes of intersection points and essential
classes of intersection points, which "are preserved under deformation" and
whose total number is called the Nielsen number. If each Nielsen class consists
of a unique point and has a non-vanishing index after a suitable deformation of
the pair of curves, one says that {\it the Wecken property holds}. We compute
the minimal number of intersection points in terms of the Nielsen numbers and
the Reidemeister numbers. In particular, we prove that the Wecken property does
not hold for some pairs of closed curves. Moreover, all the non-vanishing
indices of the Nielsen classes equal $\pm1$, while the non-vanishing Jezierski
semi-indices equal 1. Similar questions are studied for the self-intersection
problem of a curve on a surface.
