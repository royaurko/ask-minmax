Multi-dimensional classification (MDC) is the supervised learning problem
where an instance is associated with multiple classes, rather than with a
single class, as in traditional classification problems. Since these classes
are often strongly correlated, modeling the dependencies between them allows
MDC methods to improve their performance - at the expense of an increased
computational cost. In this paper we focus on the classifier chains (CC)
approach for modeling dependencies, one of the most popular and highest-
performing methods for multi-label classification (MLC), a particular case of
MDC which involves only binary classes (i.e., labels). The original CC
algorithm makes a greedy approximation, and is fast but tends to propagate
errors along the chain. Here we present novel Monte Carlo schemes, both for
finding a good chain sequence and performing efficient inference. Our
algorithms remain tractable for high-dimensional data sets and obtain the best
predictive performance across several real data sets.
