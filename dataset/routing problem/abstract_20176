In our previous work, a relation between Tsukiyama problem about self
homotopy equivalence was found by using a generalization of phantom map. In
this note, fundamental result is established for such a generalization. This is
the first time one can deal with phantom maps to space not satisfying finite
type condition. Application to Forgetful map is also discussed briefly.
