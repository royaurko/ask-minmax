We consider the classical two-encoder multiterminal source coding problem
where distortion is measured under logarithmic loss. We provide a single-letter
characterization of the achievable rate distortion region for arbitrarily
correlated sources with finite alphabets. In doing so, we also give the rate
distortion region for the $m$-encoder CEO problem (also under logarithmic
loss). Several applications and examples are given.
