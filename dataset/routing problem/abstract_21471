We solve the problem posed by Boyer and Galicki about the existence of
K-contact simply connected manifolds with no Sasakian structure. Although the
result lies in the framework of metric contact geometry, our methods come from
contact and symplectic geometry and are based on the method of fat bundles
developed by Sternberg, Weinstein and Lerman.
