We prove that algebraic isomorphisms between limit algebras are automatically
continuous, and consider consequences of this result. In particular, we give
partial solutions to a conjecture of Power [Limit Algebras, Longman, 1992,
Notes to Chapter 8] and to an open problem [op. cit., Problem 7.8]. As a
further consequence, we describe epimorphisms between various classes of limit
algebras.
