We calculate Ay in neutron-proton scattering for the interactions models
WJC-1 and WJC-2 in the Covariant Spectator Theory. We find that the recent 12
MeV measurements performed at TUNL are in better agreement with our results
than with the Nijmegen Phase Shift Analysis of 1993, and after reviewing the
low-energy data, conclude that there is no Ay problem in low-energy np
scattering.
