Gold-silica hybrids are appealing in different fields of applications like
catalysis, sensors, drug delivery, and biotechnology. In most cases, the
morphology and distribution of the hetero-units play significant roles in their
functional behavior. Methods of synthesizing these hybrids, with variable
ordering of the hetero-units, are replete; however, a complete characterization
in three dimensions could not be achieved yet. A simple route to the synthesis
of Au-decorated SiO2 spheres is demonstrated and a study on the 3D ordering of
the hetero-units by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) tomography
is presented at the final stage, intermediate stages of formation, and after
heating the hybrid. The final hybrid evolves from a soft self-assembled
structure of Au nano-particles. The hybrid shows good thermal stability up to
400 C, beyond which the Au particles start migrating inside the SiO2 matrix.
This study provides an insight in the formation mechanism and thermal stability
of the structures which are crucial factors for designing and applying such
hybrids in fields of catalysis and biotechnology. As the method is general, it
can be applied to make similar hybrids based on SiO2 by tuning the reaction
chemistry as needed.
