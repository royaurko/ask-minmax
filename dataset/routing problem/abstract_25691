SYN-flooding attack uses the weakness available in TCP's three-way handshake
process to keep it from handling legitimate requests. This attack causes the
victim host to populate its backlog queue with forged TCP connections. In other
words it increases Ploss (probability of loss) and Pa (buffer occupancy
percentage of attack requests) and decreases Pr (buffer occupancy percentage of
regular requests) in the victim host and results to decreased performance of
the host. This paper proposes a self-managing approach, in which the host
defends against SYN-flooding attack by dynamically tuning of its own two
parameters, that is, m (maximum number of half-open connections) and h (hold
time for each half-open connection). In this way, it formulates the defense
problem to an optimization problem and then employs the learning automata (LA)
algorithm to solve it. The simulation results show that the proposed defense
strategy improves performance of the under attack system in terms of Ploss, Pa
and Pr.
