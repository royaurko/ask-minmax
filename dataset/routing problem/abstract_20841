For orthonormal normal sections of two-dimensional immersions in R^4 we
define torsion coefficients and a functional for the total torsion. We discuss
normal sections which are critical for this functional. In particular, a global
estimate for the torsion coefficients of a critical normal section in terms of
the curvature of the normal bundle is provided.
