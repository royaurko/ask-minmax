We consider the semilinear Lane-Emden problem
\begin{equation}\label{problemAbstract} \left\{\begin{array}{lr}-\Delta u=
|u|^{p-1}u\qquad \mbox{ in }B\\ u=0\qquad\qquad\qquad\mbox{ on }\partial B
\end{array}\right.\tag{$\mathcal E_p$} \end{equation} where $B$ is the unit
ball of $\mathbb R^N$, $N\geq2$, centered at the origin and $1<p<p_S$, with
$p_S=+\infty$ if $N=2$ and $p_S=\frac{N+2}{N-2}$ if $N\geq3$. Our main result
is to prove that in dimension $N=2$ the Morse index of the least energy
sign-changing radial solution $u_p$ of \eqref{problemAbstract} is exactly $12$
if $p$ is sufficiently large. As an intermediate step we compute explicitly the
first eigenvalue of a limit weighted problem in $\mathbb R^N$ in any dimension
$N\geq2$.
