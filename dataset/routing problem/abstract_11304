We construct the minimal SUSY model that causes spontaneous CP violation with
an abelian flavor symmetry in the context of the large extra dimensions and
show that various phenomenological problems can be solved by introducing only
scales below the low fundamental scale. We also realize the realistic size of
the CP violation and the small masses of the neutrinos. The strong CP problem
can be solved by the axion scenario and the axion can be made invisible by
introducing an additional large extra dimension.
