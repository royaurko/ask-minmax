A strategy to address the inverse Galois problem over Q consists of
exploiting the knowledge of Galois representations attached to certain
automorphic forms. More precisely, if such forms are carefully chosen, they
provide compatible systems of Galois representations satisfying some desired
properties, e.g. properties that reflect on the image of the members of the
system. In this article we survey some results obtained using this strategy.
