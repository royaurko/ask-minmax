This work is concerned with the development of a well-founded, theoretically
justified, and least complicated metric for the classification of proteins with
reference to enzymes. As the signature of an enzyme family, a catalytic domain
is easily fingerprinted. Given that the classification problem has so far
seemed intractable, a classification schema derived from the catalytic domain
would be satisfying. Here I show that there exists a natural ab initio if
nonobvious basis to theorize that the catalytic domain of an enzyme is uniquely
informative about its regulation. This annotates its function. Based on this
hypothesis, a method that correctly classifies potassium ion channels into
their respective subfamilies is described. To put the principle on firmer
ground, extra validation was sought and obtained through co-evolutionary
analyses. The co-evolutionary analyses reveal a departure from the notion that
potassium ion channel proteins are functionally modular. This finding is
discussed in light of the prevailing notion of domain. These studies establish
that significant co-evolution of the catalytic domain of a gene with its
conjoint domain is a specialized, necessary process following fusion and
swapping events in evolution. Instances of this discovery are likely to be
found pervasive in protein science.
