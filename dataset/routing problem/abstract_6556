We consider a regular indefinite Sturm-Liouville problem with two
self-adjoint boundary conditions, one being affinely dependent on the
eigenparameter. We give sufficient conditions under which a basis of each root
subspace for this Sturm-Liouville problem can be selected so that the union of
all these bases constitutes a Riesz basis of a corresponding weighted Hilbert
space.
