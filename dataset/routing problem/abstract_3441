The Kepler problem is a physical problem about two bodies which attract each
other by a force proportional to the inverse square of the distance. The
MICZ-Kepler problems are its natural cousins and have been previously
generalized from dimension three to dimension five. In this paper, we construct
and analyze the (quantum) MICZ-Kepler problems in all dimensions higher than
two.
