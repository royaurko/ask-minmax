The purpose of this paper is the extension of Jacobi's criteria for positive
definiteness of second variation of the simplest problems of calculus of
variations subject to mixed boundary conditions. Both non constrained and
isoperimetric problems are discussed. The main result is that Jacobi's
condition remains valid also for the mixed boundary conditions.
