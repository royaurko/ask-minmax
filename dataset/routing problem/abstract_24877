In this work we consider the mean field traveling salesman problem, where the
intercity distances are taken to be i.i.d. with some distribution $F$. This
paper focus on the \emph{nearest neighbor tour} which is to move to the nearest
non-visited city and we show that under some conditions on $F$, which are
satisfied by exponential distribution with constant mean, the total length of
the nearest neighbor tour, asymptotically almost surely scales as $\log n$.
Similar result is known for Euclidean TSP and nearest neighbor tour. We further
derive the limiting behavior of the total length of the nearest neighbor tour
for more general distribution function $F$ and show that its asymptotic
properties are determined by the scaling properties of the density of $F$ at 0.
