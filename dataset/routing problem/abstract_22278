Developing an error-free spreadsheet has been a problem since the beginning
of end-user computing. In this paper, we present a methodology that separates
the modeling from the implementation. Using proven techniques from Information
Systems and Software Engineering, we present strict, but simple, rules
governing the implementation from the model. The resulting spreadsheet should
be easier to understand, audit and maintain.
