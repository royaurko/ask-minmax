Linear subspace representations of appearance variation are pervasive in
computer vision. This paper addresses the problem of robustly matching such
subspaces (computing the similarity between them) when they are used to
describe the scope of variations within sets of images of different (possibly
greatly so) scales. A naive solution of projecting the low-scale subspace into
the high-scale image space is described first and subsequently shown to be
inadequate, especially at large scale discrepancies. A successful approach is
proposed instead. It consists of (i) an interpolated projection of the
low-scale subspace into the high-scale space, which is followed by (ii) a
rotation of this initial estimate within the bounds of the imposed
``downsampling constraint''. The optimal rotation is found in the closed-form
which best aligns the high-scale reconstruction of the low-scale subspace with
the reference it is compared to. The method is evaluated on the problem of
matching sets of (i) face appearances under varying illumination and (ii)
object appearances under varying viewpoint, using two large data sets. In
comparison to the naive matching, the proposed algorithm is shown to greatly
increase the separation of between-class and within-class similarities, as well
as produce far more meaningful modes of common appearance on which the match
score is based.
