We consider directed graphs where each edge is labeled with an integer weight
and study the fundamental algorithmic question of computing the value of a
cycle with minimum mean weight. Our contributions are twofold: (1) First we
show that the algorithmic question is reducible in O(n^2) time to the problem
of a logarithmic number of min-plus matrix multiplications of n-by-n matrices,
where n is the number of vertices of the graph. (2) Second, when the weights
are nonnegative, we present the first (1 + {\epsilon})-approximation algorithm
for the problem and the running time of our algorithm is \tilde(O)(n^\omega
log^3(nW/{\epsilon}) / {\epsilon}), where O(n^\omega) is the time required for
the classic n-by-n matrix multiplication and W is the maximum value of the
weights.
