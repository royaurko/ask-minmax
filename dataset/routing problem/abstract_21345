In these notes, we discuss a selection of topics on several models of planar
statistical mechanics. We consider the Ising, Potts, and more generally abelian
spin models; the discrete Gaussian free field; the random cluster model; and
the six-vertex model. Emphasis is put on duality, order, disorder and spinor
variables, and on mappings between these models.
