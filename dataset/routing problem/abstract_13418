The features of alternative approach of non-equilibrium evolution
thermodynamics are shown on the example of theory of vacancies by opposed to
the classic prototype of Landau theory. On this foundation a strict theory of
the melting of metals, based on development of Frenkel ideas about the vacancy
mechanism of such phenomena, is considered. The phenomenon of melting is able
to be described as a discontinuous phase transition, while the traditional
Frenkel's solution in the region of low-concentration of vacancies can describe
such transition only as continuous one. The problem of limiting transition of
shear modulus to zero values in the liquid state, as well as the problem of the
influence of extended state of vacancies on their mobility, is discussed.
