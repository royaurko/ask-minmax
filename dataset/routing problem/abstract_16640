This paper develops a structure-preserving numerical integration scheme for a
class of higher-order mechanical systems. The dynamics of these systems are
governed by invariant variational principles defined on higher-order tangent
bundles of Lie groups. The variational principles admit Lagrangians that depend
on acceleration, for example. The symmetry reduction method used in the
Hamilton--Pontryagin approach for developing variational integrators of
first-order mechanics is extended here to higher order. The paper discusses the
general approach and then focuses on the primary example of Riemannian cubics.
Higher-order variational integrators are developed both for the discrete-time
integration of the initial value problem and for a particular type of
trajectory-planning problem. The solution of the discrete trajectory-planning
problem for higher-order interpolation among points on the sphere illustrates
the approach.
