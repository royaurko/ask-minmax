The library LINPRO which provides solution to the linear inverse problem for
data contaminated by a statistical noise is presented. The library makes use of
two methods: Maximum Entropy Method and Singular Value Decomposition. As an
example it has been applied to perform an analytic continuation of the
imaginary time propagator obtained within the Quantum Monte Carlo method.
