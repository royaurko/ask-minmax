The classic image problem in electromagnetism involves a grounded infinite
conducting plane and a point charge. The force of attraction between the point
charge and the plane is identified using an equivalent-field picture of an
image charge with opposite sign equidistant behind the plane resulting in a
1/{\it r}$^{\rm 2}$ force of attraction between the original charge and the
plane. If the point charge is released from rest it will reach the plane in a
time $\tau$. This time $\tau$ has not been calculated correctly up to now.
Clarification of the inconsistency is presented along with a correct solution
to the classic image problem. Other electromagnetism problems are mentioned
with attractive 1/{\it r}$^{\it n}$ forces (where {\it n} $\ge$ 1). Such
situations arise between a point charge and a line charge (1/{\it r}), between
a line charge and a point dipole (1/{\it r}$^{2}$), between a point charge and
a point dipole (1/{\it r}$^{3})$, and between a point dipole and a second point
dipole (1/{\it r}$^{4}$).
