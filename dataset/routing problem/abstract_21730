We prove the existence of scattering solutions for multidimensional magnetic
Schr\"odinger equation which belong to the weighted Sobolev space H^1_s
(R^n)(n=2,3) with some s < -1/2. As a consequence of this we formulate the
direct Born approximation for the magnetic Schr\"odinger operator. Possible
connections with inverse problems (inverse scattering Born approximation) are
discussed.
