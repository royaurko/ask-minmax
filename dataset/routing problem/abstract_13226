In this article we study a continuous Primal-Dual method proposed by Appleton
and Talbot and generalize it to other problems in image processing. We
interpret it as an Arrow-Hurwicz method which leads to a better description of
the system of PDEs obtained. We show existence and uniqueness of solutions and
get a convergence result for the denoising problem. Our analysis also yields
new a posteriori estimates.
