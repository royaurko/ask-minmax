In this paper we prove the existence of a positive solution to the equation
$-\Delta u + V(x)u=g(u)$ in $R^N,$ assuming the general hypotheses on the
nonlinearity introduced by Berestycki & Lions. Moreover we show that a
minimizing problem, related to the existence of a ground state, has no
solution.
