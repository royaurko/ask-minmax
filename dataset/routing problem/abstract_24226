The activity patterns of highly developed cognitive systems like the human
brain are dominated by autonomous dynamical processes, that is by a
self-sustained activity which would be present even in the absence of external
sensory stimuli.
  During normal operation the continuous influx of external stimuli could
therefore be completely unrelated to the patterns generated internally by the
autonomous dynamical process. Learning of spurious correlations between
external stimuli and autonomously generated internal activity states needs
therefore to be avoided.
  We study this problem within the paradigm of transient state dynamics for the
internal activity, that is for an autonomous activity characterized by a
infinite time-series of transiently stable attractor states. We propose that
external stimuli will be relevant during the sensitive periods, the transition
period between one transient state and the subsequent semi-stable attractor. A
diffusive learning signal is generated unsupervised whenever the stimulus
influences the internal dynamics qualitatively.
  For testing we have presented to the model system stimuli corresponding to
the bar-stripes problem and found it capable to perform the required
independent-component analysis on its own, all the time being continuously and
autonomously active.
