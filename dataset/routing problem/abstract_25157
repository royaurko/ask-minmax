We provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in the area of sequential
change-point detection assuming discrete time and known pre- and post-change
distributions. The overview spans over all major formulations of the underlying
optimization problem, namely, Bayesian, generalized Bayesian, and minimax. We
pay particular attention to the latest advances in each. Also, we link together
the generalized Bayesian problem with multi-cyclic disorder detection in a
stationary regime when the change occurs at a distant time horizon. We conclude
with two case studies to illustrate the cutting edge of the field at work.
