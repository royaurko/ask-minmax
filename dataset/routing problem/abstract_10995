The second part of the theory for the multicomponent nonisothermal nucleation
is presented. The solution of the kinetic equation already derived in the first
part is given with the help of the Chapman-Enskog procedure. At first the
relaxation stage is considered. The special choice of the relaxation operator
allows to refuse from the special small parameter usually required in the
nucleation problems. The special procedure allows to estimate the tails of the
approximations appeared in the reccurent procedures. The final formulas for
corrections allows to reduce the problem to the ordinary Fokker-Planck equation
in the nulticomponent case.
