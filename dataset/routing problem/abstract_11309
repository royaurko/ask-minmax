We re-examine the neutrino decay solution to the solar neutrino problem in
the light of the SuperKamiokande (SK) data. For the decay solution the SK
spectrum data by its own can provide a fit comparable to the fit obtained from
the MSW solution. However when one combines the results from the total rates of
the $^{37}{Cl}$ and $^{71}{Ga}$ experiments the fit becomes much poorer.
