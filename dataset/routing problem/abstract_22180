Recently Neil Ross and Peter Selinger analyzed the problem of approximating
z- rotations by means of single-qubit Clifford+T circuits. Their main
contribution is a deterministic-search technique which allowed them to make
approximating circuits shallower. We adapt the deterministic-search technique
to the case of Pauli+V circuits and prove similar results. Because of the
relative simplicity of the Pauli+V framework, we use much simpler geometric
methods.
