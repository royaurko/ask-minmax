The MEG inverse problem refers to the reconstruction of the neural activity
of the brain from magnetoencephalography (MEG) measurements. We propose a
two-way regularization (TWR) method to solve the MEG inverse problem under the
assumptions that only a small number of locations in space are responsible for
the measured signals (focality), and each source time course is smooth in time
(smoothness). The focality and smoothness of the reconstructed signals are
ensured respectively by imposing a sparsity-inducing penalty and a roughness
penalty in the data fitting criterion. A two-stage algorithm is developed for
fast computation, where a raw estimate of the source time course is obtained in
the first stage and then refined in the second stage by the two-way
regularization. The proposed method is shown to be effective on both synthetic
and real-world examples.
