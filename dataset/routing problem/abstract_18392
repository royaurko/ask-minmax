With only a few exceptions, the numerical simulation of cosmic and laboratory
hydromagnetic dynamos has been carried out in the framework of the differential
equation method. However, the integral equation method is known to provide
robust and accurate tools for the numerical solution of many problems in other
fields of physics. The paper is intended to facilitate the use of integral
equation solvers in dynamo theory. In concrete, the integral equation method is
employed to solve the eigenvalue problem for a hydromagnetic dynamo model with
a spherically symmetric, isotropic helical turbulence parameter alpha. Three
examples of the function alpha(r) with steady and oscillatory solutions are
considered. A convergence rate proportional to the inverse squared of the
number of grid points is achieved. Based on this method, a convergence
accelerating strategy is developed and the convergence rate is improved
remarkably. Typically, quite accurate results can be obtained with a few tens
of grid points. In order to demonstrate its suitability for the treatment of
dynamos in other than spherical domains, the method is also applied to alpha^2
dynamos in rectangular boxes. The magnetic fields and the electric potentials
for the first eigenvalues are visualized.
