In this paper we consider the identification problem of Cellular Automata
(CAs). The problem is defined and solved in the context of partial observations
with time gaps of unknown length, i.e. pre-recorded, partial configurations of
the system at certain, unknown time steps. A solution method based on a
modified variant of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed and illustrated with
brief experimental results.
