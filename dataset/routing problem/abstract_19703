Traditional clock synchronisation on a rotating platform is shown to be
incompatible with the experimentally established transformation of time. The
latter transformation leads directly to solve this problem through noninvariant
one-way speed of light. The conventionality of some features of relativity
theory allows full compatibility with existing experimental evidence.
