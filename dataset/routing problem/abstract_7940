We study the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of a spectral problem for
the Laplacian in a domain with rapidly oscillating boundary. We consider the
case where the eigenvalue of the limit problem is multiple. We construct the
leading terms of the asymptotic expansions for the eigenelements and verify the
asymptotics.
