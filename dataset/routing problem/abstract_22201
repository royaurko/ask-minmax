The problem of bounding of the distance between the two bodies of volume
$\varepsilon$ located inside the $n$-dimensional body $B$ of unit volume where
$n \to \infty$ is considered. In some cases such distances are bounded by
function depends on $\varepsilon$ but not depends on $n$. We consider cases
when $B$ is a sphere or a cube.
