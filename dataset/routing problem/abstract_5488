Robustness is a critical measure of the resilience of large networked
systems, such as transportation and communication networks. Most prior works
focus on the global robustness of a given graph at large, e.g., by measuring
its overall vulnerability to external attacks or random failures. In this
paper, we turn attention to local robustness and pose a novel problem in the
lines of subgraph mining: given a large graph, how can we find its most robust
local subgraph (RLS)?
  We define a robust subgraph as a subset of nodes with high communicability
among them, and formulate the RLS-PROBLEM of finding a subgraph of given size
with maximum robustness in the host graph. Our formulation is related to the
recently proposed general framework for the densest subgraph problem, however
differs from it substantially in that besides the number of edges in the
subgraph, robustness also concerns with the placement of edges, i.e., the
subgraph topology. We show that the RLS-PROBLEM is NP-hard and propose two
heuristic algorithms based on top-down and bottom-up search strategies.
Further, we present modifications of our algorithms to handle three practical
variants of the RLS-PROBLEM. Experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs
demonstrate that we find subgraphs with larger robustness than the densest
subgraphs even at lower densities, suggesting that the existing approaches are
not suitable for the new problem setting.
