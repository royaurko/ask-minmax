We consider the analog of visibility problems in hyperbolic plane
(represented by Poincar\'{e} half-plane model H), replacing the standard
lattice $Z\times Z$ by the orbit $z=i$ under the full modular group $z$. We
prove a visibility criterion and study orchard problem and the cardinality of
visible points in large circles
