We present a strategy for a statistically rigorous Bayesian approach to the
problem of determining cosmological parameters from the results of observations
of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave radiation background. We propose the
application of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, specifically the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, to estimate the parameters. A complete
statistical analysis is presented, with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
described in detail.
