The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has recently sparked
interest as a flexible and efficient optimization tool for imaging inverse
problems, namely deconvolution and reconstruction under non-smooth convex
regularization. ADMM achieves state-of-the-art speed by adopting a divide and
conquer strategy, wherein a hard problem is split into simpler, efficiently
solvable sub-problems (e.g., using fast Fourier or wavelet transforms, or
simple proximity operators). In deconvolution, one of these sub-problems
involves a matrix inversion (i.e., solving a linear system), which can be done
efficiently (in the discrete Fourier domain) if the observation operator is
circulant, i.e., under periodic boundary conditions. This paper extends
ADMM-based image deconvolution to the more realistic scenario of unknown
boundary, where the observation operator is modeled as the composition of a
convolution (with arbitrary boundary conditions) with a spatial mask that keeps
only pixels that do not depend on the unknown boundary. The proposed approach
also handles, at no extra cost, problems that combine the recovery of missing
pixels (i.e., inpainting) with deconvolution. We show that the resulting
algorithms inherit the convergence guarantees of ADMM and illustrate its
performance on non-periodic deblurring (with and without inpainting of interior
pixels) under total-variation and frame-based regularization.
