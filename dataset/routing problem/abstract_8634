The short pulse equation provides a model for the propagation of ultra-short
light pulses in silica optical fi?bers. It is a nonlinear evolution equation.
In this paper the wellposedness of bounded solutions for the homogeneous
initial boundary value problem and the Cauchy problem associated to this
equation are studied.
