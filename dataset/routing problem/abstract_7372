In this paper, we consider the Dirichlet problem of the three-dimensional
Laplace equation in the unit ball with a shrinking hole. The problem typically
arises from homogenization problems in domains perforated with tiny holes. We
give an almost complete description concerning the uniform $W^{1,p}$ estimates:
for any $3/2<p<3$ there hold the uniform $W^{1,p}$ estimates; for any $1<p<3/2$
or $3<p<\infty $, there are counterexamples indicating that the uniform
$W^{1,p}$ estimates do not hold. The results can be generalized to higher
dimensions.
