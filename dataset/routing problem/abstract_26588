We consider a source (Alice) trying to communicate with a destination (Bob),
in a way that an uncontributorized node (Eve) cannot infer, based on her
observations, the information that is being transmitted. The communication is
assisted by multiple multi-antenna cooperating nodes (helpers) who have the
ability to move. While Alice transmits, the helpers transmit noise that is
designed to affect the entire space except Bob. We consider the problem of
selecting the helper weights and positions that maximize the system secrecy
rate. It turns out that this optimization problem can be efficiently solved,
leading to a novel decentralized helper motion control scheme. Simulations
indicate that introducing helper mobility leads to considerable savings in
terms of helper transmit power, as well as total number of helpers required for
secrecy communications.
