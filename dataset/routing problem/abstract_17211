A discontinuous Galerkin (dG) method for the numerical solution of
initial/boundary value multi-compartment partial differential equation (PDE)
models, interconnected with interface conditions, is presented and analysed.
The study of interface problems is motivated by models of mass transfer of
solutes through semi-permeable membranes. More specifically, a model problem
consisting of a system of semilinear parabolic advection-diffusion-reaction
partial differential equations in each compartment, equipped with respective
initial and boundary conditions, is considered. Nonlinear interface conditions
modelling selective permeability, congestion and partial reflection are applied
to the compartment interfaces. An interior penalty dG method is presented for
this problem and it is analysed in the space-discrete setting. The a priori
analysis shows that the method yields optimal a priori bounds, provided the
exact solution is sufficiently smooth. Numerical experiments indicate agreement
with the theoretical bounds and highlight the stability of the numerical method
in the advection-dominated regime.
