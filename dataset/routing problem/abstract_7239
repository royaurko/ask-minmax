We study the validity problem for propositional dependence logic, modal
dependence logic and extended modal dependence logic. We show that the validity
problem for propositional dependence logic is NEXPTIME-complete. In addition,
we establish that the corresponding problem for modal dependence logic and
extended modal dependence logic is NEXPTIME-hard and in NEXPTIME^NP.
