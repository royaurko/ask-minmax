Users of heterogeneous computing systems face two problems: firstly,
understanding the trade-off relationship between the observable characteristics
of their applications, such as latency and quality of the result, and secondly,
how to exploit knowledge of these characteristics to allocate work to
distributed resources efficiently. A domain specific approach addresses both of
these problems. By considering a subset of operations, models of the observable
characteristics or domain metrics may be formulated in advance, and populated
at runtime for particular problem instances. These metric models can then be
used to express the allocation of work as a formal integer linear programming
problem, which can be solved using heuristics, numerical method-based
optimisers or constrained optimisation frameworks.
  These claims are illustrated using the example domain of derivatives pricing
in computational finance, with the domain metrics of workload latency or
makespan and pricing accuracy. For a large, varied workload of 128
Black-Scholes and Heston model-based option pricing tasks, running upon a
diverse array of 16 Multicore CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs platforms, predictions made
by models of both the makespan and accuracy are generally within 10% of the
performance actually seen at runtime. When these models are used as inputs to
numerical optimiser and formal optimisation-based workload partitioning
approaches, a latency improvement of up to 24 and 270 times over a naive
heuristic approach is seen.
