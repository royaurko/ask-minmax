PROMETHEE methods are widely used in Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA)
to deal with real decision making problems. A crucial aspect of the classical
PROMETHEE methods is the choice of criteria weights. In this paper, we propose
to apply the Stochastic Multiobjective Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) to the
classical PROMETHEE methods and to the bipolar PROMETHEE methods in order to
explore the whole set of weights compatible with some preference information
provided by the Decision Maker (DM). A didactic example describes the
application of the presented methodology to a student evaluation problem.
