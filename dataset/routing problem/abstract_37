Given a bidirected ring with capacities and a demand graph, we present an
approximation algorithm to the problem of finding the minimum $\alpha$ such
that there exists a feasible unsplittable routing of the demands after
multiplying each capacity by $\alpha$. We also give an approximation scheme to
the problem.
