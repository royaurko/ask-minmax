A major problem in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy mapping,
especially in a total-power mode, is the presence of low-frequency noise in the
data streams. If unproperly processed, such low-frequency noise leads to
striping in the maps. To deal with this problem, solutions have already been
found for mapping the CMB temperature fluctuations but no solution has yet been
proposed for the measurement of CMB polarization. Complications arise due to
the scan-dependent orientation of the measured polarization. In this paper, we
investigate a method for building temperature and polarization maps with
minimal striping effects in the case of a circular scanning strategy mission
such as the Planck mission.
