We consider the initial value problem for a massless scalar field in the
Schwarzschild geometry. When constructed using a complex-frequency approach the
necessary Green's function splits into three components. We discuss all of
these in some detail: 1) The contribution from the singularities (the
quasinormal modes of the black hole) is approximated and the mode-sum is
demonstrated to converge after a certain well defined time in the evolution. A
dynamic description of the mode-excitation is introduced and tested. 2) It is
shown how a straightforward low-frequency approximation to the integral along
the branch cut in the black-hole Green's function leads to the anticipated
power-law fall off at very late times. We also calculate higher order
corrections to this tail and show that they provide an important complement to
the leading order. 3) The high-frequency problem is also considered. We
demonstrate that the combination of the obtained approximations for the
quasinormal modes and the power-law tail provide a complete description of the
evolution at late times. Problems that arise (in the complex-frequency picture)
for early times are also discussed, as is the fact that many of the presented
results generalize to, for example, Kerr black holes.
