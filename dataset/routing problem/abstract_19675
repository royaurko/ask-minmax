We study the approximability of Max Ones when the number of variable
occurrences is bounded by a constant. For conservative constraint languages
(i.e., when the unary relations are included) we give a complete classification
when the number of occurrences is three or more and a partial classification
when the bound is two.
  For the non-conservative case we prove that it is either trivial or
equivalent to the corresponding conservative problem under polynomial-time
many-one reductions.
