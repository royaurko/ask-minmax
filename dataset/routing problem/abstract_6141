The problem of distributing the workload on a parallel computer to minimize
the overall runtime is known as Multiprocessor Scheduling Problem. It is
NP-hard, but like many other NP-hard problems, the average hardness of random
instances displays an ``easy-hard'' phase transition. The transition in
Multiprocessor Scheduling can be analyzed using elementary notions from
crystallography (Bravais lattices) and statistical mechanics (Potts vectors).
The analysis reveals the control parameter of the transition and its critical
value including finite size corrections. The transition is identified in the
performance of practical scheduling algorithms.
