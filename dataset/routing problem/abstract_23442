In this letter, we construct a model based on a flipped SU(5) partial grand
unified theory, within the framework of the Randall-Sundrum (RS1) proposal.
Breaking of $\widetilde{SU}(5)$ is achieved using a bulk scalar field in the
\textbf{10} of SU(5), $\Phi$, which gains a vacuum expectation value $\left<
\Phi\right> \sim 3 \times 10^{15}$ GeV. We are able to retain the successes of
the flipped SU(5) phenomenology, namely the elimination of the doublet-triplet
splitting problem and the confinement of all fields to the smallest
(\textbf{1}, $\mathbf{\bar{5}}$, and \textbf{10}) representations of SU(5). We
derive the beta functions, and point out some constraints on bulk matter
content implied by the runnings (and positivity) of the five dimensional
coupling. Finally, we comment on baryon decay and show the fine-tuning problem
required to prevent an exponentially short proton lifetime.
