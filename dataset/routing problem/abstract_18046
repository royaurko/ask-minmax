This paper is devoted to settle two seemingly still open problems, at least
as far as we know, connected with the existence of ample and nef divisors on a
$\mathbb{Q}$--factorial complete toric variety. The first problem is about the
existence of ample divisors when the Picard number is 2: we give a positive
answer to this question, by studying the secondary fan by means of
$\mathbb{Z}$--linear Gale duality. The second problem is about the minimum
value of the Picard number allowing the vanishing of the $Nef$ cone: we give a
3--dimensional example showing that this value cannot be greater then 3, which,
under the previous result, is also the minimum value guaranteeing the existence
of non--projective examples.
