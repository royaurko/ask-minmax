We present a chemical route to covalently couple the photosystem I (PS I) to
carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Small linker molecules are used to connect the PS I to
the CNTs. Hybrid systems, consisting of CNTs and the PS I, promise new
photo-induced transport phenomena due to the outstanding optoelectronic
properties of the robust cyanobacteria membrane protein PS I.
