The problem of computing the chromatic number of a $P_5$-free graph is known
to be NP-hard. In contrast to this negative result, we show that determining
whether or not a $P_5$-free graph admits a $k$-colouring, for each fixed number
of colours $k$, can be done in polynomial time. If such a colouring exists, our
algorithm produces it.
