We describe a novel, interdisciplinary, computational methods course that
uses Python and associated numerical and visualization libraries to enable
students to implement simulations for a number of different course modules.
Problems in complex networks, biomechanics, pattern formation, and gene
regulation are highlighted to illustrate the breadth and flexibility of
Python-powered computational environments.
