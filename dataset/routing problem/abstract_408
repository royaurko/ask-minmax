The Mott and the Anderson routes to localization have long been recognized as
the two basic processes that can drive the metal-insulator transition (MIT).
Theories separately describing each of these mechanisms were discussed long
ago, but an accepted approach that can include both has remained elusive. The
lack of any obvious static symmetry distinguishing the metal from the insulator
poses another fundamental problem, since an appropriate static order parameter
cannot be easily found. More recent work, however, has revisited the original
arguments of Anderson and Mott, which stressed that the key diference between
the metal end the insulator lies in the dynamics of the electron. This physical
picture has suggested that the "typical" (geometrically averaged) escape rate
from a given lattice site should be regarded as the proper dynamical order
parameter for the MIT, one that can naturally describe both the Anderson and
the Mott mechanism for localization. This article provides an overview of the
recent results obtained from the corresponding Typical-Medium Theory, which
provided new insight into the the two-fluid character of the Mott-Anderson
transition.
