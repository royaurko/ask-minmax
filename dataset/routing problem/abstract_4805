We are solving the classical Riemann-Hilbert problem of rank N>1 on the
extended complex plane punctured in 2m+2 points, for
 NxN quasi-permutation monodromy matrices. Following Korotkin we solve the
Riemann-Hilbert problem in terms of the Szego kernel of certain Riemann
surfaces branched over the given 2m+2 points. These Riemann surfaces are
constructed from a permutation representation of the symmetric group S_N to
which the quasi-permutation monodromy representation has been reduced. The
permutation representation of our problem generates the cyclic subgroup Z_N.
For this reason the corresponding Riemann surfaces of genus N(m-1) have Z_N
symmetry. This fact enables us to write the matrix entries of the solution of
the NxN Riemann-Hilbert problem as a product of an algebraic function and
theta-function quotients. The algebraic function turns out to be related to the
Szego kernel with zero characteristics. From the solution of the Riemann-
Hilbert problem we automatically obtain a particular solution of the
Schlesinger system. The tau-function of the Schlesinger system is computed
explicitly. The rank 3 problem with four singular points (0,t,1,\infty) is
studied in detail. The corresponding solution of the Riemann-Hilbert problem
and the Schlesinger system is given in terms of Jacobi's theta-function with
modulus T=T(t), Im(T)>0. The function T=T(t) is invertible if it belongs to the
Siegel upper half space modulo the subgroup \Gamma_0(3) of the modular group.
The inverse function t=t(T) generates a solution of a general Halphen system.
