In the present study, an advection-diffusion problem has been considered for
the numerical solution. The continuum equation is discretized using both upwind
and centered scheme. The linear system is solved using the ILU preconditioned
BiCGSTAB method. Both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary condition has been
considered. The obtained results have been compared for different cases.
