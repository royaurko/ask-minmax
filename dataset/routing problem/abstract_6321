We consider the Newtonian planar three--body problem with positive masses
$m_1$, $m_2$, $m_3$. We prove that it does not have an additional first
integral meromorphic in the complex neighborhood of the parabolic Lagrangian
orbit besides three exceptional cases $ \sum m_i m_j/(\sum m_k)^2= 1/3$,
$2^3/3^3$, $2/3^2$ where the linearized equations are shown to be partially
integrable. This result completes the non-integrability analysis of the
three-body problem started in our previous papers and based of the
Morales-Ramis-Ziglin approach.
