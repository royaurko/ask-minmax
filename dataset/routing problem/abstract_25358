The fundamental constraint on two Higgs doublet models comes from the
requirement of sufficiently suppressing flavor-changing neutral currents. There
are various standard approaches for dealing with this problem, but they all
tend to share a common feature; all of the Higgs doublets couple very weakly to
the first generation quarks. Here we consider a simple two Higgs doublet model
which is able to have large couplings to the first generation, while also being
safe from flavor constraints. We assume only that there is an SU(3)_f flavor
symmetry which is respected by the couplings of one of the Higgs doublets, and
which is broken by Hermitian Yukawa couplings of the second doublet. As a
result of the large permitted couplings to the first generation quarks, this
scenario may be used to address the excess in W+dijet events recently observed
by CDF at the Tevatron. Moreover, Hermitian Yukawa coupling matrices arise
naturally in a broad class of solutions to the strong CP problem, providing a
compelling context for the model.
