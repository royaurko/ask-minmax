We introduce a modified SPH approach that is based on discretising the
particle density instead of the mass density. This approach makes it possible
to use SPH particles with very different masses to simulate multi-phase flows
with large differences in mass density between the phases. We test our
formulation with a simple advection problem, with sound waves encountering a
density discontinuity, and with shock tubes containing a contact discontinuity
between air and Diesel oil. For all examined problems where particles have
different masses, the new formulation yields better results than standard SPH.
This is also the case for problems in which different spatial resolutions are
needed while the mass density does not change.
