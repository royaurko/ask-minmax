The albedo and dichroic polarization of spheroidal particles are studied. For
the description of the phase function two asymmetry parameters $g_{||}$ and
$g_{\bot}$ characterizing the anisotropy in forward/backward and left/right
directions are introduced and calculated. The consideration is based on the
solution to the light scattering problem by the Separation of Variables Method
(Voshchinnikov and Farafonov, 1993).
