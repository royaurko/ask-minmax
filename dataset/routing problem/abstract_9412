We propose a systematic T-matrix approach to solve few-body problems with
s-wave contact interactions in ultracold atomic gases. The problem is generally
reduced to a matrix equation expanded by a set of orthogonal molecular states,
describing external center-of-mass motions of pairs of interacting particles;
while each matrix element is guaranteed to be finite by a proper
renormalization for internal relative motions. This approach is able to
incorporate various scattering problems and the calculations of related
physical quantities in a single framework, and also provides a physically
transparent way to understand the mechanism of resonance scattering. For
applications, we study two-body effective scattering in 2D-3D mixed dimensions,
where the resonance position and width are determined with high precision from
only a few number of matrix elements. We also study three fermions in a
(rotating) harmonic trap, where exotic scattering properties in terms of mass
ratios and angular momenta are uniquely identified in the framework of
T-matrix.
