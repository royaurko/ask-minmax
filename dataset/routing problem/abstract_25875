A twisted sum in the category of topological abelian groups is a short exact
sequence $0\to Y\to X \to Z\to 0$ where all maps are assumed to be continuous
and open onto their images. The twisted sum splits if it is equivalent to $0\to
Y\to Y \times Z \to Z\to 0$. \par We study the class $\ST$ of topological
groups $G$ for which every twisted sum $0\to \T\to X \to G\to 0$ splits. We
prove that this class contains locally precompact groups, sequential direct
limits of locally compact groups and topological groups with
$\mathcal{L}_\infty$ topologies. We also prove that it is closed by taking open
and dense subgroups, quotients by dually embedded subgroups and coproducts. As
a technique to find further examples of groups in $\ST$ we use the relation of
this class with the existence of quasi-characters on $G$ and with three-space
problems for topological groups. The subject is inspired on some concepts known
in the framework of topological vector spaces such as the notion of $K$-space,
which were interpreted for topological groups by Cabello.
