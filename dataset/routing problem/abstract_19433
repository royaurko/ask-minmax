In this paper, we propose a regularized Newton method for computing ground
states of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), which can be formulated as an
energy minimization problem with a spherical constraint. The energy functional
and constraint are discretized by either the finite difference, or sine or
Fourier pseudospectral discretization schemes and thus the original infinite
dimensional nonconvex minimization problem is approximated by a finite
dimensional constrained nonconvex minimization problem. Then an initial
solution is first constructed by using a feasible gradient type method, which
is an explicit scheme and maintains the spherical constraint automatically. To
accelerate the convergence of the gradient type method, we approximate the
energy functional by its second-order Taylor expansion with a regularized term
at each Newton iteration and adopt a cascadic multigrid technique for selecting
initial data. It leads to a standard trust-region subproblem and we solve it
again by the feasible gradient type method. The convergence of the regularized
Newton method is established by adjusting the regularization parameter as the
standard trust-region strategy. Extensive numerical experiments on challenging
examples, including a BEC in three dimensions with an optical lattice potential
and rotating BECs in two dimensions with rapid rotation and strongly repulsive
interaction, show that our method is efficient, accurate and robust.
