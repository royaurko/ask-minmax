The problems of conditional entropy's definition and the formula to compute
conditional entropy are analyzed from various perspectives, and the corrected
computing formula is presented. Examples are given to prove the conclusion that
conditional entropy never be increased is not absolute, thus the representation
that information is to decrease uncertainty in the definition of information is
not absolutely correct.
