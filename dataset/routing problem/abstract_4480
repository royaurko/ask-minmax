New formulas on the inverse problem for the continuous skew-self-adjoint
Dirac type system are obtained. For the discrete skew-self-adjoint Dirac type
system the solution of a general type inverse spectral problem is also derived
in terms of the Weyl functions. The description of the Weyl functions on the
interval is given. Borg-Marchenko type uniqueness theorems are derived for both
discrete and continuous non-self-adjoint systems too.
