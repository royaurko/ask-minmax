We provide a new proof of the classical result that any closed rectifiable
Jordan curve Gamma in space being piecewise of class C^2 bounds at least one
immersed minimal surface of disc-type, under the additional assumption that the
total curvature of Gamma is smaller than 6*Pi. In contrast to the methods due
to Osserman, Gulliver and Alt, our proof relies on a polygonal approximation
technique, using the existence of immersed solutions of Plateau's problem for
polygonal boundary curves, provided by the first contributor's accomplishment of
Garnier's ideas.
