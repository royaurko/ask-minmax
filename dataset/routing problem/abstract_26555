We consider signal reconstruction from the norms of subspace components
generalizing standard phase retrieval problems. In the deterministic setting, a
closed reconstruction formula is derived when the subspaces satisfy certain
cubature conditions, that require at least a quadratic number of subspaces.
Moreover, we address reconstruction under the erasure of a subset of the norms;
using the concepts of $p$-fusion frames and list decoding, we propose an
algorithm that outputs a finite list of candidate signals, one of which is the
correct one. In the random setting, we show that a set of subspaces chosen at
random and of cardinality scaling linearly in the ambient dimension allows for
exact reconstruction with high probability by solving the feasibility problem
of a semidefinite program.
