It was a difficult problem to determine the Gaussian fixed line from the
numerical data, because close to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
multicritical point the divergence of the correlation length becomes very slow.
Considering the renormalization group behavior, we find an efficient method to
determine the Gaussian fixed line.
