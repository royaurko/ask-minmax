This work introduces an economic solution for the problems of sound
insulation of recording studios. Sound insulation at wall resonance frequency
is weak. Instead of acoustical treatment, a digital filter is used to eliminate
the effects of wall resonance and coincidence phenomena on recording of speech.
Sound insulation of studio is measured to calculate the wall resonance
frequency and the coincidence frequency. Pole /zero placement technique is used
to calculate the IIR filter coefficients. The digital filter is designed,
simulated and implemented. The proposed system is used to treat these problems
and it is shown to be effective in recording the noisy speech. In this work
digital signal processing is used instead of the acoustic treatment to
eliminate the effect of noise at the studio wall resonance. This technique is
cheap and effective in canceling the noise at the desired frequencies. Field
Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is used for hardware implementation of the
proposed filter structure which provides fast and cheap solution for processing
real time audio signals. The implementation is carried out using Spartan chip
from Xinlinx achieving higher performance than commercially available software
solutions.
