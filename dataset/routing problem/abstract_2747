Wireless sensor network consists of large number of tiny sensor nodes which
are usually deployed in a harsh environment. Self configuration and
infrastructure less are the two fundamental properties of sensor networks.
Sensor nodes are highly energy constrained devices because they are battery
operated devices and due to harsh environment deployment it is impossible to
change or recharge their battery. Energy conservation and prolonging the
network life are two major challenges in a sensor network. Communication
consumes the large portion of WSN energy. Several protocols have been proposed
to realize power- efficient communication in a wireless sensor network. Cluster
based routing protocols are best known for increasing energy efficiency,
stability and network lifetime of WSNs. Low Energy Adaptive Clustering
Hierarchy (LEACH) is an important protocol in this class. One of the
disadvantages of LEACH is that it does not consider the nodes energy and
distance for the election of cluster head. This paper proposes a new energy
efficient clustering protocol DE-LEACH for homogeneous wireless sensor network
which is an extension of LEACH. DE-LEACH elects cluster head on the basis of
distance and residual energy of the nodes. Proposed protocol increases the
network life, stability and throughput of sensor network and simulations result
shows that DE-LEACH is better than LEACH.
