Security issues in MANET are a challenging task nowadays. MANETs are
vulnerable to passive attacks and active attacks because of a limited number of
resources and lack of centralized contributority. Blackhole attack is an attack in
network layer which degrade the network performance by dropping the packets. In
this paper, we have proposed a Secure Fault-Tolerant Paradigm (SFTP) which
checks the Blackhole attack in the network. The three phases used in SFTP
algorithm are designing of coverage area to find the area of coverage, Network
Connection algorithm to design a fault-tolerant model and Route Discovery
algorithm to discover the route and data delivery from source to destination.
SFTP gives better network performance by making the network fault free.
