We study a certain one dimensional, degenerate parabolic partial differential
equation with a boundary condition which arises in pricing of Asian options.
Due to degeneracy of the partial differential operator and the non-smooth
boundary condition, regularity of the generalized solution of such a problem
remained unclear. We prove that the generalized solution of the problem is
indeed a classical solution.
