We outline reasoning that led to the current theory of quasars and look at
George Contopoulos's place in the long history of the N-body problem. Following
Newton we find new exactly soluble N-body problems with multibody forces and
give a strange eternally pulsating system that in its other degrees of freedom
reaches statistical equilibrium.
