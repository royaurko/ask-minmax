This paper is devoted to the homogenization of weakly coupled cooperative
parabolic systems in strong convection regime with purely periodic
coefficients. Our approach is to factor out oscillations from the solution via
principal eigenfunctions of an associated spectral problem and to cancel any
exponential decay in time of the solution using the principal eigenvalue of the
same spectral problem. We employ the notion of two-scale convergence with drift
in the asymptotic analysis of the factorized model as the lengthscale of the
oscillations tends to zero. This combination of the factorization method and
the method of two-scale convergence is applied to upscale an adsorption model
for multicomponent flow in an heterogeneous porous medium.
