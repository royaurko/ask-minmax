Reconfiguration is an important activity for companies selling configurable
products or services which have a long life time. However, identification of a
set of required changes in a legacy configuration is a hard problem, since even
small changes in the requirements might imply significant modifications. In
this paper we show a solution based on answer set programming, which is a
logic-based knowledge representation formalism well suited for a compact
description of (re)configuration problems. Its applicability is demonstrated on
simple abstractions of several real-world scenarios. The evaluation of our
solution on a set of benchmark instances derived from commercial
(re)configuration problems shows its practical applicability.
