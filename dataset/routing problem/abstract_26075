Proceeding from the method of stochastic perturbation of a Langevin system
associated with the non-viscous Burgers equation we construct a solution to the
Riemann problem for the non-interacting particles and sticky particles systems.
We analyze the difference in the behavior of discontinuous solutions for these
two models and relations between them.
