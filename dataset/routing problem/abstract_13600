We consider the problem of reconstruction of dielectrics from blind
backscattered experimental data. Experimental data were collected by a device,
which was built at University of North Carolina at Charlotte. This device sends
electrical pulses into the medium and collects the time resolved backscattered
data on a part of a plane. The spatially distributed dielectric constant
$\varepsilon_{r}(\mathbf{x}),\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^{3}$ is the unknown
coefficient of a wave-like PDE. This coefficient is reconstructed from those
data in blind cases. To do this, a globally convergent numerical method is
used.
