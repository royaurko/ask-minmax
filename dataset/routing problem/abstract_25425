Parameter estimation in cognitive communications can be formulated as a
multi-user estimation problem, which is solvable under maximum likelihood
solution but involves high computational complexity. This paper presents a
time-sharing and interference mitigation based EKF (Extended Kalman Filter)
design for joint CFO (carrier frequency offset) and channel estimation at
multiple cognitive users. The key objective is to realize low implementation
complexity by decomposing highdimensional parameters into multiple separate
low-dimensional estimation problems, which can be solved in a time-shared
manner via pipelining operation. We first present a basic EKF design that
estimates the parameters from one TX user to one RX antenna. Then such basic
design is time-shared and reused to estimate parameters from multiple TX users
to multiple RX antennas. Meanwhile, we use interference mitigation module to
cancel the co-channel interference at each RX sample. In addition, we further
propose adaptive noise variance tracking module to improve the estimation
performance. The proposed design enjoys low delay and low buffer size (because
of its online real-time processing), as well as low implementation complexity
(because of time-sharing and pipeling design). Its estimation performance is
verified to be close to Cramer-Rao bound.
