The evolution of a universe with Brans-Dicke gravity and nonzero curvature is
investigated here. We present the equations of motion and their solutions
during the radiation dominated era. In a Friedman-Robertson-Walker cosmology we
show explicitly that the three possible values of curvature $\kappa=+1,0,-1$
divide the evolution of the Brans-Dicke universe into dynamically distinct
classes just as for the standard model. Subsequently we discuss the flatness
problem which exists in Brans-Dicke gravity as it does in the standard model.
In addition, we demonstrate a flatness problem in MAD Brans-Dicke gravity. In
general, in any model that addresses the horizon problem, including inflation,
there are two components to the flatness issue: i) at the Planck epoch
curvature gains importance, and ii) during accelerated expansion curvature
becomes less important and the universe flattens. In many cases the universe
must be very flat at the Planck scale in order for the accelerated epoch to be
reached, thus there can be a residual flatness problem.
