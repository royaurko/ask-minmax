Current approaches to semantics in the geospatial domain are mainly based on
ontologies, but ontologies, since continue to build entirely on the symbolic
methodology, suffers from the classical problems, e.g. the symbol grounding
problem, affecting representational theories. We claim for an enactive approach
to semantics, where meaning is considered to be an emergent feature arising
context-dependently in action. Since representational theories are unable to
deal with context, a new formalism is required toward a contextual theory of
concepts. SCOP is considered a promising formalism in this sense and is briefly
described.
