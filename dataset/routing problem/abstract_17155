Despite the intractability of generic optimal partially observable Markov
decision process planning, there exist important problems that have highly
structured models. Previous researchers have used this insight to construct
more efficient algorithms for factored domains, and for domains with
topological structure in the flat state dynamics model. In our work, motivated
by findings from the education community relevant to automated tutoring, we
consider problems that exhibit a form of topological structure in the factored
dynamics model. Our Reachable Anytime Planner for Imprecisely-sensed Domains
(RAPID) leverages this structure to efficiently compute a good initial envelope
of reachable states under the optimal MDP policy in time linear in the number
of state variables. RAPID performs partially-observable planning over the
limited envelope of states, and slowly expands the state space considered as
time allows. RAPID performs well on a large tutoring-inspired problem
simulation with 122 state variables, corresponding to a flat state space of
over 10^30 states.
