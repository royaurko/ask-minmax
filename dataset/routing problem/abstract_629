Exit paths in buildings are designed to minimise evacuation time when the
building is at full capacity. We present an evacuation support system which
does this regardless of the number of evacuees. The core concept is to even-out
congestion in the building by diverting evacuees to less-congested paths in
order to make maximal usage of all accessible routes throughout the entire
evacuation process. The system issues a set of flow-optimal routes using a
capacity-constrained routing algorithm which anticipates evolutions in path
metrics using the concept of "future capacity reservation". In order to direct
evacuees in an intuitive manner whilst implementing the routing algorithm's
scheme, we use dynamic exit signs, i.e. whose pointing direction can be
controlled. To make this system practical and minimise reliance on sensors
during the evacuation, we use an evacuee mobility model and make several
assumptions on the characteristics of the evacuee flow. We validate this
concept using simulations, and show how the underpinning assumptions may limit
the system's performance, especially in low-headcount evacuations.
