In this paper, we propose new sequential estimation methods based on
inclusion principle. The main idea is to reformulate the estimation problems as
constructing sequential random intervals and use confidence sequences to
control the associated coverage probabilities. In contrast to existing
asymptotic sequential methods, our estimation procedures rigorously guarantee
the pre-specified levels of confidence.
