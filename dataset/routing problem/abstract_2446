Spintronics is an approach to electronics in which the spin of the electrons
is exploited to control the electric resistance R of devices. One basic
building block is the spin-valve, which is formed if two ferromagnetic
electrodes are separated by a thin tunneling barrier. In such devices, R
depends on the orientation of the magnetisation of the electrodes. It is
usually larger in the antiparallel than in the parallel configuration. The
relative difference of R, the so-called magneto-resistance (MR), is then
positive. Common devices, such as the giant magneto-resistance sensor used in
reading heads of hard disks, are based on this phenomenon. The MR may become
anomalous (negative), if the transmission probability of electrons through the
device is spin or energy dependent. This offers a route to the realisation of
gate-tunable MR devices, because transmission probabilities can readily be
tuned in many devices with an electrical gate signal. Such devices have,
however, been elusive so far. We report here on a pronounced gate-field
controlled MR in devices made from carbon nanotubes with ferromagnetic
contacts. Both the amplitude and the sign of the MR are tunable with the gate
voltage in a predictable manner. We emphasise that this spin-field effect is
not restricted to carbon nanotubes but constitutes a generic effect which can
in principle be exploited in all resonant tunneling devices.
