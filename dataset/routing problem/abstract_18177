So-called functional error estimators provide a valuable tool for reliably
estimating the discretization error for a sum of two convex functions. We apply
this concept to Tikhonov regularization for the solution of inverse problems
for partial differential equations, not only for quadratic Hilbert space
regularization terms but also for nonsmooth Banach space penalties. Examples
include the measure-space norm (i.e., sparsity regularization) or the indicator
function of an $L^\infty$ ball (i.e., Ivanov regularization). The error
estimators can be written in terms of residuals in the optimality system that
can then be estimated by conventional techniques, thus leading to explicit
estimators. This is illustrated by means of an elliptic inverse source problem
with the above-mentioned penalties, and numerical results are provided for the
case of sparsity regularization.
