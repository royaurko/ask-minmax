Planar microcavities with distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) host, besides
confined optical modes, also mechanical resonances due to stop bands in the
phonon dispersion relation of the DBRs. These resonances have frequencies in
the sub-terahertz (10E10-10E11 Hz) range with quality factors exceeding 1000.
The interaction of photons and phonons in such optomechanical systems can be
drastically enhanced, opening a new route toward manipulation of light. Here we
implemented active semiconducting layers into the microcavity to obtain a
vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL). Thereby three resonant
excitations -photons, phonons, and electrons- can interact strongly with each
other providing control of the VCSEL laser emission: a picosecond strain pulse
injected into the VCSEL excites long-living mechanical resonances therein. As a
result, modulation of the lasing intensity at frequencies up to 40 GHz is
observed. From these findings prospective applications such as THz laser
control and stimulated phonon emission may emerge.
