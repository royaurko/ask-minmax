Accretion onto a compact object must occur through a disc when the material
has some initial angular momentum. Thin discs and the thicker low radiative
efficiency accretion flows are solutions to this problem that have been widely
studied and applied. This is an introduction to these accretion flows within
the context of X-ray binaries and cataclysmic variables.
