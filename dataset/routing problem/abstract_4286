In calculations of the inspiral of binary black holes an intermediate
approximation is needed that can bridge the post-Newtonian methods of the early
inspiral and the numerical relativity computations of the final plunge. We
describe here the periodic standing wave approximation: A numerical solution is
found to the problem of a periodic rotating binary with helically symmetric
standing wave fields, and from this solution an approximation is extracted for
the physically relevant problem of inspiral with outgoing waves. The
approximation underlying this approach has been recently confirmed with
innovative numerical methods applied to nonlinear model problems.
