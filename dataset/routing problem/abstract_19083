High contrast imaging searches for exoplanets have been conducted on 2.4-10 m
telescopes, typically at H band (1.6 microns) and used exposure times of ~1 hr
to search for planets with semi-major axes of > ~10 AU. We are beginning to
plan for surveys using extreme-AO systems on the next generation of 30-meter
class telescopes, where we hope to begin probing the habitable zones (HZs) of
nearby stars. Here we highlight a heretofore ignorable problem in direct
imaging: planets orbit their stars. Under the parameters of current surveys,
orbital motion is negligible over the duration of a typical observation.
However, this motion is not negligible when using large diameter telescopes to
observe at relatively close stellar distances (1-10pc), over the long exposure
times (10-20 hrs) necessary for direct detection of older planets in the HZ. We
show that this motion will limit our achievable signal-to-noise ratio and
degrade observational completeness. Even on current 8m class telescopes,
orbital motion will need to be accounted for in an attempt to detect HZ planets
around the nearest sun-like stars alpha Cen A & B, a binary system now known to
harbor at least one planet. Here we derive some basic tools for analyzing this
problem, and ultimately show that the prospects are good for de-orbiting a
series of shorter exposures to correct for orbital motion.
