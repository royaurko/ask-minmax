Hilbert showed that for most $(n,m)$ there exist psd forms $p(x_1,...,x_n)$
of degree $m$ which cannot be written as a sum of squares of forms. His 17th
problem asked whether, in this case, there exists a form $h$ so that $h^2p$ is
a sum of squares of forms; that is, $p$ is a sum of squares of rational
functions with denominator $h$. We show that, for every such $(n,m)$ there does
not exist a single form $h$ which serves in this way as a denominator for {\it
every} psd $p(x_1,...,x_n)$ of degree $m$.
