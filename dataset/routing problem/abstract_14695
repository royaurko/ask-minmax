The web page contains both the dvi and postscript version of the paper. This
paper presents the method of applying the Melnikov method to autonomous
Hamiltonian systems in dimension four. Besides giving an application to
Celestial Mechanics, it discusses the problem of convergence of the Melnikov
function and the derivative of the Melnikov function.
