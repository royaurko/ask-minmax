Many problems in computational science and engineering involve partial
differential equations and thus require the numerical solution of large, sparse
(non)linear systems of equations. Multigrid is known to be one of the most
efficient methods for this purpose. However, the concrete multigrid algorithm
and its implementation highly depend on the underlying problem and hardware.
Therefore, changes in the code or many different variants are necessary to
cover all relevant cases. In this article we provide a prototype implementation
in Scala for a framework that allows abstract descriptions of PDEs, their
discretization, and their numerical solution via multigrid algorithms. From
these, one is able to generate data structures and implementations of multigrid
components required to solve elliptic PDEs on structured grids. Two different
test problems showcase our proposed automatic generation of multigrid solvers
for both CPU and GPU target platforms.
