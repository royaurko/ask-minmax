We present new point of view on the old problem, the Kramers problem. The
passage from the Fokker-Planck equation to the Smoluchowski equation, including
corrections to the Smoluchowski current, is treated through an asymptotic
expansion of the solution of the stochastic dynamical equations. The case of an
extremely weak force of friction is also discussed
