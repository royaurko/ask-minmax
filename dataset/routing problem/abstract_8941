In [N. A. Baas, Emergence, Hierarchies, and Hyper-structures, in C.G. Langton
ed., Artificial Life III, Addison Wesley, 1994.] a general framework for the
study of Emergence and hyper-structure was presented. This approach is mostly
concerned with the description of such systems. In this paper we will try to
bring forth a different aspect of this model we feel will be useful in the
engineering of agent based solutions, namely the symbiotic approach. In this
approach a self-organizing method of dividing the more complex "main-problem"
to a hyper-structure of "sub-problems" with the aim of reducing complexity is
desired. A description of the general problem will be given along with some
instances of related work. This paper is intended to serve as an introductory
challenge for general solutions to the described problem.
