We establish the relation between full traces of the Green functions for some
initial and the Darboux transformed one-dimensional two component Dirac
problems with the most general form of potential. The result is used to check
the completeness of set of wave functions obtained by the Darboux
transformation of the eigenfunctions set for the initial Dirac problem with
some typical boundary conditions.
