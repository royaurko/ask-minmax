In this paper we consider a variant of the orthogonal range reporting problem
when all points should be reported in the sorted order of their
$x$-coordinates. We show that reporting two-dimensional points with this
additional condition can be organized (almost) as efficiently as the standard
range reporting.
  Moreover, our results generalize and improve the previously known results for
the orthogonal range successor problem and can be used to obtain better
solutions for some stringology problems.
