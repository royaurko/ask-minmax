Structural, electrical and magnetic properties of Bi0.9-xLa0.1ErxFeO3
(BLEFOx) (x = 0.05, 0.07, 0.1) polycrystalline ceramics prepared by solid
solution route were studied. A phase transition from rhombohedral phase to
monoclinic phase was observed for x=0.05-0.1 in (BLEFOx). We have measured
phase transition temperatures both alpha-beta transition and low-Temperature
(low-T) transitions in doped BiFeO3. The transition peak near to 835C
corresponds to alpha to beta-phase transition of BiFeO3 were measured using
diffential thermal analysis (DTA). Dielectric measurements shows the low-T
transitions in BLEFOx (x = 0.05-0.1). Relatively high remanent magnetization of
0.1178emu/gm at 8T was observed in BLEFOx (x = 0.1).
