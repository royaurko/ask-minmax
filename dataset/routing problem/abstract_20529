The properties of nonlinear PDEs that generate filtered solutions are
explored with particular attention given to the constraints on the residual
term. The analysis is carried out for nonlinear PDEs with an emphasis on
evolution problems recast on space-time-scale. We examine the role of
approximation that allow for the generation of solutions on isolated scale
slices.
