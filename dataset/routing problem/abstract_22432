McDuff and Schlenk determined when a four-dimensional ellipsoid can be
symplectically embedded into a four-dimensional ball, and found that when the
ellipsoid is close to round, the answer is given by an "infinite staircase"
determined by the odd-index Fibonacci numbers. We show that this result still
holds in higher dimensions when we "stabilize" the embedding problem.
