Previous contributors have considered the problem of the medium effects on single
gluon bremsstrahlung associated with producing a high-energy particle in a
finite, time-dependent QCD plasma. Working to leading logarithmic order, I show
that the result for the bremsstrahlung gluon spectrum can be cast into a
remarkably simple form in the general case. I similarly analyze the process of
pair production. Also, I comment on the radius of convergence of the opacity
expansion in cases where the leading-log approximation holds, showing that the
opacity expansion does not converge when the thickness of the plasma is greater
than roughly the bremsstrahlung formation time. Additionally, as a special
bonus -- available for a limited time only while supplies last! -- I summarize
translations between the notation used by a few of the groups who have worked
on this and related problems.
