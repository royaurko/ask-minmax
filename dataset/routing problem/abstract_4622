This paper provides a new algorithm for solving inverse problems, based on
the minimization of the $L^2$ norm and on the control of the Total Variation.
It consists in relaxing the role of the Total Variation in the classical Total
Variation minimization approach, which permits us to get better approximation
to the inverse problems. The numerical results on the deconvolution problem
show that our method outperforms some previous ones.
