This paper presents and experiments approaches to solve a new bi-objective
routing problem called the ring star problem. It consists of locating a simple
cycle through a subset of nodes of a graph while optimizing two kinds of cost.
The first objective is the minimization of a ring cost that is related to the
length of the cycle. The second one is the minimization of an assignment cost
from non-visited nodes to visited ones. In spite of its obvious bi-objective
formulation, this problem has always been investigated in a single-objective
way. To tackle the bi-objective ring star problem, we first investigate
different stand-alone search methods. Then, we propose two cooperative
strategies that combines two multiple objective metaheuristics: an elitist
evolutionary algorithm and a population-based local search. We apply this new
hybrid approaches to well-known benchmark test instances and demonstrate their
effectiveness in comparison to non-hybrid algorithms and to state-of-the-art
methods.
