In this paper, we report the nature of transition to generalized
synchronization (GS) in a system of two coupled scalar piecewise linear
time-delay systems using the auxiliary system approach. We demonstrate that the
transition to GS occurs via on-off intermittency route and also it exhibits
characteristically distinct behaviors for different coupling configurations. In
particular, the intermittency transition occurs in a rather broad range of
coupling strength for error feedback coupling configuration and in a narrow
range of coupling strength for direct feedback coupling configuration. It is
also shown that the intermittent dynamics displays periodic bursts of period
equal to the delay time of the response system in the former case, while they
occur in random time intervals of finite duration in the latter case. The
robustness of these transitions with system parameters and delay times has also
been studied for both linear and nonlinear coupling configurations. The results
are corroborated analytically by suitable stability conditions for
asymptotically stable synchronized states and numerically by the probability of
synchronization and by the transition of \emph{sub}Lyapunov exponents of the
coupled time-delay systems. We have also indicated the reason behind these
distinct transitions by referring to unstable periodic orbit theory of
intermittency synchronization in low-dimensional systems.
