Fractional integral operators connected with real-valued scalar functions of
matrix argument are applied in problems of mathematics, statistics and natural
sciences. In this article we start considering the case of a Gauss
hypergeometric function with the argument being a rectangular matrix.
Subsequently some fractional integral operators are introduced which complement
these results available on fractional operators in the matrix variate cases.
Several properties and limiting forms are derived. Then the pathway idea is
incorporated to move among several different functional forms. When these are
used as models for problems in the natural sciences then these can cover the
ideal situations, neighborhoods, in between stages and paths leading to optimal
situations.
