The shift from industrial economy to knowledge economy in today's world has
revolutionalized strategic planning in organizations as well as their problem
solving approaches. The point of focus today is knowledge and service
production with more emphasis been laid on knowledge capital. Many
organizations are investing on tools that facilitate knowledge sharing among
their employees and they are as well promoting and encouraging collaboration
among their staff in order to build the organization's knowledge capital with
the ultimate goal of creating a lasting competitive advantage for their
organizations. One of the current leading approaches used for solving
organization's decision problem is the Economic Intelligence (EI) approach
which involves interactions among various actors called EI actors. These actors
collaborate to ensure the overall success of the decision problem solving
process. In the course of the collaboration, the actors express knowledge which
could be capitalized for future reuse. In this paper, we propose in the first
place, an annotation model for knowledge elicitation among EI actors. Because
of the need to build a knowledge capital, we also propose a dynamic knowledge
capitalisation approach for managing knowledge produced by the actors. Finally,
the need to manage the interactions and the interdependencies among
collaborating EI actors, led to our third proposition which constitute an
awareness mechanism for group work management.
