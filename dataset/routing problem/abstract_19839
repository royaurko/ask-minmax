A brief review of the strategies used in looking for CP violation in B decays
is presented. Some problems due to penguin diagrams are addressed. Penguin
trapping is discussed, in the context of the upcoming experiments. The high
rates and the possibility to perform experiments on the $B_s$ system justify
the interest in hadronic colliders.
