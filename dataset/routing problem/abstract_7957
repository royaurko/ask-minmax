In these lectures I give an introduction to the time-dependent approach to
inverse scattering, that has been developed recently. The aim of this approach
is to solve various inverse scattering problems with time-dependent methods
that closely follow the physical (and geometrical) intuition of the scattering
phenomena. This method has been applied to many linear and nonlinear scattering
problems.
