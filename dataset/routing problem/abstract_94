The solution of the biobjective IRP is rather challenging, even for
metaheuristics. We are still lacking a profound understanding of appropriate
solution representations and effective neighborhood structures. Clearly, both
the delivery volumes and the routing aspects of the alternatives need to be
reflected in an encoding, and must be modified when searching by means of local
search. Our work contributes to the better understanding of such solution
representations. On the basis of an experimental investigation, the advantages
and drawbacks of two encodings are studied and compared.
