This paper investigates the existence of positive solutions of a singular
boundary value problem with negative exponent similar to standard Emden--Fowler
equation. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of $C[0,1]$
positive solutions as well as $C^{1}[0,1]$ positive solutions is given by means
of the method of lower and upper solutions with the Schauder fixed point
theorem.
