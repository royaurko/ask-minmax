A discretisation scheme for heterogeneous anisotropic diffusion problems on
general meshes is developed and studied. The unknowns of this scheme are the
values at the centre of the control volumes and at some internal interfaces
which may for instance be chosen at the diffusion tensor discontinuities. The
scheme is therefore completely cell centred if no edge unknown is kept. It is
shown to be accurate on several numerical examples. Mathematical convergence of
the approximate solution to the continuous solution is obtained for general
(possibly discontinuous) tensors, general (possibly non-conforming) meshes, and
with no regularity assumption on the solution. An error estimate is then drawn
under sufficient regularity assumptions on the solution.
