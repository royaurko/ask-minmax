In this paper we consider the mixed problem for the wave equation exterior to
a non-trapping obstacle in odd space dimensions. We derive a rate of the
convergence of the solution for the mixed problem to a solution for the Cauchy
problem. As a by-product, we are able to find out the radiation field of
solutions to the mixed problem in terms of the scattering data.
