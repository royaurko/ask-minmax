Collaborative data consist of ratings relating two distinct sets of objects:
users and items. Much of the work with such data focuses on filtering:
predicting unknown ratings for pairs of users and items. In this paper we focus
on the problem of visualizing the information. Given all of the ratings, our
task is to embed all of the users and items as points in the same Euclidean
space. We would like to place users near items that they have rated (or would
rate) high, and far away from those they would give a low rating. We pose this
problem as a real-valued non-linear Bayesian network and employ Markov chain
Monte Carlo and expectation maximization to find an embedding. We present a
metric by which to judge the quality of a visualization and compare our results
to local linear embedding and Eigentaste on three real-world datasets.
