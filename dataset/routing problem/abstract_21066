The main objective of this paper is twofold. We first show that if the
doubly-weighted Bohr spectrum of an almost periodic function exists, then it is
either empty or coincides with the Bohr spectrum of that function. Next, we
investigate the problem which consists of the existence of doubly-weighted
pseudo-almost periodic solutions to some nonautonomous abstract differential
equations.
