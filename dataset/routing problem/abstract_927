We report enhanced superconductivity in bilayer thin films consisting of
superconducting La$_{1.6-x}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ with 0.06 $\leq x<$
0.20 and metallic but non-superconducting La$_{1.55}$Sr$_{0.45}$CuO$_{4}$.
These bilayers show a maximum increase in superconducting transition
temperature ($T_c$) of more than 200% for $x$ = 0.06 while no change in $T_c$
is observed for the bilayers with $x\geq$ 0.20. The analysis of the critical
current and kinetic inductance data suggests 2-3 unit cells thick interfacial
layer electronically perturbed to have a higher $T_c$. A simple charge transfer
model with cation intermixing explains the observed $T_c$ in bilayers. Still
the unusually large thickness of interfacial superconducting layers can not be
explained in terms of this model. We believe the stripe relaxation as well as
the proximity effect also influence the superconductivity of the interface.
