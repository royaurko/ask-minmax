Motifs of periodic modulations are encountered in a variety of natural
systems, where at least two rival states are present. In strongly correlated
electron systems such behaviour has typically been associated with competition
between short- and long-range interactions, e.g., between exchange and
dipole-dipole interactions in the case of ferromagnetic thin films. Here we
show that spin-stripe textures may develop also in antiferromagnets, where
long-range dipole-dipole magnetic interactions are absent. A comprehensive
analysis of magnetic susceptibility, high-field magnetization, specific heat,
and neutron diffraction measurements unveils $\beta$-TeVO$_4$ as a nearly
perfect realization of a frustrated (zigzag) ferromagnetic spin-1/2 chain.
Strikingly, a narrow spin stripe phase develops at elevated magnetic fields due
to weak frustrated short-range interchain exchange interactions possibly
assisted by the symmetry allowed electric polarization. This concept provides
an alternative route for the stripe formation in strongly correlated electron
systems and may help understanding other widespread, yet still elusive,
stripe-related phenomena.
