The general subject considered in this thesis is a recently discovered coding
technique, polar coding, which is used to construct a class of error correction
codes with unique properties. In his ground-breaking work, Ar{\i}kan proved
that this class of codes, called polar codes, achieve the symmetric capacity
--- the mutual information evaluated at the uniform input distribution ---of
any stationary binary discrete memoryless channel with low complexity encoders
and decoders requiring in the order of $O(N\log N)$ operations in the
block-length $N$. This discovery settled the long standing open problem left by
Shannon of finding low complexity codes achieving the channel capacity.
  Polar coding settled an open problem in information theory, yet opened plenty
of challenging problems that need to be addressed. A significant part of this
thesis is dedicated to advancing the knowledge about this technique in two
directions. The first one provides a better understanding of polar coding by
generalizing some of the existing results and discussing their implications,
and the second one studies the robustness of the theory over communication
models introducing various forms of uncertainty or variations into the
probabilistic model of the channel.
