In this paper we present a theory for the existence of multiple nontrivial
solutions for a class of perturbed Hammerstein integral equations. Our
methodology, rather than to work directly in cones, is to utilize the theory of
fixed point index on affine cones. This approach is fairly general and covers a
class of nonlocal boundary value problems for functional differential
equations. Some examples are given in order to illustrate our theoretical
results.
