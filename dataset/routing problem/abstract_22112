In this paper we give a general condition on the absorption term of the
1-Laplace elliptic equation for the existence of suitable large solutions. This
condition can be considered as the correspondent Keller-Osserman condition for
the $p$-Laplacian, in the case $p=1$. We also provide conditions that guarantee
uniqueness for solutions to such problems.
