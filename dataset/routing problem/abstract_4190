Two different problems are considered here. First, a version of Schwarz-Pick
Lemma for $n$ points leads to an interpolation problem for analytic functions
from the disc into itself, which may be considered as a particular case of the
classical Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation problem. Second, a characterization of
sampling sequences for this class of functions is given.
