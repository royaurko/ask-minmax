In this research work, we advise gateway based energy-efficient routing
protocol (M-GEAR) for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). We divide the sensor
nodes into four logical regions on the basis of their location in the sensing
field. We install Base Station (BS) out of the sensing area and a gateway node
at the centre of the sensing area. If the distance of a sensor node from BS or
gateway is less than predefined distance threshold, the node uses direct
communication. We divide the rest of nodes into two equal regions whose
distance is beyond the threshold distance. We select cluster heads (CHs)in each
region which are independent of the other region. These CHs are selected on the
basis of a probability. We compare performance of our protocol with LEACH (Low
Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy). Performance analysis and compared
statistic results show that our proposed protocol perform well in terms of
energy consumption and network lifetime.
