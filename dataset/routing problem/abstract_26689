It has been suggested that, when faced with large amounts of uncertainty in
situations of automated control, type-2 fuzzy logic based controllers will
out-perform the simpler type-1 varieties due to the latter lacking the
flexibility to adapt accordingly. This paper aims to investigate this problem
in detail in order to analyse when a type-2 controller will improve upon type-1
performance. A robotic sailing boat is subjected to several experiments in
which the uncertainty and difficulty of the sailing problem is increased in
order to observe the effects on measured performance. Improved performance is
observed but not in every case. The size of the FOU is shown to be have a large
effect on performance with potentially severe performance penalties for
incorrectly sized footprints.
