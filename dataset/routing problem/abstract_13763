In this paper we formulate the nonnegative matrix factorisation (NMF) problem
as a maximum likelihood estimation problem for hidden Markov models and propose
online expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithms to estimate the NMF and the
other unknown static parameters. We also propose a sequential Monte Carlo
approximation of our online EM algorithm. We show the performance of the
proposed method with two numerical examples.
