A triangulation of a planar point set S is a maximal plane straight-line
graph with vertex set S. In the minimum-weight triangulation (MWT) problem, we
are looking for a triangulation of a given point set that minimizes the sum of
the edge lengths. We prove that the decision version of this problem is
NP-hard. We use a reduction from PLANAR-1-IN-3-SAT. The correct working of the
gadgets is established with computer assistance, using dynamic programming on
polygonal faces, as well as the beta-skeleton heuristic to certify that certain
edges belong to the minimum-weight triangulation.
