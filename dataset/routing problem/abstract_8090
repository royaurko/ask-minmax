The problem of determining necessary and sufficient conditions for a set of
real numbers to be the eigenvalues of a symmetric nonnegative matrix is called
the symmetric nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem (SNIEP). In this paper we
solve SNIEP in the case of trace zero symmetric nonnegative 5x5 matrices.
