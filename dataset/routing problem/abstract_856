We have first succeefully synthesized the sodium cobalt oxyhydrate
superconductors using KMnO4 as a de-intercalating and oxidizing agent. It is a
novel route to form the superconductive phase of NaxCoO2.yH2O without resorting
to the commonly used Br2/CH3CN solution. The role of the KMnO4 is to
de-intercalate the Na+ from the parent compound Na0.7CoO2 and oxidize the Co
ion as a result. The higher molar ratio of KMnO4 relative to the sodium content
tends to remove more Na+ from the parent compound and results in a slight
expansion of the c-axis in the unit cell. The superconducting transition
temperature is 4.6-3.8 K for samples treated by the aqueous KMnO4 solution with
the molar ratio of KMnO4 relative to the sodium content in the range of 0.3 and
2.29.
