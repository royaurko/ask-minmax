The multiple disorder problem seeks to determine a sequence of stopping times
which are as close as possible to the unknown times of disorders at which the
observation process changes its probability characteristics. We derive closed
form solutions in two formulations of the multiple disorder problem for an
observable Brownian motion with switching constant drift rates. The method of
proof is based on the reduction of the initial problems to appropriate optimal
switching problems and the analysis of the associated coupled free-boundary
problems. We also describe the sequential switching multiple disorder detection
procedures resulting from these formulations.
