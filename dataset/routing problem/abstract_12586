We study different notions of slope of a vector bundle over a smooth
projective curve with respect to ampleness and affineness in order to apply
this to tight closure problems. This method gives new degree estimates from
above and from below for the tight closure of a homogeneous $R_+$-primary ideal
in a two-dimensional normal standard-graded algebra $R$ in terms of the minimal
and the maximal slope of the sheaf of relations for some ideal generators. If
moreover this sheaf of relations is semistable, then both degree estimates
coincide and we get a vanishing type theorem.
