We present evidence of magnetically controlled guided vortex motion in a
hybrid superconductor/ferromagnet nanosystem consisting of an Al film on top of
a square array of permalloy square rings. When the rings are magnetized with an
in-plane external field H, an array of point-like dipoles with moments
antiparallel to H, is formed. The resulting magnetic template generates a
strongly anisotropic pinning potential landscape for vortices in the
superconducting layer. Transport measurements show that this anisotropy is able
to confine the flux motion along the high symmetry axes of the square lattice
of dipoles. This guided vortex motion can be either re-routed by 90 degrees by
simply changing the dipole orientation or even strongly suppressed by inducing
a flux-closure magnetic state with very low stray fields in the rings.
