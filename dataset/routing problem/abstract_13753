The Erd\"os-Moser equation is a Diophantine equation proposed more than 60
years ago which remains unresolved to this day. In this paper, we consider the
problem in terms of divisibility of power sums and in terms of certain Egyptian
fraction equations. As a consequence, we show that solutions must satisfy
strong divisibility properties and a restrictive Egyptian fraction equation.
Our studies lead us to results on the Bernoulli numbers and allow us to
motivate Moser's original approach to the problem.
