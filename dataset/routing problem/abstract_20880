We prove that the general isolevel set of the ultra-discrete periodic Toda
lattice is isomorphic to the tropical Jacobian associated with the tropical
spectral curve. This result implies that the theta function solution obtained
in the contributors' previous paper is the complete solution. We also propose a
method to solve the initial value problem.
