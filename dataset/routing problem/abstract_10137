An attempt is made to review the heat transfer and the related problems
encountered in the simulation of single crystal growth. The peculiarities of
conductive, convective and radiative heat transfer in the different melt,
solution, and vapour growth methods are discussed. The importance of the
adequate description of the optical crystal properties (semitransparency,
specular reflecting surfaces) and their effect on the heat transfer is
stresses. Treatment of the unknown phase boundary fluid/crystal as well as
problems related to the assessment of the quality of the grown crystals
(composition, thermal stresses, point defects, disclocations etc.) and their
coupling to the heat transfer/fluid flow problems is considered. Differences
between the crystal growth simulation codes intended for the research and for
the industrial applications are indicated. The problems of the code
verification and validation are discussed; a brief review of the experimental
techniques for the study of heat transfer and flow structure in crystal growth
is presented. The state of the art of the optimization of the growth facilities
and technological processes is discussed. An example of the computations of the
heat transfer and crystal growth of bulk SiC crystals by the sublimation method
is presented.
