The supersymmetric $SU(6)$ model accompanied by the flavour-blind discrete
symmetry $Z_3$ can succesfully deal with such key problems of SUSY GUTs, as are
the gauge hierarchy/doublet-triplet splitting, $\mu$-problem and flavour
problem. The Higgs doublets arise as Goldstone modes of the spontaneously
broken {\em accidental} global $SU(6)\times U(6)$ symmetry of the Higgs
superpotential. Their couplings to fermions have peculiarities leading to the
consistent picture of the quark and lepton masses and mixing, without invoking
any of horizontal symmetry/zero texture concepts. In particular, the only
particle that has direct Yukawa coupling with the Higgs doublet is top quark.
Other fermion masses appear from the higher order operators, with natural mass
hierarchy. Specific mass formulas are also obtained. [On the basis of talks
