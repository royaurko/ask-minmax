In this short paper, we give an upper bound for the number of different basic
feasible solutions generated by the simplex method for linear programming
problems having optimal solutions. The bound is polynomial of the number of
constraints, the number of variables, and the ratio between the minimum and the
maximum values of all the positive elements of primal basic feasible solutions.
When the primal problem is nondegenerate, it becomes a bound for the number of
iterations. We show some basic results when it is applied to special linear
programming problems. The results include strongly polynomiality of the simplex
method for Markov Decision Problem by Ye and utilize its analysis.
