In the present paper I show how it is possible to derive the Hilbert space
formulation of Quantum Mechanics from a comprehensive definition of "physical
experiment" and assuming "experimental accessibility and simplicity" as
specified by five simple Postulates. This accomplishes the program presented in
form of conjectures in the previous paper quant-ph/0506034. Pivotal roles are
played by the "local observability principle", which reconciles the holism of
nonlocality with the reductionism of local observation, and by the postulated
existence of "informationally complete observables" and of a "symmetric
faithful state". This last notion allows one to introduce an operational
definition for the real version of the "adjoint"--i. e. the transposition--from
which one can derive a real Hilbert-space structure via either the
Mackey-Kakutani or the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal constructions. Here I analyze in
detail only the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, which leads to a real
Hilbert space structure analogous to that of (classes of generally unbounded)
selfadjoint operators in Quantum Mechanics. For finite dimensions, general
dimensionality theorems that can be derived from a local observability
principle, allow us to represent the elements of the real Hilbert space as
operators over an underlying complex Hilbert space (see, however, a still open
problem at the end of the paper). The route for the present operational
axiomatization was suggested by novel ideas originated from Quantum Tomography.
