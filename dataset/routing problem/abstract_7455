The interface problem for the linear Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation in
one-dimensional piecewise homogeneous domains is examined by constructing an
explicit solution in each domain. The location of the interface is known and a
number of compatibility conditions at the boundary are imposed. We provide an
explicit characterization of sufficient interface conditions for the
construction of a solution using Fokas's Unified Transform Method. The problem
and the method considered here extend that of earlier papers to problems with
more than two spatial derivatives.
