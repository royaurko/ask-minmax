Multipath routing is a trivial way to exploit the path diversity to leverage
the network throughput. Technologies such as OSPF ECMP use all the available
paths in the network to forward traffic, however, we argue that is not
necessary to do so to load balance the network. In this paper, we consider
multipath routing with only a limited number of end-to-end paths for each
source and destination, and found that this can still load balance the traffic.
We devised an algorithm to select a few paths for each source-destination pair
so that when all traffic are forwarded over these paths, we can achieve a
balanced load in the sense that the maximum link utilization is comparable to
that of ECMP forwarding. When the constraint of only shortest paths (i.e. equal
paths) are relaxed, we can even outperform ECMP in certain cases. As a result,
we can use a few end-to-end tunnels between each source and destination nodes
to achieve the load balancing of traffic.
