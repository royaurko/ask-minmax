The distributed synthesis problem is about constructing cor- rect distributed
systems, i.e., systems that satisfy a given specification. We consider a
slightly more general problem of distributed control, where the goal is to
restrict the behavior of a given distributed system in order to satisfy the
specification. Our systems are finite state machines that communicate via
rendez-vous (Zielonka automata). We show decidability of the synthesis problem
for all omega-regular local specifications, under the restriction that the
communication graph of the system is acyclic. This result extends a previous
decidability result for a restricted form of local reachability specifications.
