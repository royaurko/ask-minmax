I review three different problems occuring in two dimensional field theory:
1) classification of conformal field theories; 2) construction of lattice
integrable realizations of the latter; 3) solutions to the WDVV equations of
topological field theories. I show that a structure of Coxeter group is hidden
behind these three related problems.
