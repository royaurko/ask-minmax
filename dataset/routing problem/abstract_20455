This note being is devoted to the unraveling of the algebraic structure,
which governs the quadratic nonhamiltonian interaction of two rotators
described in the first part. It should be considered in the context of a
general ideology of the inverse problem of representation theory (see
mp_arc/96-477). The resulted objects are formalized as Lie algebras with
operators (Lie algebras with additional unary operations).
