Let $u$ be a solution of the Cauchy problem for the nonlinear parabolic
equation $$ \partial_t u=\Delta u+F(x,t,u,\nabla u) \quad in \quad{\bf
R}^N\times(0,\infty), \quad u(x,0)=\varphi(x)\quad in \quad{\bf R}^N, $$ and
assume that the solution $u$ behaves like the Gauss kernel as $t\to\infty$. In
this paper, under suitable assumptions of the reaction term $F$ and the initial
function $\varphi$, we establish the method of obtaining higher order
asymptotic expansions of the solution $u$ as $t\to\infty$. This paper is a
generalization of our previous paper, and our arguments are applicable to the
large class of nonlinear parabolic equations.
