We describe local similarities and global differences between minimal
surfaces in Euclidean 3-space and constant mean curvature 1 surfaces in
hyperbolic 3-space. We also describe how to solve global period problems for
constant mean curvature 1 surfaces in hyperbolic 3-space, and we give an
overview of recent results on these surfaces. We include computer graphics of a
number of examples.
