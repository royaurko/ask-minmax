A new asymmetric cryptosystem based on the Integer Factorization Problem is
proposed. It posses an encryption and decryption speed of $O(n^2)$, thus making
it the fastest asymmetric encryption scheme available. It has a simple
mathematical structure. Thus, it would have low computational requirements and
would enable communication devices with low computing power to deploy secure
communication procedures efficiently.
