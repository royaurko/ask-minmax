The number of users using wireless Local Area Network is increasing
exponentially and their behavior is changing day after day. Nowadays, users of
wireless LAN are using huge amount of bandwidth because of the explosive growth
of some services and applications such as video sharing. This situation imposes
massive pressure on the wireless LAN performance especially in term of fairness
among wireless stations. The limited resources are not distributed fairly in
saturated conditions. The most important resource is the access point buffer
space. This importance is a result of access point being the bottleneck between
two different types of networks. These two types are wired network with
relatively huge bandwidth and wireless network with much smaller bandwidth.
Also the unfairness problem is keep getting worse because of the greedy nature
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive
study on wireless LAN dynamics and proposed a new mathematical model that
describes the performance and effects of its behavior. We validate the proposed
model by using the simulation technique. The proposed model was able to produce
very good approximation in most of the cases. It also gave us a great insight
into the effective variables in the wireless LAN behavior and what are the
dimensions of the unfairness problem.
