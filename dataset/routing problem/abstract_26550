The use of copula-based models in EDAs (estimation of distribution
algorithms) is currently an active area of research. In this context, the
copulaedas package for R provides a platform where EDAs based on copulas can be
implemented and studied. The package offers complete implementations of various
EDAs based on copulas and vines, a group of well-known optimization problems,
and utility functions to study the performance of the algorithms. Newly
developed EDAs can be easily integrated into the package by extending an S4
class with generic functions for their main components. This paper presents
copulaedas by providing an overview of EDAs based on copulas, a description of
the implementation of the package, and an illustration of its use through
examples. The examples include running the EDAs defined in the package,
implementing new algorithms, and performing an empirical study to compare the
behavior of different algorithms on benchmark functions and a real-world
problem.
