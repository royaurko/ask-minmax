We report appearance of superconductivity at 5K in NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 and
supplement the discovery [1] of the same in layered sulfide based ZrCuSiAs type
compounds. The bulk polycrystalline compound is synthesized by conventional
solid state route via vacuum encapsulation technique. Detailed structural
analysis showed that the studied compound is crystallized in tetragonal P4/nmm
space group with lattice parameters a = 3.9911(3) {\AA}, c = 13.3830(2) {\AA}.
Bulk superconductivity is established in NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 at 5K by both transport
and magnetic measurements. Electrical transport measurements showed
superconducting Tc onset at 5.2K and Tc ({\rho}=0) at 4.7K. Under applied
magnetic field both Tc onset and Tc ({\rho} =0) decrease to lower temperatures
and an upper critical field [Hc2(0)] of above 23kOe is estimated. Both AC and
DC magnetic susceptibility measurements showed bulk superconductivity below 5K.
Isothermal magnetization (MH) exhibited typical type II behavior with lower
critical field (Hc1) of around 15Oe. Isothermal magnetization (MH) exhibited
typical type-II behavior with lower critical field (Hc1) of around 15Oe.
Specific heat [Cp(T)] is investigated in the temperature range of 1.9-50K in
zero external magnetic field. A Schottky-type anomaly is observed at low
temperature below 7K. This low temperature Schottky can be attributed to the
change in the entropy of the system.
