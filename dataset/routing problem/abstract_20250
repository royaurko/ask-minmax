We prove an analog of the classical Hartogs extension theorem for CR $L^{2}$
functions defined on boundaries of certain (possibly unbounded) domains on
coverings of strongly pseudoconvex manifolds. Our result is related to a
problem posed in the paper of Gromov, Henkin and Shubin [GHS] on holomorphic
$L_{2}$ functions on coverings of pseudoconvex manifolds.
