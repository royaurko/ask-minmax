The trapezoidal rule, which is a special case of the Newmark family of
algorithms, is one of the most widely used methods for transient hyperbolic
problems. In this work, we show that this rule conserves linear and angular
momenta and energy in the case of undamped linear elastodynamics problems, and
an `energy-like measure' in the case of undamped acoustic problems. These
conservation properties, thus, provide a rational basis for using this
algorithm. In linear elastodynamics problems, variants of the trapezoidal rule
that incorporate `high-frequency' dissipation are often used, since the higher
frequencies, which are not approximated properly by the standard
displacement-based approach, often result in unphysical behavior. Instead of
modifying the trapezoidal algorithm, we propose using a hybrid finite element
framework for constructing the stiffness matrix. Hybrid finite elements, which
are based on a two-field variational formulation involving displacement and
stresses, are known to approximate the eigenvalues much more accurately than
the standard displacement-based approach, thereby either bypassing or reducing
the need for high-frequency dissipation. We show this by means of several
examples, where we compare the numerical solutions obtained using the
displacement-based and hybrid approaches against analytical solutions.
