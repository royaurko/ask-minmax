Using a completely analytic procedure - based on a suitable extension of a
classical method - we discuss an approach to the Poincar\'e-Mel'nikov theory,
which can be conveniently applied also to the case of non-hyperbolic critical
points, and even if the critical point is located at the infinity. In this
paper, we concentrate our attention on the latter case, and precisely on
problems described by Kepler-like potentials in one or two degrees of freedom,
in the presence of general time-dependent perturbations. We show that the
appearance of chaos (possibly including Arnol'd diffusion) can be proved quite
easily and in a direct way, without resorting to singular coordinate
transformations, such as the McGehee or blowing-up transformations. Natural
examples are provided by the classical Gyld\'en problem, originally proposed in
celestial mechanics, but also of interest in different fields, and by the
general 3-body problem in classical mechanics.
