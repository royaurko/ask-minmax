A system of two coupled ensembles of phase oscillators can follow different
routes to inter-ensemble synchronization. Following a short report of our
preliminary results [Phys. Rev. E. {\bf 78}, 025201(R) (2008)], we present a
more detailed study of the effects of coupling, noise and phase asymmetries in
coupled phase oscillator ensembles. We identify five distinct synchronization
regions, and new routes to synchronization that are characteristic of the
coupling asymmetry. We show that noise asymmetry induces effects similar to
that of coupling asymmetry when the latter is absent. We also find that phase
asymmetry controls the probability of occurrence of particular routes to
synchronization. Our results suggest that asymmetry plays a crucial role in
controlling synchronization within and between oscillator ensembles, and hence
that its consideration is vital for modeling real life problems.
