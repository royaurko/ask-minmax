We establish existence of compact minimizers of the prescribed mean curvature
problem with volume constraint in periodic media. As a consequence, we
construct compact approximate solutions to the prescribed mean curvature
equation. We also show convergence after rescaling of the volume-constrained
minimizers towards a suitable Wulff Shape, when the volume tends to infinity.
