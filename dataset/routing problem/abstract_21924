We consider two dimensional nonstationary scattering of plane waves by a
NN-wedge. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a solution to the
corresponding mixed problem and we give an explicit formula for the solution.
Also the Limiting Amplitude Principle is proved and a rate of convergence to
the limiting amplitude is obtained.
