The relaxed maximum entropy problem is concerned with finding a probability
distribution on a finite set that minimizes the relative entropy to a given
prior distribution, while satisfying relaxed max-norm constraints with respect
to a third observed multinomial distribution. We study the entire relaxation
path for this problem in detail. We show existence and a geometric description
of the relaxation path. Specifically, we show that the maximum entropy
relaxation path admits a planar geometric description as an increasing,
piecewise linear function in the inverse relaxation parameter. We derive fast
algorithms for tracking the path. In various realistic settings, our algorithms
require $O(n\log(n))$ operations for probability distributions on $n$ points,
making it possible to handle large problems. Once the path has been recovered,
we show that given a validation set, the family of admissible models is reduced
from an infinite family to a small, discrete set. We demonstrate the merits of
our approach in experiments with synthetic data and discuss its potential for
the estimation of compact n-gram language models.
