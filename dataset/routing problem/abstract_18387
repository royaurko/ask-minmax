The discrepancy between the Pleiades cluster distance based on Hipparcos
parallaxes and main sequence fitting is investigated on the basis of Stromgren
photometry of F-type stars. Field stars with the same metallicity as the
Pleiades have been selected from the m1 index and a technique has been
developed to locate the ZAMS of these field stars in color-magnitude diagrams
based on the color/temperature indices b-y, v-y, and beta. Fitting the Pleiades
to these ZAMS relations results in a distance modulus of 5.61+/-0.03 mag in
contrast to the Hipparcos modulus of 5.36+/-0.06 mag. Hence, we cannot confirm
the recent claim by Grenon (1999) that the distance problem is solved by
adopting a low metallicity of the Pleiades ([Fe/H]=-0.11) as determined from
Geneva photometry. The metallicity sensitivity of the ZAMS determined by the
field stars is investigated, and by combining this sensitivity in all three
color/temperature indices b-y, v-y, and beta we get a independent test of the
Pleiades distance modulus which support our value of 5.61 mag. Furthermore, the
field star sample used for the comparison is tested against theoretical
isochrones of different ages to show that evolutionary effects in the field
star sample are not biasing our distance modulus estimate significantly.
Possible explanations of the Pleiades distance problem are discussed and it is
suggested that the discrepancy in the derived moduli may be linked to a
non-spherical shape of the cluster.
