Preference elicitation is a central problem in AI, and has received
significant attention in single-agent settings. It is also a key problem in
multiagent systems, but has received little attention here so far. In this
setting, the agents may have different preferences that often must be
aggregated using voting. This leads to interesting issues because what, if any,
information should be elicited from an agent depends on what other agents have
revealed about their preferences so far.
  In this paper we study effective elicitation, and its impediments, for the
most common voting protocols. It turns out that in the Single Transferable Vote
protocol, even knowing when to terminate elicitation is mathcal NP-complete,
while this is easy for all the other protocols under study. Even for these
protocols, determining how to elicit effectively is NP-complete, even with
perfect suspicions about how the agents will vote. The exception is the
Plurality protocol where such effective elicitation is easy.
  We also show that elicitation introduces additional opportunities for
strategic manipulation by the voters. We demonstrate how to curtail the space
of elicitation schemes so that no such additional strategic issues arise.
