We make a rigorous study of classical field equations on a 2-dimensional
signature changing spacetime using the techniques of operator theory. Boundary
conditions at the surface of signature change are determined by forming
self-adjoint extensions of the Schr\"odinger Hamiltonian. We show that the
initial value problem for the Klein--Gordon equation on this spacetime is
ill-posed in the sense that its solutions are unstable. Furthermore, if the
initial data is smooth and compactly supported away from the surface of
signature change, the solution has divergent $L^2$-norm after finite time.
