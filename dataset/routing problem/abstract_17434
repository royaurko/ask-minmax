In this paper we construct periodic capillarity-gravity water waves with an
arbitrary bounded vorticity distribution. This is achieved by reexpressing, in
the height function formulation of the water wave problem, the boundary
condition obtained from Bernoulli's principle as a nonlocal differential
equation. This enables us to establish the existence of weak solutions of the
problem by using elliptic estimates and bifurcation theory. Secondly, we
investigate the a priori regularity of these weak solutions and prove that they
are in fact strong solutions of the problem, describing waves with a
real-analytic free surface. Moreover, assuming merely integrability of the
vorticity function, we show that any weak solution corresponds to flows having
real-analytic streamlines.
