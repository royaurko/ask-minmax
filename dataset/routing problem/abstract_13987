We investigate the parameterized complexity of strategic behaviors in
generalized scoring rules. In particular, we prove that the manipulation,
control (all the 22 standard types), and bribery problems are fixed-parameter
tractable for most of the generalized scoring rules, with respect to the number
of candidates. Our results imply that all these strategic voting problems are
fixed-parameter tractable for most of the common voting rules, such as
Plurality, r-Approval, Borda, Copeland, Maximin, Bucklin, etc., with respect to
the number of candidates.
