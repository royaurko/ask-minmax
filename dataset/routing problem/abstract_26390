The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process has long been recognized as
a rich framework for real-world planning and control problems, especially in
robotics. However exact solutions in this framework are typically
computationally intractable for all but the smallest problems. A well-known
technique for speeding up POMDP solving involves performing value backups at
specific belief points, rather than over the entire belief simplex. The
efficiency of this approach, however, depends greatly on the selection of
points. This paper presents a set of novel techniques for selecting informative
belief points which work well in practice. The point selection procedure is
combined with point-based value backups to form an effective anytime POMDP
algorithm called Point-Based Value Iteration (PBVI). The first aim of this
paper is to introduce this algorithm and present a theoretical analysis
justifying the choice of belief selection technique. The second aim of this
paper is to provide a thorough empirical comparison between PBVI and other
state-of-the-art POMDP methods, in particular the Perseus algorithm, in an
effort to highlight their similarities and differences. Evaluation is performed
using both standard POMDP domains and realistic robotic tasks.
