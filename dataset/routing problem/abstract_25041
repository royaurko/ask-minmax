"Encoded in the large, highly evolved sensory and motor portions of the human
brain is a billion years of experience about the nature of the world and how to
survive in it. The deliberate process we call reasoning is, I believe, the
thinnest veneer of human thought, effective only because it is supported by
this much older and much powerful, though usually unconscious, sensor motor
knowledge. We are all prodigious Olympians in perceptual and motor areas, so
good that we make the difficult look easy. Abstract thought, though, is a new
trick, perhaps less than 100 thousand years old. We have not yet mastered it.
It is not all that intrinsically difficult; it just seems so when we do it."-
Hans Moravec Moravec's paradox is involved with the fact that it is the
seemingly easier day to day problems that are harder to implement in a machine,
than the seemingly complicated logic based problems of today. The results prove
that most artificially intelligent machines are as adept if not more than us at
under-taking long calculations or even play chess, but their logic brings them
nowhere when it comes to carrying out everyday tasks like walking, facial
gesture recognition or speech recognition.
