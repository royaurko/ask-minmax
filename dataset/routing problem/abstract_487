A Vehicular Ad hoc Network consists of vehicles which communicate with each
other and exchange data via wireless communication links available between the
vehicles which are in communication ranges of vehicles to improve the road
safety in city.The communication between vehicles is used to provide road
safety, comfort and entertainment.The performance of communication depends on
how better routing takes place in the network.Routing data between the source
and destination vehicle depends on the routing protocols being used in
vehicular adhoc network.In this simulation based study we investigated about
different ad hoc routing protocols for vehicular adhoc network.The main goal of
our study was to identify which ad hoc routing protocol has better performance
in highly mobile environment of vehicular adhoc network.We have measured the
performance of routing protocols using 802.11p in vehicular adhoc network in
which we considered the scenario of city i.e. Route between Nerul and Vashi
where we have taken 1200 different types of vehicles and checked their
performance.Routing protocols are selected after the literature review.The
selected protocols are then evaluated through simulation under 802.11p in terms
of performance metrics i.e PDR & E2E delay.
