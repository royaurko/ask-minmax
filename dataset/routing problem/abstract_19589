Higher order parametric level correlations in disordered systems with broken
time-reversal symmetry are studied by mapping the problem onto a model of
coupled Hermitian random matrices. Closed analytical expression is derived for
parametric density-density correlation function which corresponds to a
perturbation of disordered system by a multicomponent flux.
