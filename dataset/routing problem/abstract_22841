We study the mean-field dynamics of a fermionic condensate interacting with a
single bosonic mode (a generalized Dicke model). This problem is integrable and
can be mapped onto a corresponding BCS problem. We derive the general solution
and a full set of integrals of motion for the time evolution of coupled
Fermi-Bose condensates. The present paper complements our earlier study of the
dynamics of the BCS model (cond-mat/0407501 and cond-mat/0505493). Here we
provide a self-contained introduction to the variable separation method, which
enables a complete analytical description of the evolution of the generalized
Dicke, BCS, and other similar models.
