Using semiclassical approximation we consider parity nonconservation (PNC)
averaged over compound resonances. We demonstrate that the result of the
averaging crucially depends on the properties of residual strong
nucleon-nucleon interaction. Natural way to elucidate this problem is to
investigate experimentally PNC spin rotation with nonmonachromatic neutron
beam: $E \sim \Delta E \sim 1MeV$. Value of the effect can reach $\psi \sim
10^{-5}-10^{-4}$ per mean free path.
