This is a comprehensive exposition of the classical moment problem using
methods from the theory of finite difference operators. Among the advantages of
this approach is that the Nevanlinna functions appear as elements of a transfer
matrix and convergence of Pade approximants appears as the strong resolvent
convergence of finite matrix approximations to a Jacobi matrix. As a bonus of
this, we obtain new results on the convergence of certain Pade approximants for
series of Hamburger.
