We revisit the derivation of higher spin bulk theory using the
renormalization group in the dual field theory. We argue that existing
proposals have problems already at the level of linearized perturbations on
AdS. This is due to the form of the cutoff, which must act on bilinears in the
fundamental fields rather than on the fields themselves. For the light-cone
collective field theory, we show that the RG produces the correct linearized
perturbations. We relate this to the precursor formula of de Mello Koch,
Jevicki, Jin and Rodrigues, and we also elaborate on that result. The covariant
RG and bulk interactions remain problems for the future.
