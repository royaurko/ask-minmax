We present reliable a-posteriori error estimates for $hp$-adaptive finite
element approximations of eigenvalue/eigenvector problems. Starting from our
earlier work on $h$ adaptive finite element approximations we show a way to
obtain reliable and efficient a-posteriori estimates in the $hp$-setting. At
the core of our analysis is the reduction of the problem on the analysis of the
associated boundary value problem. We start from the analysis of Wohlmuth and
Melenk and combine this with our a-posteriori estimation framework to obtain
eigenvalue/eigenvector approximation bounds.
