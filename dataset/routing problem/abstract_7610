This paper considers downlink multicast transmit beamforming for secure
layered transmission systems with wireless simultaneous information and power
transfer. We study the power allocation algorithm design for minimizing the
total transmit power in the presence of passive eavesdroppers and energy
harvesting receivers. The algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex
optimization problem. Our problem formulation promotes the dual use of energy
signals in providing secure communication and facilitating efficient energy
transfer. Besides, we take into account a minimum required power for energy
harvesting at the idle receivers and heterogeneous quality of service (QoS)
requirements for the multicast video receivers. In light of the intractability
of the problem, we reformulate the considered problem by replacing a non-convex
probabilistic constraint with a convex deterministic constraint. Then, a
semidefinite programming relaxation (SDR) approach is adopted to obtain an
upper solution for the reformulated problem. Subsequently, sufficient
conditions for the global optimal solution of the reformulated problem are
revealed. Furthermore, we propose two suboptimal power allocation schemes based
on the upper bound solution. Simulation results demonstrate the excellent
performance and significant transmit power savings achieved by the proposed
schemes compared to isotropic energy signal generation.
