We consider the classical scheduling problem on a single machine, on which we
need to schedule sequentially $n$ given jobs. Every job $j$ has a processing
time $p_j$ and a priority weight $w_j$, and for a given schedule a completion
time $C_j$. In this paper we consider the problem of minimizing the objective
value $\sum_j w_j C_j^\beta$ for some fixed constant $\beta>0$. This
non-linearity is motivated for example by the learning effect of a machine
improving its efficiency over time, or by the speed scaling model. Except for
$\beta=1$, the complexity status of this problem is open. Past research mainly
focused on the quadratic case ($\beta=2$) and proposed different techniques to
speed up exact algorithms. This paper proposes new dominance properties and
generalizations of existing rules to non-integral $\beta$. An experimental
study evaluates the impact of the proposed rules on the exact algorithm A*.
