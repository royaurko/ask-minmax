The Carnot engine sets an upper limit to the efficiency of a practical heat
engine. An arbitrary irreversible engine is believed to behave closely as the
Curzon-Ahlborn engine. Efficiency of the latter is obtained commonly by
invoking the maximum power principle in a non-equilibrium framework. We outline
here two plausible routes within the domain of classical thermodynamics to
arrive at the same expression for efficiency. As an offshoot, role of entropy
production is noted and better lower bounds to the efficiency of Curzon-Ahlborn
engine are found. Further studies on the performances of the available
practical engines reveal that, a simpler approximate formula on the basis of
just the second law works better in respect of bounds to the efficiency, and
decisively the more so if one considers the entropy production along with the
efficiency. Results based on the maximum power principle furnish close upper
bounds too.
