We study the complexity of variants of dependence logic defined by
generalized dependency atoms. Let FOC^2 denote two-variable logic with
counting, and let ESO(FOC^2) be the extension of FOC^2 with existential
second-order prenex quantification. We show that for any finite collection A of
atoms that are definable in ESO(FOC^2), the satisfiability problem of the
two-variable fragment of FO(A) is NEXPTIME-complete. We also study
satisfiability of sentences of FO(A) in the Bernays-Sch\"onfinkel-Ramsey prefix
class. Our results show that, analogously to the first-order case, this problem
is decidable assuming the atoms in A are uniformly polynomial time computable
and closed under substructures. We establish inclusion in 2NEXPTIME. For fixed
arity vocabularies, we establish NEXPTIME-completeness.
