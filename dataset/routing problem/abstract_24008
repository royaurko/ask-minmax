The stability of the interface separating two immiscible incompressible
fluids of different densities and viscosities is considered in the case of
fluids filling a cavity which performs horizontal harmonic oscillation. There
exists a simple basic state which corresponds to the unperturbed interface and
plane-parallel unsteady counter flows; the properties of this state are
examined. A linear stability problem for the interface is formulated and solved
a) for both inviscid and b) for both viscous fluids. A transformation is found
which reduces the linear stability problem under inviscid approximation to the
Mathieu equation. The parametric resonant regions of instability associated
with the intensification of capillary-gravity waves at the interface are
examined and the results are compared to those found in the viscous case in a
fully numerical investigation.
