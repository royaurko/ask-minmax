In this article we compare solutions to elliptic problems having rapidly
oscillated conductivity (permeability, etc) coefficient with solutions to
corresponding homogenized problems obtained from two-scale extensions of the
initial coefficient. The comparison is done numerically on several one and two
dimensional test problems with randomly generated coefficients for different
intensities of oscillation. The dependency of the approximation error on the
size of averaging is investigated.
