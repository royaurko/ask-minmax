In this paper we establish a global Carleman estimate for the fourth order
Schr\"odinger equation posed on a $1-d$ finite domain. The Carleman estimate is
used to prove the Lipschitz stability for an inverse problem consisting in
retrieving a stationary potential in the Schr\"odinger equation from boundary
measurements.
