Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a technology offering methods to
identify appliances in homes based on their consumption characteristics and the
total household demand. Recently, many different novel NILM approaches were
introduced, tested on real-world data and evaluated with a common evaluation
metric. However, the fair comparison between different NILM approaches even
with the usage of the same evaluation metric is nearly impossible due to
incomplete or missing problem definitions. Each NILM approach typically is
evaluated under different test scenarios. Test results are thus influenced by
the considered appliances, the number of used appliances, the device type
representing the appliance and the pre-processing stages denoising the
consumption data. This paper introduces a novel complexity measure of
aggregated consumption data providing an assessment of the problem complexity
affected by the used appliances, the appliance characteristics and the
appliance usage over time. We test our load disaggregation complexity on
different real-world datasets and with a state-of-the-art NILM approach. The
introduced disaggregation complexity measure is able to classify the
disaggregation problem based on the used appliance set and the considered
measurement noise.
