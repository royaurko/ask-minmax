We introduce the operation of possibility qualification and show how. this
modal-like operator can be used to represent "typical" or default knowledge in
a theory of nonmonotonic reasoning. We investigate the representational power
of this approach by looking at a number of prototypical problems from the
nonmonotonic reasoning literature. In particular we look at the so called Yale
shooting problem and its relation to priority in default reasoning.
