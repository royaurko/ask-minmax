There is a single negative mode in the spectrum of small perturbations about
the tunneling solutions describing a metastable vacuum decay in flat spacetime.
This mode is needed for consistent description of decay processes. When gravity
is included the situation is more complicated. An approach based on elimination
of scalar field perturbations shows no negative mode, whereas the recent
approach based on elimination of gravitational perturbations indicates presence
of a negative mode. In this contribution we analyse and compare the present
approaches to the negative mode problem in false vacuum decay with gravity.
