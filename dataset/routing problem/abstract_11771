Work on different classification problems is described as: the classification
of integrable vector evolution equations, NLS systems with two vector unknowns,
systems with one scalar and one vector unknown, classification of integrable
Hamiltonians and non-local 2+1 dimensional equations. All these problems lead
to large bi-linear algebraic systems to be solved. In an extended appendix an
overview of the computer algebra package is given that was used to solve these
systems.
