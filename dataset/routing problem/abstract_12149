In this paper, we investigate the two-point boundary value problems for
linear wave equation defined on a circle and prove that the equation possesses
the exact controllability. We also investigate the two-point boundary value
problems for the wave equation defined on a strip with Dirichlet or Neumann
boundary conditions and show that the equation still possesses the exact
controllability. see arXiv:0910.5782v1
