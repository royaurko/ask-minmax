We propose a multi-model formulation of full-waveform inversion that is
similar to image decomposition into a "cartoon" and "texture" used in image
processing. Inversion problem is formulated as unconstrained multi-norm
optimization that can be solved using conventional iterative solvers. We
demonstrate the proposed model decomposition approach by recovering a blocky
subsurface seismic model from noisy data in time-lapse and single-model
full-waveform inversion problems.
