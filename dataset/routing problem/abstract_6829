A problem of impedance mismatch between applications written in OO languages
and relational DB is not a problem of discrepancy between object-oriented and
relational approaches themselves. Its real causes can be found in usual
implementation of the OO approach. Direct comparison of the two approaches
cannot be used as a base for the conclusion that they are discrepant or
mismatched. Experimental proof of absence of contradiction between
object-oriented paradigm and relational data model is also presented
