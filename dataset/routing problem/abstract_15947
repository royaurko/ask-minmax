We discuss the spatiotemporal intermittency (STI) seen in coupled map
lattices (CML-s). We identify the types of intermittency seen in such systems
in the context of several specific CML-s. The Chat\'e-Manneville CML is
introduced and the on-going debate on the connection of the spatiotemporal
intermittency seen in this model with the problem of directed percolation is
summarised. We also discuss the STI seen in the sine circle map model and its
connection with the directed percolation problem, as well as the inhomogenous
logistic map lattice which shows the novel phenomenon of spatial intermittency
and other types of behaviour not seen in the other models. The connection of
the bifurcation behaviour in this model with STI is touched upon. We conclude
with a discussion of open problems.
