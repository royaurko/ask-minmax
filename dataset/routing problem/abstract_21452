We address the question of describing the membership to Schatten-Von Neumann
ideals $\mathcal{S}_ p$ of integration operators $(T_ g
f)(z)=\int_{0}^{z}f(\zeta)\,g'(\zeta)\,d\zeta$ acting on Dirichlet type spaces.
We also study this problem for multiplication, Hankel and Toeplitz operators.
In particular, we provide an extension of Luecking's result on Toeplitz
operators.
