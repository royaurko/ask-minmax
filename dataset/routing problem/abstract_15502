Among the 17 volumes of results from the Hipparcos space mission, two are
dedicated to variable stars. These two volumes arose from the work of two
groups, one at the Geneva Observatory and one at RGO (Royal Greenwich
Observatory), on the 13 million photometric measurements produced by the
satellite for 118204 stars.
  The analysis of photometric time series permitted us to identify several
instrumental and mathematical problems: overestimation of the precision,
offsets in the zero-points depending on the field of view, mispointing effects,
image superpositions, trends in the magnitudes, binarity effects (spurious
periods and amplitudes) and time-sampling effects. In this article we summarize
some of the problems encountered by the Geneva group.
