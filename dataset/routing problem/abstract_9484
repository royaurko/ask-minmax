We study instabilities and pattern formation in reaction-diffusion layers
that are diffusively coupled. For two-layer systems of identical two-component
reactions, we analyze the stability of homogeneous steady states by exploiting
the block symmetric structure of the linear problem. There are eight possible
primary bifurcation scenarios, including a Turing-Turing bifurcation that
involves two disparate length scales whose ratio may be tuned via the
inter-layer coupling. For systems of $n$-component layers and non-identical
layers, the linear problem's block form allows approximate decomposition into
lower-dimensional linear problems if the coupling is sufficiently weak. As an
example, we apply these results to a two-layer Brusselator system. The
competing length scales engineered within the linear problem are readily
apparent in numerical simulations of the full system. Selecting a $\sqrt{2}$:1
length scale ratio produces an unusual steady square pattern.
