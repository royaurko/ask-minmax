In this paper we solve the multiple peeling problem by applying a fracture
mechanics approach to a complex system of films, adhering to the substrate and
having a common hinge, where the pulling force is applied. The simplest
V-shaped system, consisting of two identical peeling tapes is considered as a
case study (to be solved coupling six nonlinear equations); an optimal peeling
angle, at which adhesion is maximal, is discovered.
