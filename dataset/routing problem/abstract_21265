We generalize the hyperplane inequality in dimensions up to 4 to the setting
of arbitrary measures in place of the volume. To prove this generalization we
establish stability in the affirmative part of the solution to the
Busemann-Petty problem asking whether symmetric convex bodies in R^n with
smaller (n-1)-dimensional volume of all central hyperplane sections necessarily
have smaller n-dimensional volume.
