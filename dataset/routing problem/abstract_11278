We suppose that the solar neutrino problem is only due to the mechanism
introduced by Ellis, Hagelin, Nanopoulos and Srednicki (EHNS), then a lower
limit constraint on EHNS parameters is obtained. We find that gamma > 7.4
10^(-22)GeV if alpha < 2 gamma and alpha > 1.5 10^(-21)GeV if alpha > 2 gamma,
this limit is consistent with the upper limits extract from the K0-K0bar system
and can be detected in the future experiments.
