We consider the defocusing energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation
in the exterior of a smooth compact strictly convex obstacle in three
dimensions. For the initial-value problem with Dirichlet boundary condition we
prove global well-posedness and scattering for all initial data in the energy
space.
