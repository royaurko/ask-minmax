Theoretical studies of stretching proteins with slipknots reveal a surprising
growth of their unfolding times when the stretching force crosses an
intermediate threshold. This behavior arises as a consequence of the existence
of alternative unfolding routes that are dominant at different force ranges.
Responsible for longer unfolding times at higher forces is the existence of an
intermediate, metastable configuration where the slipknot is jammed.
Simulations are performed with a coarsed grained model with further
quantification using a refined description of the geometry of the slipknots.
The simulation data is used to determine the free energy landscape (FEL) of the
protein, which supports recent analytical predictions.
