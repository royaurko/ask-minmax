We extend the local well-posedness theory for the Cauchy problem associated
to a degenerated Zakharov system. The new main ingredients are the derivation
of Strichartz and maximal function norm estimates for the linear solution of a
Schrodinger type equation with missing dispersion in one direction. The result
here improves the one in [11].
