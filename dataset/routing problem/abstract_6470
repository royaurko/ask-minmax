This paper considerers the problem of computing the value of a solution of
the heat equation at a given point inside a bounded domain after the initial
time. It is assumed that the initial value of the solution inside the domain
(possibly in a part of the domain) is known; the boundary value and the normal
derivative on a part of the boundary of the domain over a finite time interval
are known. Two analytical formulae for the problem are given. Both formulae
make use of a special fundamental solution having a large parameter of the
backward heat equation.
