After a proof of concept using Dropbox(tm), a free storage and
synchronization service, showed that an evolutionary algorithm using several
dissimilar computers connected via WiFi or Ethernet had a good scaling behavior
in terms of evaluations per second, it remains to be proved whether that effect
also translates to the algorithmic performance of the algorithm. In this paper
we will check several different, and difficult, problems, and see what effects
the automatic load-balancing and asynchrony have on the speed of resolution of
problems.
