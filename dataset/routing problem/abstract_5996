This paper improves the algorithms based on supporting halfspaces and
quadratic programming for convex set intersection problems in our earlier paper
in several directions. First, we give conditions so that much smaller quadratic
programs (QPs) and approximate projections arising from partially solving the
QPs are sufficient for multiple-term superlinear convergence for nonsmooth
problems. Second, we identify additional regularity, which we call the second
order supporting hyperplane property (SOSH), that gives multiple-term quadratic
convergence. Third, we show that these fast convergence results carry over for
the convex inequality problem. Fourth, we show that infeasibility can be
detected in finitely many operations. Lastly, we explain how we can use the
dual active set QP algorithm of Goldfarb and Idnani to get useful iterates by
solving the QPs partially, overcoming the problem of solving large QPs in our
algorithms.
