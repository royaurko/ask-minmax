The purpose of this paper is to study the problem of estimating a compactly
supported density of probability from noisy observations of its moments. In
fact, we provide a statistical approach to the famous Hausdorff classical
moment problem. We prove an upper bound and a lower bound on the rate of
convergence of the mean squared error showing that the considered estimator
attains minimax rate over the corresponding smoothness classes.
