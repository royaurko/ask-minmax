The classical Duhamel principle, established nearly 200 years ago by
Jean-Marie-Constant Duhamel, reduces the Cauchy problem for an inhomogeneous
partial differential equation to the Cauchy problem for the corresponding
homogeneous equation. Duhamel's principle is not applicable in the case of
fractional order differential equations. In this paper we formulate and prove
fractional generalizations of this famous principle directly applicable to a
wide class of fractional order differential-operator equations.
