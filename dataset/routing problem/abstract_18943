We offer some thoughts regarding the space of string fields. We suggest that
this space should be identified as the odd component of a star-algebra and
focus among other issues on the role of the mid-point. We argue that theories
with mid-point insertions in the action, such as the modified cubic theory can
be well behaved, even if this mid-point insertion has a non-trivial kernel.
  We then discuss the recent proposal by Berkovits and Siegel of a non-minimal
superstring field theory. In this theory the action contains a mid-point
insertion of a non-zero conformal weight. We show that, while this is a-priori
a problem, it might be possible (in the NS sector) to make sense out of this
theory by regularizing it. A cleaner resolution of the problem is to extend the
non-minimal sector in a way that allows a zero-weight mid-point insertion with
the desired properties. We also study the generalisation of the theory to the
NS- sector and explain the problems with defining the Ramond sectors.
  We show that the non-minimal theory supports all the known solutions of the
standard modified cubic superstring field theory, including the GSO+ vacuum
solution. The properties of the solutions carry over to the non-minimal theory.
In particular, the vacuum solution has the correct tension and cohomology.
