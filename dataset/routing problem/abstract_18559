Modern ab initio treatments of H-Hbar systems are inconsistent with the logic
behind algebraic Hamiltonians H(+-)=H(0)+/-deltaH for charge-symmetrical and
charge-asymmetrical 4 unit charge systems like H(2) and HHbar. Since these 2
Hamiltonians are mutually exclusive, only the attractive one can apply for
stable natural molecular H(2). A wrong choice leads to problems with antiatom
Hbar. In line with earlier results on band and line spectra, we now prove that
HL chose the wrong Hamiltonian for H(2). Their theory explains the stability of
attractive system H(2) with a repulsive Hamiltonian instead of with the
attractive one, representative for charge-asymmetrical system HHbar. A new
second order symmetry effect is detected. Repulsive HL Hamiltonian H(+) applies
at long range but at the critical distance, attractive charge-inverted
Hamiltonian H(-)takes over and leads to bond H(2) but in reality, HHbar, for
which we give an analytical proof. Another wrong asymptote choice in the past
also applies for atomic antihydrogen Hbar, which has hidden the Mexican hat
potential for natural hydrogen. This generic solution removes most problems,
physicists and chemists experience with atomic Hbar and molecular HHbar,
including the problem with antimatter in the Universe.
