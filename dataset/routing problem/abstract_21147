We solve the covering problem for Demuth randomness, showing that a
computably enumerable set is computable from a Demuth random set if and only if
it is strongly jump-traceable. We show that on the other hand, the class of
sets which form a base for Demuth randomness is a proper subclass of the class
of strongly jump-traceable sets.
