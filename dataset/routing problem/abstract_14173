In this paper we consider the Cauchy problem for 2D viscous shallow water
system in $H^s(\mathbb{R}^2)$, $s>1$. We first prove the local well-posedness
of this problem by using the Littlewood-Paley theory, the Bony decomposition,
and the theories of transport equations and transport diffusion equations.
Then, we get the global existence of the system with small initial data in
$H^s(\mathbb{R}^2)$, $s>1$. Our obtained result improves the recent result in
\cite{W}
