We consider the linear stabilities of the regular n-gon relative equilibria
of the (1+n)-body problem. It is shown that there exist at most two kinds of
infinitesimal bodies arranged alternatively at the vertices of a regular n-gon
when n is even, and only one set of identical infinitesimal bodies when n is
odd. In the case of n even, the regular n-gon relative equilibrium is shown to
be linearly stable when n>=14. In each case of n=8,10,12, linear stability can
also be preserved if the ratio of two kinds of masses belongs to an open
interval. When n is odd, the related conclusion on the linear stability is
recalled.
