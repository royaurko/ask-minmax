A problem of monoenergetic particles pulse reflection from half-infinite
stratified medium is considered in conditions of elastic scattering with
absorbtion account. The theory is based on multiple scattering series solution
of Kolmogorov equation for one-particle distribution function. The analytical
representation for first two terms are given in compact form for a point
impulse source and cylindric symmetrical detector. Reading recent articles on
the LIDAR sounding of environment (e.g. Atmospheric and Oceanic Optics (2010)
23: 389-395, Kaul, B. V.; Samokhvalov, I. V.
http://www.springerlink.com/content/k3p2p3582674xt21/) one recovers standing
interest to the related direct and inverse problems. A development of the
result fo the case of n-fold scattering and polarization account as well as
correspondent convergence series problem solution of the Kolmogorov equation
will be published in nearest future.
