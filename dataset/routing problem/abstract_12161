We have derived a new Generalised Uncertainty Principle (GUP) based on
certain general assumptions. This GUP is consistent with predictions from
string theory. It is then used to study Schwarzschild black hole
thermodynamics. Corrections to the mass-temperature relation, area law and heat
capacity are obtained. We find that the evaporation process stops at a
particular mass, referred as the remnant mass. This is instrumental in
bypassing the well known singularity problem that occurs in a semiclassical
approach.
