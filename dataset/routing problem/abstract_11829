One of the main activities in science teaching, and in particular in Physics
teaching, is not only the discussion of both modern problems and problems which
solution is an urgent matter. It means that the picture of an active and alive
science should be transmitted to the students, mainly to the College students.
A central point in this matter is the issue which characterizes the Fundamental
Laws of Nature. In this work we emphasize that this sort of laws may exist in
areas which are different from those usually considered. In this type of
discussion it is neither possible nor desirable to avoid the historical
perspective of the scientific development.
