The aim of this paper is to study a whole class of first order differential
inclusions, which fit into the framework of perturbed sweeping process by
uniformly prox-regular sets. After obtaining well-posedness results, we propose
a numerical scheme based on a prediction-correction algorithm and we prove its
convergence. Finally we apply these results to a problem coming from modelling
of crowd motion.
