A class of water wave problems concerns the dynamics of the free interface
separating an inviscid, incompressible and irrotational fluid, under the
influence of gravity, from a zero-density region. In this note, we present some
recent methods and ideas developed concerning the local and global
wellposedness of these problems, the focus is on the structural aspect of the
equations.
