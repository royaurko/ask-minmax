A Mathematica implementation of the program LERG-I is presented that performs
the reduction of tensor integrals, encountered in one-loop Feynman diagram
calculations, to scalar integrals. The program was originally coded in REDUCE
and in that incarnation was applied to a number of problems of physical
interest.
