This work presents a hybrid approach to solve the maximum stable set problem,
using constraint and semidefinite programming. The approach consists of two
steps: subproblem generation and subproblem solution. First we rank the
variable domain values, based on the solution of a semidefinite relaxation.
Using this ranking, we generate the most promising subproblems first, by
exploring a search tree using a limited discrepancy strategy. Then the
subproblems are being solved using a constraint programming solver. To
strengthen the semidefinite relaxation, we propose to infer additional
constraints from the discrepancy structure. Computational results show that the
semidefinite relaxation is very informative, since solutions of good quality
are found in the first subproblems, or optimality is proven immediately.
