We study the so-called damped Navier-Stokes equations in the whole 2D space.
The global well-posedness, dissipativity and further regularity of weak
solutions of this problem in the uniformly-local spaces are verified based on
the further development of the weighted energy theory for the Navier-Stokes
type problems. Note that any divergent free vector field $u_0\in
L^\infty(\mathbb R^2)$ is allowed and no assumptions on the spatial decay of
solutions as $|x|\to\infty$ are posed. In addition, applying the developed
theory to the case of the classical Navier-Stokes problem in R2, we show that
the properly defined weak solution can grow at most polynomially (as a quintic
polynomial) as time goes to infinity.
