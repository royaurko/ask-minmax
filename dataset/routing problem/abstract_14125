Freidlin and Wentzell characterized the logarithmic asymptotics of the exit
time from a basin of attraction for a finite dimensional diffusion with small
noise. After that, several contributors studied the same properties for exit
problems associated to specific infinite dimensional system. In this paper, we
present a general method, based a control theoretic approach, to establish exit
time and exit place results for a large class of stochastic equations in Banach
spaces.
