We generalize the hyper-systolic algorithm proposed in [1] for abstract data
structures on massive parallel computers with $n_p$ processors. For a problem
of size $V$ the communication complexity of the hyper-systolic algorithm is
proportional to $\sqrt{n_p}V$, to be compared with $n_pV$ for the systolic
case. The implementation technique is explained in detail and the example of
the parallel matrix-matrix multiplication is tested on the Cray-T3D.
