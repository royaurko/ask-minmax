Description Logics (DLs) are used in knowledge-based systems to represent and
reason about terminological knowledge of the application domain in a
semantically well-defined manner. In this thesis, we establish a number of
novel complexity results and give practical algorithms for expressive DLs that
provide different forms of counting quantifiers.
  We show that, in many cases, adding local counting in the form of qualifying
number restrictions to DLs does not increase the complexity of the inference
problems, even if binary coding of numbers in the input is assumed. On the
other hand, we show that adding different forms of global counting restrictions
to a logic may increase the complexity of the inference problems dramatically.
  We provide exact complexity results and a practical, tableau based algorithm
for the DL SHIQ, which forms the basis of the highly optimized DL system iFaCT.
  Finally, we describe a tableau algorithm for the clique guarded fragment
(CGF), which we hope will serve as the basis for an efficient implementation of
a CGF reasoner.
