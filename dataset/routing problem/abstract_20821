It is a survey of the results obtained by K. Glazek's and his co-workers. We
restrict our attention to the problems of axiomatizations of n-ary groups,
classes of n-ary groups, properties of skew elements and homomorphisms induced
by skew elements, constructions of covering groups, classifications and
representations of n-ary groups. Some new results are added too.
