We consider the reconstruction of a diffusion coefficient in a quasilinear
elliptic problem from a single measurement of overspecified Neumann and
Dirichlet data. The uniqueness for this parameter identification problem has
been established by Cannon and we therefore focus on the stable solution in the
presence of data noise. For this, we utilize a reformulation of the inverse
problem as a linear ill-posed operator equation with perturbed data and
operators. We are able to explicitly characterize the mapping properties of the
corresponding operators which allow us to apply regularization in Hilbert
scales. We can then prove convergence and convergence rates of the regularized
reconstructions under very mild assumptions on the exact parameter. These are,
in fact, already needed for the analysis of the forward problem and no
additional source conditions are required. Numerical tests are presented to
illustrate the theoretical statements.
