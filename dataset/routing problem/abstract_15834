We study the Newton-like problem of minimal resistance for a two-dimensional
body moving with constant velocity in a homogeneous rarefied medium of moving
particles. The distribution of the particles over velocities is centrally
symmetric. The problem is solved analytically; the minimizers are shown to be
of four different types. Numerical results are obtained for the physically
significant case of gaussian circular distribution of velocities, which
corresponds to a homogeneous ideal gas of positive temperature.
