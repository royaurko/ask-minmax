The main achievement of this paper is to provide a structure theorem for
Artinian, Gorenstein local rings with the property that the square of the
maximal ideal is generated by two elements. The moduli problem for this class
of local algebras is also discussed. Finally, upper and lower bounds for the
minimal number of generators of perfect ideals are given.
