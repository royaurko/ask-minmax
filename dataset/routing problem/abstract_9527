In this article, I explain why I abandoned my original plan to write a novel
about a mathematician proving Fermat's Last Theorem, letting my protagonist
solve the entirely fictional Wild Number Problem instead. I enumerate the steps
that had to be taken to make it seem as much like a genuine mathematical
problem as possible. I then describe how my novel was received by the general
public, many readers not quite sure whether or not the wild numbers really
existed, and how it was received by the mathematical community, a number of
mathematicians trying to rid the problem of its fictional character to
transform it into real mathematics after all.
