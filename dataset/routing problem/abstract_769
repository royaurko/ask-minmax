A Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is a self-motivated wireless network which
has no centralized point. It is an independent network that is connected by
wireless link so, in which every point or device work as a router. In this
network every node forward the packets to the destination as a router and it's
not operating as an ending point. In this network every node adjusts them self
by on his way in any direction because they are independent and change their
position regularly. There are exist three main types of routing protocols which
are reactive, proactive and final is hybrid protocols. This whole work compares
the performance of some reactive protocols which also known as on - demand
protocols, which are DSR, AODV and the final is AOMDV. DSR and AODV are
reactive protocols which connected the devices on the network when needed by a
doorway. The AOMDV protocol was designed for ad hoc networks whenever any route
or link fail and also maintain routes with sequence numbers to avoid looping.
