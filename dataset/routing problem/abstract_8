Current methods of routing are based on network information in the form of
routing tables, in which routing protocols determine how to update the tables
according to the network changes. Despite the variability of data in routing
tables, node addresses are constant. In this paper, we first introduce the new
concept of variable addresses, which results in a novel framework to cope with
routing problems using heuristic solutions. Then we propose a heuristic routing
mechanism based on the application of genes for determination of network
addresses in a variable address network and describe how this method flexibly
solves different problems and induces new ideas in providing integral solutions
for variety of problems. The case of ad-hoc networks is where simulation
results are more supportive and original solutions have been proposed for
issues like mobility.
