The aim of this paper is to establish uniform estimates of the spectrum's
bottom of the Neumann realization of $(i\nabla+q\A)^2$ on a bounded open set
$\Om$ with smooth boundary when $|\nabla\times\A|=1$ and $q\to+\infty$. This
problem was motivated by a question occuring in the theory of liquid crystals
and appears also in superconductivity questions in large domains.
