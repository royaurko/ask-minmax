We consider the problem of minimizing the sum of a convex, piecewise linear-
quadratic function and a convex piecewise linear-quadratic function composed
with an injective linear mapping. We show that, for such problems, iterates of
the alternating directions method of multipliers converge linearly to fixed
points from which the solution to the original problem can be computed. Our
proof strategy uses duality and strong metric subregularity of the
Douglas-Rachford fixed point mapping. Our analysis does not require strong
convexity and yields error bounds to the set of model solutions. We demonstrate
an application of this result to exact penalization for signal deconvolution
and denoising with multiresolution statistical constraints.
