We give a detailed survey of the theory of quasidiagonal C*-algebras. The
main structural results are presented and various functorial questions around
quasidiagonality are discussed. In particular we look at what is currently
known (and not known) about extensions, quotients, tensor products, ect. of
quasidiagonal C*-algebras. We also point out how quasidiagonality is connected
to some important open problems.
