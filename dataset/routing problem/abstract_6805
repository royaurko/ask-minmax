To derive an eigenvalue problem for the associated Askey-Wilson polynomials,
we consider an auxiliary function in two variables which is related to the
associated Askey-Wilson polynomials introduced by Ismail and Rahman. The
Askey-Wilson operator, applied in each variable separately, maps this function
to the ordinary Askey-Wilson polynomials with different sets of parameters. A
third Askey-Wilson operator is found with the help of a computer algebra
program which links the two, and an eigenvalue problem is stated.
