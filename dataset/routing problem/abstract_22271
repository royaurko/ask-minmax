A.Goncharov and R.Kenyon has defined a class of integrable system on a
cluster varieties constructed out of a Newton polygon on the plane. In the
present note we show that thiest cluster varieties coincides with the
configuration spaces of collections of complete flags in an infinite
dimensional space invariant with respect to two commuting operators. We use
this interpretation to give explicit solution for these integrable systems in
terms of theta-functions.
