Various perturbation series are factorially divergent. The behavior of their
high-order terms can be found by Lipatov's method, according to which they are
determined by the saddle-point configurations (instantons) of appropriate
functional integrals. When the Lipatov asymptotics is known and several lowest
order terms of the perturbation series are found by direct calculation of
diagrams, one can gain insight into the behavior of the remaining terms of the
series. Summing it, one can solve (in a certain approximation) various
strong-coupling problems. This approach is demonstrated by determining the
Gell-Mann - Low functions in \phi^4 theory, QED, and QCD for arbitrary coupling
constants. An overview of the mathematical theory of divergent series is
presented, and interpretation of perturbation series is discussed. Explicit
derivations of the Lipatov asymptotic forms are presented for some basic
problems in theoretical physics. A solution is proposed to the problem of
renormalon contributions, which hampered progress in this field in the late
1970s. Practical schemes for summation of perturbation series are described for
a coupling constant of order unity and in the strong-coupling limit. An
interpretation of the Borel integral is given for 'non-Borel-summable' series.
High-order corrections to the Lipatov asymptotics are discussed.
