An approach is developed to find approximate solutions to the restricted
circular three body problem. The solution is useful in approximately describing
the position vectors of three spherically symmetric masses, one of which has a
much smaller mass than the other two. These masses perform free motion under
each others gravitational influence. The set of solutions is found using the
lamberts wave function.
