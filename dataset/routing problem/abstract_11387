We present arguments pointing to a behavior of the string free energy in the
presence of a black hole horizon similar to the Atick-Witten dependence on
temperature beyond the Hagedorn transition. We give some evidence based on
orbifold techniques applied to Rindler space and further support is found
within a Hamiltonian approach. However, we argue that the interpretation in
terms of a reduction of degrees of freedom is confronted by serious problems.
Finally, we point out the problems concerning heuristic red-shift arguments and
the local interpretation of thermodynamical quantities.
