The breakup of rotating scroll waves in three-dimensional excitable media has
been linked to important biological processes. The known mechanisms for this
transition almost exclusively involve the dynamics of the scroll filament,
i.e., the line connecting the phase singularities. In this paper, we describe a
novel defect-induced route to breakup of a scroll wave pinned by an inexcitable
obstacle partially extending through the bulk of the medium. The wave is
helically wound around the defect inducing sudden changes in velocity
components of the wavefront at the obstacle boundary. This results in breakup
far from the filament, eventually giving rise to spatiotemporal chaos. Our
results suggest a potentially critical role of pinning obstacles in the onset
of life-threatening disturbances of cardiac activity.
