We consider mildly degenerate Kirchhoff equations with a small parameter and
a weak dissipation term. We prove the existence of global solutions when the
parameter is small with respect to the size of initial data. Then we provide
global-in-time error estimates on the difference between the solution of our
problem and the solution of the corresponding first order problem.
