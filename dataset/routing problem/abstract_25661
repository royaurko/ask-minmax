In this paper GA based light weight faster version of Digital Signature
Algorithm (GADSA) in wireless communication has been proposed. Various genetic
operators like crossover and mutation are used to optimizing amount of modular
multiplication. Roulette Wheel selection mechanism helps to select best
chromosome which in turn helps in faster computation and minimizes the time
requirements for DSA. Minimization of number of modular multiplication itself a
NP-hard problem that means there is no polynomial time deterministic algorithm
for this purpose. This paper deals with this problem using GA based
optimization algorithm for minimization of the modular multiplication. Proposed
GADSA initiates with an initial population comprises of set of valid and
complete set of individuals. Some operators are used to generate feasible valid
offspring from the existing one. Among several exponents the best solution
reached by GADSA is compared with some of the existing techniques. Extensive
simulations shows competitive results for the proposed GADSA.
