Dynamics of Maxwell-Bloch top system, that includes Maxwell-Bloch and
Lorenz-Hamilton equations as particular cases, is studied in the framework
Poisson geometry. Constants of motion as well as the relation of solution to
that of pendulum are presented. Equilibrium states are determined and their
complete stability analysis are performed. Results are applied to an optimal
control problem on the Lie group G4.
