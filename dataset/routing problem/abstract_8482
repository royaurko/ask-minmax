We apply a multi-color extension of the Beck-Fiala theorem to show that the
multiobjective maximum traveling salesman problem is randomized
1/2-approximable on directed graphs and randomized 2/3-approximable on
undirected graphs. Using the same technique we show that the multiobjective
maximum satisfiablilty problem is 1/2-approximable.
