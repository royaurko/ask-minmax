For the one-dimensional linear kinetic equations with collisional frequency
of the molecules, proportional to the module velocity of molecules, analytical
solutions of problems about temperature jump and weak evaporation
(condensation) in rarefied gas are received. Quantities of temperature and
concentration jumps are found. Distributions of concentration, mass velocity
and temperature are constructed. Necessary numerical calculations and graphic
researches are done.
