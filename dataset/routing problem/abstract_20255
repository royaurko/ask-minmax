We give a new approach to intersection theory. Our "cycles" are closed
manifolds mapping into compact manifolds and our "intersections" are elements
of a homotopy group of a certain Thom space. The results are then applied in
various contexts, including fixed point, linking and disjunction problems. Our
main theorems resemble those of Hatcher and Quinn, but our proofs are
fundamentally different.
