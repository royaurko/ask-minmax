We outline a method to estimate the value of computation for a flexible
algorithm using empirical data. To determine a reasonable trade-off between
cost and value, we build an empirical model of the value obtained through
computation, and apply this model to estimate the value of computation for
quite different problems. In particular, we investigate this trade-off for the
problem of constructing policies for decision problems represented as influence
diagrams. We show how two features of our anytime algorithm provide reasonable
estimates of the value of computation in this domain.
