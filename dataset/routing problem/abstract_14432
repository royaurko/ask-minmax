In this paper, we provide a partial answer for the long-standing open problem
whether every surface diagram of a surface-knot can be unknotted by applying
the cross-change operation. An invariant of a surface-knot based on the
cross-change operation along the double curves of a surface diagram is defined.
This invariant enables us to define a set of surface-knots called
DU-exchangeable surface-knots. We answer the problem under consideration
positively for DU-exchangeable surface-knots.
