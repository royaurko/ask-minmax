In 1977, Young proposed a voting scheme that extends the Condorcet Principle
based on the fewest possible number of voters whose removal yields a Condorcet
winner. We prove that both the winner and the ranking problem for Young
elections is complete for the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by
parallel access to NP. Analogous results for Lewis Carroll's 1876 voting scheme
were recently established by Hemaspaandra et al. In contrast, we prove that the
winner and ranking problems in Fishburn's homogeneous variant of Carroll's
voting scheme can be solved efficiently by linear programming.
