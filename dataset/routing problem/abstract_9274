In many machine learning problems, labeled training data is limited but
unlabeled data is ample. Some of these problems have instances that can be
factored into multiple views, each of which is nearly sufficent in determining
the correct labels. In this paper we present a new algorithm for probabilistic
multi-view learning which uses the idea of stochastic agreement between views
as regularization. Our algorithm works on structured and unstructured problems
and easily generalizes to partial agreement scenarios. For the full agreement
case, our algorithm minimizes the Bhattacharyya distance between the models of
each view, and performs better than CoBoosting and two-view Perceptron on
several flat and structured classification problems.
