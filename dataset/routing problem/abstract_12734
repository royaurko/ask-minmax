In this paper, we study an initial boundary value problem for a generalized
Camassa-Holm equation. We establish local well-posedness of this closed-loop
system by using Kato theorem for abstract quasilinear evolution equation of
hyperbolic type. Then, by using multiplier technique, we obtain a conservation
law which enable us to present a blow-up result.
