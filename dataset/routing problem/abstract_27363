This paper studies the Nash stability in hedonic coalition formation games.
We address the following issue: for a general problem formulation, is there any
utility allocation method ensuring a Nash-stable partition? We propose the
definition of the Nash-stable core and we analyze the conditions for having a
non-empty Nash-stable core. More precisely, we prove that using relaxed
efficiency in utility sharing allows to ensure a non empty Nash-stable core.
Then, a decentralized algorithm called Nash stability establisher is proposed
for finding the Nash stability in a game whenever at least one exists. The
problem of finding the Nash stability is formulated as a non-cooperative game.
In the proposed approach, during each round, each player determines its
strategy in its turn according to a random round-robin scheduler. We prove that
the algorithm converges to an equilibrium if it exists, which is the indicator
of the Nash stability.
