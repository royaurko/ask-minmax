We shall firstly study the existence of one positive solution of a model
problem for one equation via the classical Krasnosel'ski\u\i{} fixed-point
theorem. Secondly we investigate how to handle this problem via the fixed point
index theory for compact maps. Finally, we illustrate how this approach can be
tailored in order to deal with non-trivial solutions for systems of ODEs
subject to local boundary conditions.
