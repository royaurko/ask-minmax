Most of the models leading to a current state of cosmic accelerated expansion
fail to address the coincidence problem, i.e., that the dark energy density and
the energy density of the matter fluid are of the same order precisely today.
We show that a way to drive late acceleration and simultaneously solve the
aforesaid problem is assuming the matter fluid dissipative[1].
