Following renewed interest, the problem of whether the cosmological expansion
affects the dynamics of local systems is reconsidered. The cosmological
correction to the equations of motion in the locally inertial Fermi normal
frame (the relevant frame for astronomical observations) is computed. The
evolution equations for the cosmological perturbation of the two--body problem
are solved in this frame. The effect on the orbit is insignificant as are the
effects on the galactic and galactic--cluster scales.
