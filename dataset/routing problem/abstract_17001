An independent dominating set D of a graph G = (V,E) is a subset of vertices
such that every vertex in V \ D has at least one neighbor in D and D is an
independent set, i.e. no two vertices of D are adjacent in G. Finding a minimum
independent dominating set in a graph is an NP-hard problem. Whereas it is hard
to cope with this problem using parameterized and approximation algorithms,
there is a simple exact O(1.4423^n)-time algorithm solving the problem by
enumerating all maximal independent sets. In this paper we improve the latter
result, providing the first non trivial algorithm computing a minimum
independent dominating set of a graph in time O(1.3569^n). Furthermore, we give
a lower bound of \Omega(1.3247^n) on the worst-case running time of this
algorithm, showing that the running time analysis is almost tight.
