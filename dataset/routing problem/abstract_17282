In this paper, we consider the weighted graph matching problem. Recently,
approaches to this problem based on spectral methods have gained significant
attention. We propose two graph spectral descriptors based on the graph
Laplacian, namely a Laplacian family signature (LFS) on nodes, and a pairwise
heat kernel distance on edges. We show the stability of both our descriptors
under small perturbation of edges and nodes. In addition, we show that our
pairwise heat kernel distance is a noise-tolerant approximation of the
classical adjacency matrix-based second order compatibility function. These
nice properties suggest a descriptor-based matching scheme, for which we set up
an integer quadratic problem (IQP) and apply an approximate solver to find a
near optimal solution. We have tested our matching method on a set of randomly
generated graphs, the widely-used CMU house sequence and a set of real images.
These experiments show the superior performance of our selected node signatures
and edge descriptors for graph matching, as compared with other existing
signature-based matchings and adjacency matrix-based matchings.
