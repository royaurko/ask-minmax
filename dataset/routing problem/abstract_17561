We study the propagation of transient waves under the action of a vertical
step point load on the surface of a half-space filled by a block medium. The
block medium is modeled by a square lattice of masses connected by springs in
the directions of the axes x, y, and in the diagonal directions. The problem is
solved by two methods. Analytically, we obtain asymptotic solutions in the
vicinity of the Rayleigh wave at large time intervals. Numerically, we obtain a
solution for any finite time interval. We compare these solutions with each
other and with the solution to the Lamb problem for an elastic medium.
