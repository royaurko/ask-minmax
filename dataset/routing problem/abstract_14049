We investigate the problem of completing partial matrices to rank-1
probability matrices. The motivation for studying this problem comes from
statistics: A lack of desired completion can provide a falsification test for
partial observations to come from the independence model. For each type of
partial matrix, we give an inequality in the observed entries which is
satisfied if and only if a desired completion exists. We explain how to
construct such completions and, in case a partial matrix has more than one
rank-1 probability completion, completions that minimize a distance function
are studied.
