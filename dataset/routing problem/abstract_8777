If you color a table using k colors, and throw a needle randomly on it, for
some proper definition, you get a certain probability that the endpoints will
fall on different colors. How can one make this probability maximal? This
problem is related to finite graphs having unit-length edges, and some bounds
on the optimal probability are deduced.
