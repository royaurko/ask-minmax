This paper is motivated by two problems in the theory of Diophantine
approximation, namely, Davenport's problem regarding badly approximable points
on submanifolds of a Euclidean space and Schmidt's problem regarding the
intersections of the sets of weighted badly approximable points. The problems
have been recently settled in dimension two but remain open in higher
dimensions. In this paper we develop new techniques that allow us to tackle
them in full generality. The techniques rest on lattice points counting and a
powerful quantitative result of Bernik, Kleinbock and Margulis. The main
theorem of this paper implies that any finite intersection of the sets of
weighted badly approximable points on any analytic nondegenerate submanifold of
$R^n$ has full dimension. One of the consequences of this result is the
existence of transcendental real numbers badly approximable by algebraic
numbers of any degree.
