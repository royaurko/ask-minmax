We give a brief exposition of the proof of the Cayley-Salmon theorem and its
recent role in incidence geometry. Even when we don't use the properties of
ruled surfaces explicitly, the regime in which we have interesting results in
point-line incidence problems often coincides with the regime in which lines
are organized into ruled surfaces.
