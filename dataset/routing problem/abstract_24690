Each year, numerous segmentation and classification algorithms are invented
or reused to solve problems where machine vision is needed. Generally, the
efficiency of these algorithms is compared against the results given by one or
many human experts. However, in many situations, the location of the real
boundaries of the objects as well as their classes are not known with certainty
by the human experts. Furthermore, only one aspect of the segmentation and
classification problem is generally evaluated. In this paper we present a new
evaluation method for classification and segmentation of image, where we take
into account both the classification and segmentation results as well as the
level of certainty given by the experts. As a concrete example of our method,
we evaluate an automatic seabed characterization algorithm based on sonar
images.
