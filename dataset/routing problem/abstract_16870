In this paper we study the structural stability of a bang-singular-bang
extremal in the minimum time problem between fixed points. The dynamics is
single-input and control-affine.
  On the nominal problem ($r = 0$), we assume the coercivity of a suitable
second variation along the singular arc and regularity both of the bang arcs
and of the junction points, thus obtaining the strict strong local optimality
for the given bang-singular-bang extremal trajectory. Moreover, as in the
classically studied regular cases, we assume a suitable controllability
property, which grants the uniqueness of the adjoint covector.
  Under these assumptions we prove that, for any sufficiently small $r$, there
is a bang-singular-bang extremal trajectory which is a strict strong local
optimiser for the $r$-problem. A uniqueness result in a neighbourhood of the
graph of the nominal extremal pair is also obtained.
  The results are proven via the Hamiltonian approach to optimal control and by
taking advantage of the implicit function theorem, so that a sensitivity
analysis could also be carried out.
