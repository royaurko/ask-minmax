This paper investigates various aspects of the discrete-time exponential
utility maximization problem with non-negative consumption. Using the
Kuhn-Tucker theorem and the notion of aggregate state price density (Malamud
and Trubowitz (2007)), we provide a solution to this problem in the setting of
both complete and incomplete markets (with random endowments). Then, we exploit
this result to provide an explicit characterization of complete market
heterogeneous equilibria. Furthermore, we construct concrete examples of models
admitting multiple (including infinitely many) equilibria. By using Cramer's
large deviation theorem, we study the asymptotics of equilibrium zero coupon
bonds. Lastly, we conduct a study of the precautionary savings motive in
incomplete markets.
