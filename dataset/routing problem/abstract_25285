We consider in this paper a reaction-diffusion system under a KPP hypothesis
in a cylindrical domain in the presence of a shear flow. Such systems arise in
predator-prey models as well as in combustion models with heat losses.
Similarly to the single equation case, the existence of a minimal speed c* and
of traveling front solutions for every speed c > c* has been shown both in the
cases of heat losses distributed inside the domain or on the boundary. Here, we
deal with the accordance between the two models by choosing heat losses inside
the domain which tend to a Dirac mass located on the boundary. First, using the
characterizations of the corresponding minimal speeds, we will see that they
converge to the minimal speed of the limiting problem. Then, we will take
interest in the convergence of the traveling front solutions of our
reaction-di?usion systems. We will show the convergence under some assumptions
on those solutions, which in particular can be satis?ed in dimension 2.
