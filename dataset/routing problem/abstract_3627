This paper considers linear transceiver design for downlink multiuser
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We examine different transceiver
design problems. We focus on two groups of design problems. The first group is
the weighted sum mean-square-error (WSMSE) (i.e., symbol-wise or user-wise
WSMSE) minimization problems and the second group is the minimization of the
maximum weighted mean-squareerror (WMSE) (symbol-wise or user-wise WMSE)
problems. The problems are examined for the practically relevant scenario where
the power constraint is a combination of per base station (BS) antenna and per
symbol (user), and the noise vector of each mobile station is a zero-mean
circularly symmetric complex Gaussian random variable with arbitrary covariance
matrix. For each of these problems, we propose a novel downlink-interference
duality based iterative solution. Each of these problems is solved as follows.
First, we establish a new mean-square-error (MSE) downlink-interference
duality. Second, we formulate the power allocation part of the problem in the
downlink channel as a Geometric Program (GP). Third, using the duality result
and the solution of GP, we utilize alternating optimization technique to solve
the original downlink problem. For the first group of problems, we have
established symbol-wise and user-wise WSMSE downlink-interference duality.
