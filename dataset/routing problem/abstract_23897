We introduce Laplace transformations of 2D semi-discrete hyperbolic
Schroedinger operators and show their relation to a semi-discrete 2D Toda
lattice. We develop the algebro-geometric spectral theory of 2D semi-discrete
hyperbolic Schroedinger operators and solve the direct spectral problem for 2D
discrete ones (the inverse problem for discrete operators was already solved by
Krichever). Using the spectral theory we investigate spectral properties of the
Laplace transformations of these operators. This makes it possible to find
solutions of the semi-discrete and discrete 2D Toda lattices in terms of
theta-functions.
