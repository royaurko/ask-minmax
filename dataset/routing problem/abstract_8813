An old problem asks whether a Riemannian manifold can be isospectral to a
Riemannian orbifold with nontrivial singular set. In this short note we show
that under the assumption of Schanuel's conjecture in transcendental number
theory, this is impossible whenever the orbifold and manifold in question are
length-commensurable compact locally symmetric spaces of nonpositive curvature
associated to simple Lie groups.
