We study clustering on graphs with multiple edge types. Our main motivation
is that similarities between objects can be measured in many different metrics.
For instance similarity between two papers can be based on common contributors,
where they are published, keyword similarity, citations, etc. As such, graphs
with multiple edges is a more accurate model to describe similarities between
objects. Each edge/metric provides only partial information about the data;
recovering full information requires aggregation of all the similarity metrics.
Clustering becomes much more challenging in this context, since in addition to
the difficulties of the traditional clustering problem, we have to deal with a
space of clusterings. We generalize the concept of clustering in single-edge
graphs to multi-edged graphs and investigate problems such as: Can we find a
clustering that remains good, even if we change the relative weights of
metrics? How can we describe the space of clusterings efficiently? Can we find
unexpected clusterings (a good clustering that is distant from all given
clusterings)? If given the ground-truth clustering, can we recover how the
weights for edge types were aggregated? %In this paper, we discuss these
problems and the underlying algorithmic challenges and propose some solutions.
We also present two case studies: one based on papers on Arxiv and one based on
CIA World Factbook.
