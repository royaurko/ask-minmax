Using information theoretic quantities like the Wehrl entropy and Fisher's
information measure we study the thermodynamics of the problem leading to
Landau's diamagnetism, namely, a free spinless electron in a uniform magnetic
field. It is shown that such a problem can be "translated" into that of the
thermal harmonic oscillator. We discover a new Fisher-uncertainty relation,
derived via the Cramer-Rao inequality, that involves phase space localization
and energy fluctuations.
