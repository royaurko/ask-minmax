We present an alternative formulation of the magnetostatic boundary value
problem which is useful for calculating the magnetic field around a magnetic
material placed in the vicinity of steady currents. The formulation differs
from the standard approach in that a single-valued scalar potential, plus a
vector field that depends on the given currents but not on the magnetic
material, are used to obtain the total magnetic field instead of a magnetic
vector potential. We illustrate the method by a few sample computations.
