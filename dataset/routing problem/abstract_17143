Multichannel Cosmic Ray (CR) spectra and the large scale CR anisotropy can
hardly be made compatible in the framework of conventional isotropic and
homogeneous propagation models. These models also have problems explaining the
longitude distribution and the radial emissivity gradient of the $\gamma$-ray
galactic interstellar emission. We argue here that accounting for a well
physically motivated correlation between the CR escape time and the spatially
dependent magnetic turbulence power can naturally solve both problems. Indeed,
by exploiting this correlation we find propagation models that fit a wide set
of CR primary and secondary spectra, and consistently reproduce the CR
anisotropy in the energy range $10^2 - 10^4 \GeV$ and the $\gamma$-ray
longitude distribution recently measured by Fermi-LAT.
