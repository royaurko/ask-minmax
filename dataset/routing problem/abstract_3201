We review the current state of the homogeneous Banach space problem. We then
formulate several questions which arise naturally from this problem, some of
which seem to be fundamental but new. We give many examples defining the
bounds on the problem. We end with a simple construction showing that every
infinite dimensional Banach space contains a subspace on which weak properties
have become stable (under passing to further subspaces). Implications of this
construction are considered.
