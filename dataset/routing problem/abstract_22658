This paper defines unification based ID/LP grammars based on typed feature
structures as nonterminals and proposes a variant of Earley's algorithm to
decide whether a given input sentence is a member of the language generated by
a particular typed unification ID/LP grammar. A solution to the problem of the
nonlocal flow of information in unification ID/LP grammars as discussed in
Seiffert (1991) is incorporated into the algorithm. At the same time, it tries
to connect this technical work with linguistics by presenting an example of the
problem resulting from HPSG approaches to linguistics (Hinrichs and Nakasawa
1994, Richter and Sailer 1995) and with computational linguistics by drawing
connections from this approach to systems implementing HPSG, especially the
TROLL system, Gerdemann et al. (forthcoming).
