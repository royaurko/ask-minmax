Several complex organic molecules are routinely detected in high abundances
towards hot cores and hot corinos. For many of them, their paths of formation
in space are uncertain, as gas phase reactions alone seem to be insufficient.
  In this paper, we investigate a possible solid-phase route of formation for
methyl formate (HCOOCH3). We use a chemical model updated with recent results
from an experiment where simulated grain surfaces were irradiated with 200 keV
protons at 16 K, to simulate the effects of cosmic ray irradiation on grain
surfaces.
  We find that this model may be sufficient to reproduce the observed methyl
formate in dark clouds, but not that found in hot cores and corinos.
