Analytical solutions to acoustic scattering problems involving nonspherical
shapes, such as spheroids and disks, have long been known and have many
applications. However, these solutions require special functions that are not
easily computable. For this reason, their asymptotic forms are typically used
since they are more readily available. We explore these solutions and provide
computational software for calculating their nonasymptotic forms, which are
accurate over a wide range of frequencies and distances. This software, which
runs in MATLAB, computes the solutions to acoustic scattering problems
involving spheroids and disks by semi-analytical means, and is freely available
from our webpage.
