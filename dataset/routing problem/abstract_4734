We show local existence and uniqueness of plasma(fluid)-vaccum free boundary
problem of magnetohydrodynamic flow in three-dimensional space with infinite
depth setting when magnetic field is zero on the free boundary. We use
Sobolev-Slobodetskii space which was used in usual free boundary problem in
[3,5,6,7,8,9]. We also show that this solution can be extended as long as we
want for sufficiently small initial data. Using the result of this paper we
will get a unique solution of (kinematic inviscid) - (magnetic non diffusive)
free boundary magnetohydrodynamics problem via (kinematic viscosity) -
(magnetic diffusivity) limit in [10].
