The perturbed Kepler problem is shown to be a bi-Hamiltonian system in spite
of the fact that the graph of the Hamilton function is not a hypersurface of
translation, which is against a necessary condition for the existence of the
bi-Hamiltonian structure according to the Fernandes theorem. In fact, both the
initial and perturbed Kepler systems are isochronous systems and, therefore,
the Fernandes theorem cannot be applied to them.
