PDDL was originally conceived and constructed as a lingua franca for the
International Planning Competition. PDDL2.1 embodies a set of extensions
intended to support the expression of something closer to real planning
problems. This objective has only been partially achieved, due in large part to
a deliberate focus on not moving too far from classical planning models and
solution methods.
