In this contribution, we establish a model for multichannel cognitive radio
networks (CRNs) using the theory of priority queues. This model enables us to
conduct a performance analysis in the most general form by the derivation of
the probability mass function (PMF) of queue length at the secondary users
(SUs). In the second part, a reverse problem is considered to answer the
important top-down question of whether a service requirement can be satisfied
in a multi-channel CRN knowing the network parameters and traffic situation
with respect to the SUs and the primary users (PUs). Terming this problem as
the network synthesis, a precise conservation law is obtained, which relates
the packet waiting times of both types of users, and based on which the
achievable region of the network is also determined. Lastly, by the
introduction of a mixed strategy, the conditions for the existence of an
optimal trade-off between the interference onto the PUs and the
quality-of-service of the SUs is shown, and the optimal mixed strategy is
obtained when those conditions are satisfied.
