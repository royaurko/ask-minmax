Generalized linear models (GLMs) have been used quite effectively in the
modeling of a mean response under nonstandard conditions, where discrete as
well as continuous data distributions can be accommodated. The choice of design
for a GLM is a very important task in the development and building of an
adequate model. However, one major problem that handicaps the construction of a
GLM design is its dependence on the unknown parameters of the fitted model.
Several approaches have been proposed in the past 25 years to solve this
problem. These approaches, however, have provided only partial solutions that
apply in only some special cases, and the problem, in general, remains largely
unresolved. The purpose of this article is to focus attention on the
aforementioned dependence problem. We provide a survey of various existing
techniques dealing with the dependence problem. This survey includes
discussions concerning locally optimal designs, sequential designs, Bayesian
designs and the quantile dispersion graph approach for comparing designs for
GLMs.
