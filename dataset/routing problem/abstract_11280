Recently, an interesting class of the direct gauge mediation supersymmetry
(SUSY) breaking models are proposed, in which the minimum of the potential of
the SUSY breaking field is determined by the inverted hierarchy mechanism. We
consider their cosmological implications. In this class of models, SUSY
breaking field has a very flat potential, which may have a cosmological
importance. Assuming the initial amplitude of the SUSY breaking field to be of
the order of the Planck scale, it can be a source of a large entropy
production. A special attention is paid to the cosmological moduli problem, and
we will see the cosmological mass density of the moduli field can be
significantly reduced.
