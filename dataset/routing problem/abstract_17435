We discuss a general approach to handling "multiple hypotheses" testing in
the case when a particular hypothesis states that the vector of parameters
identifying the distribution of observations belongs to a convex compact set
associated with the hypothesis. With our approach, this problem reduces to
testing the hypotheses pairwise. Our central result is a test for a pair of
hypotheses of the outlined type which, under appropriate assumptions, is
provably nearly optimal. The test is yielded by a solution to a convex
programming problem, so that our construction admits computationally efficient
implementation. We further demonstrate that our assumptions are satisfied in
several important and interesting applications. Finally, we show how our
approach can be applied to a rather general detection problem encompassing
several classical statistical settings such as detection of abrupt signal
changes, cusp detection and multi-sensor detection.
