In 1996, H. Volkmer observed that the inequality
\[(\int_{-1}^1\frac{1}{|r|}|f'|dx)^2 \le K^2
\int_{-1}^1|f|^2dx\int_{-1}^1\Big|\Big(\frac{1}{r}f'\Big)'\Big|^2dx \] is
satisfied with some positive constant $K>0$ for a certain class of functions
$f$ on $[-1,1]$ if the eigenfunctions of the problem \[ -y"=\lambda\,
r(x)y,\quad y(-1)=y(1)=0 \] form a Riesz basis of the Hilbert space
$L^2_{|r|}(-1,1)$. Here the weight $r\in L^1(-1,1)$ is assumed to satisfy
$xr(x)>0$ a.e. on $[-1,1]$.
  We present two criteria in terms of Weyl-Titchmarsh $m$-functions for the
Volkmer inequality to be valid. Using these results we show that this
inequality is valid if the operator associated with the spectral problem
satisfies the linear resolvent growth condition. In particular, we show that
the Riesz basis property of eigenfunctions is equivalent to the linear
resolvent growth if $r$ is odd.
