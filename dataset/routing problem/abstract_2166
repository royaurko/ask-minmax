The available synthesized silicene-like structures have been only realized on
metallic substrates which are very different from the standalone buckled
silicene, e.g. the Dirac cone of silicene is destroyed due to lattice
distortion and the interaction with the substrate. Using graphene bilayer as a
scaffold a novel route is proposed to synthesize silicene with electronic
properties decoupled from the substrate. The buckled hexagonal arrangement of
silicene between the graphene layers is found to be very similar to the
theoretically predicted standalone buckled silicene which is only very weakly
van der Waals coupled to the graphene layers with a graphite-like interlayer
distance of 3.42\,\AA and without only lattice distortion. We found that these
stacked layers are stable well above room temperature.
