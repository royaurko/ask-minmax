The broadcast scheduling problem asks how a multihop network of broadcast
transceivers operating on a shared medium may share the medium in such a way
that communication over the entire network is possible. This can be naturally
modeled as a graph coloring problem via distance-2 coloring (L(1,1)-labeling,
strict scheduling). This coloring is difficult to compute and may require a
number of colors quadratic in the graph degree. This paper introduces
pseudo-scheduling, a relaxation of distance-2 coloring. Centralized and
decentralized algorithms that compute pseudo-schedules with colors linear in
the graph degree are given and proved.
