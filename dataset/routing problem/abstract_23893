In this letter we re-visit the X-ray problem. Assuming point interaction
between the conduction electrons and the first instantaneously created
core-hole, the latter's Green's function can be represented as a Fredholm
determinant of certain Wiener-Hopf operators acting on L^2(0,T) with
discontinuous symbols. Here the symbols are the local conduction electron
Green's function in the frequency domain and T is the time the core-hole spends
in the system before removal. In this situation, the classical theory of
singular integral equations usually employed in the literature to compute the
large T asymptotics of the Fredholm determinant ceased to be applicable. A
rigorous theory first put forward in the context of operator theory comes into
play and universal constants are found in the aymptotics.
