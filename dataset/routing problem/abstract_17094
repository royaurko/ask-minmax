Motivated by iterative decoding techniques for the binary erasure channel
Hollmann and Tolhuizen introduced and studied the notion of generic erasure
correcting sets for linear codes. A generic $(r,s)$--erasure correcting set
generates for all codes of codimension $r$ a parity check matrix that allows
iterative decoding of all correctable erasure patterns of size $s$ or less. The
problem is to derive bounds on the minimum size $F(r,s)$ of generic erasure
correcting sets and to find constructions for such sets. In this paper we
continue the study of these sets. We derive better lower and upper bounds.
Hollmann and Tolhuizen also introduced the stronger notion of $(r,s)$--sets and
derived bounds for their minimum size $G(r,s)$. Here also we improve these
bounds. We observe that these two conceps are closely related to so called
$s$--wise intersecting codes, an area, in which $G(r,s)$ has been studied
primarily with respect to ratewise performance. We derive connections. Finally,
we observed that hypergraph covering can be used for both problems to derive
good upper bounds.
