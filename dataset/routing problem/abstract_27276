We consider the situation in which $m_{3/2}\sim O(100{\rm TeV})$ for solving
the gravitino problem and the other supersymmetry(SUSY) breaking parameters are
$O(1{\rm TeV})$ for the naturalness. We point out that the anomaly mediation
cancels out the renormalization group contribution to the gaugino masses and
the sfermion masses other than the stop masses at a scale which is called the
mirage scale. The situation is similar to the mirage mediation, in which
special boundary conditions for the SUSY breaking parameters are required,
though for the stop masses and the up-type Higgs mass, such cancellation at the
mirage scale does not happen. Despite no cancellation for the up-type Higgs
mass, we show that the little hierarchy problem becomes less severe in this
situation. One advantage of this situation over the mirage mediation is that
the stop mixing parameter $A_t$ can be larger and therefore, smaller stop mass
is sufficient for 125 GeV Higgs. When the mirage scale is around TeV scale, the
SUSY breaking parameters induced by the gravity mediation at the grand
unification scale can be observed directly by the TeV scale experiments.
