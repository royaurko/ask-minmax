In this paper we show existence of solutions for some elliptic problems with
nonlocal diffusion by means of nonvariational tools. Our proof is based on the
use of topological degree, which requires a priori bounds for the solutions. We
obtain the a priori bounds by adapting the classical scaling method of Gidas
and Spruck. We also deal with problems involving gradient terms.
