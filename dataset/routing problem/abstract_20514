In the iterative algorithm recently proposed by Waxman for solving eigenvalue
problems, we point out that the convergence rate may be improved. For many
non-singular symmetric potentials which vanish asymptotically, a simple
analytical relationship between the coupling constant of the potential and the
ground state eigenvalue is obtained which can be used to make the algorithm
more efficient.
