The Exceptional Supersymmetric Standard Model (E6SSM) is an E6 inspired model
with an extra gauged U(1) symmetry, which solves the mu-problem in a similar
way to the NMSSM but without the accompanying problems of singlet tadpoles or
domain walls. It predicts new exotic particles at the TeV scale. We investigate
the Renormalisation Group Evolution of the model and test electroweak symmetry
breaking for a selection of interesting scenarios with non-universal Higgs
masses at the GUT scale. We present a detailed particle spectrum that could be
observed at the LHC.
