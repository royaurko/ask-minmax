We address the problem of retrieving information from a noisy version of the
``knowledge networks'' introduced by Maslov and Zhang. We map this problem onto
a disordered statistical mechanics model, which opens the door to many
analytical and numerical approaches. We give the replica symmetric solution,
compare with numerical simulations, and finally discuss an application to real
datas from the United States Senate.
