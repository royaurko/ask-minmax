In this paper we prove that the avalanche problem for Kadanoff sandpile model
(KSPM) is P-complete for two-dimensions. Our proof is based on a reduction from
the monotone circuit value problem by building logic gates and wires which work
with configurations in KSPM. The proof is also related to the known prediction
problem for sandpile which is in NC for one-dimensional sandpiles and is
P-complete for dimension 3 or greater. The computational complexity of the
prediction problem remains open for two-dimensional sandpiles.
