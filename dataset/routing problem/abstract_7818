Let R be a complete discrete valuation ring of mixed characteristics, with
algebraically closed residue field k. We study the existence problem of
equivariant liftings to R of Galois covers of nodal curves over k. Using
formal geometry, we show that this problem is actually a local one. We apply
this local-to-global principle to obtain new results concerning the existence
of such liftings.
