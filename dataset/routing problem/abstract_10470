In this paper, we consider the problem of power efficient uplink scheduling
in a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) system over a fading wireless
channel. The objective is to minimize the power expenditure of each user
subject to satisfying individual user delay. We make the practical assumption
that the system statistics are unknown, i.e., the probability distributions of
the user arrivals and channel states are unknown. The problem has the structure
of a Constrained Markov Decision Problem (CMDP). Determining an optimal policy
under for the CMDP faces the problems of state space explosion and unknown
system statistics. To tackle the problem of state space explosion, we suggest
determining the transmission rate of a particular user in each slot based on
its channel condition and buffer occupancy only. The rate allocation algorithm
for a particular user is a learning algorithm that learns about the buffer
occupancy and channel states of that user during system execution and thus
addresses the issue of unknown system statistics. Once the rate of each user is
determined, the proposed algorithm schedules the user with the best rate. Our
simulations within an IEEE 802.16 system demonstrate that the algorithm is
indeed able to satisfy the user specified delay constraints. We compare the
performance of our algorithm with the well known M-LWDF algorithm. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the power expended by the users under our algorithm is quite
low.
