In this paper we have computed all the affine Kac-Moody symmetric spaces
which are tame Frechet manifolds starting from the Vogan diagrams related to
the affine untwisted Kac-Moody algebras. The detail computation of affine
Kac-Moody symmetric spaces associated with A_1^(1) and A_2^(1) are shown
algebraically to corroborate our method.
