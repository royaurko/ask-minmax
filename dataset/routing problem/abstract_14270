A set $A$ of vertices in an $r$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal H$ is covered in
$\mathcal H$ if, for every $(r-1)$-set $B\subset A$, the set $\{u\}\cup B$ is
in $\mathcal H$. Erdos and Moser (1970) determined the minimum number of edges
in a graph on $n$ vertices such that every $k$-set is covered. We extend this
result to $r$-uniform hypergraphs on sufficiently many vertices, and determine
the extremal hypergraphs. We also address the problem for directed graphs.
