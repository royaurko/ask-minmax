We derive an explicit system of Picard-Fuchs differential equations satisfied
by Abelian integrals of monomial forms and majorize its coefficients. A
peculiar feature of this construction is that the system admitting such
explicit majorants, appears only in dimension approximately two times greater
than the standard Picard-Fuchs system.
  The result is used to obtain a partial solution to the tangential Hilbert
16th problem. We establish upper bounds for the number of zeros of arbitrary
Abelian integrals on a positive distance from the critical locus. Under the
additional assumption that the critical values of the Hamiltonian are distant
from each other (after a proper normalization), we were able to majorize the
number of all (real and complex) zeros.
  In the second part of the paper an equivariant formulation of the above
problem is discussed and relationships between spread of critical values and
non-homogeneity of uni- and bivariate complex polynomials are studied.
