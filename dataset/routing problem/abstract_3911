We consider a generalisation of the classical Lehmer problem about the
distribution of modular inverses in arithmetic progression, introduced by E.
Alkan, F. Stan and A. Zaharescu. Using bounds of sums of multiplicative
characters instead of traditionally applied to this kind of problem Kloosterman
sums, we improve their results in several directions.
