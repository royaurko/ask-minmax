We consider a pair of isoperimetric problems arising in physics. The first
concerns a Schr\"odinger operator in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ with an attractive
interaction supported on a closed curve $\Gamma$, formally given by
$-\Delta-\alpha \delta(x-\Gamma)$; we ask which curve of a given length
maximizes the ground state energy. In the second problem we have a loop-shaped
thread $\Gamma$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, homogeneously charged but not conducting,
and we ask about the (renormalized) potential-energy minimizer. Both problems
reduce to purely geometric questions about inequalities for mean values of
chords of $\Gamma$. We prove an isoperimetric theorem for $p$-means of chords
of curves when $p \leq 2$, which implies in particular that the global extrema
for the physical problems are always attained when $\Gamma$ is a circle. The
article finishes with a discussion of the $p$--means of chords when $p > 2$.
