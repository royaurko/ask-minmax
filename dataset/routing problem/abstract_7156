Consider a classification problem where we do not have access to labels for
individual training examples, but only have average labels over
sub-populations. We give practical examples of this setup, and show how such a
classification task can usefully be analyzed as a weakly supervised clustering
problem. We propose three approaches to solving the weakly supervised
clustering problem, including a latent variables model that performs well in
our experiments. We illustrate our methods on an analysis of aggregated
elections data, and an industry dataset that was the original motivation for
this research.
