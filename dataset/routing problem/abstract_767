The technologies like Wi-Fi, Blue tooth, WiMax etc. have made Mobile Ad hoc
Networks common in our Real life. Multi-media applications need to be supported
on MANET. A certain level of QoS (Quality of Service) support is essential for
Real time data. Our proposed protocol provides the required QoS without having
negative impact on Best Effort data traffic. An efficient rout discovery
mechanism for AODV routing protocol as well as transmission technique for real
time data are proposed. This technique gives more transmission opportunities to
real time data traffic results in decreasing transmission delay and increasing
throughput. A modified version of the popular AODV routing protocol to provide
QoS guarantee for real time traffic in MANETs is proposed. The simulation shows
better performance results for proposed protocol over the basic AODV.
