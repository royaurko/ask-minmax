The use of the sine-Gordon equation as a model of magnetic flux propagation
in Josephson junctions motivates studying the initial-value problem for this
equation in the semiclassical limit in which the dispersion parameter $\e$
tends to zero. Assuming natural initial data having the profile of a moving
$-2\pi$ kink at time zero, we analytically calculate the scattering data of
this completely integrable Cauchy problem for all $\e>0$ sufficiently small,
and further we invert the scattering transform to calculate the solution for a
sequence of arbitrarily small $\e$. This sequence of exact solutions is
analogous to that of the well-known $N$-soliton (or higher-order soliton)
solutions of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Plots of exact
solutions for small $\e$ reveal certain features that emerge in the
semiclassical limit. For example, in the limit $\epsilon\to 0$ one observes the
appearance of nonlinear caustics. In the appendices we give a self contained
account of the Cauchy problem from the perspectives of both inverse scattering
and classical analysis (Picard iteration). Specifically, Appendix A contains a
complete formulation of the inverse-scattering method for generic $L^1$-Sobolev
initial data, and Appendix B establishes the well-posedness for $L^p$-Sobolev
initial data (which in particular completely justifies the inverse-scattering
analysis in Appendix A).
