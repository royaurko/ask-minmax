We present the necessary and sufficient condition for the
$L^2$-well-posedness of the initial problem for a third order linear dispersive
equation on the two dimensional torus. Birkhoff's method of asymptotic
solutions is used to prove the necessity. Some properties of a system for
quadratic algebraic equations associated to the principal symbol play crucial
role in proving the sufficiency.
