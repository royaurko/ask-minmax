The initial value problem of the Zakharov system on two dimensional torus
with general period is shown to be locally well-posed in the Sobolev spaces of
optimal regularity, including the energy space. Proof relies on a standard
iteration argument using the Bourgain norms. The same strategy is also
applicable to three and higher dimensional cases.
