To advance Thomson problem we generalize physical principles suggested by
Caspar and Klug (CK) to model icosahedral capsids. Proposed simplest
distortions of the CK spherical arrangements yield new-type trial structures
very close to the lowest energy ones. In the region 600<N<1000, where N is the
number of particles in the structure, we found 40 new spherical crystals with
the lowest ever seen energies and curvature-induced topological defects being
not the well-known elongated scars but flatten pentagons. These crystals have N
values prohibited in the CK model and demonstrate a new way to combine the
local hexagonal order and spherical geometry.
