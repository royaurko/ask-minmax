This paper partially addresses the problem of characterizing the lengths of
vectors in a family of Euclidean lattices that arise from any CM number field.
We define a modified quadratic form on these lattices, the weighted norm, that
contains the standard field trace as a special case. Using this modified
quadratic form, we obtain a bound on the field norm of any vector that has a
minimal length in any of these lattices, in terms of a basis for the group of
units of the ring of integers of the field. For any CM number field F, we prove
that there exists a finite set of elements of F which allows one to find the
set of minimal vectors in every principal ideal of the ring of integers of F.
We interpret our result in terms of the asymptotic behavior of a Hilbert
modular form, and consider some of the computational implications of our
theorem. Additionally, we show how our result can be applied to the specific
Craig's Difference Lattice problem, which asks us to find the minimal vectors
in lattices arising from cyclotomic number fields.
