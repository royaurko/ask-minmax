A hybrid version the deformed nuclear potential is suggested, which combines
a spherical Woods Saxon potential with a deformed Nilsson potential. It removes
the problems of the conventional Nilsson potential in the mass 130 region.
Based on the hybrid potential, tilted axis cranking calculations are carried
out for the magnetic dipole band in ^{128}Ba.
