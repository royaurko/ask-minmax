We consider the Cauchy problem of the two-dimensional Schr\"odinger-Poisson
system in the energy class. Though the Newtonian potential diverges at the
spatial infinity in the logarithmic order, global well-posedness is proven in
both defocusing and focusing cases. The key is a decomposition of the
nonlinearity into a sum of the linear logarithmic potential and a good
remainder, which enables us to apply the perturbation method. Our argument can
be adapted to the one-dimensional problem.
