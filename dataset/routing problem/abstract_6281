We consider an elliptic PDE in two variables. As one parameter approaches
zero, this PDE collapses to a parabolic one, that is forward parabolic in a
part of the domain and backward parabolic in the remainder. Such problems arise
naturally in various stochastic models, such as fluid models for data-handling
systems and Markov-modulated queues. We employ singular perturbation methods to
study the problem for small values of the parameter.
