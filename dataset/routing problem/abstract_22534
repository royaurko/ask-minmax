Unhappily, there has been a maelstrom of problems for dark matter theories
over the last few years and many serious difficulties still have no resolution
in sight. This article reviews the evidence for dark matter in galaxies. The
haloes built up by hierarchical merging in dark matter cosmogonies are cusped
and dominated by dark matter at the center. Evidence from the microlensing
optical depth towards Baade's Window and from dynamical modelling of the
Galactic bar already suggests that the Galactic halo is not cusped. Similarly,
evidence from the stability of unbarred disk galaxies, as well as the survival
of fast bars in barred galaxies, suggests that the this result holds good more
generally. Judged on the data from galactic scales alone, the case for dark
matter is weak and non-standard theories of gravity provide a better
description. Of course, non-standard theories of gravity have their own
problems, but not on galactic scales.
