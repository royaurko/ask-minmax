We introduce and analyze a system of two coupled partial differential
equations with external noise. The equations are constructed to model
transitions of monovalent metallic nanowires with non-axisymmetric intermediate
or end states, but also have more general applicability. They provide a rare
example of a system for which an exact solution of nonuniform stationary states
can be found. We find a transition in activation behavior as the interval
length on which the fields are defined is varied. We discuss several
applications to physical problems.
