We introduce Quasi-Threshold Mover (QTM), an algorithm to solve the
quasi-threshold (also called trivially perfect) graph editing problem with edge
insertion and deletion. Given a graph it computes a quasi-threshold graph which
is close in terms of edit count. This edit problem is NP-hard. We present an
extensive experimental study, in which we show that QTM is the first algorithm
that is able to scale to large real-world graphs in practice. As a side result
we further present a simple linear-time algorithm for the quasi-threshold
recognition problem.
