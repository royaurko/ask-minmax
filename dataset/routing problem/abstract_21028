The problem of thermally activated escape over a potential barrier is solved
by means of path integrals for one-dimensional reaction dynamics with very
general time dependences. For a suitably chosen but still quite simple static
potential landscape, the net escape rate may be substantially reduced by
temporally increasing the temperature above its unperturbed constant level.
