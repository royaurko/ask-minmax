We investigate the problem of secure source coding with a two-sided helper in
a game-theoretic framework. Alice (A) and Helen (H) view iid correlated
information sequences $X^n$ and $Y^n$ respectively. Alice communicates to Bob
(B) at rate $R$, while H broadcasts a message to both A and B at rate $R_H$.
Additionally, A and B share secret key $K$ at rate $R_0$ that is independent of
$(X^n,Y^n)$. An active adversary, Eve (E) sees all communication links while
having access to a (possibly degraded) version of the past information. We
characterize the rate-payoff region for this problem. We also solve the problem
when the link from A to B is private. Our work recovers previous results of
Schieler-Cuff and Kittichokechai et al.
