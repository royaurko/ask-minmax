We consider questions related to the computation of the capacity of codes
that avoid forbidden difference patterns. The maximal number of $n$-bit
sequences whose pairwise differences do not contain some given forbidden
difference patterns increases exponentially with $n$. The exponent is the
capacity of the forbidden patterns, which is given by the logarithm of the
joint spectral radius of a set of matrices constructed from the forbidden
difference patterns. We provide a new family of bounds that allows for the
approximation, in exponential time, of the capacity with arbitrary high degree
of accuracy. We also provide a polynomial time algorithm for the problem of
determining if the capacity of a set is positive, but we prove that the same
problem becomes NP-hard when the sets of forbidden patterns are defined over an
extended set of symbols. Finally, we prove the existence of extremal norms for
the sets of matrices arising in the capacity computation. This result makes it
possible to apply a specific (even though non polynomial) approximation
algorithm. We illustrate this fact by computing exactly the capacity of codes
that were only known approximately.
