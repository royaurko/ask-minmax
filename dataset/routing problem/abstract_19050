We consider the problem of finding a minimum edge cost subgraph of a graph
satisfying both given node-connectivity requirements and degree upper bounds on
nodes. We present an iterative rounding algorithm of the biset LP relaxation
for this problem. For directed graphs and $k$-out-connectivity requirements
from a root, our algorithm computes a solution that is a 2-approximation on the
cost, and the degree of each node $v$ in the solution is at most $2b(v) + O(k)$
where $b(v)$ is the degree upper bound on $v$. For undirected graphs and
element-connectivity requirements with maximum connectivity requirement $k$,
our algorithm computes a solution that is a $4$-approximation on the cost, and
the degree of each node $v$ in the solution is at most $4b(v)+O(k)$. These
ratios improve the previous $O(\log k)$-approximation on the cost and $O(2^k
b(v))$ approximation on the degrees. Our algorithms can be used to improve
approximation ratios for other node-connectivity problems such as undirected
$k$-out-connectivity, directed and undirected $k$-connectivity, and undirected
rooted $k$-connectivity and subset $k$-connectivity.
