A clique of a graph is a maximal set of vertices of size at least 2 that
induces a complete graph. A $k$-clique-colouring of a graph is a colouring of
the vertices with at most $k$ colours such that no clique is monochromatic.
D\'efossez proved that the 2-clique-colouring of perfect graphs is a
$\Sigma_2^P$-complete problem [J. Graph Theory 62 (2009) 139--156]. We
strengthen this result by showing that it is still $\Sigma_2^P$-complete for
weakly chordal graphs. We then determine a hierarchy of nested subclasses of
weakly chordal graphs whereby each graph class is in a distinct complexity
class, namely $\Sigma_2^P$-complete, $\mathcal{NP}$-complete, and
$\mathcal{P}$. We solve an open problem posed by Kratochv\'il and Tuza to
determine the complexity of 2-clique-colouring of perfect graphs with all
cliques having size at least 3 [J. Algorithms 45 (2002), 40--54], proving that
it is a $\Sigma_2^P$-complete problem. We then determine a hierarchy of nested
subclasses of perfect graphs with all cliques having size at least 3 whereby
each graph class is in a distinct complexity class, namely
$\Sigma_2^P$-complete, $\mathcal{NP}$-complete, and $\mathcal{P}$.
