Joint sparsity regularization in multi-task learning has attracted much
attention in recent years. The traditional convex formulation employs the group
Lasso relaxation to achieve joint sparsity across tasks. Although this approach
leads to a simple convex formulation, it suffers from several issues due to the
looseness of the relaxation. To remedy this problem, we view jointly sparse
multi-task learning as a specialized random effects model, and derive a convex
relaxation approach that involves two steps. The first step learns the
covariance matrix of the coefficients using a convex formulation which we refer
to as sparse covariance coding; the second step solves a ridge regression
problem with a sparse quadratic regularizer based on the covariance matrix
obtained in the first step. It is shown that this approach produces an
asymptotically optimal quadratic regularizer in the multitask learning setting
when the number of tasks approaches infinity. Experimental results demonstrate
that the convex formulation obtained via the proposed model significantly
outperforms group Lasso (and related multi-stage formulations
