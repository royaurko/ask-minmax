We examine the application of the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method to a
cluster model for halo nuclei. Particular attention is paid to the error
estimate in the presence of correlations in the underlying random walk. We
analyse the required steps for a reliable application of the VMC in the case of
a complicated many-body problem such as the direct solution of the nuclear
hamiltonian with realistic interactions. We also examine the possibility of
variance reduction through the `zero variance principle', paying particular
attention to the complexity of the many-body problem.
