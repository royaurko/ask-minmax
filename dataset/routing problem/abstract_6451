We consider the problem of varying conformally the metric of a four
dimensional manifold in order to obtain constant $Q$-curvature. The problem is
variational, and solutions are in general found as critical points of saddle
type. We show how the problem leads naturally to consider the set of formal
barycenters of the manifold.
