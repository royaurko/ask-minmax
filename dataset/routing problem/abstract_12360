In the Scheduling Machines with Capacity Constraints problem, we are given k
identical machines, each of which can process at most m_i jobs. M jobs are also
given, where job j has a non-negative processing time length t_j >= 0. The task
is to find a schedule such that the makespan is minimized and the capacity
constraints are met. In this paper, we present a 3-approximation algorithm
using an extension of Iterative Rounding Method introduced by Jain. To the best
of the contributors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply Iterative
Rounding Method to scheduling problem with capacity constraints.
