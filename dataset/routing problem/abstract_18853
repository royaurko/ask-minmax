Let F be a finite set of graphs. In the F-Deletion problem, we are given an
n-vertex, m-edge graph G and an integer k as input, and asked whether at most k
vertices can be deleted from G such that the resulting graph does not contain a
graph from F as a minor. F-Deletion is a generic problem and by selecting
different sets of forbidden minors F, one can obtain various fundamental
problems such as Vertex Cover, Feedback Vertex Set or Treewidth t-Deletion.
  In this paper we obtain a number of generic algorithmic results about Planar
F-Deletion, when F contains at least one planar graph. The highlights of our
work are
  - A randomized O(nm) time constant factor approximation algorithm for the
optimization version of Planar F-Deletion.
  - A randomized O(2^{O(k)} n) time parameterized algorithm for Planar
F-Deletion when F is connected. Here a family F is called connected if every
graph in F is connected. The algorithm can be made deterministic at the cost of
making the polynomial factor in the running time n\log^2 n rather than linear.
  These algorithms unify, generalize, and improve over a multitude of results
in the literature. Our main results have several direct applications, but also
the methods we develop on the way have applicability beyond the scope of this
paper. Our results -- constant factor approximation and FPT algorithms -- are
stringed together by a common theme of polynomial time preprocessing.
