We study two different initial conditions for fermions for the problem of
pair production of fermions coupled to a classical electromagnetic field with
backreaction in \oneplusone boost-invariant coordinates. Both of these
conditions are consistent with fermions initially in a vacuum state. We present
results for the proper time evolution of the electric field $E$, the current,
the matter energy density, and the pressure as a function of the proper time
for these two cases. We also determine the interpolating number density as a
function of the proper time. We find that when we use a "first order adiabatic"
vacuum initial condition or a "free field" initial condition for the fermion
field, we obtain essentially similar behavior for physically measurable
quantities. The second method is computationally simpler, it is twice as fast
and involves half the storage required by the first method.
