We present a novel selection algorithm for N-2 contingency analysis problem.
The algorithm is based on the iterative bounding of line outage distribution
factors and successive pruning of the set of contingency pair candidates. The
selection procedure is non-heuristic, and is certified to identify all events
that lead to thermal constraints violations in DC approximation. The complexity
of the algorithm is O(N^2) comparable to the complexity of N-1 contingency
problem. We validate and test the algorithm on the Polish grid network with
around 3000 lines. For this test case two iterations of the pruning procedure
reduce the total number of candidate pairs by a factor of almost 1000 from 5
millions line pairs to only 6128.
