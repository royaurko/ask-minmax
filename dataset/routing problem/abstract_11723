We apply the Linear Delta Expansion (LDE) to the Lindstedt-Poincare
(``distorted time'') method to find improved approximate solutions to nonlinear
problems. We find that our method works very well for a wide range of
parameters in the case of the anharmonic oscillator (Duffing equation) and of
the non-linear pendulum. The approximate solutions found with this method are
better behaved and converge more rapidly to the exact ones than in the simple
Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method.
