It is an open problem in general to prove that there exists a sequence of
$\Delta_g$-eigenfunctions $\phi_{j_k}$ on a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ for
which the number $N(\phi_{j_k}) $ of nodal domains tends to infinity with the
eigenvalue. Our main result is that $N(\phi_{j_k}) \to \infty$ along a
subsequence of eigenvalues of density $1$ if the $(M, g)$ is a non-positively
curved surface with concave boundary, i.e. a generalized Sinai or Lorentz
billiard. Unlike the recent closely related work of Ghosh-Reznikov-Sarnak and
of the contributors on the nodal domain counting problem, the surfaces need not have
any symmetries.
