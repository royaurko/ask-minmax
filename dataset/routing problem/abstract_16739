We prove a completeness result for a class of polynomial solutions of the
wave equation called wave polynomials and construct generalized wave
polynomials, solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation with a variable
coefficient. Using the transmutation (transformation) operators and their
recently discovered mapping properties we prove the completeness of the
generalized wave polynomials and use them for an explicit construction of the
solution of the Cauchy problem for the Klein-Gordon equation. Based on this
result we develop a numerical method for solving the Cauchy problem and test
its performance.
