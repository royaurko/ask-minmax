We address the inverse problem of local volatility surface calibration from
market given option prices. We integrate the ever-increasing flow of option
price information into the well-accepted local volatility model of Dupire. This
leads to considering both the local volatility surfaces and their corresponding
prices as indexed by the observed underlying stock price as time goes by in
appropriate function spaces. The resulting parameter to data map is defined in
appropriate Bochner-Sobolev spaces. Under this framework, we prove key
regularity properties. This enable us to build a calibration technique that
combines online methods with convex Tikhonov regularization tools. Such
procedure is used to solve the inverse problem of local volatility
identification. As a result, we prove convergence rates with respect to noise
and a corresponding discrepancy-based choice for the regularization parameter.
We conclude by illustrating the theoretical results by means of numerical
tests.
