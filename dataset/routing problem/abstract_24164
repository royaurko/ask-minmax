We develop novel techniques using abstract operator theory to obtain
asymptotic formulae for lattice counting problems on infinite-volume hyperbolic
manifolds, with error terms which are uniform as the lattice moves through
"congruence" subgroups.
  We give the following application to the theory of affine linear sieves. In
the spirit of Fermat, consider the problem of primes in the sum of two squares,
f(c,d)=c^2+d^2, but restrict (c,d) to the orbit O = (0,1).Gamma, where Gamma is
an infinite-index non-elementary finitely-generated subgroup of SL(2,Z). Assume
that the Reimann surface Gamma\H^2 has a cusp at infinity. We show that the set
of values f(O) contains infinitely many integers having at most R prime factors
for any R>4/(delta-theta), where theta>1/2 is the spectral gap and delta<1 is
the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of Gamma. If delta>149/150, then we
can take theta=5/6, giving R=25. The limit of this method is R=9 for
delta-theta>4/9. This is the same number of prime factors as attained in Brun's
original attack on the twin prime conjecture.
