A statistical analysis is performed for a random unrestricted local crew
scheduling problem, expressed in terms of pairing arrivals with departures. The
analysis is aimed at understanding the structure of similar problems with
global restrictions, and estimating their difficulty. The methods developed are
of a general nature and can be of use in other problems with a similar
structure. For large random problems, the ground-state energy scales like
\sqrt{N} and the average excitation like N, where N is the number of
arrivals/departures. The average ground-state degeneracy is such that the
probability of hitting an optimal pairing by chance scales like 2N2^{-N} for
large N. By insisting on the local ground-state energy for a restricted
problem, airports can be split into smaller parts, and the state space reduced
by typically a factor ~ 2^{N_a}, with N_a the total number of airports.
