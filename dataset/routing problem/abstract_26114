In this paper we examine the use of topological methods for multivariate
statistics. Using persistent homology from computational algebraic topology, a
random sample is used to construct estimators of persistent homology. This
estimation procedure can then be evaluated using the bottleneck distance
between the estimated persistent homology and the true persistent homology. The
connection to statistics comes from the fact that when viewed as a
nonparametric regression problem, the bottleneck distance is bounded by the
sup-norm loss. Consequently, a sharp asymptotic minimax bound is determined
under the sup-norm risk over Holder classes of functions for the nonparametric
regression problem on manifolds. This provides good convergence properties for
the persistent homology estimator in terms of the expected bottleneck distance.
