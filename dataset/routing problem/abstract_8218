This paper analyzes rectangular finite element methods for fourth order
elliptic singular perturbation problems. We show that the non-$C^0$ rectangular
Morley element is uniformly convergent in the energy norm with respect to the
perturbation parameter. We also propose a $C^0$ extended high order rectangular
Morley element and prove the uniform convergence. Finally, we do some numerical
experiments to confirm the theoretical results.
