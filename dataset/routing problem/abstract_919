We present several algorithms for computing the visibility polygon of a
simple polygon $P$ from a viewpoint inside the polygon, when the polygon
resides in read-only memory and only few working variables can be used. The
first algorithm uses a constant number of variables, and outputs the vertices
of the visibility polygon in $O(n\Rout)$ time, where $\Rout$ denotes the number
of reflex vertices of $P$ that are part of the output. The next two algorithms
use $O(\log \Rin)$ variables, and output the visibility polygon in $O(n\log
\Rin)$ randomized expected time or $O(n\log^2 \Rin)$ deterministic time, where
$\Rin$ is the number of reflex vertices of $P$.
