We present a homogenization result for $L^\infty$ variational problems in
general stationary ergodic random environments. By introducing a generalized
notion of distance function (a special solution of an associated eikonal
equation) and demonstrating a connection to absolute minimizers of the
variational problem, we obtain the homogenization result as a consequence of
the fact that the latter homogenizes in random environments.
