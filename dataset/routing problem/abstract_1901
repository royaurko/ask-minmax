Inspired by cotunneling spectroscopy of spin-states in a single OPE5-based
molecule, we investigate the prospects for electric control of magnetism in
purely organic molecules contacted in a three-terminal geometry. Using the gate
electrode, the molecule is reversibly switched between three different redox
states, with magnetic spectra revealing both ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic exchange couplings on the molecule. These observations are
shown to be captured by an effective low-energy Heisenberg model, which we
substantiate microscopically by a simple valence bond description of the
molecule. These preliminary findings suggest an interesting route towards
functionalized all-organic molecular magnetism.
