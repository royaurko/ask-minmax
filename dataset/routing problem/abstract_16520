We investigate the birthrate problem for low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and
millisecond radio pulsars (MRPs) in this paper. We consider intermediate-mass
and low-mss X-ray binaries (I/LMXBs) as the progenitors of MRPs, and calculate
their evolutionary response to the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) both
semi-analytically and numerically. With typical value (~1 Gyr) of the LMXB
lifetime, one may expect comparable birthrates of LMXBs and MRPs, but the
calculated number of LMXBs is an order of magnitude higher than observed in the
Galaxy. Instead, we suggest that the birthrate problem could be solved if most
MRPs have evolved from faint rather bright LMXBs. The former may have a
population of ~ 104 in the Galaxy.
