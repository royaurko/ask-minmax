In this paper we develop a new approach to stochastic evolution equations
with an unbounded drift $A$ which is dependent on time and the underlying
probability space in an adapted way. It is well-known that the semigroup
approach to equations with random drift leads to adaptedness problems for the
stochastic convolution term. In this paper we give a new representation formula
for the stochastic convolution which avoids integration of nonadapted
processes. Here we mainly consider the parabolic setting. We establish
connections with other solution concepts such as weak solutions. The usual
parabolic regularity properties are derived and we show that the new approach
can be applied in the study of semilinear problems with random drift. At the
end of the paper the results are illustrated with two examples of stochastic
heat equations with random drift.
