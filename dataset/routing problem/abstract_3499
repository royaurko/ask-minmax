The problem of Maxflow is a widely developed subject in modern mathematics.
Efficient algorithms exist to solve this problem, that is why a good
generalization may permit these algorithms to be understood as a particular
instance of solutions in a wider class of problems. In the last section we
suggest a generalization in the context of simplicial complexes, that reduces
to the problem of Maxflow in graphs, when we consider a graph as a simplicial
complex of dimension 1.
