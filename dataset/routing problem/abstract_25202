We develop a Nitsche-based formulation for a general class of stabilized
finite element methods for the Stokes problem posed on a pair of overlapping,
non-matching meshes. By ex- tending the least-squares stabilization to the
overlap region, we prove that the method is stable, consistent, and optimally
convergent. To avoid an ill-conditioned linear algebra system, the scheme is
augmented by a least-squares term measuring the discontinuity of the solution
in the overlap region of the two meshes. As a consequence, we may prove an
estimate for the condition number of the resulting stiffness matrix that is
independent of the location of the interface. Finally, we present numerical
examples in three spatial dimensions illustrating and confirming the
theoretical results.
