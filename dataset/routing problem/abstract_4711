We propose an analysis for the stabilized finite element methods proposed in,
E. Burman, Stabilized finite element methods for nonsymmetric, noncoercive, and
ill-posed problems. Part I: Elliptic equations. SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 35(6)
2013, valid in the case of ill-posed problems for which only weak continuous
dependence can be assumed. A priori and a posteriori error estimates are
obtained without assuming coercivity or inf-sup stability of the continuous
problem. A numerical example illustrates the theory.
