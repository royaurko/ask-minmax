This study presented a type of image processing code which is used for
sharpening photoelastic fringe patterns of transparent materials in
photoelastic experiences to determine the stress distribution. C-Sharp software
was utilized for coding the algorithm of this image processing method. For
evaluation of this code, the results of a photoelastic experience of a sample
contact problem between a half-plane with an oblique edge crack and a tilted
wedge using this image processing method was compared with the FEM results of
the same problem in order to obtain the stress intensity factors (SIF) of the
specimen. A good agreement between experimental results extracted from this
method of image processing and computational results was observed.
