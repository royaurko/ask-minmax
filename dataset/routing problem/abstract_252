With the proliferation of mobile computing devices, the demand for continuous
network connectivity regardless of physical location has spurred interest in
the use of mobile ad hoc networks. Since Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is
the standard network protocol for communication in the internet, any wireless
network with Internet service need to be compatible with TCP. TCP is tuned to
perform well in traditional wired networks, where packet losses occur mostly
because of congestion. However, TCP connections in Ad-hoc mobile networks are
plagued by problems such as high bit error rates, frequent route changes,
multipath routing and temporary network partitions. The throughput of TCP over
such connection is not satisfactory, because TCP misinterprets the packet loss
or delay as congestion and invokes congestion control and avoidance algorithm.
In this research, the performance of TCP in Adhoc mobile network with high Bit
Error rate (BER) and mobility is studied and investigated. Simulation model is
implemented and experiments are performed using the Network Simulatior 2 (NS2).
