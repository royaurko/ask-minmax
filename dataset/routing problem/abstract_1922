We present a graphical analysis of the adiabatic connections underlying
double-hybrid density-functional methods that employ second-order perturbation
theory. Approximate adiabatic connection formulae relevant to the construction
of these functionals are derived and compared directly with those calculated
using accurate ab initio methods. The discontinuous nature of the approximate
adiabatic integrands is emphasized, the discontinuities occurring at
interaction strengths which mark the transitions between regions that are: (i)
described predominantly by second- order perturbation theory (ii) described by
a mixture of density-functional and second-order perturbation theory
contributions and (iii) described purely by density-functional theory.
Numerical examples are presented for a selection of small molecular systems and
van der Waals dimers. The impacts of commonly used approximations in each of
the three sections of the adiabatic connection are discussed along with
possible routes for the development of improved double-hybrid methodologies.
