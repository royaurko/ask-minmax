The moving coframe method is applied to solve the local equivalence problem
for the class of nonlinear wave equations in two independent variables under an
action of the pseudo-group of contact transformations. The structure equations
and the complete sets of differential invariants for symmetry groups are found.
The solution of the equivalence problem is given in terms of these invariants.
