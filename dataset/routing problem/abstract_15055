We carry out a systematic study of a natural covering problem, used for
identification across several areas, in the realm of parameterized complexity.
In the {\sc Test Cover} problem we are given a set $[n]=\{1,...,n\}$ of items
together with a collection, $\cal T$, of distinct subsets of these items called
tests. We assume that $\cal T$ is a test cover, i.e., for each pair of items
there is a test in $\cal T$ containing exactly one of these items. The
objective is to find a minimum size subcollection of $\cal T$, which is still a
test cover. The generic parameterized version of {\sc Test Cover} is denoted by
$p(k,n,|{\cal T}|)$-{\sc Test Cover}. Here, we are given $([n],\cal{T})$ and a
positive integer parameter $k$ as input and the objective is to decide whether
there is a test cover of size at most $p(k,n,|{\cal T}|)$. We study four
parameterizations for {\sc Test Cover} and obtain the following:
  (a) $k$-{\sc Test Cover}, and $(n-k)$-{\sc Test Cover} are fixed-parameter
tractable (FPT).
  (b) $(|{\cal T}|-k)$-{\sc Test Cover} and $(\log n+k)$-{\sc Test Cover} are
W[1]-hard. Thus, it is unlikely that these problems are FPT.
