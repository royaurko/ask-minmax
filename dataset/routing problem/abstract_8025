Boundary value problems for integrable nonlinear partial differential
equations are considered from the symmetry point of view. Families of boundary
conditions compatible with the Harry-Dym, KdV and MKdV equations and the
Volterra chain are discussed. We also discuss the uniqueness of some of these
boundary conditions.
