Dynamical evolution plays a key role in shaping the current properties of
star clusters and star cluster systems. A detailed understanding of the effects
of evolutionary processes is essential to be able to disentangle the properties
which result from dynamical evolution from those imprinted at the time of
cluster formation. In this review, we focus our attention on globular clusters
and review the main physical ingredients driving their early and long-term
evolution, describe the possible evolutionary routes and show how cluster
structure and stellar content are affected by dynamical evolution.
