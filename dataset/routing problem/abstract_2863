In various research papers, such as [2], one will find the claim that the
minLA is optimally solvable on outerplanar graphs, with a reference to [1].
However, the problem solved in that publication, which we refer to as the
planar minimum linear arrangement problem (planar minLA), is different from the
minimum linear arrangement problem (minLA), as we show in this article.
