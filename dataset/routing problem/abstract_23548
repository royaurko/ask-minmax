The new first order, rheonomic, kappa-supersymmetric formalism recently
introduced by us for the world-volume action of the D3-brane is extended to the
case of D5-branes. This extension requires the dual formulation of the Free
Differential Algebra of type IIB supergravity in terms of 6-form gauge
potentials which was so far missing and is given here. Furthermore relying on
our new approach we are able to write the D5-world volume action in a
manifestly SL(2,R) covariant form. This is important in order to solve the
outstanding problem of finding the appropriate boundary actions of D3-branes on
smooth ALE manifolds with twisted fields. The application of our results to
this problem is however postponed to a subsequent publication.
