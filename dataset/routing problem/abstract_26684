This paper presents a probabilistic interpretation for the weak Sobolev
solution of the obstacle problem for semilinear parabolic partial
integro-differential equations (PIDEs).
  The results of Leandre (1985) concerning the homeomorphic property for the
solution of SDEs with jumps are used to construct random test functions for the
variational equation for such PIDEs. This results in the natural connection
with the associated Reflected Backward Stochastic Differential Equations with
jumps (RBSDEs), namely Feynman Kac's formula for the solution of the PIDEs.
Moreover it gives an application to the pricing and hedging of contingent
claims with constraints in the wealth or portfolio processes in financial
markets including jumps.
