Based on the methodological similarity between sparse signal reconstruction
and system identification, a new approach for sparse signal reconstruction in
compressive sensing (CS) is proposed in this paper. This approach employs a
stochastic gradient-based adaptive filtering framework, which is commonly used
in system identification, to solve the sparse signal reconstruction problem.
Two typical algorithms for this problem: $l_0$-least mean square ($l_0$-LMS)
algorithm and $l_0$-exponentially forgetting window LMS ($l_0$-EFWLMS)
algorithm are hence introduced here. Both the algorithms utilize a zero
attraction method, which has been implemented by minimizing a continuous
approximation of $l_0$ norm of the studied signal. To improve the performances
of these proposed algorithms, an $l_0$-zero attraction projection ($l_0$-ZAP)
algorithm is also adopted, which has effectively accelerated their convergence
rates, making them much faster than the other existing algorithms for this
problem. Advantages of the proposed approach, such as its robustness against
noise etc., are demonstrated by numerical experiments.
