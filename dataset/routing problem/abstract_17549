The paper deals with a special kind of problems that appear in solutions of
Einstein's field equations for extended bodies: many structure-dependent terms
appear in intermediate calculations that cancel exactly in virtue of the local
equations of motion or can be eliminated by appropriate gauge transformations.
For a single body at rest these problems are well understood for both the
post-Newtonian and the post-Minkowskian cases. However, the situation is still
unclear for approximations of higher orders. This paper discusses this problem
for a "body" of spherical symmetry to post-linear order. We explicitly
demonstrate how the usual Schwarzschild field can be derived directly from the
field equations in the post-linear approximation in the harmonic gauge and for
an arbitrary spherically symmetric matter distribution. Both external and
internal solutions are considered. The case of static incompressible fluid is
then compared to the well-known results from the literature. The results of
this paper can be applied to generalize the well-known post-Newtonian and
post-Minkowskian multipole expansions of the metric in the post-linear
approximation.
