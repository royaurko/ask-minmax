This work addresses the problem of estimating the parameters of the general
half-normal distribution. Namely, the problem of determining the minimum risk
equi\-va\-riant (MRE) estimators of the parameters is explored. Simulation
studies are realized to compare the behavior of these estimators with maximum
likelihood and unbiased estimators. A natural Monte Carlo method to compute
conditional expectations is used to approximate the MRE estimation of the
location parameter because its expression involves two conditional expectations
not easily computables. The used Monte Carlo method is justified by a theorem
of Besicovitch on differentiation of measures, and has been slightly modified
to solve a sort of "curse of dimensionality" problem appearing in the
estimation of this parameter. This method has been implicitly used in the last
years in the context of ABC (approximate Bayesian computation) methods.
