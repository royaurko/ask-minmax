A highly nonlinear eigenvalue problem is studied in a Sobolev space with
variable exponent. The Euler-Lagrange equation for the minimization of a
Rayleigh quotient of two Luxemburg norms is derived. The asymptotic case with a
"variable infinity" is treated. Local uniqueness is proved for the viscosity
solutions.
