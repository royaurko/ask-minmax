One of the classical problems concerns the class of analytic functions $f$ on
the open unit disk $|z|<1$ which have finite Dirichlet integral $\Delta(1,f)$,
where $$\Delta(r,f)=\iint_{|z|<r}|f'(z)|^2 \, dxdy \quad (0<r\leq 1). $$ The
class ${\mathcal S}^*(A,B)$ of normalized functions $f$ analytic in $|z|<1$ and
satisfies the subordination condition $zf'(z)/f(z)\prec (1+Az)/(1+Bz)$ in
$|z|<1$ and for some $-1\leq B\leq 0$, $A\in {\mathbb C}$ with $A\neq B$, has
been studied extensively. In this paper, we solve the extremal problem of
determining the value of $$\max_{f\in {\mathcal S}^*(A,B)}\Delta(r,z/f)$$ as a
function of $r$. This settles the question raised by Ponnusamy and Wirths in
[11]. One of the particular cases includes solution to a conjecture of
Yamashita which was settled recently by Obradovi\'{c} et. al [9].
