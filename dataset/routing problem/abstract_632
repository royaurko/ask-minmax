Energy management is one of the critical parameters in Wireless Sensor
Networks. In this paper we attempt for a solution to balance the energy usage
for maximizing the network lifetime, increase the packet delivery ratio and
throughput. Our proposed algorithm is based on Energy Density of the clusters
in Wireless Sensor Networks. The cluster head is selected using two step method
and on-demand routing approach to calculate the balanced energy shortest path
from source to sink. This unique approach maintains the balanced energy
utilization among all nodes by selecting the different cluster heads
dynamically. Our simulation results have compared with one of the plain routing
scheme (EBRP) and cluster based routing (TSCHS), which shows the significant
improvements in minimizing the delay and energy utilization and maximizing the
network lifetime and throughput with respect to these works.
