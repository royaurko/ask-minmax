We address the existence and properties of discrete embedded solitons (ESs),
i.e., localized waves existing inside the phonon band in a nonlinear
dynamical-lattice model. The model describes a one-dimensional array of optical
waveguides with both the quadratic (second-harmonic generation) and cubic
nonlinearities. A rich family of ESs was previously known in the continuum
limit of the model. First, a simple motivating problem is considered, in which
the cubic nonlinearity acts in a single waveguide. An explicit solution is
constructed asymptotically in the large-wavenumber limit. The general problem
is then shown to be equivalent to the existence of a homoclinic orbit in a
four-dimensional reversible map. From properties of such maps, it is shown that
(unlike ordinary gap solitons), discrete ESs have the same codimension as their
continuum counterparts. A specific numerical method is developed to compute
homoclinic solutions of the map, that are symmetric under a specific reversing
transformation. Existence is then studied in the full parameter space of the
problem. Numerical results agree with the asymptotic results in the appropriate
limit and suggest that the discrete ESs may be semi-stable as in the continuous
case.
