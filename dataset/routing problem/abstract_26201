We address the problem of securing distributed storage systems against
eavesdropping and adversarial attacks. An important aspect of these systems is
node failures over time, necessitating, thus, a repair mechanism in order to
maintain a desired high system reliability. In such dynamic settings, an
important security problem is to safeguard the system from an intruder who may
come at different time instances during the lifetime of the storage system to
observe and possibly alter the data stored on some nodes. In this scenario, we
give upper bounds on the maximum amount of information that can be stored
safely on the system. For an important operating regime of the distributed
storage system, which we call the 'bandwidth-limited regime', we show that our
upper bounds are tight and provide explicit code constructions. Moreover, we
provide a way to short list the malicious nodes and expurgate the system.
