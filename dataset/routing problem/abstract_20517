The perturbation theory in QED used the new form of ground state as a state
of interacted particles is proposed. The mean electromagnetic field of charged
elementary particle is calculated. The possibility of elimination the problem
with ultraviolet as well as infrared divergences is shown. The electromagnetic
energy of the particle turns out to be regular and small.
