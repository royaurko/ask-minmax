A polynomial algorithm for solving "Hamiltonian circuit" problem is presented
in the paper. Computational complexity of the algorithm is equal
$O(n^{8}{\log_2}^2n)$ where $n$ is the cardinality of the observed graph vertex
set. Thus the polynomial solvability for ${\mathcal NP}$-complete problems is
proved.
