Let $S$ be a Polish space and $(X_n:n\geq1)$ an exchangeable sequence of
$S$-valued random variables. Let $\alpha_n(\cdot)=P(X_{n+1}\in \cdot\mid
X_1,\...,X_n)$ be the predictive measure and $\alpha$ a random probability
measure on $S$ such that
$\alpha_n\stackrel{\mathrm{weak}}{\longrightarrow}\alpha$ a.s. Two (related)
problems are addressed. One is to give conditions for $\alpha\ll\lambda$ a.s.,
where $\lambda$ is a (nonrandom) $\sigma$-finite Borel measure on $S$. Such
conditions should concern the finite dimensional distributions $\mathcal
{L}(X_1,\...,X_n)$, $n\geq1$, only. The other problem is to investigate whether
$\Vert\alp ha_n-\alpha\Vert\stackrel{\mathrm{a.s.}}{\longrightarrow}0$, where
$\Vert\cdot\Vert$ is total variation norm. Various results are obtained. Some
of them do not require exchangeability, but hold under the weaker assumption
that $(X_n)$ is conditionally identically distributed, in the sense of [Ann.
Probab. 32 (2004) 2029-2052].
