We investigate the existence of ground states for functionals with
nonhomogenous principal part. Roughly speaking, we show that the Nehari
manifold method requires no homogeinity on the principal part of a functional.
This result is motivated by some elliptic problems involving nonhomogeneous
operators. As an application, we prove the existence of a ground state and
infinitely many solutions for three classes of boundary value problems.
