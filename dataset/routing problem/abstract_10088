Fuzzy co-clustering can be improved if we handle two main problem first is
outlier and second curse of dimensionality .outlier problem can be reduce by
implementing page replacement algorithm like FIFO, LRU or priority algorithm in
a set of frame of web pages efficiently through a search engine. The web page
which has zero priority (outlier) can be represented in separate slot of frame.
Whereas curse of dimensionality problem can be improved by implementing FCC_STF
algorithm for web pages obtain by search engine that reduce the outlier problem
first. The algorithm FCCM and FUZZY CO-DOK are compared with FCC_STF algorithm
with merit and demerits on the bases of different fuzzifier used. FCC_STF
algorithm in which fuzzifier fused into one entity who have shown high
performance by experiment result of values (A1,B1,Vcj,A2,B2) seem to less
sensitive to local maxima and obtain optimization search space in 2-D for web
pages by plotting graph between J(fcc_stf) and Vcj.
