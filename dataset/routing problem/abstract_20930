Polymetric walls are walls built from bricks in more than one size.
Architects and builders want to built polymetric walls that satisfy certain
structural and aesthetical constraints. In a recent paper by de Jong, Vinduska,
Hans and Post these problems are solved by integer programming techniques,
which can be very time consuming for patterns consisting of more than 40
bricks. Here we give an extremely fast method, generating patterns of arbitrary
size.
