This article is concerned with the infinite depth water wave equation in two
space dimensions. We consider this problem expressed in position-velocity
potential holomorphic coordinates. Viewing this problem as a quasilinear
dispersive equation, we establish two results: (i) local well-posedness in
Sobolev spaces, and (ii) almost global solutions for small localized data.
Neither of these results are new; they have been recently obtained by
Alazard-Burq-Zuily \cite{abz}, respectively by Wu \cite{wu} using different
coordinates and methods. Instead our goal is improve the understanding of this
problem by providing a single setting for both problems, by proving sharper
versions of the above results, as well as presenting new, simpler proofs. This
article is self contained.
