In aiming to explain the establishment, maintenance and stability of
methylation pattern in gene body of Arabidopsis we propose here a theoretical
framework for understanding how the methylated and unmethylated states of
cytosine residues are maintained and transmitted during DNA replication. Routed
in statistical mechanics, the framework built herein is used to explore minimal
models of epigenetic inheritance and identify the necessary conditions for
stability of methylated/unmethylated states of cytosine over rounds of DNA
replication. The models are flexible enough to allow adding new biological
concepts and information.
