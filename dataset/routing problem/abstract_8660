We analyze the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of an
elliptic operator with mixed boundary conditions on cylindrical domains when
the length of the cylinder goes to infinity. We identify the correct limiting
problem and show in particular, that in general the limiting behavior is very
different from the one for the Dirichlet boundary conditions.
