This article provides a computational evaluation of the popular high
resolution upwind WACEB, CUBISTA and ADBQUICKEST schemes for solving non-linear
fluid dynamics problems. By using the finite difference methodology, the
schemes are analyzed and implemented in the context of normalized variables of
Leonard. In order to access the performance of the schemes, Riemann problems
for 1D Burgers, Euler and shallow water equations are considered. From the
numerical results, the schemes are ranked according to their performance in
solving these non-linear equations. The best scheme is then applied in the
numerical simulation of tridimensional incompressible moving free surface
flows.
