Estimating the number of sources impinging on an array of sensors is a well
known and well investigated problem. A common approach for solving this problem
is to use an information theoretic criterion, such as Minimum Description
Length (MDL) or the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The MDL estimator is
known to be a consistent estimator, robust against deviations from the Gaussian
assumption, and non-robust against deviations from the point source and/or
temporally or spatially white additive noise assumptions. Over the years
several alternative estimation algorithms have been proposed and tested.
Usually, these algorithms are shown, using computer simulations, to have
improved performance over the MDL estimator, and to be robust against
deviations from the assumed spatial model. Nevertheless, these robust
algorithms have high computational complexity, requiring several
multi-dimensional searches.
  In this paper, motivated by real life problems, a systematic approach toward
the problem of robust estimation of the number of sources using information
theoretic criteria is taken. An MDL type estimator that is robust against
deviation from assumption of equal noise level across the array is studied. The
consistency of this estimator, even when deviations from the equal noise level
assumption occur, is proven. A novel low-complexity implementation method
avoiding the need for multi-dimensional searches is presented as well, making
this estimator a favorable choice for practical applications.
