We consider the inverse problem of determining the Lam\'{e} parameters and
the density of a three-dimensional elastic body from the local time-harmonic
Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. We prove uniqueness and Lipschitz stability of this
inverse problem when the Lam\'{e} parameters and the density are assumed to be
piecewise constant on a given domain partition.
