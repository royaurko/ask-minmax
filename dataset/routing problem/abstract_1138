Novel applications in nanotechnology rely on the design of tailored
nano-architectures. For this purpose, carbon nanotubes and nanoparticles are
intensively investigated. In this work we study the influence of
non-functionalized carbon nanotubes on the synthesis of CdSe nanoparticles by
means of organometallic colloidal routes. This new synthesis methodology does
not only provide an effective path to attach nanoparticles non-covalently to
carbon nanotubes but represents also a new way to control the shape of
nanoparticles.
