We describe conditions under which an appropriately-defined anisotropic
Voronoi diagram of a set of sites in Euclidean space is guaranteed to be
composed of connected cells in any number of dimensions. These conditions are
natural for problems in optimization and approximation, and algorithms already
exist to produce sets of sites that satisfy them.
