Abstraction is one of the most important strategies for dealing with the
state space explosion problem in model checking. In the abstract model, the
state space is largely reduced, however, a counterexample found in such a model
may not be a real counterexample in the concrete model. Accordingly, the
abstract model needs to be further refined. How to check whether or not a
reported counterexample is spurious is a key problem in the
abstraction-refinement loop. In this paper, a formal definition for spurious
path is given. Based on it, efficient algorithms for detecting spurious
counterexamples are proposed.
