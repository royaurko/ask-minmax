Many problems in bioinformatics are about finding strings that approximately
represent a collection of given strings. We look at more general problems where
some input strings can be classified as outliers. The Close to Most Strings
problem is, given a set S of same-length strings, and a parameter d, find a
string x that maximizes the number of "non-outliers" within Hamming distance d
of x. We prove this problem has no PTAS unless ZPP=NP, correcting a decade-old
mistake. The Most Strings with Few Bad Columns problem is to find a
maximum-size subset of input strings so that the number of non-identical
positions is at most k; we show it has no PTAS unless P=NP. We also observe
Closest to k Strings has no EPTAS unless W[1]=FPT. In sum, outliers help model
problems associated with using biological data, but we show the problem of
finding an approximate solution is computationally difficult.
