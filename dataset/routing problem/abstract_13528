We discuss problems for convex Bayesian decision making and uncertainty
representation. These include the inability to accommodate various natural and
useful constraints and the possibility of an analog of the classical Dutch Book
being made against an agent behaving in accordance with convex Bayesian
prescriptions. A more general set-based Bayesianism may be as tractable and
would avoid the difficulties we raise.
