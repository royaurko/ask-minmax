In this paper, we study a second order variational problem for locally convex
hypersurfaces, which is the affine invariant analogue of the classical Plateau
problem for minimal surfaces. We prove existence, regularity and uniqueness
results for hypersurfaces maximizing affine area under appropriate boundary
conditions.
