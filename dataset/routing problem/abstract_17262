In a recent paper, Hou and Shi introduced a new adaptive data analysis method
to analyze nonlinear and non-stationary data. The main idea is to look for the
sparsest representation of multiscale data within the largest possible
dictionary consisting of intrinsic mode functions of the form $\{a(t)
\cos(\theta(t))\}$, where $a \in V(\theta)$, $V(\theta)$ consists of the
functions smoother than $\cos(\theta(t))$ and $\theta'\ge 0$. This problem was
formulated as a nonlinear $L^0$ optimization problem and an iterative nonlinear
matching pursuit method was proposed to solve this nonlinear optimization
problem. In this paper, we prove the convergence of this nonlinear matching
pursuit method under some sparsity assumption on the signal. We consider both
well-resolved and sparse sampled signals. In the case without noise, we prove
that our method gives exact recovery of the original signal.
