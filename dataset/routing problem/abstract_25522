The $E_6$SSM extension of the MSSM allows for the solution of many of the
difficulties that are usually encountered within conventional SUSY breaking
scenarios, e.g., the $\mu$ problem, the imposition of R-parity 'by hand', the
generation of light neutrino masses and obtaining a light Higgs boson with a
mass as large as $\sim$ 125 GeV as suggested by recent LHC measurements. In
addressing these problems, such a scenario predicts the existence of additional
singlet and vector-like superfields beyond those in the MSSM as well as
possibly two new neutral gauge bosons near the TeV scale. In this paper the
phenomenological implications of simultaneous gauge kinetic mixing between the
usual Standard Model (SM) hypercharge gauge field and both these new neutral
gauge fields present in the $E_6$SSM scenario is explored. To this end a large
class of specific toy models realizing this type of kinetic mixing is examined.
In particular, we demonstrate that a significant suppression (or enhancement)
of the expected event rate for $Z'$ production in the dilepton channel at the
LHC is not likely to occur in this scenario due to gauge kinetic mixing.
