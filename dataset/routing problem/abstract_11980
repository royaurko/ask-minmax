For any bounded measurable function $f$ on the unit ball $B_n$, let $T_f$ be
the Toeplitz operator with symbol $f$ acting on the Bergman space $A^2(B_n)$.
The Zero-Product Problem asks: if $f_1,..., f_N$ are bounded measurable
functions such that $T_{f_1}... T_{f_N}=0$, does it follow that one of the
functions must be zero almost everywhere? This paper give the affirmative
answer to this question when all except possibly one of the symbols are radial
functions. The answer in the general case remains unknown.
