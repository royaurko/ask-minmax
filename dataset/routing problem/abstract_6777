We consider the problem of constructing an appropriate multivariate model for
the study of the counterparty credit risk in credit rating migration problem.
For this financial problem different multivariate Markov chain models were
proposed. However the markovian assumption may be inappropriate for the study
of the dynamic of credit ratings which typically show non markovian like
behaviour. In this paper we develop a semi-Markov approach to the study of the
counterparty credit risk by defining a new multivariate semi-Markov chain
model. Methods are given for computing the transition probabilities,
reliability functions and the price of a risky Credit Default Swap.
