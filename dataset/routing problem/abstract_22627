Recently, Bell has reanalysed the problem of wave excitation by cosmic rays
propagating in the pre-cursor region of a supernova remnant shock front. He
pointed out a strong, non-resonant, current-driven instability that had been
overlooked in the kinetic treatments, and suggested that it is responsible for
substantial amplification of the ambient magnetic field. Magnetic field
amplification is also an important issue in the problem of the formation and
structure of relativistic shock fronts, particularly in relation to models of
gamma-ray bursts. We have therefore generalised the linear analysis to apply to
this case, assuming a relativistic background plasma and a monoenergetic,
unidirectional incoming proton beam. We find essentially the same non-resonant
instability noticed by Bell, and show that also under GRB conditions, it grows
much faster than the resonant waves. We quantify the extent to which thermal
effects in the background plasma limit the maximum growth rate.
