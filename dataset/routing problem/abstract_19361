We present two methods to analyse the global effects of a small perturbation
in a non-integrable Hamiltonian system, choosing as a paradigmatic example the
restricted planar three body problem and focusing on its Poincar\'e map for the
Jacobi invariant. The cumulative effects on the orbit of random or round-off
errors leads to a divergence of the perturbed orbit from the exact one. Rather
than computing the distance of the perturbed orbit from the reference one after
a given number n of time steps, we measure the distance of the reversed orbit
(n time steps forwards and backwards) from the initial point. This approach
does not require the knowledge of the unperturbed map. The asymptotic
equivalence of the Reversibility Error Method (REM) with the forward error is
proved for noisy linear maps, and it is shown to characterize the phase space
stability of the perturbed map just as the Lyapunov Characteristic Exponent.
The loss of memory of the perturbed map is quantified by the Fidelity and its
decay rate. It is found that Fidelity behaves in a different way for randomly
perturbed regular and chaotic orbits. This property, already known for
one-dimensional maps, is confirmed for the considered planar three body problem
suggesting a possible validity for integrable and hyperbolic systems.
