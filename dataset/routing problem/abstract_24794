The problem of finding a covariant expression for the distribution and
conservation of gravitational energy-momentum dates to the 1910s. A suitably
covariant infinite-component localization is displayed, reflecting Bergmann's
realization that there are infinitely many conserved gravitational
energy-momenta. Initially use is made of a flat background metric or connection
(or rather, all of them), because the desired gauge invariance properties are
obvious. Partial gauge-fixing then yields an appropriate covariant quantity
without any background metric or connection; one version is the collection of
pseudotensors of a given type, such as the Einstein pseudotensor, in_every_
coordinate system. This solution to the gauge covariance problem is easily
adapted to any pseudotensorial expression or to any tensorial expression built
with a background metric or connection. Thus the specific functional form can
be chosen on technical grounds such as relating to Noether's theorem and
yielding expected values of conserved quantities in certain contexts and then
rendered covariant using the procedure described here. The application to
angular momentum localization is straightforward. Traditional objections to
pseudotensors are based largely on the false assumption that there is only one
gravitational energy rather than infinitely many.
