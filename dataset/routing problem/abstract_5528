The paper focuses on two problems: (i) how to orient the edges of an
undirected graph in order to maximize the number of ordered vertex pairs (x,y)
such that there is a directed path from x to y, and (ii) how to orient the
edges so as to minimize the number of such pairs. The paper describes a
quadratic-time algorithm for the first problem, and a proof that the second
problem is NP-hard to approximate within some constant 1+epsilon > 1. The
latter proof also shows that the second problem is equivalent to
``comparability graph completion''; neither problem was previously known to be
NP-hard.
