This paper presents approaches to develop efficient network for non-binary
quasi-cyclic LDPC (QC-LDPC) decoders. By exploiting the intrinsic shifting and
symmetry properties of the check matrices, significant reduction of memory size
and routing complexity can be achieved. Two different efficient network
architectures for Class-I and Class-II non-binary QC-LDPC decoders have been
proposed, respectively. Comparison results have shown that for the code of the
64-ary (1260, 630) rate-0.5 Class-I code, the proposed scheme can save more
than 70.6% hardware required by shuffle network than the state-of-the-art
designs. The proposed decoder example for the 32-ary (992, 496) rate-0.5
Class-II code can achieve a 93.8% shuffle network reduction compared with the
conventional ones. Meanwhile, based on the similarity of Class-I and Class-II
codes, similar shuffle network is further developed to incorporate both classes
of codes at a very low cost.
