We analyze the convergence of an iterative method for solving the nonlinear
system resulting from a natural discretization of the Monge-Amp\`ere equation
with $C^1$ conforming approximations. We make the assumption, supported by
numerical experiments for the two dimensional problem, that the discrete
problem has a convex solution. The method we analyze is the discrete version of
Newton's method in the vanishing moment methodology. Numerical experiments are
given in the framework of the spline element method.
