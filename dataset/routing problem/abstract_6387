General properties of new models of the electronic Fock spaces based on the
notion of (p,q)-sheaves are studied. Interrelation between simple sheaves and
density operators is established. Explicit expressions for the transformed
reduced Hamiltonians in terms of the standard creation-annihilation operators
are presented. General scheme of parametrization of p-electron states by
k-electron means (k=2,3,...) is described and studied in detail for the case of
sheaves induced by k-electron wavefunctions. It is demonstrated that under
certain conditions p-electron problem may be reformulated as the eigenvalue
problem in k-electron space equipped with certain p-electron metric. Simple
numerical examples are given to illustrate our approach.
