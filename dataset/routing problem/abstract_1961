We determine, by means of density functional theory, the stability and the
structure of graphene nanoribbon (GNR) edges in presence of molecules such as
oxygen, water, ammonia, and carbon dioxide. As in the case of
hydrogen-terminated nanoribbons, we find that the most stable armchair and
zigzag configurations are characterized by a non-metallic/non-magnetic nature,
and are compatible with Clar's sextet rules, well known in organic chemistry.
In particular, we predict that, at thermodynamic equilibrium, neutral GNRs in
oxygen-rich atmosphere should preferentially be along the armchair direction,
while water-saturated GNRs should present zigzag edges. Our results promise to
be particularly useful to GNRs synthesis, since the most recent and advanced
experimental routes are most effective in water and/or ammonia-containing
solutions.
