We consider one-dimensional parabolic free boundary value problem with a
nonlocal (integro-differential) condition on the free boundary. Results on
$C^m$-regularity of the free boundary are obtained. In particular, a necessary
and sufficient condition for infinite differentiability of the free boundary is
given.
