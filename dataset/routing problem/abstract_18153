Recent progress in wireless receiver design has been towards iterative
processing, where channel estimation and decoding is considered a joint
optimization problem. Sparse channel estimation is another recent advancement,
which exploits the inherent structure of those wireless channels that are
composed of a small number of multipath components. In this work we design
iterative receivers which incorporate sparse channel estimation.
State-of-the-art sparse channel estimators simplify the estimation problem to
be a finite basis selection problem by restricting the multipath delays to the
discrete domain (i.e. to a grid). Our main contribution is a receiver without
such a restriction; the delays are estimated directly as continuous values. As
a result, our receiver does not suffer from the leakage effect which destroys
sparsity when the delays are restricted to the discrete domain. We discuss
certain connections between continuous and discrete domain sparse estimation
methods. Our receivers outperform state-of-the-art sparse channel estimation
iterative receivers in terms of bit error rate.
