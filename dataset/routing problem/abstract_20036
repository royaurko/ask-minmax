Using the U(4) formalism developed ten years ago, the worldsheet action for
the superstring in Ramond-Ramond plane wave backgrounds is expressed in a
manifestly N=(2,2) superconformally invariant manner. This simplifies the
construction of consistent Ramond-Ramond plane wave backgrounds and eliminates
the problems associated with light-cone interaction point operators.
