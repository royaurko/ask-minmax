We study the magnetic field response of the Majorana Kramers pairs of a
one-dimensional time-reversal invariant (TRI) superconductors (class DIII) with
or without a coexisting chirality symmetry. For unbroken TR and chirality
invariance the parameter regimes for nontrivial values of the (Z_2)
DIII-invariant and the (Z) chiral invariant coincide. However, broken TR may or
may not be accompanied by broken chirality, and if chiral symmetry is unbroken,
the pair of Majorana fermions (MFs) at a given end survives the loss of TR
symmetry in an entire plane perpendicular to the spin-orbit coupling field.
Conversely, we show that broken chirality may or may not be accompanied by
broken TR, and if TR is unbroken, the pair of MFs survives the loss of broken
chirality. In addition to explaining the anomalous magnetic field response of
all the DIII class TS systems proposed in the literature, we provide a
realistic route to engineer a "true" TR-invariant TS, whose pair of MFs at each
end is split by an applied Zeeman field in arbitrary direction. We also prove
that, quite generally, the splitting of the MFs by TR-breaking fields in TRI
superconductors is highly anisotropic in spin space, even in the absence of the
topological chiral symmetry.
