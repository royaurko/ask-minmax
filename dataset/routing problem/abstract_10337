We consider parameter identification problems in parametrized partial
differential equations (PDE). This leads to nonlinear ill-posed inverse
problems. One way to solve them are iterative regularization methods, which
typically require numerous amounts of forward solutions during the solution
process. In this article we consider the nonlinear Landweber method and want to
couple it with the reduced basis method as a model order reduction technique in
order to reduce the overall computational time. In particular, we consider PDEs
with a high-dimensional parameter space, which are known to pose difficulties
in the context of reduced basis methods. First, we show the applicability and
the limitations of a direct approach, where we replace the forward solution in
the nonlinear Landweber method with a reduced basis approximation. Then, the
main contribution is a new method that is able to handle high-dimensional
parameter spaces by combining the nonlinear Landweber method with adaptive
online reduced basis updates. The various approaches presented are applied to
the inverse problem of reconstructing the conductivity in the stationary heat
equation.
