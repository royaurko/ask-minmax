The problem of neutrino mass origin is considered on the phenomenological
level. The assumption is made that the neutrino mass values depend on two
dominant contributions with their characteristic scales. The neutrino mass
values as well as the values of the neutrino mass observables m_C, m_{\beta},
m_{2\beta} and the CP-phase {\delta} are estimated.
