This paper introduces a method to preform optical tomography, using 3D
radiative transfer as the forward model. We use an iterative approach
predicated on the Spherical Harmonics Discrete Ordinates Method (SHDOM) to
solve the optimization problem in a scalable manner. We illustrate with an
application in remote sensing of a cloudy atmosphere.
