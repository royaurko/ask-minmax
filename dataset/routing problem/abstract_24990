The Monty Hall problem is the TV game scenario where you, the contestant, are
presented with three doors, with a car hidden behind one and goats hidden
behind the other two. After you select a door, the host (Monty Hall) opens a
second door to reveal a goat. You are then invited to stay with your original
choice of door, or to switch to the remaining unopened door, and claim whatever
you find behind it. Assuming your objective is to win the car, is your best
strategy to stay or switch, or does it not matter? Jason Rosenhouse has
provided the definitive analysis of this game, along with several intriguing
variations, and discusses some of its psychological and philosophical
implications. This extended review examines several themes from the book in
some detail from a Bayesian perspective, and points out one apparently
inadvertent error.
