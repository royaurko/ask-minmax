The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model reduced to 2+1 dimensions has two different path
integral formulations: at finite chemical potential one formulation has a
severe sign problem similar to that found in QCD, while the other does not. At
large N, where N is the number of flavors, one can compute the probability
distributions of fermion correlators analytically in both formulations. In the
former case one finds a broad distribution with small mean; in the latter one
finds a heavy tailed positive distribution amenable to the cumulant expansion
techniques developed in earlier work. We speculate on the implications of this
model for QCD.
