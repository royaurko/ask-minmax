This paper addresses the issue of integrating agents with a variety of
external resources and services, as found in enterprise computing environments.
We propose an approach for interfacing agents and existing message routing and
mediation engines based on the endpoint concept from the enterprise integration
patterns of Hohpe and Woolf. A design for agent endpoints is presented, and an
architecture for connecting the Jason agent platform to the Apache Camel
enterprise integration framework using this type of endpoint is described. The
approach is illustrated by means of a business process use case, and a number
of Camel routes are presented. These demonstrate the benefits of interfacing
agents to external services via a specialised message routing tool that
supports enterprise integration patterns.
