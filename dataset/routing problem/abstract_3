We consider an online network routing problem in continuous time, where calls
have Poisson arrivals and exponential durations. The first-fit dynamic
alternative routing algorithm sequentially selects up to $d$ random two-link
routes between the two endpoints of a call, via an intermediate node, and
assigns the call to the first route with spare capacity on each link, if there
is such a route. The balanced dynamic alternative routing algorithm
simultaneously selects $d$ random two-link routes, and the call is accepted on
a route minimising the maximum of the loads on its two links, provided neither
of these two links is saturated. We determine the capacities needed for these
algorithms to route calls successfully and find that the balanced algorithm
requires a much smaller capacity. In order to handle such interacting random
processes on networks, we develop appropriate tools such as lemmas on biased
random walks.
