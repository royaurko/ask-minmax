In this paper we address the problem of constructing a class of
representations of Clifford algebras that can be named "alphabetic
(re)presentations". The Clifford algebras generators are expressed as m-letter
words written with a 3-character or a 4-character alphabet. We formulate the
problem of the alphabetic presentations, deriving the main properties and some
general results. At the end we briefly discuss the motivations of this work and
outline some possible applications.
