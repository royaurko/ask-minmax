We present a logic for the specification of static analysis problems that
goes beyond the logics traditionally used. Its most prominent feature is the
direct support for both inductive computations of behaviors as well as
co-inductive specifications of properties. Two main theoretical contributions
are a Moore Family result and a parametrized worst case time complexity result.
We show that the logic and the associated solver can be used for rapid
prototyping and illustrate a wide variety of applications within Static
Analysis, Constraint Satisfaction Problems and Model Checking. In all cases the
complexity result specializes to the worst case time complexity of the
classical methods.
