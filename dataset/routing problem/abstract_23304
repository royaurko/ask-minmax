We discuss the supersymmetric contribution to $\epsilon'/\epsilon$ in various
supersymmetric flavor models. We find that in alignment models the
supersymmetric contribution could be significant while in heavy squark models
it is expected to be small. The situation is particularly interesting in models
that solve the flavor problems by either of the above mechanisms and the
remaining CP problems by means of approximate CP, that is, all CP violating
phases are small. In such models, the standard model contributions cannot
account for $\epsilon'/\epsilon$ and a failure of the supersymmetric
contributions to do so would exclude the model. In models of alignment and
approximate CP, the supersymmetric contributions can account for
$\epsilon'/\epsilon$ only if both the supersymmetric model parameters and the
hadronic parameters assume rather extreme values. Such models are then strongly
disfavored by the $\epsilon'/\epsilon$ measurements. Models of heavy squarks
and approximate CP are excluded.
