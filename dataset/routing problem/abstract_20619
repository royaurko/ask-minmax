We prove uniqueness for the vortex-wave system with a single point vortex
introduced by Marchioro and Pulvirenti in the case where the vorticity is
initially constant near the point vortex. Our method relies on the Eulerian
approach for this problem and in particular on the formulation in terms of the
velocity.
