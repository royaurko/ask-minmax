The considered Robin problem can formally be seen as a small perturbation of
a Dirichlet problem. However, due to the sign of the impedance value, its
associated eigenvalues converge point-wise to $-\infty$ as the perturbation
goes to zero. We prove that in this case, Dirichlet eigenpairs are the only
accumulation points of the Robin eigenpairs with normalized eigenvectors. We
then provide a criteria to select accumulating sequences of eigenvalues and
eigenvectors and exhibit their full asymptotic with respect to the small
parameter.
