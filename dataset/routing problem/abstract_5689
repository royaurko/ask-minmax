We consider the offset-deconstruction problem: Given a polygonal shape Q with
n vertices, can it be expressed, up to a tolerance \eps in Hausdorff distance,
as the Minkowski sum of another polygonal shape P with a disk of fixed radius?
If it does, we also seek a preferably simple-looking solution P; then, P's
offset constitutes an accurate, vertex-reduced, and smoothened approximation of
Q. We give an O(n log n)-time exact decision algorithm that handles any
polygonal shape, assuming the real-RAM model of computation. A variant of the
algorithm, which we have implemented using CGAL, is based on rational
arithmetic and answers the same deconstruction problem up to an uncertainty
parameter \delta; its running time additionally depends on \delta. If the input
shape is found to be approximable, this algorithm also computes an approximate
solution for the problem. It also allows us to solve parameter-optimization
problems induced by the offset-deconstruction problem. For convex shapes, the
complexity of the exact decision algorithm drops to O(n), which is also the
time required to compute a solution P with at most one more vertex than a
vertex-minimal one.
