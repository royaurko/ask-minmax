We prove an epiperimetric inequality for the thin obstacle problem, extending
the pioneering results by Weiss on the classical obstacle problem (Invent.
Math. 138 (1999), no. 1, 23-50). This inequality provides the means to study
the rate of converge of the rescaled solutions to their limits, as well as the
regularity properties of the free boundary.
