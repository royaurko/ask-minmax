We propose an analytic approach to the frequency bandwidth dimensioning
problem, faced by cellular network operators who deploy/upgrade their networks
in various geographical regions (countries) with an inhomogeneous urbanization.
We present a model allowing one to capture fundamental relations between users'
quality of service parameters (mean downlink throughput), traffic demand, the
density of base station deployment, and the available frequency bandwidth.
These relations depend on the applied cellular technology (3G or 4G impacting
user peak bit-rate) and on the path-loss characteristics observed in different
(urban, sub-urban and rural) areas. We observe that if the distance between
base stations is kept inversely proportional to the distance coefficient of the
path-loss function, then the performance of the typical cells of these
different areas is similar when serving the same (per-cell) traffic demand. In
this case, the frequency bandwidth dimensioning problem can be solved uniformly
across the country applying the mean cell approach proposed in [Blaszczyszyn et
al. WiOpt2014] http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2014.6850355 . We validate our
approach by comparing the analytical results to measurements in operational
networks in various geographical zones of different countries.
