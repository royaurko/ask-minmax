One of the major problems in cosmology today is to explain the observed
acceleration of the universe. The present observational data are consistent
with the simplest solution to this problem, which is based on the vacuum
energy. A decaying vacuum energy is a very attractive solution. It could link
the value of the present vacuum energy, that is accelerating the universe
today, with the value that created the inflationary epoch in the past. We
investigate here models that suggest that the vacuum energy decays into cold
dark matter (CDM) and show that the density fluctuation spectrum obtained from
the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data together with large galaxy surveys
(e.g., the Sloan Digital Sky Survey), puts strong limits on the rate of decay
of the vacuum energy. CDM produced by a decaying vacuum energy would dilute the
density fluctuation spectrum, created in the primordial universe and observed
with large galaxy surveys at low redshifts. Our results indicate that the decay
rate of the vacuum energy into CDM is extremely small.
