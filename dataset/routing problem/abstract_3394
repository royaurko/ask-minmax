The Fuzzy Modeling has been applied in a wide variety of fields such as
Engineering and Management Sciences and Social Sciences to solve a number
Decision Making Problems which involve impreciseness, uncertainty and vagueness
in data. In particular, applications of this Modeling technique in Decision
Making Problems have remarkable significance. These problems have been tackled
using various theories such as Probability theory, Fuzzy Set Theory, Rough Set
Theory, Vague Set Theory, Approximate Reasoning Theory etc. which lack in
parameterization of the tools due to which they could not be applied
successfully to such problems. The concept of Soft Set has a promising
potential for giving an optimal solution for these problems. With the
motivation of this new concept, in this paper we define the concepts of Soft
Relation and Fuzzy Soft Relation and then apply them to solve a number of
Decision Making Problems. The advantages of Fuzzy Soft Relation compared to
other paradigms are discussed. To the best of our knowledge this is the first
work on the application of Fuzzy Soft Relation to the Decision Making Problems.
