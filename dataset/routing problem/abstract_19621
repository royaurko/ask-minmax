This article describes Monte-Carlo algorithms for charged systems using
constrained updates for the electric field. The method is generalized to treat
inhomogeneous dielectric media, electrolytes via the Poisson-Boltzmann equation
and considers the problem of charge and current interpolation for off lattice
models. We emphasize the differences between this algorithm and methods based
on the electrostatic potential, calculated from the Poisson equation.
