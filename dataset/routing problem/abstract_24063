We study a relativistic charged Dirac particle moving in a rotating magnetic
field. By using a time-dependent unitary transformation, the Dirac equation
with the time-dependent Hamiltonian can be reduced to a Dirac-like equation
with a time-independent effective Hamiltonian. Eigenstates of the effective
Hamiltonian correspond to cyclic solutions of the original Dirac equation. The
nonadiabatic geometric phase of a cyclic solution can be expressed in terms of
the expectation value of the component of the total angular momentum along the
rotating axis, regardless of whether the solution is explictly available. For a
slowly rotating magnetic field, the eigenvalue problem of the effective
Hamiltonian is solved approximately and the geometric phases are calculated.
The same problem for a charged or neutral Dirac particle with an anomalous
magnetic moment is discussed briefly.
