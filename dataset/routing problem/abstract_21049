We characterize the image of the Poisson transform on any distinguished
boundary of a Riemannian symmetric space of the noncompact type by a system of
differential equations. The system corresponds to a generator system of a two
sided ideals of an universal enveloping algebra, which are explicitly given by
analogues of minimal polynomials of matrices.
