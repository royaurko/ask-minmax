Hilbert-Arnold (HA) problem, motivated by Hilbert 16-th problem, is to prove
that for a generic k-parameter family of smooth vector fields {\dot
x=v(x,\eps)}_{\eps\in B^k} on the 2-dimensional sphere S^2 has uniformly
bounded number of limit cycles (isolated periodic solutions), denoted by
LC(\eps), over the parameter \eps, i.e. max_{\eps \in B^k} LC(\eps) <= K <
\infty for some K.
  The HA problem can be reduced to so-called Local Hilbert-Arnold (LHA)
problem. Suppose that a generic k-parameter family {\dot x=v(x,\eps)}_{\eps \in
B^k}, x\in S^2 for some parameter \eps^*\in B^k has a polycycle (separatrix
polygon) gamma consisting of equilibrium points as vertices and connecting
separatrices as sides. LHA problem is to estimate B(k)--- the maximal number of
limit cycles that can be born in a neighbourhood of gamma for a field \dot
x=v(x,\eps), where \eps is close to \eps^*.
