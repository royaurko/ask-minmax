For the first time it is shown that for thin metallic films thickness of
which not exceed thickness of skin-layer, the problem allows analytical
solution for arbitrary boundary value problems. The analysis of dependence of
coefficients of transmission, reflection and absorbtion on angle incidence,
thickness of films and coefficient of specular reflection is carried out.
