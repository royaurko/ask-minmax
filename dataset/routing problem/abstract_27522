We develop a sound, complete and practically implementable tableaux-based
decision method for constructive satisfiability testing and model synthesis in
the fragment ATL+ of the full Alternating time temporal logic ATL*. The method
extends in an essential way a previously developed tableaux-based decision
method for ATL and works in 2EXPTIME, which is the optimal worst case
complexity of the satisfiability problem for ATL+ . We also discuss how
suitable parametrizations and syntactic restrictions on the class of input ATL+
formulae can reduce the complexity of the satisfiability problem.
