The main purpose of this note is to pose a couple of problems which are
easily formulated thought some seem to be not yet solved. These problems are of
general interest for discrete mathematics including a new twig of a bough of
theory of graphs i.e. a given graph compositions. The problems result from and
are served in the entourage of series of exercises with hints based
predominantly on the second reference and other related recent papers.
