In the classic Dial-a-Ride Problem, a server travels in some metric space to
serve requests for rides. Each request has a source, destination, and release
time. We study a variation of this problem where each request also has a
revenue that is earned if the request is satisfied. The goal is to serve
requests within a time limit such that the total revenue is maximized. We first
prove that the version of this problem where edges in the input graph have
varying weights is NP-complete. We also prove that no algorithm can be
competitive for this problem. We therefore consider the version where edges in
the graph have unit weight and develop a 2-competitive algorithm for this
problem.
