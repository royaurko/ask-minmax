We generalize the recent results of Chaiken et al. to a rectangular $m\times
n$ chessboard. An explicit formula for the number of nonattacking
configurations of one-move riders on such a chessboard is calculated in two
different ways, one utilizing the theory of symmetric functions and the other
the theory of generating functions. With these newly found results, several
conjectures and open problems are resolved, and various formulas found by
Kotesovec are generalized.
