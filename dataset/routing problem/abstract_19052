Deep saline aquifers are promising geological reservoirs for CO2
sequestration if they do not leak. The absence of leakage is provided by the
caprock integrity. However, CO2 injection operations may change the
geomechanical stresses and cause fracturing of the caprock. We present a model
for the propagation of a fracture in the caprock driven by the outflow of fluid
from a low-permeability aquifer. We show that to describe the fracture
propagation, it is necessary to solve the pressure diffusion problem in the
aquifer. We solve the problem numerically for the two-dimensional domain and
show that, after a relatively short time, the solution is close to that of
one-dimensional problem, which can be solved analytically. We use the relations
derived in the hydraulic fracture literature to relate the the width of the
fracture to its length and the flux into it, which allows us to obtain an
analytical expression for the fracture length as a function of time. Using
these results we predict the propagation of a hypothetical fracture at the In
Salah CO2 injection site to be as fast as a typical hydraulic fracture. We also
show that the hydrostatic and geostatic effects cause the increase of the
driving force for the fracture propagation and, therefore, our solution serves
as an estimate from below. Numerical estimates show that if a fracture appears,
it is likely that it will become a pathway for CO2 leakage.
