We have recently calculated shot noise for entangled and spin-polarized
electrons in novel beam-splitter geometries with a local Rashba s-o interaction
in the incoming leads. This interaction allows for a gate-controlled rotation
of the incoming electron spins. Here we present an alternate simpler route to
the shot noise calculation in the above work and focus on only electron pairs.
Shot noise for these shows continuous bunching and antibunching behaviors. In
addition, entangled and unentangled triplets yield distinctive shot noise
oscillations. Besides allowing for a direct way to identify triplet and singlet
states, these oscillations can be used to extract s-o coupling constants
through noise measurements. Incoming leads with spin-orbit interband mixing
give rise an additional modulation of the current noise. This extra rotation
allows the design of a spin transistor with enhanced spin control.
