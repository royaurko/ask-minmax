The topological interference management problem refers to the study of the
capacity of partially connected linear (wired and wireless) communication
networks with no channel state information at the transmitters (no CSIT) beyond
the network topology, i.e., a knowledge of which channel coefficients are zero
(weaker than the noise floor in the wireless case). While the problem is
originally studied with fixed topology, in this work we explore the
implications of varying connectivity, through a series of simple and
conceptually representative examples. Specifically, we highlight the
synergistic benefits of coding across alternating topologies.
