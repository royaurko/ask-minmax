The sign of the refractive index of any medium is soley determined by the
requirement that the propagation of an electromagnetic wave obeys Einstein
causality. Our analysis shows that this requirement predicts that the real part
of the refractive index may be negative in an isotropic medium even if the
electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability are both positive. Such a
system may be a route to negative index media at optical frequencies. We also
demonstrate that the refractive index may be positive in left-handed media that
contain two molecular species where one is in its excited state.
