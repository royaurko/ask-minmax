It is developed the theory of the Dirichlet problem for harmonic functions.
On this basis, for the nondegenerate Beltrami equations in the quasidisks and,
in particular, in the smooth domains, it is proved the existence of regular
solutions of the Riemann-Hilbert problem with coefficients of bounded variation
and boundary data that are measurable with respect to the absolute harmonic
measure (logarithmic capacity). Moreover, it is shown that the dimension of the
spaces of the given solutions is infinite.
