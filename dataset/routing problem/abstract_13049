We review the main "omnibus procedures" for goodness-of-fit testing for
copulas: tests based on the empirical copula process, on probability integral
transformations, on Kendall's dependence function, etc, and some corresponding
reductions of dimension techniques. The problems of finding asymptotic
distribution-free test statistics and the calculation of reliable p-values are
discussed. Some particular cases, like convenient tests for time-dependent
copulas, for Archimedean or extreme-value copulas, etc, are dealt with.
Finally, the practical performances of the proposed approaches are briefly
summarized.
