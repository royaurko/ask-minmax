In this thesis, we study the details of some fundamental cosmological
problems of the gauge mediated supersymmetry breakdown and we probe the
supersymmetry breaking sector by cosmological arguments. We manifest that
problems like the metastable vacuum selection and the gravitino overproduction
in the reheated early universe are naturally absent in the most general class
of gauge mediation models without including additional ingredients or
assumptions. We also find that the gravitino can generically account for the
bulk dark matter of the universe. Cosmological implications of a stringy
UV-completion of the supersymmetry breaking sector have been also considered.
