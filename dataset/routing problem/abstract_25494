We apply the holonomic gradient method introduced by Nakayama et al.(2011) to
the evaluation of the exact distribution function of the largest root of a
Wishart matrix, which involves a hypergeometric function 1F1 of a matrix
argument. Numerical evaluation of the hypergeometric function has been one of
the longstanding problems in multivariate distribution theory. The holonomic
gradient method offers a totally new approach, which is complementary to the
infinite series expansion around the origin in terms of zonal polynomials. It
allows us to move away from the origin by the use of partial differential
equations satisfied by the hypergeometric function. From numerical viewpoint we
show that the method works well up to dimension 10. From theoretical viewpoint
the method offers many challenging problems both to statistics and D-module
theory.
