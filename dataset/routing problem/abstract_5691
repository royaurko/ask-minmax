We consider the problem of covering hypersphere by a set of spherical
hypercaps. This sort of problem has numerous practical applications such as
error correcting codes and reverse k-nearest neighbor problem. Using the
reduction of non degenerated concave quadratic programming (QP) problem, we
demonstrate that spherical coverage verification is NP hard. We propose a
recursive algorithm based on reducing the problem to several lower dimension
subproblems. We test the performance of the proposed algorithm on a number of
generated constellations. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm, in spite
of its exponential worst-case complexity, is applicable in practice. In
contrast, our results indicate that spherical coverage verification using QP
solvers that utilize heuristics, due to numerical instability, may produce
false positives.
