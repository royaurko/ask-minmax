For popular websites most important concern is to handle incoming load
dynamically among web servers, so that they can respond to their client without
any wait or failure. Different websites use different strategies to distribute
load among web servers but most of the schemes concentrate on only one factor
that is number of requests, but none of the schemes consider the point that
different type of requests will require different level of processing efforts
to answer, status record of all the web servers that are associated with one
domain name and mechanism to handle a situation when one of the servers is not
working. Therefore, there is a fundamental need to develop strategy for dynamic
load allocation on web side. In this paper, an effort has been made to
introduce a cluster based frame work to solve load distribution problem. This
framework aims to distribute load among clusters on the basis of their
operational capabilities. Moreover, the experimental results are shown with the
help of example, algorithm and analysis of the algorithm.
