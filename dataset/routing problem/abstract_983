The Proportional Scheduler was recently proposed as a scheduling algorithm
for multi-hop switch networks. For these networks, the BackPressure scheduler
is the classical benchmark. For networks with fixed routing, the Proportional
Scheduler is maximum stable, myopic and, furthermore, will alleviate certain
scaling issued found in BackPressure for large networks. Nonetheless, the
equilibrium and delay properties of the Proportional Scheduler has not been
fully characterized.
  In this article, we postulate on the equilibrium behaviour of the
Proportional Scheduler though the analysis of an analogous rule called the
Store-Forward allocation. It has been shown that Store-Forward has
asymptotically allocates according to the Proportional Scheduler. Further, for
Store-Forward networks, numerous equilibrium quantities are explicitly
calculable. For FIFO networks under Store-Forward, we calculate the policies
stationary distribution and end-to-end route delay. We discuss network
topologies when the stationary distribution is product-form, a phenomenon which
we call \emph{product form resource pooling}. We extend this product form
notion to independent set scheduling on perfect graphs, where we show that
non-neighbouring queues are statistically independent. Finally, we analyse the
large deviations behaviour of the equilibrium distribution of Store-Forward
networks in order to construct Lyapunov functions for FIFO switch networks.
