The problem of P vs. NP is very serious, and solutions to the problem can
help save lives. This article is an attempt at solving the problem using a
computer algorithm. It is presented in a fashion that will hopefully allow for
easy understanding for many people and scientists from many diverse fields.
  In technical terms, a novel method for solving k-SAT is explained. This
method is primarily based on linear algebra and finite fields. Evidence is
given that this method may require rougly O(n^3) time and space for
deterministic models. More specifically the algorithm runs in time O(P
V(n+V)^2) with mistaking satisfiable Boolean expressions as unsatisfiable with
an approximate probablity 1 / \Theta(V(n+V)^2)^P, where n is the number of
clauses and V is the number of variables. It's concluded that significant
evidence exists that P=NP.
  There is a forum devoted to this paper at http://482527.ForumRomanum.com. All
are invited to correspond here and help with the analysis of the algorithm.
