Given a graph with edge costs, the {\em power} of a node is themaximum cost
of an edge incident to it, and the power of a graph is the sum of the powers of
its nodes. Motivated by applications in wireless networks, we consider the
following fundamental problem in wireless network design. Given a graph
$G=(V,E)$ with edge costs and degree bounds $\{r(v):v \in V\}$, the {\sf
Minimum-Power Edge-Multi-Cover} ({\sf MPEMC}) problem is to find a
minimum-power subgraph $J$ of $G$ such that the degree of every node $v$ in $J$
is at least $r(v)$. We give two approximation algorithms for {\sf MPEMC}, with
ratios $O(\log k)$ and $k+1/2$, where $k=\max_{v \in V} r(v)$ is the maximum
degree bound. This improves the previous ratios $O(\log n)$ and $k+1$, and
implies ratios $O(\log k)$ for the {\sf Minimum-Power $k$-Outconnected
Subgraph} and $O(\log k \log \frac{n}{n-k})$ for the {\sf Minimum-Power
$k$-Connected Subgraph} problems; the latter is the currently best known ratio
for the min-cost version of the problem.
