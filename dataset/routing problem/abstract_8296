The global existence of strong solution to the initial-boundary value problem
of the three-dimensional compressible viscoelastic fluids near equilibrium is
established in a bounded domain. Uniform estimates in $W^{1,q}$ with $q>3$ on
the density and deformation gradient are also obtained. All the results apply
to the two-dimensional case.
