The relativistic corrections to the Maxwellian velocity distribution are
needed for standard solar models. Relativistic equilibrium velocity
distribution, if adopted in standard solar models, will lower solar neutrino
fluxes and change solar neutrino energy spectra but keep solar sound speeds. It
is possibly a solution to the solar neutrino problem.
