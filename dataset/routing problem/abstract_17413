The subgraph homeomorphism problem, SHP($H$), has been shown to be
polynomial-time solvable for any fixed pattern graph $H$, but practical
algorithms have been developed only for a few specific pattern graphs. Among
these are the wheels with four, five, and six spokes. This paper examines the
subgraph homeomorphism problem where the pattern graph is a wheel with seven
spokes, and gives a result that describes graphs with no $W_{7}$-subdivision,
showing how they can be built up, using certain operations, from smaller
`pieces' that meet certain conditions. We also discuss algorithmic aspects of
the problem.
