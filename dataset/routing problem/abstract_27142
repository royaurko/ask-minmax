I give a general review of inflationary cosmology and of its present status,
in view of the 2013 data release by the Planck satellite. A specific emphasis
is given to the new broad class of theories, the cosmological attractors, which
have nearly model-independent predictions converging at the sweet spot of the
Planck data in the (n_s,r) plane. I also discuss the problem of initial
conditions for the theories favored by the Planck data.
