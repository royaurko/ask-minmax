The problem of enumeration of conjugacy classes of finite abelian subgroups
of the mapping class group $\mathcal{M}_{\sigma}$ of a compact closed surface
$X$ of genus $\sigma$ is considered. A complete method of enumeration is
achieved for finite elementary abelian subgroups and steps are taken toward
enumeration of finite abelian subgroups.
