It has been shown by several contributors that a certain class of composite
operators with many fields and gradients endangers the stability of nontrivial
fixed points in 2+eps expansions for various models. This problem is so far
unresolved. We investigate it in the N-vector model in an 1/N-expansion. By
establishing an asymptotic naive addition law for anomalous dimensions we
demonstrate that the first orders in the 2+eps expansion can lead to erroneous
interpretations for high--gradient operators. While this makes us cautious
against over--interpreting such expansions (either 2+eps or 1/N), the stability
problem in the N-vector model persists also in first order in 1/N below three
dimensions.
