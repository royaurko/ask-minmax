This paper introduces the CondorJ2 cluster management system. Traditionally,
cluster management systems such as Condor employ a process-oriented approach
with little or no use of modern database system technology. In contrast,
CondorJ2 employs a data-centric, 3-tier web-application architecture for all
system functions (e.g., job submission, monitoring and scheduling; node
configuration, monitoring and management, etc.) except for job execution.
Employing a data-oriented approach allows the core challenge (i.e., managing
and coordinating a large set of distributed computing resources) to be
transformed from a relatively low-level systems problem into a more abstract,
higher-level data management problem. Preliminary results suggest that
CondorJ2's use of standard 3-tier software represents a significant step
forward to the design and implementation of large clusters (1,000 to 10,000
nodes).
