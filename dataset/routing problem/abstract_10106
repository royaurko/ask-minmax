We consider the following problem for a fixed graph H: given a graph G and
two H-colorings of G, i.e. homomorphisms from G to H, can one be transformed
(reconfigured) into the other by changing one color at a time, maintaining an
H-coloring throughout. This is the same as finding a path in the Hom(G,H)
complex. For H=K_k this is the problem of finding paths between k-colorings,
which was shown to be in P for k<=3 and PSPACE-complete otherwise by Cereceda
et al. 2011. We generalize the positive side of this dichotomy by providing an
algorithm that solves the problem in polynomial time for any H with no C_4
subgraph. This gives a large class of constraints for which finding solutions
to the Constraint Satisfaction Problem is NP-complete, but finding paths in the
solution space is P.
  The algorithm uses a characterization of possible reconfiguration sequences
(paths in Hom(G,H)), whose main part is a purely topological condition
described in algebraic terms of the fundamental groupoid of H seen as a
topological space.
