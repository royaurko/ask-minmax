In Euclidean spaces, the geometric notions of nearest-points map,
farthest-points map, Chebyshev set, Klee set, and Chebyshev center are well
known and well understood. Since early works going back to the 1930s,
tremendous theoretical progress has been made, mostly by extending classical
results from Euclidean space to Banach space settings. In all these results,
the distance between points is induced by some underlying norm. Recently, these
notions have been revisited from a different viewpoint in which the discrepancy
between points is measured by Bregman distances induced by Legendre functions.
The associated framework covers the well known Kullback-Leibler divergence and
the Itakura-Saito distance. In this survey, we review known results and we
present new results on Klee sets and Chebyshev centers with respect to Bregman
distances. Examples are provided and connections to recent work on Chebyshev
functions are made. We also identify several intriguing open problems.
