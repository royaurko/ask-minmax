The attempt to discretize gravity in flat space is foiled by the appearance
of strongly interacting long wave-length longitudinal modes. In this paper we
show how the introduction of sites with different scales, or equivalently
curvature in the bulk, ameliorate all the problems encountered in flat space
associated with long wave-length modes. However, as one could expect, all such
problem resurface once the mode's wave-length is smaller than the bulk
curvature.
