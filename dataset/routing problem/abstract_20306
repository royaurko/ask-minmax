A current Lie algebra is contructed from a tensor product of a Lie algebra
and a commutative associative algebra of dimension greater than 2. In this work
we are interested in deformations of such algebras and in the problem of
rigidity. In particular we prove that a current Lie algebra is rigid if it is
isomorphic to a direct product gxg...xg where g is a rigid Lie algebra.
