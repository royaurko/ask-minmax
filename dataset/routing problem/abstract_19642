As the most fundamental empirical law, Zipf's law has been studied from many
aspects. But its meaning is still an open problem. Some models have been
constructed to explain Zipf's law. In the letter, a new concept named
nonsymmetric entropy was introduced, maximizing nonsymmetric entropy leads
naturally to Zipf's law.
