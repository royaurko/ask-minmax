The existence, multiplicity and nonexistence of nontrivial radial convex
solutions of a system of two weakly coupled Monge-Ampere equations are
established with asymptotic assumptions for an appropriately chosen parameter.
The proof of the results is based on Krasnoselskii's fixed point theorem in a
cone.
