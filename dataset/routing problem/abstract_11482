We describe a substring search problem that arises in group presentation
simplification processes. We suggest a two-level searching model: skip and
match levels. We give two timestamp algorithms which skip searching parts of
the text where there are no matches at all and prove their correctness. At the
match level, we consider Harrison signature, Karp-Rabin fingerprint, Bloom
filter and automata based matching algorithms and present experimental
performance figures.
