The relativistic viscous fluid equations describing the outflow of high
temperature matter created via Hawking radiation from microscopic black holes
are solved numerically for a realistic equation of state. We focus on black
holes with initial temperatures greater than 100 GeV and lifetimes less than 6
days. The spectra of direct photons and photons from $\pi^0$ decay are
calculated for energies greater than 1 GeV. We calculate the diffuse gamma ray
spectrum from black holes distributed in our galactic halo. However, the most
promising route for their observation is to search for point sources emitting
gamma rays of ever-increasing energy.
