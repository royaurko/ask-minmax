This paper proposes a new memetic evolutionary algorithm to achieve explicit
learning in rule-based nurse rostering, which involves applying a set of
heuristic rules for each nurse's assignment. The main framework of the
algorithm is an estimation of distribution algorithm, in which an ant-miner
methodology improves the individual solutions produced in each generation.
Unlike our previous work (where learning is implicit), the learning in the
memetic estimation of distribution algorithm is explicit, i.e. we are able to
identify building blocks directly. The overall approach learns by building a
probabilistic model, i.e. an estimation of the probability distribution of
individual nurse-rule pairs that are used to construct schedules. The local
search processor (i.e. the ant-miner) reinforces nurse-rule pairs that receive
higher rewards. A challenging real world nurse rostering problem is used as the
test problem. Computational results show that the proposed approach outperforms
most existing approaches. It is suggested that the learning methodologies
suggested in this paper may be applied to other scheduling problems where
schedules are built systematically according to specific rules
