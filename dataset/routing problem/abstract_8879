We prove that the (nonlocal) Marchaud fractional derivative in $\mathbb{R}$
can be obtained from a parabolic extension problem with an extra (positive)
variable, as the operator that maps the heat conduction equation to the Neumann
condition. Some properties of the fractional derivative are deduced from those
of the local operator. In particular we prove a Harnack principle for
Marchaud-stationary functions.
