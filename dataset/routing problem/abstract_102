Orienteering problems (OPs) are a variant of the well-known prize-collecting
traveling salesman problem, where the salesman needs to choose a subset of
cities to visit within a given deadline. OPs and their extensions with
stochastic travel times (SOPs) have been used to model vehicle routing problems
and tourist trip design problems. However, they suffer from two limitations
travel times between cities are assumed to be time independent and the route
provided is independent of the risk preference (with respect to violating the
deadline) of the user. To address these issues, we make the following
contributions: We introduce (1) a dynamic SOP (DSOP) model, which is an
extension of SOPs with dynamic (time-dependent) travel times; (2) a
risk-sensitive criterion to allow for different risk preferences; and (3) a
local search algorithm to solve DSOPs with this risk-sensitive criterion. We
evaluated our algorithms on a real-world dataset for a theme park navigation
problem as well as synthetic datasets employed in the literature.
