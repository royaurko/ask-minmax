In this work we investigate a boundary problem with non-local conditions for
mixed parabolic-hyperbolic type equation with three lines of type-changing with
Caputo fractional derivative in the parabolic part. We equivalently reduce
considered problem to the system of second kind Volterra integral equations. In
the parabolic part we use solution of the first boundary problem with
appropriate Green's function and in hyperbolic parts we use corresponding
solutions of the Cauchy problem.
