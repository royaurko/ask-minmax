We study a coupled elliptic-parabolic Poincar\'e-Steklov system arising in
electrical cell activity in biological tissues. By using the notion of
$j$-subgradient, we show that this system has a gradient structure and thus
obtain wellposedness. We further exploit the gradient structure for the
discretisation of the problem and provide numerical experiments.
