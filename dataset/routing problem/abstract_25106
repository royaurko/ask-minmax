We have recently introduced a new implementation of the Feynman gauge on the
lattice, based on a minimizing functional that extends in a natural way the
Landau-gauge case, while preserving all the properties of the continuum
formulation. The only remaining difficulty with our approach is that, using the
standard (compact) discretization, the gluon field is bounded, while its
four-divergence satisfies a Gaussian distribution, i.e. it is unbounded. This
can give rise to convergence problems when a numerical implementation is
attempted. In order to overcome this problem, one can use different
discretizations for the gluon field, or consider an SU(N_c) group with
sufficiently large N_c. Here we discuss these two possible solutions.
