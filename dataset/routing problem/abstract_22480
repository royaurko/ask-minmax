The surest solution of the Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) mystery is to find an
unambiguous low-energy quiescent counterpart. However, to date no reasonable
candidates have been identified in the x-ray, optical, infrared, or radio
ranges. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has now allowed for the first deep
ultraviolet searches for quiescent counterparts. This paper reports on
multiepoch ultraviolet searches of five GRB positions with HST. We found no
sources with significant ultraviolet excesses, variability, parallax, or proper
motion in any of the burst error regions. In particular, we see no sources
similar to that proposed as a counterpart to the GRB970228. While this negative
result is disappointing, it still has good utility for its strict limits on the
no-host-galaxy problem in cosmological models of GRBs. For most cosmological
models (with peak luminosity 6X10^50 erg/s), the absolute B magnitude of any
possible host galaxy must be fainter than -15.5 to -17.4. These smallest boxes
for some of the brightest bursts provide the most critical test, and our limits
are a severe problem for all published cosmological burst models.
