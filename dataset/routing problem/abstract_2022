Spiking Neural P systems, SNP systems for short, are biologically inspired
computing devices based on how neurons perform computations. SNP systems use
only one type of symbol, the spike, in the computations. Information is encoded
in the time differences of spikes or the multiplicity of spikes produced at
certain times. SNP systems with delays (associated with rules) and those
without delays are two of several Turing complete SNP system variants in
literature. In this work we investigate how restricted forms of SNP systems
with delays can be simulated by SNP systems without delays. We show the
simulations for the following spike routing constructs: sequential, iteration,
join, and split.
