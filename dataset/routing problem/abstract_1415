The infrared (IR) spectrum of solid C60 exhibits many weak vibrational modes.
Symmetry breaking due to 13C isotopes provides a possible route for optically
activating IR-silent vibrational modes. Experimental spectra and a
semi-empirical theory on natural abundance and 13C-enriched single crystals of
C60 are presented. By comparing the experimental results with the theoretical
results, we exclude this isotopic activation mechanism from the explanation for
weakly active fundamentals in the spectra.
