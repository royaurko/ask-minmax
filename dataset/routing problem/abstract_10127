Given an undirected node-weighted graph, the Maximum-Weight Connected
Subgraph problem (MWCS) is to identify a subset of nodes of maximalsum of
weights that induce a connected subgraph. MWCS is closely related to the
well-studied Prize Collecting Steiner Tree problem and has many applications in
different areas, including computational biology, network design and computer
vision. The problem is NP-hard and even hard to approximate within a constant
factor. In this work we describe an algorithmic scheme for solving MWCS to
provable optimality, which is based on preprocessing rules, new results on
decomposing an instance into its biconnected and triconnected components and a
branch-and-cut approach combined with a primal heuristic. We demonstrate the
performance of our method on the benchmark instances of the 11th DIMACS
implementation challenge consisting of MWCS as well as transformed PCST
instances.
