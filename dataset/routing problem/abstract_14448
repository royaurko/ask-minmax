This paper proposes a target zones exchange rate model with a terminal
condition of entering a currency zone. It is assumed that the exchange rate is
a function of the fundamental and time. Another essential assumptions of the
model is that the fundamental process is bounded inside a band and that
terminal condition for the exchange rate holds. The fundamental is specified in
two ways: as a regulated Brownian motion and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. For
the case of the Brownian motion process the closed form solution of the problem
is obtained, whereas for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process the closed form
solution does not exist, therefore we had to use numerical method for solving
of the problem. Both specifications are compared numerically.
