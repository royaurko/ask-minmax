We study an alloy system where short-ranged, thermally-driven diffusion
competes with externally imposed, finite-ranged, athermal atomic exchanges, as
is the case in alloys under irradiation. Using a Cahn-Hilliard-type approach,
we show that when the range of these exchanges exceeds a critical value,
labyrinthine concentration patterns at a mesoscopic scale can be stabilized.
Furthermore, these steady-state patterns appear only for a window of the
frequency of forced exchanges. Our results suggest that ion beams may provide a
novel route to stabilize and tune the size of nanoscale structural features in
materials.
