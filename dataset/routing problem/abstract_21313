Prime factorization is an outstanding problem in arithmetic, with important
consequences in a variety of fields, most notably cryptography. Here we employ
the intriguing analogy between prime factorization and optical interferometry
in order to obtain, for the first time, analytic expressions for closely
related functions, including the number of distinct prime factors.
