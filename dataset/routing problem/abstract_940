We study a routing game in which one of the players unilaterally acts
altruistically by taking into consideration the latency cost of other players
as well as his own. By not playing selfishly, a player can not only improve the
other players' equilibrium utility but also improve his own equilibrium
utility. To quantify the effect, we define a metric called the Value of
Unilateral Altruism (VoU) to be the ratio of the equilibrium utility of the
altruistic user to the equilibrium utility he would have received in Nash
equilibrium if he were selfish. We show by example that the VoU, in a game with
nonlinear latency functions and atomic players, can be arbitrarily large. Since
the Nash equilibrium social welfare of this example is arbitrarily far from
social optimum, this example also has a Price of Anarchy (PoA) that is
unbounded. The example is driven by there being a small number of players since
the same example with non-atomic players yields a Nash equilibrium that is
fully efficient.
