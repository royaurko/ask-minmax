The modular technology of creation of the problem-oriented extensions of a
CAD system is described, which was realised in a system TechnoCAD GlassX for
designing of reconstruction of the plants. The modularity of the technology is
expressed in storage of all parameters of the design in one element of the
drawing - modulus, with automatic generation of a geometrical part of the
modulus from these parameters. The common principles of the system organization
of extensions developing are described: separation of the part of the design to
automize in this extension, architecture of parameters in the form of the lists
of objects with their properties and links to another objects, separation of
common and special operations, stages of the developing, boundaries of
applicability of technology.
