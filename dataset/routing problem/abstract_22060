This paper is to prove superconvergence of a family of simple conforming
mixed finite elements of first orderfor the linear elasticity problem with the
Hellinger--Reissner variational formulation. The analysis is based on three
main ingredients: a new interpolation operator, a new expansion method, and a
new iterative argument for superconvergence analysis.
