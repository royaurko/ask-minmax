In this paper we prove a duality relation between coalescence times and exit
points in last-passage percolation models with exponential weights. As a
consequence, we get lower bounds for coalescence times with scaling exponent
3/2, and we relate its distribution with variational problems involving the
Brownian motion process and the Airy process.
