Boundary value problems on hedgehog-type graphs for Sturm-Liouville
differential operators with general matching conditions are studied. We
investigate inverse spectral problems of recovering the coefficients of the
differential equation from the spectral data. For this inverse problem we prove
a uniqueness theorem and provide a procedure for constructing its solution.
