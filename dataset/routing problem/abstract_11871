The aim of this paper is to present the technique (and its linkage with
physics) of overcoming problems connected to modeling social structures, which
are typically hierarchical. Hierarchical Linear Models provide a conceptual and
statistical mechanism for drawing conclusions regarding the influence of
phenomena at different levels of analysis. In the social sciences it is used to
analyze many problems such as educational, organizational or market dilemma.
This paper introduces the logic of modeling hierarchical linear equations and
estimation based on MPlus software. I present my own model to illustrate the
impact of different factors on school acceptation level.
