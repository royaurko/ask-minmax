It is known that a large neutrino number, of the order of a few percent of
the entropy of the universe, leads to symmetry breaking at high temperature. We
show here that in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) this implies
the breaking of electromagnetic charge invariance at T >> M_W allowing for the
solution of the monopole problem.
