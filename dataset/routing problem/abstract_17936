The data equation in subspace identification relates Hankel matrices
constructed from input and output data. The matrices in this equation, which
are derived from the system matrices of the unknown system, contain important
structural information. Such information is the low rank property of the
product between the extended observability matrix and the state sequence, and
the Toeplitz structure of the matrix of Markov parameters of the system in
innovation form. We will show that nuclear norm subspace identification makes
it possible to formulate these structural properties as constraints in a single
convex multi-criteria optimization problem. This problem seeks a trade-off
between a nuclear norm minimization problem to retrieve the subspace of
interest and a prediction error criterium to find an optimal match between the
measured and predicted output. The advantage of our method over existing
unconstrained and nuclear norm constrained subspace identification methods is
that the structural constraints are in general improving the estimates when
dealing with short data sets, i.e. where the number of measurements is a small
multiple of the system order. This advantage is demonstrated in a validation
study making use of data sets from the DaSIy library.
