In Gravity Unified Theories all operators that are consistent with the local
gauge and discrete symmetries are expected to arise in the effective
low-energy theory. Given the absence of multiplets like 126 of SO(10) in
string models, and assuming that B-L is violated spontaneously to generate
light neutrino masses via a seesaw mechanism, it is observed that string theory
solutions generically face the problem of producing an excessive $\nu_L-{\tilde
H}$ mixing mass at the GUT scale, which is some nineteen orders of magnitude
larger than the experimental bound of 1 MeV. The suppression of $\nu_L-{\tilde
H}$ mixing, like proton longevity, thus provides one of the most severe
constraints on the validity of any string theory solution. We examine this
problem in a class of superstring derived models. We find a family of solutions
within this class for which the symmetries of the models and an allowed pattern
of VEVs, surprisingly, succeed in adequately suppressing the neutrino-Higgsino
mixing terms. At the same time they produce the terms required to generate
small neutrino masses via a seesaw mechanism.
