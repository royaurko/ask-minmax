Vehicular networks have a diverse range of applications that vary from
safety, to traffic management and comfort. Vehicular communications (VC) can
assist in the ecorouting of vehicles in order to reduce the overall mileage and
CO2 emissions by the exchange of data among vehicle-entities. However, the
trustworthiness of these data is crucial as false information can heavily
affect the performance of applications. Hence, the devising of mechanisms that
reassure the integrity of the exchanged data is of utmost importance. In this
article we investigate how tweaked information originating from malicious nodes
can affect the performance of a real time eco routing mechanism that uses DSRC
communications, namely ErouVe. We also develop and evaluate defense mechanisms
that exploit vehicular communications in order to filter out tweaked data. We
prove that our proposed mechanisms can restore the performance of the ErouVe to
near its optimal operation and can be used as a basis for protecting other
similar traffic management systems.
