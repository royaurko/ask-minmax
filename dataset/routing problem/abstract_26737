The reliability and security of a user in an interconnected system depends on
all users' collective effort in security. Consequently, investments in security
technologies by strategic users is typically modeled as a public good problem,
known as the Interdependent Security (IDS) game. The equilibria for such games
are often inefficient, as selfish users free-ride on positive externalities of
others' contributions. In this paper, we present a mechanism that implements
the socially optimal equilibrium in an IDS game through a message exchange
process, in which users submit proposals about the security investment and
tax/price profiles of one another. This mechanism is different from existing
solutions in that (1) it results in socially optimal levels of investment,
closing the Price of Anarchy gap in the IDS game, (2) it is applicable to a
general model of user interdependencies. We further consider the issue of
individual rationality, often a trivial condition to satisfy in many resource
allocation problems, and argue that with positive externality, the incentive to
stay out and free-ride on others' investment can make individual rationality
much harder to satisfy in designing a mechanism.
