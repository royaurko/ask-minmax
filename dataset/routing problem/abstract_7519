We introduce a new technique for proving kernelization lower bounds, called
cross-composition. A classical problem L cross-composes into a parameterized
problem Q if an instance of Q with polynomially bounded parameter value can
express the logical OR of a sequence of instances of L. Building on work by
Bodlaender et al. (ICALP 2008) and using a result by Fortnow and Santhanam
(STOC 2008) we show that if an NP-complete problem cross-composes into a
parameterized problem Q then Q does not admit a polynomial kernel unless the
polynomial hierarchy collapses. Our technique generalizes and strengthens the
recent techniques of using OR-composition algorithms and of transferring the
lower bounds via polynomial parameter transformations. We show its
applicability by proving kernelization lower bounds for a number of important
graphs problems with structural (non-standard) parameterizations, e.g.,
Chromatic Number, Clique, and Weighted Feedback Vertex Set do not admit
polynomial kernels with respect to the vertex cover number of the input graphs
unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses, contrasting the fact that these
problems are trivially fixed-parameter tractable for this parameter. We have
similar lower bounds for Feedback Vertex Set.
