We study here the impulse control minimax problem. We allow the cost
functionals and dynamics to be unbounded and hence the value functions can
possibly be unbounded. We prove that the value function of the problem is
continuous. Moreover, the value function is characterized as the unique
viscosity solution of an Isaacs quasi-variational inequality. This problem is
in relation with an application in mathematical finance.
