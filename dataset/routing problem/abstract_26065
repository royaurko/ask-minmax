Motivated by the sign problem in several systems, we have developed a
geometric simulation algorithm based on the strong coupling expansion which can
be applied to abelian pure gauge models. We have studied the algorithm in the
U(1) model in 3 and 4 dimensions, and seen that it is practical and is
similarly efficient to the standard heat-bath algorithm, but without the
ergodicity problems which comes from the presence of vortices. We have also
applied the algorithm to the Ising gauge model at the critical point, and we
find hints of a better asymptotic behaviour of the autocorrelation time, which
therefore suggests the possibility of a smaller dynamical critical exponent
with respect to the standard heat-bath algorithm.
