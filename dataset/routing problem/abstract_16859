Physics has played a fundamental role in medicine sciences, specially in
imaging diagnostic. Currently, image reconstruction techniques are already
taught in Physics courses and there is a growing interest in new potential
applications. The aim of this paper is to introduce to students the electrical
impedance tomography, a promising technique in medical imaging. We consider a
numerical example which consists in finding the position and size of a
non-conductive region inside a conductive wire. We review the electric
impedance tomography inverse problem modeled by the minimization of an error
functional. To solve the boundary value problem that arises in the direct
problem, we use the boundary element method. The simulated annealing algorithm
is chosen as the optimization method. Numerical tests show the technique is
accurate to retrieve the non-conductive inclusion.
