The existence of symmetries in asymptotically flat space-times are studied
from the point of view of initial value problems. General necessary and
sufficient (implicit) conditions are given for the existence of Killing vector
fields in the asymptotic characteristic and in the hyperboloidal initial value
problem (both of them are formulated on the conformally compactified space-time
manifold).
