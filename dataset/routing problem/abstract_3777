Exploration of task mappings plays a crucial role in achieving high
performance in heterogeneous multi-processor system-on-chip (MPSoC) platforms.
The problem of optimally mapping a set of tasks onto a set of given
heterogeneous processors for maximal throughput has been known, in general, to
be NP-complete. The problem is further exacerbated when multiple applications
(i.e., bigger task sets) and the communication between tasks are also
considered. Previous research has shown that Genetic Algorithms (GA) typically
are a good choice to solve this problem when the solution space is relatively
small. However, when the size of the problem space increases, classic genetic
algorithms still suffer from the problem of long evolution times. To address
this problem, this paper proposes a novel bias-elitist genetic algorithm that
is guided by domain-specific heuristics to speed up the evolution process.
Experimental results reveal that our proposed algorithm is able to handle large
scale task mapping problems and produces high-quality mapping solutions in only
a short time period.
