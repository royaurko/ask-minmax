In this paper we present an idea of trusted communication platform for
Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) called TrustMAS. Based on analysis of routing
protocols suitable for MAS we have designed a new proactive hidden routing.
Proposed steg-agents discovery procedure, as well as further routes updates and
hidden communication, are cryptographically independent. Steganographic
exchange can cover heterogeneous and geographically outlying environments using
available cross-layer covert channels. Finally we have specified rules that
agents have to follow to benefit the TrustMAS distributed router platform.
