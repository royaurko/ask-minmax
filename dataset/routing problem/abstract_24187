We discuss the entropy and the size/homogeneity/horizon problems in power-law
expanding universes with one scale initial conditions. We set the minimal scale
$\Lambda = 10^{25}$ GeV at which a non-inflationary solution is possible and
show that the radiation dominated epoch alone technically is not able to
explain the issue. An earlier paper on the subject, [1], attempts a
multidimensional scenario. We review the scenario of the paper [1] in an
effective four dimensional Einstein frame. We find that during contraction of
extra dimensions, the residual bulk energy density is important and leads to a
scaling solution. The existence of this scaling solution is a new result. We
provide a numerical example which demonstrates the evolution of the scale
factor and the extra dimensions. In the whole, the validity of the effective
field theory calculations at the scale of $\Lambda = 10^{25}$ GeV is under
question and, hence, the final conclusion regarding the possibility of a
non-inflationary solution is preliminary.
