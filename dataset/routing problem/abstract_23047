The emergence of Hawking radiation from vacuum fluctuations is analyzed in
conventional field theories and their energy content is defined through the
Aharonov weak value concept. These fluctuations travel in flat space-time and
carry transplanckian energies sharply localized on cisplanckian distances. We
argue that these features cannot accommodate gravitational nonlinearities. We
suggest that the very emission of Hawking photons from tamed vacuum
fluctuations requires the existence of an exploding set of massive fields.
These considerations corroborate some conjectures of Susskind and may prove
relevant for the back-reaction problem and for the unitarity issue.
