The inverse problem of spectral analysis for the non-self-adjoint matrix
Sturm-Liouville operator on a finite interval is investigated. We study
properties of the spectral characteristics for the considered operator, and
provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of the inverse
problem. Our approach is based on the constructive solution of the inverse
problem by the method of spectral mappings. The characterization of the
spectral data in the self-adjoint case is derived as a corollary of the main
result.
