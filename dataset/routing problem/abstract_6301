A description of the set of $m$-sectorial extensions of a dual pair
$\{A_1,A_2\}$ of nonnegative operators is obtained. Some classes of
nonaccretive extensions of the dual pair $\{A_1,A_2\}$ are described too. Both
problems are reduced to similar problems for a dual pair $\{T_1,T_2\}$ of
nondensely defined symmetric contractions $T_j=(I-A_j)(I+A_j)^{-1},\
j\in\{1,2\}$. In turn these problems are reduced to the investigation of the
corresponding operator "holes". A complete description of the set of all proper
and improper extensions of a nonnegative operator is obtained too.
