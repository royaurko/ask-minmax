In this study, we illustrate the effective medium theories in the designs of
three-dimensional composite metametails of both negative permittivity and
permeability. The proposed metamaterials consist of coated spheres embedded in
a dielectric host. Simple design rules and formulas following the effective
medium models are numerically and analytically presented. We demonstrate that
the revised Maxwell-Garnett effective medium theory enables us to design
three-dimensional composite metamaterials through assembly of coated small
spheres. The proposed approach allows for precise control of the permittivity
and permeability and guides a facile, flexible and versatile way for the
fabrication of composite metamaterials.
