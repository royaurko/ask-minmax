We show that conventional asymmetric chiral random matrix models (ChRMM),
with a gaussian distribution in the asymmetry, provide for a screening of the
topological charge and a resolution of the $U(1)$ problem in the unquenched
approximation. Our exact results to order $1/N$ are in agreement with numerical
estimates using large ensembles of asymmetric ChRMM with gaussian
distributions.
