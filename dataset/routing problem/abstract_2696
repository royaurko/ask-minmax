We present a route for direct growth of boron nitride via a polyborazylene to
h-BN conversion process. This two-step growth process ultimately leads to a
>25x reduction in the RMS surface roughness of h-BN films when compared to a
high temperature growth on Al2O3(0001) and Si(111) substrates. Additionally,
the stoichiometry is shown to be highly dependent on the initial polyborazylene
deposition temperature. Importantly, CVD graphene transferred to direct-grown
boron nitride films on Al2O3 at 400{\deg}C results in a >1.5x and >2.5x
improvement in mobility compared to CVD graphene transferred to Al2O3 and SiO2
substrates, respectively, which is attributed to the combined reduction of
remote charged impurity scattering and surface roughness scattering. Simulation
of mobility versus carrier concentration confirms the importance of limiting
the introduction of charged impurities in the h-BN film and highlights the
importance of these results in producing optimized h-BN substrates for high
performance graphene and TMD devices.
