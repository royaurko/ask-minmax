Characterization of successful formulas in Public Announcement Logic (PAL) is
a well known open problem in Dynamic Epistemic Logic. Recently, Holliday and
ICard have given a complete characterization for the single agent case.
However, the problem for the multi-agent case is open. This paper gives a
partial solution to the problem, characterizing the subclass of the language
consisting of unary operators, and discusses methods to give a complete
solution.
