We present a real symmetric tri-diagonal matrix of order $n$ whose
eigenvalues are $\{2k \}_{k=0}^{n-1}$ which also satisfies the additional
condition that its leading principle submatrix has a uniformly interlaced
spectrum, $\{2l + 1 \}_{l=0}^{n-2}$. The matrix entries are explicit functions
of the size $n$, and so the matrix can be used as a test matrix for
eigenproblems, both forward and inverse. An explicit solution of a spring-mass
inverse problem incorporating the test matrix is provided.
