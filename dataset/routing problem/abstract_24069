We illustrate some problems that are related to the existence of an
underlying linear structure at the level of the property lattice associated
with a physical system, for the particular case of two explicitly separated
spin 1/2 objects that are considered, and mathematically described, as one
compound system. It is shown that the separated product of the property
lattices corresponding with the two spin 1/2 objects does not have an
underlying linear structure, although the property lattices associated with the
subobjects in isolation manifestly do. This is related at a fundamental level
to the fact that separated products do not behave well with respect to the
covering law (and orthomodularity) of elementary lattice theory. In addition,
we discuss the orthogonality relation associated with the separated product in
general and consider the related problem of the behavior of the corresponding
Sasaki projections as partial state space mappings
