The constrained Dirichlet boundary value problem $\ddot x=f(t,x)$,
$x(0)=x(T)$, is studied in billiard spaces, where impacts occur in boundary
points. Therefore we develop the research on impulsive Dirichlet problems with
state-dependent impulses. Inspiring simple examples lead to an approach
enabling to obtain both the existence and multiplicity results in one
dimensional billiards. Several observations concerning the multidimensional
case are also given.
