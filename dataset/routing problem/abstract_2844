The $\bar{\partial}$-Neumann problem is the fundamental boundary value
problem in several complex variables. It features an elliptic operator coupled
with non-coercive boundary conditions. The problem is globally regular on many,
but not all, pseudoconvex domains.
  We discuss several recent developments in the $L^{2}$-Sobolev theory of the
$\bar{\partial}$-Neumann problem that concern compactness and global
regularity.
