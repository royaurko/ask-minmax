The Statistics Consortium at the University of Maryland, College Park, hosted
a two-day workshop on Bayesian Methods that Frequentists Should Know during
April 30--May 1, 2008. The event was co-sponsored by the Institute of
Mathematical Statistics (IMS), Office of Research and Methodology, National
Center for Health Statistics, Survey Research Methods Section (SRMS) of the
American Statistical Association, and Washington Statistical Society. The
workshop was intended to bring out the positive features of Bayesian statistics
in solving real-life problems, including complex problems in sample surveys and
production of high-quality official statistics.
