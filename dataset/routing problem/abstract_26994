We present a geometric interpretation of a product form stationary
distribution for a $d$-dimensional semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion
(SRBM) that lives in the nonnegative orthant. The $d$-dimensional SRBM data can
be equivalently specified by $d+1$ geometric objects: an ellipse and $d$ rays.
Using these geometric objects, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions
for characterizing product form stationary distribution. The key idea in the
characterization is that we decompose the $d$-dimensional problem to
$\frac{1}{2}d(d-1)$ two-dimensional SRBMs, each of which is determined by an
ellipse and two rays. This characterization contrasts with the algebraic
condition of [14]. A $d$-station tandem queue example is presented to
illustrate how the product form can be obtained using our characterization.
Drawing the two-dimensional results in [1,7], we discuss potential optimal
paths for a variational problem associated with the three-station tandem queue.
Except Appendix D, the rest of this paper is almost identical to the QUESTA
paper with the same title.
