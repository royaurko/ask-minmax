We have adapted the maximally-localized Wannier function approach of [I.
Souza, N. Marzari and D. Vanderbilt, Phys. Rev. B 65, 035109 (2002)] to the
density functional theory based Siesta method [J. M. Soler et al., J. Phys.:
Cond. Mat. 14, 2745 (2002)] and applied it to the study of Co substitutional
impurities in bulk copper as well as to the Cu (111) surface. In the Co
impurity case, we have reduced the problem to the Co d-electrons and the Cu
sp-band, permitting us to obtain an Anderson-like Hamiltonian from well defined
density functional parameters in a fully orthonormal basis set. In order to
test the quality of the Wannier approach to surfaces, we have studied the
electronic structure of the Cu (111) surface by again transforming the density
functional problem into the Wannier representation. An excellent description of
the Shockley surface state is attained, permitting us to be confident in the
application of this method to future studies of magnetic adsorbates in the
presence of an extended surface state.
