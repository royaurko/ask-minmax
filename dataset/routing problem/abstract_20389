Present paper is devoted to formulation of the system of the master equations
of the problem and analytical considerations of the limiting cases, which have
an exact solutions (transversal and longitudinal flat bunches, linear approxim-
ation). Presented consideration gives some hints to the construction of proper
algorithm for numerical calculations.
