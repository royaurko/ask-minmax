Applying the Second Main Theorem we deal with the algebraic degeneracy of
entire holomorphic curves from the complex plane into a complex algebraic
normal variety of positive log Kodaira dimension that admits a finite proper
morphism to a semi-abelian variety. We will also discuss applications to the
Kobayashi hyperbolicity problem.
