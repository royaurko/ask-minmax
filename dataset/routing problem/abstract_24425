Security of an information system is only as strong as its weakest element.
Popular elements of such system include hardware, software, network and people.
Current approaches to computer security problems usually exclude people in
their studies even though it is an integral part of these systems. To fill that
gap, this paper discusses crucial people-related problems in computer security
and proposes a method of improving security in such systems by integrating
people tightly into the whole system. The integration is implemented via
visualization to provide visual feedbacks and capture people's awareness of
their actions and consequent results. By doing it, we can improve system
usability, shorten user's learning curve, and hence enable user uses computer
systems more securely.
