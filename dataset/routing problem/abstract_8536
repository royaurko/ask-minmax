We establish the existence of non-negative global weak solutions for a
strongly couple degenerated parabolic system which was obtained as an
approximation of the two-phase Stokes problem driven solely by capillary
forces. Moreover, the system under consideration may be viewed as a two-phase
generalization of the classical Thin Film equation.
