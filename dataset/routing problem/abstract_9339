Amoebas and coamoebas are the logarithmic images of algebraic varieties and
the images of algebraic varieties under the arg-map, respectively. We present
new techniques for computational problems on amoebas and coamoebas, thus
establishing new connections between (co-)amoebas, semialgebraic and convex
algebraic geometry and semidefinite programming.
  Our approach is based on formulating the membership problem in amoebas
(respectively coamoebas) as a suitable real algebraic feasibility problem.
Using the real Nullstellensatz, this allows to tackle the problem by sums of
squares techniques and semidefinite programming. Our method yields polynomial
identities as certificates of non-containment of a point in an amoeba or
coamoeba. As the main theoretical result, we establish some degree bounds on
the polynomial certificates. Moreover, we provide some actual computations of
amoebas based on the sums of squares approach.
