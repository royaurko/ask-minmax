Electromagnetic cloaking refers to the ability to prevent an object from
scattering an incident electromagnetic field. This has been accomplished in
recent works by routing the incident field around the object or by changing the
scattering properties of the object itself through specially designed
materials, surfaces or guiding structures. In this letter, we introduce a new
way of cancelling the electromagnetic scattering of an object by using an array
of sources. We show that by superimposing magnetic and electric surface current
densities at the boundary of an object, the scattered fields from that object
can be cancelled. These magnetic and electric surface currents can be
discretized into electric and magnetic dipoles which are physically
implementable by straight and loop wire antennas. Finally we confirm our
results using numerical simulations for cloaking a dielectric and a metallic
cylinder by means of a thin array of such wire antennas.
