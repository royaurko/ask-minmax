We generalize the Brundobler-Elser hypothesis in the multistate Landau-Zener
problem to the case when instead of a state with the highest slope of the
diabatic energy level there is a band of states with an arbitrary number of
parallel levels having the same slope. We argue that the probabilities of
counterintuitive transitions among such states are exactly zero.
