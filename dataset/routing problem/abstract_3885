The classical Center-Focus problem posed by H. Poincare in 1880's asks about
the classification of planar polynomial vector fields such that all their
integral trajectories are closed curves whose interiors contain a fixed point
(which is called a center). In this paper we describe a new general approach to
the Center Problem.
