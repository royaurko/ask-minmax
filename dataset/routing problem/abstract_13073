An analytical method for the visualization and prediction of trapped-mode
resonances based on the dimensions of a dispersive microwave network is
described. The method as explained is intuitive, easy to implement, and has
proven itself to be a useful tool in the avoidance of problems associated with
trapped modes prior to fabrication, as well as to correct those problems in
designs where this design detail was overlooked.
