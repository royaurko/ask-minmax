The development of modern information technologies permits to collect and to
analyze huge amounts of statistical data in different spheres of life. The main
problem is not to only to collect but to process all relevant information. The
purpose of our work is to show the example of intelligent data analysis in such
complex and non-formalized field as science. Using the statistical data about
scientific periodical it is possible to perform its comprehensive analysis and
to solve different practical problems. The combination of various approaches
including the statistical analysis, methods of the complex network theory and
different techniques that can be used for the concept mapping permits to
perform an intelligent data analysis in order to obtain underlying patterns and
hidden connections. Results of such analysis can be used for particular
practical problems like information retrieval within journal.
