This paper considers estimation of sparse covariance matrices and establishes
the optimal rate of convergence under a range of matrix operator norm and
Bregman divergence losses. A major focus is on the derivation of a rate sharp
minimax lower bound. The problem exhibits new features that are significantly
different from those that occur in the conventional nonparametric function
estimation problems. Standard techniques fail to yield good results, and new
tools are thus needed. We first develop a lower bound technique that is
particularly well suited for treating "two-directional" problems such as
estimating sparse covariance matrices. The result can be viewed as a
generalization of Le Cam's method in one direction and Assouad's Lemma in
another. This lower bound technique is of independent interest and can be used
for other matrix estimation problems. We then establish a rate sharp minimax
lower bound for estimating sparse covariance matrices under the spectral norm
by applying the general lower bound technique. A thresholding estimator is
shown to attain the optimal rate of convergence under the spectral norm. The
results are then extended to the general matrix $\ell_w$ operator norms for
$1\le w\le \infty$. In addition, we give a unified result on the minimax rate
of convergence for sparse covariance matrix estimation under a class of Bregman
divergence losses.
