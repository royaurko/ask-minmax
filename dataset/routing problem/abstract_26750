In this paper, we develop a new mathematical technique which allows us to
express the joint distribution of a Markov process and its running maximum (or
minimum) through the marginal distribution of the process itself. This
technique is an extension of the classical reflection principle for Brownian
motion, and it is obtained by weakening the assumptions of symmetry required
for the classical reflection principle to work. We call this method a weak
reflection principle and show that it provides solutions to many problems for
which the classical reflection principle is typically used. In addition, unlike
the classical reflection principle, the new method works for a much larger
class of stochastic processes which, in particular, do not possess any strong
symmetries. Here, we review the existing results which establish the weak
reflection principle for a large class of time-homogeneous diffusions on a real
line and, then, proceed to extend this method to the Levy processes with
one-sided jumps (subject to some admissibility conditions). Finally, we
demonstrate the applications of the weak reflection principle in Financial
Mathematics, Computational Methods, and Inverse Problems.
