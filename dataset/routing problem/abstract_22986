From a geometric perspective most nonlinear binary classification algorithms,
including state of the art versions of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Radial
Basis Function Network (RBFN) classifiers, and are based on the idea of
reconstructing indicator functions. We propose instead to use reconstruction of
the signed distance function (SDF) as a basis for binary classification. We
discuss properties of the signed distance function that can be exploited in
classification algorithms. We develop simple versions of such classifiers and
test them on several linear and nonlinear problems. On linear tests accuracy of
the new algorithm exceeds that of standard SVM methods, with an average of 50%
fewer misclassifications. Performance of the new methods also matches or
exceeds that of standard methods on several nonlinear problems including
classification of benchmark diagnostic micro-array data sets.
