Graph inference is a burgeoning field in the applied and theoretical
statistics communities, as well as throughout the wider world of science,
engineering, business, etc. Given two graphs on the same number of vertices,
the graph matching problem is to find a bijection between the two vertex sets
which minimizes the number of adjacency disagreements between the two graphs.
The seeded graph matching problem is the graph matching problem with an
additional constraint that the bijection assigns some particular vertices of
one vertex set to respective particular vertices of the other vertex set.
Solving the (seeded) graph matching problem will enable methodologies for many
graph inference tasks, but the problem is NP-hard. We modify the
state-of-the-art approximate graph matching algorithm of Vogelstein et al.
(2012) to make it a fast approximate seeded graph matching algorithm. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm - and the potential for dramatic
performance improvement from incorporating just a few seeds - via simulation
and real data experiments.
