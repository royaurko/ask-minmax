This paper deals with the computation of the eigenvalues of two-parameter
Sturm- Liouville (SL) problems using the Regularized Sampling Method, a method
which has been effective in computing the eigenvalues of broad classes of SL
problems (Singular, Non-Self-Adjoint, Non-Local, Impulsive,...). We have shown,
in this work that it can tackle two-parameter SL problems with equal ease. An
example was provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the method.
