The Riemann problem is studied in the case when the unknown function has
nonisolated singularities, concentrated on the real axis. The problem is used
for the factorization of functions, holomorphic outside of the unit circle and
the real axis, in the form of the product of two functions which have
singulariries on the given set of the real axis.
