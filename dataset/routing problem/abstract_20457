We investigate the scaling properties of the Penna model, which has become a
popular tool for the study of population dynamics and evolutionary problems in
recent years. We find that the model generates a normalised age distribution
for which a simple scaling rule is proposed, that is able to reproduce
qualitative features for all genome sizes.
