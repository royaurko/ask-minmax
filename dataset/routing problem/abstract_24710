We consider the Cacuhy problem for a viscous compressible rotating shallow
water system with a third-order surface-tension term involved, derived recently
in the modelling of motions for shallow water with free surface in a rotating
sub-domain. The global existence of the solution in the space of Besov type is
shown for initial data close to a constant equilibrium state away from the
vacuum. Unlike the previous analysis about the compressible fluid model without
coriolis forces, the rotating effect causes a coupling between two parts of
Hodge's decomposition of the velocity vector field, additional regularity is
required in order to carry out the Friedrichs' regularization and compactness
arguments.
