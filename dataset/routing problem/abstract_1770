Browsing is a way of finding documents in a large amount of data which is
complementary to querying and which is particularly suitable for multimedia
documents. Locating particular documents in a very large collection of
multimedia documents such as the ones available in peer to peer networks is a
difficult task. However, current peer to peer systems do not allow to do this
by browsing. In this report, we show how one can build a peer to peer system
supporting a kind of browsing. In our proposal, one must extend an existing
distributed hash table system with a few features : handling partial hash-keys
and providing appropriate routing mechanisms for these hash-keys. We give such
an algorithm for the particular case of the Tapestry distributed hash table.
This is a work in progress as no proper validation has been done yet.
