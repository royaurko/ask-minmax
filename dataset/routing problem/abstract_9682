The superiority and inferiority ranking (SIR) method is a generation of the
well-known PROMETHEE method, which can be more efficient to deal with
multi-criterion decision making (MCDM) problem. Intuitionistic fuzzy sets
(IFSs), as an important extension of fuzzy sets (IFs), include both membership
functions and non-membership functions and can be used to, more precisely
describe uncertain information. In real world, decision situations are usually
under uncertain environment and involve multiple individuals who have their own
points of view on handing of decision problems. In order to solve uncertainty
group MCDM problem, we propose a novel intuitionistic fuzzy SIR method in this
paper. This approach uses intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operators and SIR
ranking methods to handle uncertain information; integrate individual opinions
into group opinions; make decisions on multiple-criterion; and finally
structure a specific decision map. The proposed approach is illustrated in a
simulation of group decision making problem related to supply chain management.
