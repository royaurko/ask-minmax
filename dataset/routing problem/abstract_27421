In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm to solve planar minimum
time multi-vehicle rendezvous problem with non-identical velocity constraints
on cyclic digraph (topology). Motivated by the cyclic alternating projection
method that can compute a point's projection on the intersection of some convex
sets, we transform the minimum time rendezvous problem into finding the
distance between the position plane and the intersection of several
second-order cones in position-time space. The distance can be achieved by
metric projecting onto the plane and the intersection persistently from any
initial point, where the projection onto the intersection is obtained by
Dykstra's alternating projection algorithm. It is shown that during the
procedure, vehicles use only the information from neighbors and can apply the
projection onto the plane asynchronously. Demonstrations are worked out to
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
