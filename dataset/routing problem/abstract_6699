Given two triangulations of a convex polygon, computing the minimum number of
flips required to transform one to the other is a long-standing open problem.
It is not known whether the problem is in P or NP-complete. We prove that two
natural generalizations of the problem are NP-complete, namely computing the
minimum number of flips between two triangulations of (1) a polygon with holes;
(2) a set of points in the plane.
