This paper studies magnifying superlens using complementary media.
Superlensing using complementary media was suggested by Veselago in [16] and
innovated by Nicorovici et al. in [9] and Pendry in [10]. The study of this
problem is difficult due to two facts. Firstly, this problem is unstable since
the equations describing the phenomena have sign changing coefficients; hence
the ellipticity is lost. Secondly, the phenomena associated are localized
resonant, i.e., the field explodes in some regions and remains bounded in some
others. This makes the problem difficult to analyse. In this paper, we develop
the technique of removing of localized singularity introduced in [6] and make
use of the reflecting technique in [5] to overcome these two difficulties. More
precisely, we suggest a class of lenses which has root from [9] and [14] and
inspired from [6] and give a proof of superlensing for this class. To our
knowledge, this is the first rigorous proof on the magnification of an
arbitrary inhomogeneous object using complementary media.
