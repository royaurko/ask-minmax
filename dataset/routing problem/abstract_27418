The minimal speeds ($c^*$) of the Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (KPP) fronts
at small diffusion ($\epsilon \ll 1$) in a class of time-periodic cellular
flows with chaotic streamlines is investigated in this paper. The variational
principle of $c^*$ reduces the computation to that of a principal eigenvalue
problem on a periodic domain of a linear advection-diffusion operator with
space-time periodic coefficients and small diffusion. To solve the advection
dominated time-dependent eigenvalue problem efficiently over large time, a
combination of finite element and spectral methods, as well as the associated
fast solvers, are utilized to accelerate computation. In contrast to the
scaling $c^*=\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{1/4})$ in steady cellular flows, a new
relation $c^* = \mathcal{O}(1)$ as $\epsilon \ll 1$ is revealed in the
time-periodic cellular flows due to the presence of chaotic streamlines.
Residual propagation speed emerges from the Lagrangian chaos which is
quantified as a sub-diffusion process.
