In order to interpret and explain the physiological signal behaviors, it can
be interesting to find some constants among the fluctuations of these data
during all the effort or during different stages of the race (which can be
detected using a change points detection method). Several recent papers have
proposed the long-range dependence (Hurst) parameter as such a constant.
However, their results induce two main problems. Firstly, DFA method is usually
applied for estimating this parameter. Clearly, such a method does not provide
the most efficient estimator and moreover it is not at all robust even in the
case of smooth trends. Secondly, this method often gives estimated Hurst
parameters larger than 1, which is the larger possible value for long memory
stationary processes. In this article we propose solutions for both these
problems and we define a new model allowing such estimated parameters.
