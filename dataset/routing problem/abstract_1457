Following the work of Leutheusser [Physica A 127, 667 (1984)], the solution
to the Percus-Yevick equation for a seven-dimensional hard-sphere fluid is
explicitly found. This allows the derivation of the equation of state for the
fluid taking both the virial and the compressibility routes. An analysis of the
virial coefficients and the determination of the radius of convergence of the
virial series are carried out. Molecular dynamics simulations of the same
system are also performed and a comparison between the simulation results for
the compressibility factor and theoretical expressions for the same quantity is
presented.
