The problem of the derivation of hydrodynamics from the Boltzmann equation
and related dissipative systems is formulated as the problem of slow invariant
manifold in the space of distributions. We review a few instances where such
hydrodynamic manifolds were found analytically both as the result of summation
of the Chapman--Enskog asymptotic expansion and by the direct solution of the
invariance equation. These model cases, comprising Grad's moment systems, both
linear and nonlinear, are studied in depth in order to gain understanding of
what can be expected for the Boltzmann equation. Particularly, the dispersive
dominance and saturation of dissipation rate of the exact hydrodynamics in the
short-wave limit and the viscosity modification at high divergence of the flow
velocity are indicated as severe obstacles to the resolution of Hilbert's 6th
Problem. Furthermore, we review the derivation of the approximate hydrodynamic
manifold for the Boltzmann equation using Newton's iteration and avoiding
smallness parameters, and compare this to the exact solutions. Additionally, we
discuss the problem of projection of the Boltzmann equation onto the
approximate hydrodynamic invariant manifold using entropy concepts. Finally, a
set of hypotheses is put forward where we describe open questions and set a
horizon for what can be derived exactly or proven about the hydrodynamic
manifolds for the Boltzmann equation in the future.
