The reachability problem for Vector Addition Systems (VASs) is a central
problem of net theory. The general problem is known to be decidable by
algorithms exclusively based on the classical
Kosaraju-Lambert-Mayr-Sacerdote-Tenney decomposition. This decomposition is
used in this paper to prove that the Parikh images of languages recognized by
VASs are semi-pseudo-linear; a class that extends the semi-linear sets, a.k.a.
the sets definable in Presburger arithmetic. We provide an application of this
result; we prove that a final configuration is not reachable from an initial
one if and only if there exists a semi-linear inductive invariant that contains
the initial configuration but not the final one. Since we can decide if a
Presburger formula denotes an inductive invariant, we deduce that there exist
checkable certificates of non-reachability. In particular, there exists a
simple algorithm for deciding the general VAS reachability problem based on two
semi-algorithms. A first one that tries to prove the reachability by
enumerating finite sequences of actions and a second one that tries to prove
the non-reachability by enumerating Presburger formulas.
