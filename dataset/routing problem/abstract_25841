This paper examines the effect of mimicking discontinuous heredity caused by
carrying more than one chromosome in some living organisms cells in
Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization algorithms. In this representation,
the phenotype may not fully reflect the genotype. By doing so we are mimicking
living organisms inheritance mechanism, where traits may be silently carried
for many generations to reappear later. Representations with different number
of chromosomes in each solution vector are tested on different benchmark
problems with high number of decision variables and objectives. A comparison
with Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II is done on all problems.
