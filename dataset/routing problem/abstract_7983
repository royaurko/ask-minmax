We consider integrable spherical analogue of the Darboux potential, which
appear in the problem (and its generalizations) of the planar motion of a
particle in the field of two and four fixed Newtonian centers. The obtained
results can be useful when constructing a theory of motion of satellites in the
field of an oblate spheroid in constant curvature spaces.
