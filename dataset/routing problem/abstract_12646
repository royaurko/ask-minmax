The development of the theory of three-dimensional harmonic mappings is
considered. The new classes of mappings that generate three-dimensional
harmonic functions are introduced. The physical interpretation of these
mappings is applied to electrostatics problems. It is found that these mappings
locally conserve electric charge of the equipotential surfaces. To confirm the
correctness of the theory it is shown that by using the proposed mappings the
electric field in two known electrostatic problems can be found.
