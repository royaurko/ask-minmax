We first review the three known chiral anomalies in four dimensions and then
use the anomaly free conditions to study the uniqueness of quark and lepton
representations and charge quantizations in the standard model. We also extend
our results to theory with an arbitrary number of color. Finally, we discuss
the family problem.
