Realization of logic circuits from graphene is very attractive for high-speed
nanoelectronics. However, the intrinsic ambipolar nature hinders the formation
of graphene logic devices with the conventional complementary architecture.
Using electrostatic doping modulation, we show here a facile method to control
the charge neutrality points and form a complementary-like structure, in which
the ambipolar conduction is used as a benefit rather than a drawback to
construct logic devices. A band gap is also introduced in the channels to
improve the switching ratio of the graphene transistors. For the first time,
complementary-like NOR and NAND logic gates were demonstrated. This method
provides a possible route for logic circuits from ambipolar graphene and, in
principle, can be also extended to other ambipolar semiconductors, such as
organic compounds and carbon nanotube thin films.
