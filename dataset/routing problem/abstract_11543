In this paper a new connection between the discrete conformal geometry
problem of disk pattern construction and the continuous conformal geometry
problem of metric uniformization is presented. In a nutshell, we discuss how to
construct disk patterns by optimizing an objective function, which turns out to
be intimately related to hyperbolic volume. With the use of random Delaunay
triangulations we then average this objective function to construct an
objective function on the metrics conformal to a fixed one. Finally using this
averaged objective function we may reprove the uniformization theorem in two
dimensions.
