We prove a global stability estimate for the time-dependent X-ray transform
on simple manifolds with dimension greater than or equal to $2$. We do this by
extending a known result by Begmatov for stability of the time dependent X-ray
transform in $\mathbb{R}^+_t\times\mathbb{R}^2$. We give some examples of
stability and injectivity results in relationship to the Dirichlet-to-Neumann
problem.
