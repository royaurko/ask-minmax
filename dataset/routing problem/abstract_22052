We consider weak non-negative solutions to the critical $p$-Laplace equation
in $\mathbb{R}^N$, $-\Delta_p u =u^{p^*-1}$ in the singular case $1<p<2$. We
prove that if the nonlinearity is locally Lipschitz continuous, namely
$p^*\geqslant2$ then all the solutions in ${\mathcal D}^{1,p}(\R^N)$ are radial
(and radially decreasing) about some point.
