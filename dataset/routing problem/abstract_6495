The paper introduces a modified version of the classical Coupon Collector's
Problem entailing exchanges and cooperation between multiple players. Results
of the development show that, within a proper Markov framework, the complexity
of the Cooperative Multiplayer Coupon Collectors' Problem can be attacked with
an eye to the modeling of resource harvesting and sharing within the context of
Next Generation Network. The cost of cooperation is computed in terms of
exchange protocol burden and found to be dependent on only ensemble parameters
such as the number of players and the number of coupons but not on the detailed
collection statistics. The benefits of cooperation are quantified in terms of
reduction of the average number of actions before collection completion.
