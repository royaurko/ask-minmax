The eigenstate problem of the Jaynes-Cummings model on the basis of complete
Hamiltonian, including the center-of -mass kinetic energy operator, is treated.
The energy spectrum and wave functions in standing-wave (SW)- and
counterpropagating waves (CPW)- cases are calculated and compared with each
other. It is shown that in CPW-case i) the atomic momentum distribution is
asymmetric and somewhat narrower in general; ii) the concept of quasimomentum
is not applicable and instead the ordinary momentum concerns the problem; iii)
atomic and photonic state distributions are self-consistent, and, in
consequence iiii) mean number of photons in the counterpropagating traveling
waves and mean atomic momentum match. Explicit analytic expressions for energy
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are found in Tavis -Cummings-type approximation
[Phys. Rev. 170, 379(1968)] and is pointed, that it implies only the
bounded-like states for atomic center-of-mass motion. It is also shown that if
the recoil energy is taken into account, the Doppleron resonance is split into
two branches, one of which diverges to Bragg-like resonance in the high-order
range.
