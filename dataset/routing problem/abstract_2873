In the literature two notions of the word problem for a variety occur. A
variety has a decidable word problem if every finitely presented algebra in
the variety has a decidable word problem. It has a uniformly decidable word
problem if there is an algorithm which given a finite presentation produces an
algorithm for solving the word problem of the algebra so presented. A variety
is given with finitely many axioms having a decidable, but not uniformly
decidable, word problem. Other related examples are given as well.
