We provide a fast and simple method to solve fractional variational problems
with dependence on Hadamard fractional derivatives. Using a relation between
the Hadamard fractional operator and a sum involving integer-order derivatives,
we rewrite the fractional problem into a classical optimal control problem. The
latter problem is then solved by application of standard numerical techniques.
We illustrate the procedure with an example.
