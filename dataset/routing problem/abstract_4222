In this paper inverse problems for Dirac operator with nonlocal conditions
are considered. Uniqueness theorems of inverse problems from the Weyl-type
function and spectra are provided, which are generalizations of the well-known
Weyl function and Borg's inverse problem for the classical Dirac operator.
