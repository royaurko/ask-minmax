We consider the Suslov problem of nonholonomic rigid body motion with
inhomogeneous constraints. We show that if the direction along which the Suslov
constraint is enforced is perpendicular to a principal axis of inertia of the
body, then the reduced equations are integrable and, in the generic case,
possess a smooth invariant measure. Interestingly, in this generic case, the
first integral that permits integration is transcendental and the density of
the invariant measure depends on the angular velocities. We also study the
Painlev\'e property of the solutions.
