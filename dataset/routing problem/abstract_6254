We study the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to Dirichlet problems in
perforated domains for nonlinear elliptic equations associated with monotone
operators. The main difference with respect to the previous papers on this
subject is that no uniformity is assumed in the monotonicity condition. Under a
very general hypothesis on the holes of the domains, we construct a limit
equation, which is satisfied by the weak limits of the solutions. The
additional term in the limit problem depends only on the local behaviour of the
holes, which can be expressed in terms of suitable nonlinear capacities
associated with the monotone operator.
