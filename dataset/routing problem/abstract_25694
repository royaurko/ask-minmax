Let $f(n,\ell)$ be the maximum integer such that every set of $n$ points in
the plane with at most $\ell$ collinear contains a subset of $f(n,\ell)$ points
with no three collinear. First we prove that if $\ell \leq O(\sqrt{n})$ then
$f(n,\ell)\geq \Omega(\sqrt{\frac{n}{\ln \ell}})$. Second we prove that if
$\ell \leq O(n^{(1-\epsilon)/2})$ then $f(n,\ell) \geq \Omega(\sqrt{n\log_\ell
n})$, which implies all previously known lower bounds on $f(n,\ell)$ and
improves them when $\ell$ is not fixed. A more general problem is to consider
subsets with at most $k$ collinear points in a point set with at most $\ell$
collinear. We also prove analogous results in this setting.
