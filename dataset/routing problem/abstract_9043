In this paper we examine an inverse problem in the modular theory of von
Neumann algebras in the case of finite factors. First we give a
characterization of cyclic and separating vectors for finite factors in terms
of operators associated with this vector and being affiliated with the factor.
Further we show how this operator generates the modular objects of the given
cyclic and separating vector generalizing an idea of Kadison and Ringrose. With
the help of these rather technical results we show under an appropriate
condition, which is always fulfilled for finite type I factors, that there
exists another simple class of solutions of the inverse problem beside a
trivial one which always exists. Finally we give a complete classification of
the solutions of the inverse problem in the case of modular operators having
pure point spectrum which is no restriction in the type I case. In a subsequent
paper these results will be generalized to all semifinite factors.
