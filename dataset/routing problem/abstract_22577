K-essence has been proposed as a possible means of explaining the coincidence
problem of the Universe beginning to accelerate only at the present epoch. We
carry out a comprehensive dynamical systems analysis of the k-essence models
given so far in the literature. We numerically study the basin of attraction of
the tracker solutions and we highlight the behaviour of the field close to
sound speed divergences. We find that, when written in terms of parameters with
a simple dynamical interpretation, the basins of attraction represent only a
small region of the phase space.
