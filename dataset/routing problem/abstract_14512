In this paper we investigate the problem of sorting a set of $n$ coins, each
with distinct but unknown weights, using an unusual scale. The classical
version of this problem, which has been well-studied, gives the user a binary
scale, enabling them to determine which is the lighter/heavier of any two
objects. We generalise this, considering a scale that accepts $k$ coins as
input and returns the $t^{\text{th}}$ lightest, for a fixed $k$ and $t$. We
consider this in both an on-line and off-line setting, and exhibit algorithms
in both settings that are best-possible in terms of the order of the number of
queries required.
