Dark matter, gauge coupling unification, and the strong CP problem find a
common and simple solution (in the absence of naturalness) within axion models.
We show that such solution, even without specifying the details of the model
implementation, makes testable predictions for the experimentally measurable
axion parameters: the axion mass and its coupling to photons.
