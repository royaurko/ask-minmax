Special problems were encountered in some areas in Northern France where the
high speed railways (TGV Nord) crossed some loess deposits that appeared to be
specially sensitive to change in water content and susceptible to collapse.
Numerous sinkholes appeared along some sections of the line following wet
climatic periods. After a general geological and geotechnical presentation of
loess deposits and collapse susceptibility, in which some tools of the
mechanics of unsaturated soils are reconsidered with special application to
loess collapsibility, this paper describes the results of a geotechnical study
carried out on block samples of intact loess. Collapse susceptibility is
examined in the light of microstructure observation. The dependence of collapse
to water content changes is examined and the validity of various existing
collapse criteria is investigated.
