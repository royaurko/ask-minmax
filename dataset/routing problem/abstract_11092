A dynamic crack will travel in a straight path up to a material-dependent
critical speed beyond which its path becomes erratic. Predicting this critical
speed and discovering the origin of this instability are two outstanding
problems in fracture mechanics. We recently discovered a simple scaling model
based on an effective elastic modulus that gives successful predictions for
this critical speed by transforming the nonlinear crack dynamics problem into a
linear elasticity representation. We now show that a simple atomic picture
based on broken-bond relaxation at the dynamic crack tip provides an
explanation for the origin of the effective elastic modulus.
