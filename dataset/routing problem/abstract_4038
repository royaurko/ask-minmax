In this paper, first we give a sequential linear-time algorithm for the
longest path problem in meshes. This algorithm can be considered as an
improvement of [13]. Then based on this sequential algorithm, we present a
constant-time parallel algorithm for the problem which can be run on every
parallel machine.
