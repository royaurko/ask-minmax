The pricing of American style and multiple exercise options is a very
challenging problem in mathematical finance. One usually employs a Least-Square
Monte Carlo approach (Longstaff-Schwartz method) for the evaluation of
conditional expectations which arise in the Backward Dynamic Programming
principle for such optimal stopping or stochastic control problems in a
Markovian framework. Unfortunately, these Least-Square Monte Carlo approaches
are rather slow and allow, due to the dependency structure in the Backward
Dynamic Programming principle, no parallel implementation; whether on the Monte
Carlo levelnor on the time layer level of this problem. We therefore present in
this paper a quantization method for the computation of the conditional
expectations, that allows a straightforward parallelization on the Monte Carlo
level. Moreover, we are able to develop for AR(1)-processes a further
parallelization in the time domain, which makes use of faster memory structures
and therefore maximizes parallel execution. Finally, we present numerical
results for a CUDA implementation of this methods. It will turn out that such
an implementation leads to an impressive speed-up compared to a serial CPU
implementation.
