We study the enclosure method for the p-Calder\'on problem, which is a
nonlinear generalization of the inverse conductivity problem due to Calder\'on
that involves the p-Laplace equation. The method allows one to reconstruct the
convex hull of an inclusion in the nonlinear model by using exponentially
growing solutions introduced by Wolff. We justify this method for the
penetrable obstacle case, where the inclusion is modelled as a jump in the
conductivity. The result is based on a monotonicity inequality and the
properties of the Wolff solutions.
