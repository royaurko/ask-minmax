This short paper presents a nontechnical introduction to the problem of
nonequivalent microcanonical and canonical ensembles. Both the thermodynamic
and the macrostate levels of definition of nonequivalent ensembles are
introduced. The many relationships that exist between these two levels are also
explained in simple physical terms.
