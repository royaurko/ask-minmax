The cosmological evolution of the string landscape is expected to consist of
multiple stages of old inflation with large cosmological constant ending by
tunnelling. Old inflation has a well known graceful exit problem as the
observable universe becomes empty, devoid of any entropy. Simultaneously, in
the quest for reheating the right degrees of freedom, it is important that the
final stage of inflation reheat Standard Model sector. It is known that
inflation can occur naturally along a flat direction of the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), solving the reheating problem, but the
initial conditions require a large degree of fine-tuning. In this paper, we
study how inflation of a MSSM flat direction can be embedded into the string
theory landscape to solve both the graceful exit problem of old inflation and
the fine-tuning problem of MSSM inflation, elaborating on ideas of Bousso and
Polchinski. The fluctuations of the MSSM flat direction during old inflation
create regions with initial conditions favorable for eternal inflation, which
also allows the cosmological constant to continue to relax. This final phase of
inflation also provides all the usual benefits of MSSM inflation, including
straightforward reheating into Standard Model degrees of freedom.
