We analyze CP violation in the supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) embedded
minimally into a left-right symmetric gauge structure with the seesaw mechanism
for neutrino masses. With the plausible assumption of universal scalar masses
it is shown that CP violation in the hadron sector of the MSSM is described by
a single phase residing in the supersymmetry breaking Lagrangian. This improves
the CP properties of the MSSM by providing a natural solution to the SUSY CP
problem. Furthermore, $\epsilon'/\epsilon$ vanishes in this model above the
seesaw scale; extrapolation to the weak scale then leads to a prediction in
agreement with the NA31 and the recent KTeV observations. The electric dipole
moment of the neutron is naturally suppressed, we estimate its magnitude to be
about $4 \times 10^{-29}$ ecm. Additional predictions include a tightly
constrained super particle spectrum and vanishingly small CP asymmetries in the
$B$ meson system.
