Analyzing the computational complexity of evolutionary algorithms for binary
search spaces has significantly increased their theoretical understanding. With
this paper, we start the computational complexity analysis of genetic
programming. We set up several simplified genetic programming algorithms and
analyze them on two separable model problems, ORDER and MAJORITY, each of which
captures an important facet of typical genetic programming problems. Both
analyses give first rigorous insights on aspects of genetic programming design,
highlighting in particular the impact of accepting or rejecting neutral moves
and the importance of a local mutation operator.
