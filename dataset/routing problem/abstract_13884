For the one-dimensional linear kinetic equation analytical solutions of
problems about temperature jump and weak evaporation (condensation) over flat
surface are received. The equation has integral of collisions BGK (Bhatnagar,
Gross and Krook) and frequency of collisions of molecules, affine depending on
the module molecular velocity.
