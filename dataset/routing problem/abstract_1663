We investigate the heat current flowing across the interface between graphene
and hexagonal boron nitride (so-called white graphene) using both molecular
dynamics simulation and nonequilibrium Green's function approaches. These two
distinct methods discover the same phenomena that the heat current is reduced
linearly with increasing interface length, and the zigzag interface causes
stronger reduction of heat current than the armchair interface. These phenomena
are interpreted by both the lattice dynamics analysis and the transmission
function explanation, which both reveal that the localized phonon modes at
interfaces are responsible for the heat management. The room temperature
interface thermal resistance is about $7\times10^{-10}$m$^{2}$K/W in zigzag
interface and $3.5\times10^{-10}$m$^{2}$K/W in armchair interface, which
directly results in stronger heat reduction in zigzag interface. Our
theoretical results provide a specific route for experimentalists to control
the heat transport in the graphene and hexagonal boron nitride compound through
shaping the interface between these two materials.
