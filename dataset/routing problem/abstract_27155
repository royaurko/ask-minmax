The problem of harmonics generation in nanotargets is considered at the range
of parameters (a nanotarget diameter and a pump laser intensity) when the
oscillation amplitude of an electron in a target is much larger than the target
width. Electron motion in charged nanotargets in the presence of a laser field
of different (non-relativistic) strength is considered. It is demonstarted that
for lasers of infrared frequencies clusters do not posess strong enough
potential to bound electrons with large oscillation amplitudes. Opposite to
clusters, nanofilms were found to be very perspective targets in the problem
considered. A simple analytic model and molecular dynamic simulations showed
increased harmonics generation when the oscillation amplitude of electrons in a
film becomes much larger, than the film width. Different regimes of generation
are briefly discussed.
