Let $n = b_1 + ... + b_k = b_1' + \cdot + b_k'$ be a pair of compositions of
$n$ into $k$ positive parts. We say this pair is {\em irreducible} if there is
no positive $j < k$ for which $b_1 + ... b_j = b_1' + ... b_j'$. The
probability that a random pair of compositions of $n$ is irreducible is shown
to be asymptotic to $8/n$. This problem leads to a problem in probability
theory. Two players move along a game board by rolling a die, and we ask when
the two players will first coincide. A natural extension is to show that the
probability of a first return to the origin at time $n$ for any mean-zero
variance $V$ random walk is asymptotic to $\sqrt{V/(2 \pi)} n^{-3/2}$. We prove
this via two methods, one analytic and one probabilistic.
