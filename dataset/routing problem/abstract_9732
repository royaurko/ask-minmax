In this paper, the preliminary design of a space mission is approached
introducing uncertainties on the design parameters and formulating the
resulting reliable design problem as a multiobjective optimization problem.
Uncertainties are modelled through evidence theory and the belief, or
credibility, in the successful achievement of mission goals is maximised along
with the reliability of constraint satisfaction. The multiobjective
optimisation problem is solved through a novel algorithm based on the
collaboration of a population of agents in search for the set of highly
reliable solutions. Two typical problems in mission analysis are used to
illustrate the proposed methodology.
