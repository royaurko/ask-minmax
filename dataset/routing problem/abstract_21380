We classify all pairs $(V,H)$, where $H$ is a proper subgroup of $G=Sp_6(q)$,
$q$ even, and $V$ is an $\ell$-modular representation of $G$ for $\ell\neq 2$
which is absolutely irreducible as a representation of $H$. This problem is
motivated by the Aschbacher-Scott program on classifying maximal subgroups of
finite classical groups.
