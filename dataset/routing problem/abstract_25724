The problem of finding a rank-one solution to a system of linear matrix
equations arises from many practical applications. Given a system of linear
matrix equations, however, such a low-rank solution does not always exist. In
this paper, we aim at developing some sufficient conditions for the existence
of a rank-one solution to the system of homogeneous linear matrix equations
(HLME) over the positive semidefinite cone. First, we prove that an existence
condition of a rank-one solution can be established by a homotopy invariance
theorem. The derived condition is closely related to the so-called
$P_\emptyset$ property of the function defined by quadratic transformations.
Second, we prove that the existence condition for a rank-one solution can be
also established through the maximum rank of the (positive semidefinite) linear
combination of given matrices. It is shown that an upper bound for the rank of
the solution to a system of HLME over the positive semidefinite cone can be
obtained efficiently by solving a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem.
Moreover, a sufficient condition for the nonexistence of a rank-one solution to
the system of HLME is also established in this paper.
