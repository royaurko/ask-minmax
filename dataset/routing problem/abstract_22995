In a previous paper we generalized the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) pattern
matching algorithm and defined a non-conventional kind of RAM, the MP--RAMs
(RAMS equipped with extra operations), and designed an O(n) on-line algorithm
for solving the serial episode matching problem on MP--RAMs when there is only
one single episode. We here give two extensions of this algorithm to the case
when we search for several patterns simultaneously and compare them. More
preciseley, given $q+1$ strings (a text $t$ of length $n$ and $q$ patterns
$m\_1,...,m\_q$) and a natural number $w$, the {\em multiple serial episode
matching problem} consists in finding the number of size $w$ windows of text
$t$ which contain patterns $m\_1,...,m\_q$ as subsequences, i.e. for each
$m\_i$, if $m\_i=p\_1,..., p\_k$, the letters $p\_1,..., p\_k$ occur in the
window, in the same order as in $m\_i$, but not necessarily consecutively (they
may be interleaved with other letters).} The main contribution is an algorithm
solving this problem on-line in time $O(nq)$.
