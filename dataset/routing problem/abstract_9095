We study an integrable modification of the focusing nonlinear
  Schroedinger equation from the point of view of semiclassical asymptotics. In
particular, (i) we establish several important consequences of the mixed-type
limiting quasilinear system including the existence of maps that embed the
limiting forms of both the focusing and defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger
equations into the framework of a single limiting system for the modified
equation, (ii) we obtain bounds for the location of discrete spectrum for the
associated spectral problem that are particularly suited to the semiclassical
limit and that generalize known results for the spectrum of the nonselfadjoint
Zakharov-Shabat spectral problem, and (iii) we present a multiparameter family
of initial data for which we solve the associated spectral problem in terms of
special functions for all values of the semiclassical scaling parameter. We
view our results as part of a broader project to analyze the semiclassical
limit of the modified nonlinear Schroedinger equation via the noncommutative
steepest descent procedure of Deift and Zhou, and we also present a
self-contained development of a Riemann-Hilbert problem of inverse scattering
that differs from those given in the literature and that is well-adapted to
semiclassical asymptotics.
