In the practical business environment, portfolio managers often face
business-driven requirements that limit the number of constituents in their
tracking portfolio. A natural index tracking model is thus to minimize a
tracking error measure while enforcing an upper bound on the number of assets
in the portfolio. In this paper we consider such a cardinality-constrained
index tracking model. In particular, we propose an efficient nonmonotone
projected gradient (NPG) method for solving this problem. At each iteration,
this method usually solves several projected gradient subproblems. We show that
each subproblem has a closed-form solution, which can be computed in linear
time. Under some suitable assumptions, we establish that any accumulation point
of the sequence generated by the NPG method is a local minimizer of the
cardinality-constrained index tracking problem. We also conduct empirical tests
to compare our method with the hybrid evolutionary algorithm and the hybrid
half thresholding algorithm \cite{L1/2} for index tracking. The computational
results demonstrate that our approach generally produces sparse portfolios with
smaller out-of-sample tracking error and higher consistency between in-sample
and out-of-sample tracking errors. Moreover, our method outperforms the other
two approaches in terms of speed.
