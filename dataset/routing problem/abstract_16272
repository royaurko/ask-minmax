We describe a new method for imaging ultrafast dynamics in condensed matter
using inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS). We use the concepts of causality and
irreversibility to construct a general solution to the inverse scattering
problem (or "phase problem") for inelastic x-ray scattering, which enables
direct imaging of dynamics of the electron density with resolutions of ~1
attosecond (10-18 sec) in time and < 1 A in space. This method is not a Fourier
transform of IXS data, but a means to impose causality on the data and
reconstruct the charge propagator. The method can also be applied to inelastic
electron or neutron scattering. We give a general outline of phenomena that can
and cannot be studied with this technique, and provide an outlook for the
future.
