We give a classification of generic coadjoint orbits for the groups of
symplectomorphisms and Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of closed symplectic
surfaces. We also classify simple Morse functions on symplectic surfaces with
respect to actions of those groups. This gives an answer to V.Arnold's problem
on invariants of generic isovorticed fields for 2D ideal fluids.
