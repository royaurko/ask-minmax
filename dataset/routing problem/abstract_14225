A short review on selected issues related to the problem of neutrino
electromagnetic properties is given. After a flash look at the theoretical
basis of neutrino electromagnetic form factors, constraints on neutrino
magnetic moments and electric millicharge from terrestrial experiments and
astrophysical observations are discussed. We also focus on some recent studies
of the problem and on perspectives.
