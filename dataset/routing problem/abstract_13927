For the one-dimensional linear kinetic equation analytical solutions of
problems about temperature jump and weak evaporation (condensation) over flat
surface are received. The equation has integral of collisions BGK (Bhatnagar,
Gross and Krook) and constant frequency of collisions of molecules.
Distribution of concentration, mass speed and temperature is received.
