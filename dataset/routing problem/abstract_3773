In this paper, we study a cold-start problem in recommendation systems where
we have completely new users entered the systems. There is not any interaction
or feedback of the new users with the systems previoustly, thus no ratings are
available. Trivial approaches are to select ramdom items or the most popular
ones to recommend to the new users. However, these methods perform poorly in
many case. In this research, we provide a new look of this cold-start problem
in recommendation systems. In fact, we cast this cold-start problem as a
contextual-bandit problem. No additional information on new users and new items
is needed. We consider all the past ratings of previous users as contextual
information to be integrated into the recommendation framework. To solve this
type of the cold-start problems, we propose a new efficient method which is
based on the LinUCB algorithm for contextual-bandit problems. The experiments
were conducted on three different publicly-available data sets, namely
Movielens, Netflix and Yahoo!Music. The new proposed methods were also compared
with other state-of-the-art techniques. Experiments showed that our new method
significantly improves upon all these methods.
