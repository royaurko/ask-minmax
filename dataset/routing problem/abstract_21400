One important question for science and society is how to best promote
scientific progress. Inspired by the great success of Hilbert's famous set of
problems, the FuturICT project tries to stimulate and focus the efforts of many
scientists by formulating Grand Challenges, i.e. a set of fundamental, relevant
and hardly solvable scientific questions.
