The contributor solves two problems: formation of object of econophysics, creation
of the general theory of financial-economic monitoring. In the first problem he
studied two fundamental tasks: a choice of conceptual model and creation of
axiomatic base. It is accepted, that the conceptual model of econophysics is a
concrete definition of entropy conceptual model. Financial and economic
monitoring is considered as monitoring of flows on entropy manifold of phase
space - on a Diffusion field.
