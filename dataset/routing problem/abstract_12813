We give an overview on recent results concerning additive unit
representations. Furthermore the solutions of some open questions are included.
The central problem is whether and how certain rings are (additively) generated
by their units. This has been investigated for several types of rings related
to global fields, most importantly rings of algebraic integers. We also state
some open problems and conjectures which we consider to be important in this
field.
