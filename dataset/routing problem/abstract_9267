The "relating" entwines three problems:
  1. Davenport's Problem, describing pairs of polynomials over Q whose ranges
on Z/p are the same for almost all p.
  2. Showing that the monodromy groups of rational function maps over the
complexes are limited to a finite set of groups, outside of groups close to
alternating groups (example, symmetric groups) with special representations,
and dihedral and cyclic groups.
  3. Relating the genus 0 modular curves to the character group of the Monster
simple group, so-called Monstrous Moonshine.
