The lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) is a microscopically-inspired method
designed to solve macroscopic fluid dynamics problems. As a such, it lives at
the interface between the microscopic (molecular) and macroscopic (continuum)
worlds, hopefully capturing the best of the two. In this paper we shall discuss
whether or not, after almost a decade since its inception, LBE has lived up to
the initial expectations. Open problems and future research developments are
also briefly outlined.
