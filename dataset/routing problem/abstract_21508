The method of defensive forecasting is applied to the problem of prediction
with expert advice for binary outcomes. It turns out that defensive forecasting
is not only competitive with the Aggregating Algorithm but also handles the
case of "second-guessing" experts, whose advice depends on the learner's
prediction; this paper assumes that the dependence on the learner's prediction
is continuous.
