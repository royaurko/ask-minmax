Tight Bell inequalities are facets of Pitowsky's correlation polytope and are
usually obtained from its extreme points by solving the hull problem. Here we
present an alternative method based on a combination of algebraic results on
extensions of measures and variable elimination methods, e.g., the
Fourier-Motzkin method. Our method is shown to overcome some of the
computational difficulties associated with the hull problem in some non-trivial
cases. Moreover, it provides an explanation for the arising of only a finite
number of families of Bell inequalities in measurement scenarios where one
experimenter can choose between an arbitrary number of different measurements.
