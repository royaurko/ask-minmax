In this paper, we generalize the notions of perfect matchings, perfect
2-matchings to perfect k-matchings and give a necessary and sufficient
condition for existence of perfect k-matchings. For bipartite graphs, we show
that this k-matching problem is equivalent to that matching question. Moreover,
for regular graphs, we provide a sufficient condition of perfect k-matching in
terms of edge connectivity.
