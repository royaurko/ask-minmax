Integral transform approaches are numerous in many fields of physics, but in
most cases limited to the use of the Laplace kernel. However, it is well known
that the inversion of the Laplace transform is very problematic, so that the
function related to the physical observable is in most cases unaccessible. The
great advantage of kernels of bell-shaped form has been demonstrated in
few-body nuclear systems. In fact the use of the Lorentz kernel has allowed to
overcome the stumbling block of the ab initio description of reactions to the
full continuum of systems of more than three particles. The problem of finding
kernels of similar form, applicable to many-body problems deserves particular
attention. If this search were successful the integral transform approach might
represent the only viable ab initio access to many observables that are not
calculable directly.
