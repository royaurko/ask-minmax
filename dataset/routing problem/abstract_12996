A transfer matrix method is presented for solving the scattering problem for
the quasi one-dimensional massless Dirac equation applied to graphene in the
presence of an arbitrary inhomogeneous electric and perpendicular magnetic
field. It is shown that parabolic cylindrical functions, which have previously
been used in literature, become inaccurate at high incident energies and low
magnetic fields. A series expansion technique is presented to circumvent this
problem. An alternate method using asymptotic expressions is also discussed and
the relative merits of the two methods are compared.
