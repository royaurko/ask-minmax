Existence and uniqueness of the solution of the Neumann problem for the
Kohn-Laplacian on the Kor\'anyi ball of the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}_n$ are
discussed. Explicit representations of Green's type function (Neumann function)
for the half space and Kor\'anyi ball in $\mathbb{H}_n$ for circular functions
have been obtained. These functions are then used on above regions in
$\mathbb{H}_n$ to solve the inhomogeneous Neumann boundary value problem for
circular data.
