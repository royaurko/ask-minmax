We summarise research reported in (Efroimsky 2002, 2003; Efroimsky and
Goldreich 2003a,b) and develop its application to planetary equations in
non-inertial frames.
  We provide a practical example illustrating how the gauge formalism
considerably simplifies the calculation of satellite motion about an oblate
precessing planet.
