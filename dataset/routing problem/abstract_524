The growing amount of XML encoded data exchanged over the Internet increases
the importance of XML based publish-subscribe (pub-sub) and content based
routing systems. The input in such systems typically consists of a stream of
XML documents and a set of user subscriptions expressed as XML queries. The
pub-sub system then filters the published documents and passes them to the
subscribers. Pub-sub systems are characterized by very high input ratios,
therefore the processing time is critical. In this paper we propose a "pure
hardware" based solution, which utilizes XPath query blocks on FPGA to solve
the filtering problem. By utilizing the high throughput that an FPGA provides
for parallel processing, our approach achieves drastically better throughput
than the existing software or mixed (hardware/software) architectures. The
XPath queries (subscriptions) are translated to regular expressions which are
then mapped to FPGA devices. By introducing stacks within the FPGA we are able
to express and process a wide range of path queries very efficiently, on a
scalable environment. Moreover, the fact that the parser and the filter
processing are performed on the same FPGA chip, eliminates expensive
communication costs (that a multi-core system would need) thus enabling very
fast and efficient pipelining. Our experimental evaluation reveals more than
one order of magnitude improvement compared to traditional pub/sub systems.
