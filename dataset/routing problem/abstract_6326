Three inverse boundary value problems for the heat equations in one space
dimension are considered. Those three problems are: extracting an unknown
interface in a heat conductive material, an unknown boundary in a layered
material or a material with a smooth heat conductivity by employing a single
set of the temperature and heat flux on a known boundary as the observation
data. Some extraction formulae of those discontinuities which suggest a
relationship between the travel time of a {\it virtual} signal and the
observation data are given by applying the enclosure method to the problems.
