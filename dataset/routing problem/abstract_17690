Numerical homogenization, i.e. the finite-dimensional approximation of
solution spaces of PDEs with arbitrary rough coefficients, requires the
identification of accurate basis elements. These basis elements are oftentimes
found after a laborious process of scientific investigation and plain
guesswork. Can this identification problem be facilitated? Is there a general
recipe/decision framework for guiding the design of basis elements? We suggest
that the answer to the above questions could be positive based on the
reformulation of numerical homogenization as a Bayesian Inference problem in
which a given PDE with rough coefficients (or multi-scale operator) is excited
with noise (random right hand side/source term) and one tries to estimate the
value of the solution at a given point based on a finite number of
observations. We apply this reformulation to the identification of bases for
the numerical homogenization of arbitrary integro-differential equations and
show that these bases have optimal recovery properties. In particular we show
how Rough Polyharmonic Splines can be re-discovered as the optimal solution of
a Gaussian filtering problem.
