We show that the problem of solving recurrence relations for L-loop
(R+1)-point Feynman integrals within the method of integration by parts is
equivalent to the corresponding problem for (L+R)-loop vacuum or (L+R-1)-loop
propagator-type integrals. Using this property we solve recurrence relations
for two-loop massless vertex diagrams, with arbitrary numerators and integer
powers of propagators in the case when two legs are on the light cone, by
reducing the problem to the well-known solution of the corresponding recurrence
relations for massless three-loop propagator diagrams with specific boundary
conditions.
