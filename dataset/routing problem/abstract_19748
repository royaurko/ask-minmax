The scattering problems arising when considering the contribution of the
topologically inequivalent configurations of the spinors on
Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black holes to the Hawking radiation are correctly
stated. The corresponding $S$-matrices are described and presented in the form
convenient to numerical computations.
