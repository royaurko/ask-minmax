Efficient sampling from high-dimensional distributions is a challenging issue
which is encountered in many large data recovery problems involving Markov
chain Monte Carlo schemes. In this context, sampling using Hamiltonian dynamics
is one of the recent techniques that have been proposed to exploit the target
distribution geometry. Such schemes have clearly been shown to be efficient for
multi-dimensional sampling, but are rather adapted to the exponential families
of distributions with smooth energy function. In this paper, we address the
problem of using Hamiltonian dynamics to sample from probability distributions
having non-differentiable energy functions such as $\ell_1$. Such distributions
are being more and more used in sparse signal and image recovery applications.
The proposed technique uses a modified leapfrog transform involving a proximal
step. The resulting non-smooth Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (ns-HMC) method is
tested and validated on a number of experiments. Results show its ability to
accurately sample according to various multivariate target distributions. The
proposed technique is illustrated on synthetic examples and is applied to an
image denoising problem.
