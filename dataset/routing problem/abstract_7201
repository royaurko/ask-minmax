In this paper we consider the variable inequality problem, that is, to find a
solution of the inclusion given by the sum of a function and a point-to-cone
application. This problem can be seen as a generalization of the classical
system inequality problem taking a variable order structure. Exploiting this
special structure, we propose two variants of the subgradient algorithm for
solving a system of variable inequalities. The convergence analysis is given
under convex-like conditions which, when the point-to-cone application is
constant, contains the old subgradient schemes.
