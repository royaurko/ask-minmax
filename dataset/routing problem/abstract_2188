The use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for emergency navigation systems
suffer disadvantages such as limited computing capacity, restricted battery
power and high likelihood of malfunction due to the harsh physical environment.
By making use of the powerful sensing ability of smart phones, this paper
presents a cloud-enabled emergency navigation framework to guide evacuees in a
coordinated manner and improve the reliability and resilience in both
communication and localization. By using social potential fields (SPF),
evacuees form clusters during an evacuation process and are directed to
egresses with the aid of a Cognitive Packet Networks (CPN) based algorithm.
Rather than just rely on the conventional telecommunications infrastructures,
we suggest an Ad hoc Cognitive Packet Network (AHCPN) based protocol to prolong
the life time of smart phones, that adaptively searches optimal communication
routes between portable devices and the egress node that provides access to a
cloud server with respect to the remaining battery power of smart phones and
the time latency.
