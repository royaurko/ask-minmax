The behavior of a charged massive Dirac field on a Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS
black hole background is investigated. The essential self-adjointness of the
Dirac Hamiltonian is studied. Then, an analysis of the discharge problem is
carried out in analogy with the standard Reissner-Nordstrom black hole case.
