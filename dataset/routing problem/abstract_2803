Carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene have proved to be
efficient building blocks for active optoelectronic devices. Especially, the
exotic properties of crystalline graphene, such as a linear/gapless energy
dispersion, offer a generic route to the development of active photonic
modulator at the infrared (IR) and terahertz (THz) regime with large modulation
depth. Here, we show that graphene oxide (GO), an oxygenated derivative of
graphene with randomly distributed molecular defects (e.g., adsorbed water
molecules and punched holes), can provide a different way to effectively
control broadband THz transmission amplitude, when incorporated into
two-terminal electrode devices. Electrically trapped charge carriers within
localized impurity states (LIS) of GO, which originate from fully randomized
defective structure of GO, results in a large modulation of transmission
amplitude (~30%) for broadband THz waves (0.3 ~ 2.0 THz) even at room
temperature. Interesting hysteretic behavior observed in the control of
broadband THz transmission further confirms the key role of trapped charge
carriers in switching of broadband THz waves. The device architecture
constructed by simple solution printing of GO onto the two-terminal electrode
enables easy-to-implement active photonic devices.
