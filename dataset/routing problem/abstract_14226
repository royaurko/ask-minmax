In this paper we address the uniqueness issue in the classical Robin inverse
problem on a Lipschitz domain $\Omega\subset\RR^n$, with $L^\infty$ Robin
coefficient, $L^2$ Neumann data and isotropic conductivity of class
$W^{1,r}(\Omega)$, $r\textgreater{}n$. We show that uniqueness of the Robin
coefficient on a subpart of the boundary given Cauchy data on the complementary
part, does hold in dimension $n=2$ but needs not hold in higher dimension. We
also raise on open issue on harmonic gradients which is of interest in this
context.
