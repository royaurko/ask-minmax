We consider the problems of finding a maximum clique in a graph and finding a
maximum-edge biclique in a bipartite graph. Both problems are NP-hard. We write
both problems as matrix-rank minimization and then relax them using the nuclear
norm. This technique, which may be regarded as a generalization of compressive
sensing, has recently been shown to be an effective way to solve rank
optimization problems. In the special cases that the input graph has a planted
clique or biclique (i.e., a single large clique or biclique plus diversionary
edges), our algorithm successfully provides an exact solution to the original
instance. For each problem, we provide two analyses of when our algorithm
succeeds. In the first analysis, the diversionary edges are placed by an
adversary. In the second, they are placed at random. In the case of random
edges for the planted clique problem, we obtain the same bound as Alon,
Krivelevich and Sudakov as well as Feige and Krauthgamer, but we use different
techniques.
