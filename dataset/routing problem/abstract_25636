We investigate an additive perturbation of a complex Wishart random matrix
and prove that a large deviation principle holds for the spectral measures. The
rate function is associated to a vector equilibrium problem coming from
logarithmic potential theory, which in our case is a quadratic map involving
the logarithmic energies, or Voiculescu's entropies, of two measures in the
presence of an external field and an upper constraint. The proof is based on a
two type particles Coulomb gas representation for the eigenvalue distribution,
which gives a new insight on why such variational problems should describe the
limiting spectral distribution. This representation is available because of a
Nikishin structure satisfied by the weights of the multiple orthogonal
polynomials hidden in the background.
