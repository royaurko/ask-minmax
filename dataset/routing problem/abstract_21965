We show that any open orientable surface S can be properly embedded in H^2xR
as an area minimizing surface. We obtained this result by proving a bridge
principle at infinity for H^2xR for vertical bridges in the asymptotic
boundary. Furthermore, we studied the asymptotic Plateau problem in H^2xR, and
gave a fairly complete solution.
