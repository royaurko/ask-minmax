This document is an exposition of an assortment of open problems arising from
the exact enumeration of (perfect) matchings of finite graphs. Roughly half
have been solved at the time of this writing; see the document "Twenty Open
Problems in Enumeration of Matchings: Progress Report" (also available from
this server as math.CO/9801061). NOTE: This article has now been superseded by
