The mathematical theory of super-resolution developed recently by Cand\`{e}s
and Fernandes-Granda states that a continuous, sparse frequency spectrum can be
recovered with infinite precision via a (convex) atomic norm technique given a
set of regularly spaced time-space samples. This theory was then extended to
the cases with partial/compressive samples and/or multiple measurement vectors
via atomic norm minimization (ANM), known as off-grid/continuous compressed
sensing. However, a major problem of existing atomic norm methods is that the
frequencies can be recovered only if they are sufficiently separated,
prohibiting commonly known high resolution. In this paper, a novel nonconvex
optimization method is proposed which guarantees exact recovery under no
resolution limit and hence achieves high resolution. A locally convergent
iterative algorithm is implemented to solve the nonconvex problem. The
algorithm iteratively carries out ANM with a sound reweighting strategy which
enhances sparsity and resolution, and is termed as reweighted atomic-norm
minimization (RAM). Extensive numerical simulations are carried out to
demonstrate the performance of the proposed method with application to
direction of arrival (DOA) estimation.
