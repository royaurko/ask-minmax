We propose a simple but interesting graph theoretic problem and posited a
heuristic solution procedure, which we have christened as Vectored Route-length
Minimization Search (VeRMinS). Basically, it constitutes of a re-casting of the
classical 'shortest route' problem within a strictly Euclidean space. We have
only presented a heuristic solution process with the hope that a formal proof
will eventually emerge as the problem receives wider exposure within
mathematical circles.
