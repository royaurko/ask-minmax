The study of Mobile Ad-hoc Network remains attractive due to the desire to
achieve better performance and scalability. MANETs are distributed systems
consisting of mobile hosts that are connected by multi-hop wireless links. Such
systems are self organized and facilitate communication in the network without
any centralized administration. MANETs exhibit battery power constraint and
suffer scalability issues therefore cluster formation is expensive. This is due
to the large number of messages passed during the process of cluster formation.
Clustering has evolved as an imperative research domain that enhances system
performance such as throughput and delay in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) in
the presence of both mobility and a large number of mobile terminals.In this
thesis, we present a clustering scheme that minimizes message overhead and
congestion for cluster formation and maintenance. The algorithm is devised to
be independent of the MANET Routing algorithm. Depending upon the context, the
clustering algorithm may be implemented in the routing or in higher layers. The
dynamic formation of clusters helps reduce data packet overhead, node
complexity and power consumption, The simulation has been performed in ns-2.
The simulation shows that the number of clusters formed is in proportion with
the number of nodes in MANET.
