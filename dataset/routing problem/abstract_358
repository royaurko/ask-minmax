We report that asymmetrically interacting ensembles of oscillators (AIEOs)
follow novel routes to synchrony. These routes seem to be a characteristic
feature of coupling asymmetry. We show that they are unaffected by white noise
except that the entrainment frequencies are shifted. The probability of
occurrence of the routes is determined by phase asymmetry. The identification
of these phenomena offers new insight into synchrony between oscillator
ensembles and suggest new ways in which it may be controlled.
