We give a simple topological argument to show that the number of solutions of
the asymptotic Plateau problem in hyperbolic space is generically unique. In
particular, we show that the space of codimension-1 closed submanifolds of
sphere at infinity, which bounds a unique absolutely area minimizing
hypersurface in hyperbolic n-space, is dense in the space of all codimension-1
closed submanifolds at infinity. In dimension 3, we also prove that the set of
uniqueness curves in asymptotic sphere for area minimizing planes is generic in
the set of Jordan curves at infinity. We also give some nonuniqueness results
for dimension 3, too.
