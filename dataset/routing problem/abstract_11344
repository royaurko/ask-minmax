As is well known, electroweak breaking in the MSSM requires substantial
fine-tuning. We explain why this fine tuning problem is abnormally acute, and
this allows to envisage possible solutions to this undesirable situation.
Following these ideas, we review some recent work which shows how in models
with SUSY broken at a low scale (not far from the TeV) this fine-tuning can be
dramatically reduced or even absent.
