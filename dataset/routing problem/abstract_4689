Boundary value problems on the unit sphere arise naturally in geophysics and
oceanography when scientists model a physical quantity on large scales. Robust
numerical methods play an important role in solving these problems. In this
article, we construct numerical solutions to a boundary value problem defined
on a spherical sub-domain (with a sufficiently smooth boundary) using radial
basis functions (RBF). The error analysis between the exact solution and the
approximation is provided. Numerical experiments are presented to confirm
theoretical estimates.
