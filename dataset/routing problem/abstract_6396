A popular problem asks for the equilibrium separation between two identical
(mutually repelling) charges suspended by strings fastened to a common point.
We slightly modify this problem by considering two opposite (mutually
attracting) charges and adding a finite separation between the suspension
points. The discussion leading to the solution introduces important physical
phenomena including "catastrophic" behavior and hysterisis.
