Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) are considered as a new paradigm of
infrastructure-less mobile wireless communication systems. MANETs are being
widely studied and it is the technology that is attracting a large variety of
applications. Routing in MANETs is considered a challenging task due to the
unpredictable changes in the network topology, resulting from the random and
frequent movement of the nodes and due to the absence of any centralized
control [1][2]. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of reactive routing
protocols, Ad hoc On demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing
(DSR) and proactive routing protocol Destination Sequenced Distance Vector
(DSDV). The major goal of this study is to analyze the performance of well
known MANETs routing protocol in high mobility case under low, medium and high
density scenario. Unlike military applications, most of the other applications
of MANETs require moderate to high mobility. Hence it becomes important to
study the impact of high mobility on the performance of these routing
protocols. The performance is analyzed with respect to Average End-to-End
Delay, Normalized Routing Load (NRL), Packet Delivery Fraction (PDF) and
Throughput. Simulation results verify that AODV gives better performance as
compared to DSR and DSDV.
