For a certain class of compact oriented 3-manifolds, M. Goussarov and K.
Habiro have conjectured that the information carried by finite-type invariants
should be characterized in terms of ``cut-and-paste'' operations defined by the
lower central series of the Torelli group of a surface.
  In this paper, we observe that this is a variation of a classical problem in
group theory, namely the ``dimension subgroup problem.'' This viewpoint allows
us to prove, by purely algebraic methods, an analogue of the Goussarov-Habiro
conjecture for finite-type invariants with values in a fixed field. We deduce
that their original conjecture is true at least in a weaker form.
