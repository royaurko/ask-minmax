We prove an upper bound for the convergence rate of the homogenization limit
$\epsilon\to 0$ for a linear transmission problem for a
advection-diffusion(-reaction) system posed in areas with low and high
diffusivity, where $\epsilon$ is a suitable scale parameter. On this way, we
justify the formal homogenization asymptotics obtained by us earlier by proving
an upper bound for the convergence rate (a corrector estimate). The main
ingredients of the proof of the corrector estimate include integral estimates
for rapidly oscillating functions with prescribed average, properties of the
macroscopic reconstruction operators, energy bounds and extra two-scale
regularity estimates. The whole procedure essentially relies on a good
understanding of the analysis of the limit two-scale problem.
