In this paper, we perform an empirical evaluation of the Parallel External
Memory (PEM) model in the context of geometric problems. In particular, we
implement the parallel distribution sweeping framework of Ajwani, Sitchinava
and Zeh to solve batched 1-dimensional stabbing max problem. While modern
processors consist of sophisticated memory systems (multiple levels of caches,
set associativity, TLB, prefetching), we empirically show that algorithms
designed in simple models, that focus on minimizing the I/O transfers between
shared memory and single level cache, can lead to efficient software on current
multicore architectures. Our implementation exhibits significantly fewer
accesses to slow DRAM and, therefore, outperforms traditional approaches based
on plane sweep and two-way divide and conquer.
