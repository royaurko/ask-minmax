Let C be a depth-3 circuit with n variables, degree d and top fanin k (called
sps(k,d,n) circuits) over base field F. It is a major open problem to design a
deterministic polynomial time blackbox algorithm that tests if C is identically
zero. Klivans & Spielman (STOC 2001) observed that the problem is open even
when k is a constant. This case has been subjected to a serious study over the
past few years, starting from the work of Dvir & Shpilka (STOC 2005).
  We give the first polynomial time blackbox algorithm for this problem. Our
algorithm runs in time poly(nd^k), regardless of the base field. The only field
for which polynomial time algorithms were previously known is F=Q (Kayal &
Saraf, FOCS 2009, and Saxena & Seshadhri, FOCS 2010). This is the first
blackbox algorithm for depth-3 circuits that does not use the rank based
approaches of Karnin & Shpilka (CCC 2008).
  We prove an important tool for the study of depth-3 identities. We design a
blackbox polynomial time transformation that reduces the number of variables in
a sps(k,d,n) circuit to k variables, but preserves the identity structure.
