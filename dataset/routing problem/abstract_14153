This paper focuses on the acousto-electromagnetic tomography, a recently
introduced hybrid imaging technique. In a previous work, the reconstruction of
the electric permittivity of the medium from internal data was achieved under
the Born approximation assumption. In this work, we tackle the general problem
by a Landweber iteration algorithm. The convergence of such scheme is
guaranteed with the use of a multiple frequency approach, that ensures
uniqueness and stability for the corresponding linearized inverse problem.
Numerical simulations are presented.
