We consider the boundary problem -y''(x)+q(x)y(x)=f(x),
lim_{|x|\to\infty}y^{(i)}(x)=0, i=0,1, where f(x)\in L_p(R), p\in[1,\infty],
1\le q(x)\in L_1^{\loc}(R). For this boundary problem we obtain: 1) necessary
and sufficient conditions for unique solvability and a priori properties of the
solution; 2) a criterion for the resolvent to be compact in L_p(R), and some a
priori properties of the spectrum.
