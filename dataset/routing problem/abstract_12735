There are several fundamental differences between four-dimensional and
higher-dimensional gravitational waves, namely in the so called braneworld
set-up. One of them is their asymptotic behavior within the Cauchy problem.
This study is connected with the so called Hadamard problem, which aims at the
question of Huygens principle validity. We investigate the effect of braneworld
scenarios on the character of propagation of gravitational waves on FRW
background.
