We propose an authentication scheme where forgery (a.k.a. impersonation)
seems infeasible without finding the prover's long-term private key. The latter
would follow from solving the conjugacy search problem in the platform
(noncommutative) semigroup, i.e., to recovering X from X^{-1}AX and A. The
platform semigroup that we suggest here is the semigroup of nxn matrices over
truncated multivariable polynomials over a ring.
