Richard Stanely proposed, in a recent Amer. Math. Monthly Problem, to prove a
nice explicit formula for the generating function for the number of n-letter
words in {H,T} that have as many occurrences of HT as HH. In this article, we
show how to prove this problem automatically, and ANY problem of that type,
regardless of the size of the alphabet and the length of the two chosen strings
