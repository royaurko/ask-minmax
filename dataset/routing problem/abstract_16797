We present a new, practical algorithm to test whether a knot complement
contains a closed essential surface. This property has important theoretical
and algorithmic consequences; however, systematically testing it has until now
been infeasibly slow, and current techniques only apply to specific families of
knots. As a testament to its practicality, we run the algorithm over a
comprehensive body of 2979 knots, including the two 20-crossing dodecahedral
knots, yielding results that were not previously known.
  The algorithm derives from the original Jaco-Oertel framework, involves both
enumeration and optimisation procedures, and combines several techniques from
normal surface theory. This represents substantial progress in the practical
implementation of normal surface theory, in that we can systematically solve a
theoretically double exponential-time problem for significant inputs. Our
methods are relevant for other difficult computational problems in 3-manifold
theory, ranging from testing for Haken-ness to the recognition problem for
knots, links and 3-manifolds.
