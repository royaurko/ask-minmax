We study the problem of minimal resistance for a body moving with constant
velocity in a rarefied medium of chaotically moving point particles, in
Euclidean space R^d. The particles distribution over velocities is radially
symmetric. Under some additional assumptions on the distribution function, the
complete classification of bodies of least resistance is made. In the case of
three and more dimensions there are two kinds of solutions: a body similar to
the solution of classical Newton's problem and a union of two such bodies
``glued together'' by rear parts of their surfaces. In the two-dimensional case
there are solutions of five different types: (a) a trapezium; (b) an isosceles
triangle; (c) the union of a triangle and a trapezium with common base; (d) the
union of two isosceles triangles with common base; (e) the union of two
triangles and a trapezium. The cases (a)--(d) are realized for any distribution
of particles over velocities, and the case (e) is only realized for some
distributions. Two limit cases are considered, where the average velocity of
particles is big and where it is small as compared to the body's velocity.
Finally, using the obtained analytical results, we study numerically a
particular case: the problem of body's motion in a rarefied homogeneous
monatomic ideal gas of positive temperature in R^2 and in R^3.
