In this paper, we discuss the Cauchy Problem for the compressible isentropic
Euler-Boltzmann equations with vacuum in radiation hydrodynamics. Firstly, we
establish the local existence of regular solutions by the fundamental methods
in the theory of quasi-linear symmetric hyperbolic systems under some physical
assumptions. Then we give the non-global existence of regular solutions caused
by the effect of vacuum for $1<\gamma\leq 3$. Finally, we extend our result to
the initial-boundary value problem under some suitable boundary conditions.
These blow-up results tell us that the radiation cannot prevent the formation
of singularities caused by the appearance of vacuum.
