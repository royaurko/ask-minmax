We discuss a classical mistake, made in earlier publications on the stick
percolation problem in 3D, for generating the right isotropic configuration of
sticks. We explain the observed systematic deviations from the excluded volume
rule. New MC simulations considered by us confirm nicely the applicability of
the excluded volume theory.
