We prove that, for large $n$, every $3$-connected $D$-regular graph on $n$
vertices with $D \geq n/4$ is Hamiltonian. This is best possible and confirms a
conjecture posed independently by Bollob\'as and H\"aggkvist in the 1970s. The
proof builds on a structural decomposition result proved recently by the same
contributors.
