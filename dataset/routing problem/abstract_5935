This article considers nonlocal heat flows into a singular target space. The
problem is the parabolic analogue of a stationary problem that arises as the
limit of a singularly perturbed elliptic system. It also provides a gradient
flow approach to an optimal eigenvalue partition problem that, in light of the
work of Caffarelli and Lin, is equivalent to a constrained harmonic mapping
problem. In particular, we show that weak solutions of our heat equation
converge as time approaches infinity to stationary solutions of this mapping
problem. For these weak solutions, we also prove Lipschitz continuity and
regularity of free interfaces, making use of a parabolic Almgren-type
monotonicity formula.
