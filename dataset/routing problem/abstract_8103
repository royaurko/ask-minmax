In this paper, we explain social information retrieval (SIR) and
collaborative information retrieval (CIR). We see SIR as a way of knowing who
to collaborate with in resolving an information problem while CIR entails the
process of mutual understanding and solving of an information problem among
collaborators. We are interested in the transition from SIR to CIR hence we
developed a communication model to facilitate knowledge sharing during CIR.
