In this paper, we present a new routing paradigm that generalizes
opportunistic routing in wireless mesh networks. In multirate anypath routing,
each node uses both a set of next hops and a selected transmission rate to
reach a destination. Using this rate, a packet is broadcast to the nodes in the
set and one of them forwards the packet on to the destination. To date, there
is no theory capable of jointly optimizing both the set of next hops and the
transmission rate used by each node. We bridge this gap by introducing a
polynomial-time algorithm to this problem and provide the proof of its
optimality. The proposed algorithm runs in the same running time as regular
shortest-path algorithms and is therefore suitable for deployment in link-state
routing protocols. We conducted experiments in a 802.11b testbed network, and
our results show that multirate anypath routing performs on average 80% and up
to 6.4 times better than anypath routing with a fixed rate of 11 Mbps. If the
rate is fixed at 1 Mbps instead, performance improves by up to one order of
magnitude.
