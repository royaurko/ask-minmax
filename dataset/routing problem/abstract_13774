We reduce to various absolute parallelisms, namely to certain {e}-structures
on manifolds of dimensions 7, 6, 5, the biholomorphic equivalence problem or
the intrinsic CR equivalence problem for generic submanifolds M^5 in C^4 of CR
dimension 1 and of codimension 3 that are maximally minimal and are
geometry-preserving deformations of one natural cubic model of Beloshapka,
somewhere else called the General Class III-1 of 5-dimensional CR manifolds.
Some inspiration links exist with the treatment of the General Class II
previously done in 2007 by Beloshapka, Ezhov, Schmalz, and also with the
classification of nilpotent Lie algebras due to Goze, Khakimdjanov, Remm.
