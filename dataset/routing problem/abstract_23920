Several semianalytical approaches are now available for describing
diffraction of a plane wave by the 2D (two dimensional) traction free isotropic
elastic wedge. In this paper we follow Budaev and Bogy who reformulated the
original diffraction problem as a singular integral one. This comprises two
algebraic and two singular integral equations. Each integral equation involves
two unknowns, a function and a constant. We discuss the underlying integral
operators and develop a new semianalytical scheme for solving the integral
equations. We investigate the properties of the obtained solution and argue
that it is the solution of the original diffraction problem. We describe a
comprehensive code verification and validation programme.
