In this paper, we give a possible solution to the cosmological constant
problem. It is shown hat the traditional approach, based on volume weighting of
probabilities, leads to an incoherent onclusion: the probability that a
randomly chosen observer measures $\Lambda=0$ is exactly equal to 1. Using an
alternative, volume averaging measure, instead of volume weighting can explain
why the osmological constant is non-zero.
