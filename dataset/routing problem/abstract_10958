In this paper, we present an algorithm for the solution of the von Karman
equations of elasticity theory and related problems. Our method of successive
reconditioning is able to avoid convergence problems at any ratio of the
nonlinear streching and the pure bending energies. We illustrate the power of
the method by numerical calculations of pinched or compressed plates subject to
fixed boundaries.
