In the orbitally degenerate ($J=5/2$) Periodic Anderson Model, the magnetic
susceptibility is composed of both the Pauli term and the Van Vleck term, as is
well known. The former is strongly enhanced by the strong correlation between
$f$-electrons. But, for the latter, the influence of the strong correlation has
been obscure for years. In this paper we give the solution of the longstanding
problem. With the aid of the $d=\infty$ approximation, we study this problem on
the basis of the Fermi liquid theory with degenerate orbitals, taking account
of all the vertex corrections in a consistent way. As a result, we obtain the
simple expression for the magnetic susceptibility, and show unambiguously that
the Van Vleck term is also highly enhanced} in the strong correlation regime.
This fact explains naturally the enhanced magnetic susceptibility observed in
many insulating systems (i.e., Kondo insulator). Moreover, we show that the
Wilson ratio takes a value around 1 in the metallic system, in good agreement
with experiments.
