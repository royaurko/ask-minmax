In this paper defuzzification method of WABL is investigated, its properties
are analyzed. The WABL method is applied to some fuzzy models. The package of
applied programs is worked out on the base of proposed algorithms. The obtained
in the form of visual- interactive graphs results are compared with knows ones.
