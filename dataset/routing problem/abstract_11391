The exchange operator formalism previously introduced for the Calogero
problem is extended to the three-body Calogero-Marchioro-Wolfes one. In the
absence of oscillator potential, the Hamiltonian of the latter is interpreted
as a free particle Hamiltonian, expressed in terms of generalized momenta. In
the presence of oscillator potential, it is regarded as a free modified boson
Hamiltonian. The modified boson operators are shown to belong to a
$D_6$-extended Heisenberg algebra. A proof of complete integrability is also
provided.
