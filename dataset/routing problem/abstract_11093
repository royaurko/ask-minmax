We give a brief review of the Kondo effect and exactly solve the
nonequilibrium Kondo problem at the special point in the parameter space of the
model with spin-dependent chemical potentials. Using the obtained solution, we
compute several experimentally observable quantities: charge current, spin
current and magnetic properties. Applications to the physically important cases
such as the case where the impurity spin is placed in between two
ferromagnetically polarized leads are discussed.
