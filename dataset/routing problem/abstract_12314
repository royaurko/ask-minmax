We study general mathematical framework for variation of potential energy
with respect to domain deformation. It enables rigorous derivation of the
integral formulas for the energy release rate in crack problems. Applying a
technique of the shape sensitivity analysis, we formulate the shape derivative
of potential energy as a variational problem with a parameter. Key tools of our
abstract theory are a new parameter variational principle and the classical
implicit function theorem in Banach spaces.
