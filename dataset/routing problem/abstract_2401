Detection of symmetry is vital to problem solving. Most of the problems of
computer vision and computer graphics and machine intelligence in general, can
be reduced to symmetry detection problem. Unstructured search problem can also
be looked upon from symmetry detection point of view. Unstructured search can
be thought as searching a binary string satisfying some search condition in an
unsorted list of binary strings. In this paper unstructured search problem is
reduced to function bilateral symmetry detection problem with polynomial
overhead in terms of the size of the input.
