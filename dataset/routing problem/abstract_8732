The linear programming (LP) bound of Delsarte can be applied to several
problems in various branches of mathematics. We describe a general Fourier
analytic method to get a slight improvement on this bound. We then apply our
method to the problem of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) to prove that the
Fourier family $F(a,b)$ in dimension 6 cannot be extended to a full system of
MUBs.
