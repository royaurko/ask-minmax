We propose that constructing a molecule super-lattice on a superconducting
ultrathin film is a promising way to manipulate superconductivity in
experiment. We theoretically study superconductivity in a molecule graphene
system, which is built by fabricating a hexagonal molecule super-lattice on
2-dimensional electron gas. The super-lattice potential dramatically changes
the electron density of states, which oscillates as function of the energy. We
show that such a molecular graphene may increase superconducting gap by a few
times, which may open a new route to realize high temperature
superconductivity.
