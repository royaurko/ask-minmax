We study the Subnormal Completion Problem (SCP) for 2-variable weighted
shifts. We use tools and techniques from the theory of truncated moment
problems to give a general strategy to solve SCP. We then show that when all
quadratic moments are known (equivalently, when the initial segment of weights
consists of five independent data points), the natural necessary conditions for
the existence of a subnormal completion are also sufficient. To calculate
explicitly the associated Berger measure, we compute the algebraic variety of
the associated truncated moment problem; it turns out that this algebraic
variety is precisely the support of the Berger measure of the subnormal
completion.
