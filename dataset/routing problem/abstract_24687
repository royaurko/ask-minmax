We present and discuss a mixed conjunctive and disjunctive rule, a
generalization of conflict repartition rules, and a combination of these two
rules. In the belief functions theory one of the major problem is the conflict
repartition enlightened by the famous Zadeh's example. To date, many
combination rules have been proposed in order to solve a solution to this
problem. Moreover, it can be important to consider the specificity of the
responses of the experts. Since few year some unification rules are proposed.
We have shown in our previous works the interest of the proportional conflict
redistribution rule. We propose here a mixed combination rule following the
proportional conflict redistribution rule modified by a discounting procedure.
This rule generalizes many combination rules.
