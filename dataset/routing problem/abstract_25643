A central problem in data integration and data cleansing is to find entities
in different data sources that describe the same real-world object. Many
existing methods for identifying such entities rely on explicit linkage rules
which specify the conditions that entities must fulfill in order to be
considered to describe the same real-world object. In this paper, we present
the GenLink algorithm for learning expressive linkage rules from a set of
existing reference links using genetic programming. The algorithm is capable of
generating linkage rules which select discriminative properties for comparison,
apply chains of data transformations to normalize property values, choose
appropriate distance measures and thresholds and combine the results of
multiple comparisons using non-linear aggregation functions. Our experiments
show that the GenLink algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art genetic
programming approach to learning linkage rules recently presented by Carvalho
et. al. and is capable of learning linkage rules which achieve a similar
accuracy as human written rules for the same problem.
