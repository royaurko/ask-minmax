We show that there is an intimate connection between the theory of
nonparametric (smoothed) maximum likelihood estimators for certain inverse
problems and integral equations. This is illustrated by estimators for interval
censoring and deconvolution problems. We also discuss the asymptotic efficiency
of the MLE for smooth functionals in these models.
