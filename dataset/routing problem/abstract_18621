To clarify the relation of energy shifts to scattering phase shifts in
one-body and many-body problems, we examine their relation in a number of
different situations. We derive, for a particle in a container of arbitrary
shape with a short-range scattering center, a general result for the energy
eigenvalues in terms of the s-wave scattering phase shift and the eigenstates
in the absence of the scatterer. We show that, while the energy shifts for a
spherical container are proportional to the phase shift over large ranges,
those for a cubic container have a more complicated behavior. We connect our
result to the description of energy shifts in terms of the scattering T-matrix.
The general relation is extended to problems of particles in traps with
smoothly varying potentials, including, e.g., the interaction of a small
neutral atom with a Rydberg atom. We then consider the many-body problem for
particles with a two-body interaction and show that the free energy change due
to the interaction is proportional to an average of a generalized phase shift
that includes the effects of the medium. Finally, we discuss why, even though
individual energy levels are very sensitive to boundary conditions, the energy
of a many-body system is not.
