We propose a globally convergent alternating minimization (AM) algorithm for
image reconstruction in transmission tomography, which extends automatic
relevance determination (ARD) to Poisson noise models with Beer's law. The
algorithm promotes solutions that are sparse in the pixel/voxel-differences
domain by introducing additional latent variables, one for each pixel/voxel,
and then learning these variables from the data using a hierarchical Bayesian
model. Importantly, the proposed AM algorithm is free of any tuning parameters
with image quality comparable to standard penalized likelihood methods. Our
algorithm exploits optimization transfer principles which reduce the problem
into parallel 1D optimization tasks (one for each pixel/voxel), making the
algorithm feasible for large-scale problems. This approach considerably reduces
the computational bottleneck of ARD associated with the posterior variances.
Positivity constraints inherent in transmission tomography problems are also
enforced. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm for x-ray
computed tomography using synthetic and real-world datasets. The algorithm is
shown to have much better performance than prior ARD algorithms based on
approximate Gaussian noise models, even for high photon flux.
