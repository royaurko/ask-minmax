In quasi-exactly solvable problems partial analytic solution (energy spectrum
and associated wavefunctions) are obtained if some potential parameters are
assigned specific values. We introduce a new class in which exact solutions are
obtained at a given energy for a special set of values of the potential
parameters. To obtain a larger solution space one varies the energy over a
discrete set (the spectrum). A unified treatment that includes the standard as
well as the new class of quasi-exactly solvable problems is presented and few
examples (some of which are new) are given. The solution space is spanned by
discrete square integrable basis functions in which the matrix representation
of the Hamiltonian is tridiagonal. Imposing quasi-exact solvability constraints
result in a complete reduction of the representation into the direct sum of a
finite and infinite component. The finite is real and exactly solvable, whereas
the infinite is complex and associated with zero norm states. Consequently, the
whole physical space contracts to a finite dimensional subspace with
normalizable states.
