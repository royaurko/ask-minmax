We are interested in solving the multiple measurement vector (MMV) problem
for instances, where the underlying sparsity pattern exhibit spatio-temporal
structure motivated by the electroencephalogram (EEG) source localization
problem. We propose a probabilistic model that takes this structure into
account by generalizing the structured spike and slab prior and the associated
Expectation Propagation inference scheme. Based on numerical experiments, we
demonstrate the viability of the model and the approximate inference scheme.
