Motivated by multipath routing, we introduce a multi-connected variant of
spanners. For that purpose we introduce the $p$-multipath cost between two
nodes $u$ and $v$ as the minimum weight of a collection of $p$ internally
vertex-disjoint paths between $u$ and $v$. Given a weighted graph $G$, a
subgraph $H$ is a $p$-multipath $s$-spanner if for all $u,v$, the $p$-multipath
cost between $u$ and $v$ in $H$ is at most $s$ times the $p$-multipath cost in
$G$. The $s$ factor is called the stretch. Building upon recent results on
fault-tolerant spanners, we show how to build $p$-multipath spanners of
constant stretch and of $\tO(n^{1+1/k})$ edges, for fixed parameters $p$ and
$k$, $n$ being the number of nodes of the graph. Such spanners can be
constructed by a distributed algorithm running in $O(k)$ rounds. Additionally,
we give an improved construction for the case $p=k=2$. Our spanner $H$ has
$O(n^{3/2})$ edges and the $p$-multipath cost in $H$ between any two node is at
most twice the corresponding one in $G$ plus $O(W)$, $W$ being the maximum edge
weight.
