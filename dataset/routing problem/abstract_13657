This paper concerns the quantitative step of the medical imaging modality
Thermo-acoustic Tomography (TAT). We model the radiation propagation by a
system of Maxwell's equations. We show that the index of refraction of light
and the absorption coefficient (conductivity) can be uniquely and stably
reconstructed from a sufficiently large number of TAT measurements. Our method
is based on verifying that the linearization of the inverse problem forms a
redundant elliptic system of equations. We also observe that the
reconstructions are qualitatively quite different from the setting where
radiation is modeled by a scalar Helmholtz equation as in [10].
