In this paper we consider an inverse problem for determining time - dependent
heat conduction coefficient which vanishes at initial moment as a power $
t^{\beta}. $ The case of strong degeneration ($ \beta \ge1$) is studied.
  To prove the existence of solution we employ the Schauder fixed point
theorem. The uniqueness of the solution is established too.
