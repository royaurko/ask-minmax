This work studies nonnegative solutions for the Cauchy, Neumann, and
Dirichlet problems of a logistic type reaction-diffusion equation. The finite
time blowup results for nonnegative solutions under various restrictions on the
coefficients of this equation are presented. Applying the results allows one to
construct some reaction diffusion systems with the so-called diffusion-induced
blowup phenomenon, particularly in the case of equal diffusion rates.
