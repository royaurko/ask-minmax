For certain hierarchical structures, one can study the percolation problem
using the renormalization-group method in a very precise way. We show that the
idea can be also applied to two-dimensional planar lattices by regarding them
as hierarchical structures. Either a lower bound or an exact critical
probability can be obtained with this method and the correlation-length
critical exponent is approximately estimated as $\nu \approx 1$.
