Healthcare applications are well thought-out as interesting fields for WSN
where patients can be examine using wireless medical sensor networks. Inside
the hospital or extensive care surroundings there is a tempting need for steady
monitoring of essential body functions and support for patient mobility. Recent
research cantered on patient reliable communication, mobility, and
energy-efficient routing. Yet deploying new expertise in healthcare
applications presents some understandable security concerns which are the
important concern in the inclusive deployment of wireless patient monitoring
systems. This manuscript presents a survey of the security features, its
counter attacks in healthcare applications including some proposed projects
which have been done recently.
