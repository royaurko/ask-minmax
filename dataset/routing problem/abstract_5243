The problem of recovering a low-rank matrix from a set of observations
corrupted with gross sparse error is known as the robust principal component
analysis (RPCA) and has many applications in computer vision, image processing
and web data ranking. It has been shown that under certain conditions, the
solution to the NP-hard RPCA problem can be obtained by solving a convex
optimization problem, namely the robust principal component pursuit (RPCP).
Moreover, if the observed data matrix has also been corrupted by a dense noise
matrix in addition to gross sparse error, then the stable principal component
pursuit (SPCP) problem is solved to recover the low-rank matrix. In this paper,
we develop efficient algorithms with provable iteration complexity bounds for
solving RPCP and SPCP. Numerical results on problems with millions of variables
and constraints such as foreground extraction from surveillance video, shadow
and specularity removal from face images and video denoising from heavily
corrupted data show that our algorithms are competitive to current
state-of-the-art solvers for RPCP and SPCP in terms of accuracy and speed.
