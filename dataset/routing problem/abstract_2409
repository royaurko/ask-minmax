We study the absorption along lines of sight toward high-z radio sources
caused by the 21 cm transition of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium
(IGM) before reionization. Using semi-analytic methods, we compute the number
density of observable features caused by both ``minihalos'' (bound objects that
are unable to cool efficiently because of their small virial temperatures) and
protogalactic disks. We show that both sets of features should be observable by
the next generation of low-frequency radio telescopes, including the Low
Frequency Array and the Square Kilometer Array, provided that sufficiently
bright background sources exist. The statistics of minihalo absorption features
seen along lines of sight to radio-loud quasars offer a way to measure the
evolution of the radiation background and the IGM temperature with cosmic time.
Intersections with disks are much less common, but also cause much deeper
absorption features that would be visible in the spectra of both radio-loud
quasars and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The absorption feature caused by HI in the
host galaxy of a GRB should be observable, offering a route to determine
spectroscopically the burst redshift.
