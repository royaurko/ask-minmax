A numerical solution scheme for the Einstein field equations based on
generalized harmonic coordinates is described, focusing on details not provided
before in the literature and that are of particular relevance to the binary
black hole problem. This includes demonstrations of the effectiveness of
constraint damping, and how the time slicing can be controlled through the use
of a source function evolution equation. In addition, some results from an
ongoing study of binary black hole coalescence, where the black holes are
formed via scalar field collapse, are shown. Scalar fields offer a convenient
route to exploring certain aspects of black hole interactions, and one
interesting, though tentative suggestion from this early study is that behavior
reminiscent of "zoom-whirl" orbits in particle trajectories is also present in
the merger of equal mass, non-spinning binaries, with appropriately fine-tuned
initial conditions.
