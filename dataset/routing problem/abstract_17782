We study the complexity of approximating solution structure of the bijective
weighted sentence alignment problem of DeNero and Klein (2008). In particular,
we consider the complexity of finding an alignment that has a significant
overlap with an optimal alignment. We discuss ways of representing the solution
for the general weighted sentence alignment as well as phrases-to-words
alignment problem, and show that computing a string which agrees with the
optimal sentence partition on more than half (plus an arbitrarily small
polynomial fraction) positions for the phrases-to-words alignment is NP-hard.
For the general weighted sentence alignment we obtain such bound from the
agreement on a little over 2/3 of the bits. Additionally, we generalize the
Hamming distance approximation of a solution structure to approximating it with
respect to the edit distance metric, obtaining similar lower bounds.
