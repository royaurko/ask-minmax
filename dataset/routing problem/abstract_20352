Ambiguities in pseudoscalar-meson photoproduction, arising from incomplete
experimental data, have analogs in pion-nucleon scattering. Amplitude
ambiguities have important implications for the problems of amplitude
extraction and resonance identification in partial-wave analysis. The effect of
these ambiguities on observables is described. We compare our results with
those found in earlier studies.
