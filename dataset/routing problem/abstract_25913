We consider the problem of Ambrosetti-Prodi type
\begin{equation}\label{0}\quad\begin{cases} \Delta u + e^u = s\phi_1 + h(x)
&\hbox{in} \Omega, u=0 & \hbox{on} \partial \Omega, \end{cases} \nonumber
\end{equation} where $\Omega$ is a bounded, smooth domain in $\R^2$, $\phi_1$
is a positive first eigenfunction of the Laplacian under Dirichlet boundary
conditions and $h\in\mathcal{C}^{0,\alpha}(\bar{\Omega})$. We prove that given
$k\ge 1$ this problem has at least $k$ solutions for all sufficiently large
$s>0$, which answers affirmatively a conjecture by Lazer and McKenna \cite{LM1}
for this case. The solutions found exhibit multiple concentration behavior
around maxima of $\phi_1$ as $s\to +\infty$.
