We study the utility maximization problem for power utility random fields in
a semimartingale financial market, with and without intermediate consumption.
The notion of an opportunity process is introduced as a reduced form of the
value process of the resulting stochastic control problem. We show how the
opportunity process describes the key objects: optimal strategy, value
function, and dual problem. The results are applied to obtain monotonicity
properties of the optimal consumption.
