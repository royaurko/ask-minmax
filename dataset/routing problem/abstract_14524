In this paper, a distributed output regulation problem is formulated for a
class of uncertain nonlinear multi-agent systems subject to local disturbances.
The formulation is given to study a leader-following problem when the leader
contains unknown inputs and its dynamics is different from those of the
followers. Based on the conventional output regulation assumptions and graph
theory, distributed feedback controllers are constructed to make the agents
globally or semi-globally follow the uncertain leader even when the bound of
the leader's inputs is unknown to the followers.
