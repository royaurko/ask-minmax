Sharp reverse affine isoperimetric inequalities for asymmetric Wulff shapes
and their polars are established, along with the characterization of all
extremals. These new inequalities have as special cases previously obtained
simplex inequalities by Ball, Barthe and Lutwak, Yang, and Zhang. In
particular, they provide the solution to a problem by Zhang.
