It is an open question whether solutions of the Einstein-Euler equations are
smooth enough to admit locally inertial coordinates at points of shock wave
interaction, or whether "regularity singularities" can exist at such points.
The term regularity singularity was proposed by the contributors as a point in
spacetime where the gravitational metric tensor is Lipschitz continuous
($C^{0,1}$), but no smoother, in any coordinate system of the $C^{1,1}$ atlas.
An existence theory for shock wave solutions in $C^{0,1}$ admitting arbitrary
interactions has been proven for the Einstein-Euler equations in spherically
symmetric spacetimes, but $C^{1,1}$ is the requisite smoothness required for
space-time to be locally flat. Thus the open problem of regularity
singularities is the problem as to whether locally inertial coordinate systems
exist at shock waves, within the larger $C^{1,1}$ atlas. Our purpose here is to
clarify and motivate the open problem of regularity singularities, and to prove
that if locally inertial coordinates do not lie within the $C^{1,1}$ atlas,
then the scattering of gravitational radiation by a regularity singularity
produces quantifiable physical effects analogous to non-removable Coriolis
forces.
