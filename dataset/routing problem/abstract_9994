The theoretical analysis of many problems in physics, astronomy and applied
mathematics requires an efficient numerical exploration of multimodal parameter
spaces that exhibit broken ergodicity. Monte Carlo methods are widely used to
deal with these classes of problems, but such simulations suffer from a
ubiquitous sampling problem: the probability of sampling a particular state is
proportional to its entropic weight. Devising an algorithm capable of sampling
efficiently the full phase space is a long-standing problem. Here we report a
new hybrid method for the exploration of multimodal parameter spaces exhibiting
broken ergodicity. Superposition enhanced nested sampling (SENS) combines the
strengths of global optimization with the unbiased/athermal sampling of nested
sampling, greatly enhancing its efficiency with no additional parameters. We
report extensive tests of this new approach for atomic clusters that are known
to have energy landscapes for which conventional sampling schemes suffer from
broken ergodicity. We also introduce a novel parallelization algorithm for
nested sampling.
