A random walk (or a Wiener process), possibly with drift, is observed in a
noisy or delayed fashion. The problem considered in this paper is to estimate
the first time \tau the random walk reaches a given level. Specifically, the
p-moment (p\geq 1) optimization problem \inf_\eta \ex|\eta-\tau|^p is
investigated where the infimum is taken over the set of stopping times that are
defined on the observation process.
  When there is no drift, optimal stopping rules are characterized for both
types of observations. When there is a drift, upper and lower bounds on
\inf_\eta \ex|\eta-\tau|^p are established for both types of observations. The
bounds are tight in the large-level regime for noisy observations and in the
large-level-large-delay regime for delayed observations. Noteworthy, for noisy
observations there exists an asymptotically optimal stopping rule that is a
function of a single observation.
  Simulation results are provided that corroborate the validity of the results
for non-asymptotic settings.
