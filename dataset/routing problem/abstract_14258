During the past 15 years, several extensions of the concepts noise
sensitivity and noise stability, first coined in~\cite{schramm2000}, has been
studied. The purpose in this paper is to give definitions of this concepts in
the setting of continuous time Markov chains, which then unifies many of the
previously considered generalizations. In addition, a considerable amount of
time is spent on proving the existence of sequences of noise stable and
nondegenerate functions with respect to various classes of Markov chains, a
problem which interestingly will appear to have close connections to the so
called localization of eigenvectors, a problem which in the setting of random
graphs has recently been given a lot of attention.
