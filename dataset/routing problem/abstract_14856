An arc-annotated string is a string of characters, called bases, augmented
with a set of pairs, called arcs, each connecting two bases. Given
arc-annotated strings $P$ and $Q$ the arc-preserving subsequence problem is to
determine if $P$ can be obtained from $Q$ by deleting bases from $Q$. Whenever
a base is deleted any arc with an endpoint in that base is also deleted.
Arc-annotated strings where the arcs are ``nested'' are a natural model of RNA
molecules that captures both the primary and secondary structure of these. The
arc-preserving subsequence problem for nested arc-annotated strings is basic
primitive for investigating the function of RNA molecules. Gramm et al. [ACM
Trans. Algorithms 2006] gave an algorithm for this problem using $O(nm)$ time
and space, where $m$ and $n$ are the lengths of $P$ and $Q$, respectively. In
this paper we present a new algorithm using $O(nm)$ time and $O(n + m)$ space,
thereby matching the previous time bound while significantly reducing the space
from a quadratic term to linear. This is essential to process large RNA
molecules where the space is likely to be a bottleneck. To obtain our result we
introduce several novel ideas which may be of independent interest for related
problems on arc-annotated strings.
