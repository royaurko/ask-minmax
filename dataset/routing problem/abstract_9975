Delamination is a typical failure mode of composite materials caused by weak
bonding. It arises when a crack initiates and propagates under a destructive
loading. Given the physical law characterizing the properties of the interlayer
adhesive between the bonded bodies, we consider the problem of computing the
propagation of the crack front and the stress field along the contact boundary.
This leads to a hemivariational inequality, which after discretization by
finite elements we solve by a nonconvex bundle method, where upper-$C^1$
criteria have to be minimized. As this is in contrast with other classes of
mechanical problems with non-monotone friction laws and in other applied
fields, where criteria are typically lower-$C^1$, we propose a bundle method
suited for both types of nonsmoothness. We prove its global convergence in the
sense of subsequences and test it on a typical delamination problem of material
sciences.
