The M^\alpha energy which is usually minimized in branched transport problems
among singular 1-dimensional rectifiable vector measures with prescribed
divergence is approximated (and convergence is proved) by means of a sequence
of elliptic energies, defined on more regular vector fields. The procedure
recalls the Modica-Mortola one for approximating the perimeter, and the
double-well potential is replaced by a concave power.
