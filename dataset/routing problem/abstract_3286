In this note, we give a solution to Problem $9.2$, which was presented by
Mesiar and Stup\v{n}anov\'a [{\it Open problems from the 12th International
Conference on Fuzzy Set Theory and Its Applications}, Fuzzy Sets and Systems
(2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/ j.fss.2014.07.012]. We show that the class
of semicopulas solving Problem $9.2$ contains only the {\L}ukasiewicz t-norm.
