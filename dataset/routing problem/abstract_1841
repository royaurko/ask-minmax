Efficient momentum relaxation through umklapp scattering, leading to a power
law in temperature d.c. resistivity, requires a significant low energy spectral
weight at finite momentum. One way to achieve this is via a Fermi surface
structure, leading to the well-known relaxation rate Gamma ~ T^2. We observe
that local criticality, in which energies scale but momenta do not, provides a
distinct route to efficient umklapp scattering. We show that umklapp scattering
by an ionic lattice in a locally critical theory leads to Gamma ~
T^(2\Delta(k_L)). Here \Delta(k_L) \geq 0 is the dimension of the (irrelevant
or marginal) charge density operator J^t(w,k_L) in the locally critical theory,
at the lattice momentum k_L. We illustrate this result with an explicit
computation in locally critical theories described holographically via
Einstein-Maxwell theory in Anti-de Sitter spacetime. We furthermore show that
scattering by random impurities in these locally critical theories gives a
universal Gamma ~ 1/log(1/T)
