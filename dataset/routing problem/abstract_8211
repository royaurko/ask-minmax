We pose and discuss several Hermitian analogues of Hilbert's $17$-th problem.
We survey what is known, offer many explicit examples and some proofs, and give
applications to CR geometry. We prove one new algebraic theorem: a non-negative
Hermitian symmetric polynomial divides a nonzero squared norm if and only if it
is a quotient of squared norms. We also discuss a new example of
Putinar-Scheiderer.
