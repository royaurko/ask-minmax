Using the AdS-CFT correspondence we calculate the two point function of CFT
energy momentum tensors. The AdS gravitons are considered by explicitly
solving the Dirichlet boundary value problem for $x_0=\epsilon$. We consider
this treatment as complementary to existing work, with which we make contact.
