We give a brief overview of black-hole solutions in four-dimensional
supergravity theories and their extremal and supersymmetric limits. We also
address problems like cosmic censorship and no-hair theorems in supergravity
theories. While supergravity by itself seems not to be enough to enforce cosmic
censorship and absence of primary scalar hair, superstring theory may be.
