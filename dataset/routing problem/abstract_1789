We observe the transient formation of a ringed pattern state during spin-up
of an evaporating fluid on a time scale of order a few Ekman spin-up times. The
ringed state is probed using infrared thermometry and particle image
velocimetry and it is demonstrated to be a consequence of the transient balance
between Coriolis and viscous forces which dominate inertia, each of which are
extracted from the measured velocity field. The breakdown of the ringed state
is quantified in terms of the antiphasing of these force components which
drives a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and we show that the resulting vortex
grid spacing scales with the ring wavelength. This is the fundamental route to
quasi-two dimensional turbulent vortex flow and thus may have implications in
astrophysics and geophysics wherein rotating convection is ubiquitous. sics.
