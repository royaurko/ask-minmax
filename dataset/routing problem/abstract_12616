Given a hyper loop algebra over a non-algebraically closed field, we address
multiplicity problems in the underlying abelian tensor category of
finite-dimensional representations. Namely, we give formulas for the
l-characters of the simple objects, the Jordan-Holder multiplicities of the
Weyl modules, and the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.
