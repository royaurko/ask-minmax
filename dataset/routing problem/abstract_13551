In this paper we study the Perron method for solving the p-harmonic Dirichlet
problem on the topologist's comb. For functions which are bounded and
continuous at the accessible points, we obtain invariance of the Perron
solutions under arbitrary perturbations on the set of inaccessible points. We
also obtain some results allowing for jumps and perturbations at a countable
set of points.
