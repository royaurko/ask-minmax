The relaxation method used to solve boundary value problems is applied to
study the variation of the magnetization orientation in several types of domain
walls that occur in ferromagnetic materials. The algorithm is explained and
applied to several cases: the Bloch wall in bulk magnetic systems, the radial
wall in cylindrical wires and the N\'eel wall in thin films
