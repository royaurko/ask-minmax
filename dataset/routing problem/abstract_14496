The Smoluchowski equation with a time dependent delta function sink is solved
exactly for many special cases. In all other cases the problem can be reduced
to an integral equation. It is shown that by knowing the probability
distribution at the position of sink, one can derive analytical expression for
probability distribution everywhere. Thus the problem is reduced from a PDE in
two variables to an integral equation of one. As far as the contributors knowledge,
we are the first one to provide an exact analytical solution of Smoluchowski
equation for a parabolic potential with time dependent sink.
