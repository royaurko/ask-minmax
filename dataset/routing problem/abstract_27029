The formulation of the on-surface radiation condition (OSRC) is extended to
handle wave scattering problems in the presence of multiple obstacles. The new
multiple-OSRC simultaneously accounts for the outgoing behavior of the wave
fields, as well as, the multiple wave reflections between the obstacles. Like
boundary integral equations (BIE), this method leads to a reduction in
dimensionality (from volume to surface) of the discretization region. However,
as opposed to BIE, the proposed technique leads to boundary integral equations
with smooth kernels. Hence, these Fredholm integral equations can be handled
accurately and robustly with standard numerical approaches without the need to
remove singularities. Moreover, under weak scattering conditions, this approach
renders a convergent iterative method which bypasses the need to solve single
scattering problems at each iteration.
  Inherited from the original OSRC, the proposed multiple-OSRC is generally a
crude approximate method. If accuracy is not satisfactory, this approach may
serve as a good initial guess or as an inexpensive pre-conditioner for Krylov
iterative solutions of BIE.
