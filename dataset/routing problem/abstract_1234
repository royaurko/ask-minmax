We present a first-principles study of the electronic transport properties of
micrometer long semiconducting CNTs randomly covered with carbene functional
groups. Whereas prior studies suggested that metallic tubes are hardly affected
by such addends, we show here that the conductance of semiconducting tubes with
standard diameter is on the contrary severely damaged. The configurational
averaged conductance as a function of tube diameter and with a coverage of up
to one hundred functional groups is extracted. Our results indicate that the
search for a conductance-preserving covalent functionalization route remains a
challenging issue.
