We study the performance of Empirical Risk Minimization in noisy phase
retrieval problems, indexed by subsets of $\R^n$ and relative to subgaussian
sampling; that is, when the given data is $y_i=\inr{a_i,x_0}^2+w_i$ for a
subgaussian random vector $a$, independent noise $w$ and a fixed but unknown
$x_0$ that belongs to a given subset of $\R^n$.
  We show that ERM produces $\hat{x}$ whose Euclidean distance to either $x_0$
or $-x_0$ depends on the gaussian mean-width of the indexing set and on the
signal-to-noise ratio of the problem. The bound coincides with the one for
linear regression when $\|x_0\|_2$ is of the order of a constant. In addition,
we obtain a minimax lower bound for the problem and identify sets for which ERM
is a minimax procedure. As examples, we study the class of $d$-sparse vectors
in $\R^n$ and the unit ball in $\ell_1^n$.
