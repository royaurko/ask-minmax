Basing on analogy between the three-body scattering problem and the
diffraction problem of the plane wave (for the case of the short range pair
potentials) by the system of six half transparent screens, we presented a new
approach to the few-body scattering problem.
  The numerical results have been obtained for the case of the short range
nonnegative pair potentials. The presented method allows a natural
generalization to the case of the long range pair potentials.
