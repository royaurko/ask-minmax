Transition from regular to chaotic dynamics in a crystal made of singular
scatterers $U(r)=\lambda |r|^{-\sigma}$ can be reached by varying either sigma
or lambda. We map the problem to a localization problem, and find that in all
space dimensions the transition occurs at sigma=1, i.e., Coulomb potential has
marginal singularity. We study the critical line sigma=1 by means of a
renormalization group technique, and describe universality classes of this new
transition. An RG equation is written in the basis of states localized in
momentum space. The RG flow evolves the distribution of coupling parameters to
a universal stationary distribution. Analytic properties of the RG equation are
similar to that of Boltzmann kinetic equation: the RG dynamics has integrals of
motion and obeys an H-theorem. The RG results for sigma=1 are used to derive
scaling laws for transport and to calculate critical exponents.
