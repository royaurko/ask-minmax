Understanding of the structure evolution in the Universe has been greatly
advanced with a rapid progress in high-resolution cosmological simulations. In
this contribution, we report a new set of cosmological simulations with $512^3$
($\sim 1.4\times 10^8$) particles in a simulation box of $100\mpc$. With this
unprecedented resolution, we have successfully overcomed the over-merging
problem while retaining a cosmological volume size that is crucial for the
statistical analysis. The simulations are being applied to studying important
astrophysical problems that are sensitive to the simulation resolution.
