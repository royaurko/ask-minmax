We discuss the extraction of alpha_s using isovector hadronic tau decay data
and sum rules constructed specifically to suppress contributions associated
with poorly known higher dimension condensates. We show, first, that problems
with the treatment of such contributions affect earlier related analyses and,
second, that these problems can be brought under good theoretical control
through the use of an alternate analysis strategy. Our results, run up to the
n_f=5 regime, correspond to alpha_s(M_Z^2)=0.1187(16), in excellent agreement
with the recently updated global fit to electroweak data at the Z scale and
other high-scale direct determinations.
