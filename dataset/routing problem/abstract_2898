The braid group has recently attracted much attention. This is primarily
based upon the discovery of its usage in various cryptosystems [AAG],[KLCHKP].
One major focus of current research has been in solving decision problems in
braid groups and analyzing their complexity. Among the decision problems which
have been investigated are: the word problem, the conjugacy problem and the
conjugacy search problem. One decision problem which has not been thoroughly
pursued is the generalized word problem. It can be shown that this problem is,
in general, unsolvable for braid groups of index greater then or equal to 5.
However, we will show that for the special case of cyclic subgroups, this
problem is, in almost all cases, solvable. We will design an algorithm,
implement it on a multitape Turing machine, and analyze its complexity.
