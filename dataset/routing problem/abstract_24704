The notion of `Pseudo Algebraically Closed (PAC) extensions' is a
generalization of the classical notion of PAC fields. It was originally
motivated by Hilbert's tenth problem, and recently had new applications.
  In this work we develop a basic machinery to study PAC extensions. This
machinery is based on a generalization of embedding problems to field
extensions. The main goal is to prove that the Galois closure of any proper
separable algebraic PAC extension is its separable closure. This vastly
generalizes earlier works of Jarden-Razon, Jarden, and Jarden and the contributor.
This also leads to a classification of all finite PAC extensions which in turn
proves the `bottom conjecture' for finitely generated infinite fields.
  The secondary goal of this work is to unify proofs of known results about PAC
extensions and to establish new basic properties of PAC extensions, e.g.\
transitiveness of PAC extensions.
