The problem of determining the thermomechanical characteristics of the system
of closely spaced bodies considered by many contributors. For scalar problems, such
as problems of heat, electrostatic, etc., the localization effect was found (so
called Tamm's shielding effect), which consists in the fact that in a system of
closely spaced highly conductive bodies, most energy is localized in the region
between adjacent bodies. We can assume that the localization of energy is a
general property of closely spaced bodies. The aim is to study the effect of
localization of energy in a system of closely spaced rigid bodies in an elastic
medium.
