We obtain the two-point Green's function for the relativistic
Dirac-Oscillator problem. This is accomplished by setting up the relativistic
problem in such a way that makes comparison with the nonrelativistic problem
highly transparent and results in a map of the latter into the former. The
relativistic bound states energy spectrum is obtained by locating the energy
poles of this Green's function in a simple and straightforward manner.
