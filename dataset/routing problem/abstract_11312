Using the resolution of the gauge hierarchy problem recently proposed by
Randall and Sundrum, we find a natural explanation for the observed fermion
masses and mixings of the three Standard Model (SM) generations. Localizing
massless SM matter generations on neighboring 3-branes in an extra dimensional
world leads to effective four dimensional masses and mixings from the coupling
of the fermions with the background metric. We find that the positions of the
3-branes required to solve the gauge hierachy problem simultaneously reproduces
phenomenologically acceptable fermion masses and mixings.
