As an alternative to state-of-the-art laser frequency stabilisation using
ultra-stable cavities, it has been proposed to exploit the non-linear effects
from coupling of atoms with a narrow transition to an optical cavity. Here we
have constructed such a system and observed non-linear phase shifts of a narrow
optical line by strong coupling of a sample of strontium-88 atoms to an optical
cavity. The sample temperature of a few mK provides a domain where the Doppler
energy scale is several orders of magnitude larger than the narrow linewidth of
the optical transition. This makes the system sensitive to velocity dependent
multi-photon scattering events (Dopplerons) that affect the cavity field
transmission and phase. By varying the number of atoms and the intra-cavity
power we systematically study this non-linear phase signature which displays
roughly the same features as for much lower temperature samples. This
demonstration in a relatively simple system opens new possibilities for
alternative routes to laser stabilization at the sub 100 mHz level and
superradiant laser sources involving narrow line atoms. The understanding of
relevant motional effects obtained here has direct implications for other
atomic clocks when used in relation with ultranarrow clock transitions.
