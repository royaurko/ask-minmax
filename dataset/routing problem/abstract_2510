Semiconductor glasses exhibit many unique optical and electronic anomalies.
We have put forth a semi-phenomenological scenario (J. Chem. Phys. 132, 044508
(2010)) in which several of these anomalies arise from deep midgap electronic
states residing on high-strain regions intrinsic to the activated transport
above the glass transition. Here we demonstrate at the molecular level how this
scenario is realized in an important class of semiconductor glasses, namely
chalcogen and pnictogen containing alloys. Both the glass itself and the
intrinsic electronic midgap states emerge as a result of the formation of a
network composed of $\sigma$-bonded atomic $p$-orbitals that are only weakly
hybridized. Despite a large number of weak bonds, these $pp\sigma$-networks are
stable with respect to competing types of bonding, while exhibiting a high
degree of structural degeneracy. The stability is rationalized with the help of
a hereby proposed structural model, by which $pp\sigma$-networks are
symmetry-broken and distorted versions of a high symmetry structure. The latter
structure exhibits exact octahedral coordination and is fully
covalently-bonded. The present approach provides a microscopic route to a fully
consistent description of the electronic and structural excitations in vitreous
semiconductors.
