This work concerns with the discontinuous Galerkin (DG)method for the
time-dependent linear elasticity problem. We derive the a posteriori error
bounds for semi-discrete and fully discrete problems, by making use of the
stationary elasticity reconstruction technique which allows to estimate the
error for time-dependent problem through the error estimation of the associated
stationary elasticity problem. To this end, to derive the error bound for the
stationary problem, we present two methods to obtain two different a posteriori
error bounds, by $L^2$ duality technique and via energy norm. For fully
discrete scheme, we make use of the backward-Euler scheme and an appropriate
space-time reconstruction. The technique here can be applicable for a variety
of DG methods as well.
