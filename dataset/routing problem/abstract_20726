An exact solution has been found for the problem of diffraction radiation
appearing when a charged particle moves perpendicularly to a thin finite screen
having arbitrary conductivity and frequency dispersion. Expressions describing
the Diffraction and Cherenkov emission mechanisms have been obtained for the
spectral-angular forward and backward radiation densities.
