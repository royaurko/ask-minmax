Recent technology breakthroughs have enabled data collection of unprecedented
scale, rate, variety and complexity that has led to an explosion in data
management requirements. Existing theories and techniques are not adequate to
fulfil these requirements. We endeavour to rethink the way data management
research is being conducted and we propose to work towards modular data
management that will allow for unification of the expression of data management
problems and systematization of their solution. The core of such an approach is
the novel notion of a datom, i.e. a data management atom, which encapsulates
generic data management provision. The datom is the foundation for comparison,
customization and re-usage of data management problems and solutions. The
proposed approach can signal a revolution in data management research and a
long anticipated evolution in data management engineering.
