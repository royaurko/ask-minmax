A famous problem in discrete geometry is to find all monohedral plane tilers,
which is still open to the best of our knowledge. This paper concerns with one
of its variants that to determine all convex polyhedra whose every
cross-section tiles the plane. We call such polyhedra universal tilers. We
obtain that a convex polyhedron is a universal tiler only if it is a
tetrahedron or a pentahedron.
