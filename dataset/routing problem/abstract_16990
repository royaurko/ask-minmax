Let $\om $ be a bounded domain in an $n$-dimensional Euclidean space $\Bbb
R^n$. We study eigenvalues of an eigenvalue problem of a system of elliptic
equations:
  $$ \{\aligned &\Delta {\mathbf u}+ \alpha{\rm grad}(\text{div}{\mathbf
u})=-\sigma {\mathbf u}, \ \text{in $\Omega$},
  &{\mathbf u}|_{\partial \Omega}={\mathbf 0}. \aligned . $$ Estimates for
eigenvalues of the above eigenvalue problem are obtained. Furthermore, we
obtain an upper bound on the $(k+1)^{\text{th}}$ eigenvalue $\sigma_{k+1}$. We
also obtain sharp lower bound for the first eigenvalue of two kinds of
eigenvalue problems of the biharmonic operator on compact manifolds with
boundary and positive Ricci curvature.
