The Joint Replenishment Problem (JRP) is a fundamental optimization problem
in supply-chain management, concerned with optimizing the flow of goods over
time from a supplier to retailers. Over time, in response to demands at the
retailers, the supplier sends shipments, via a warehouse, to the retailers. The
objective is to schedule shipments to minimize the sum of shipping costs and
retailers' waiting costs.
  We study the approximability of JRP with deadlines, where instead of waiting
costs the retailers impose strict deadlines. We study the integrality gap of
the standard linear-program (LP) relaxation, giving a lower bound of 1.207, and
an upper bound and approximation ratio of 1.574. The best previous upper bound
and approximation ratio was 1.667; no lower bound was previously published. For
the special case when all demand periods are of equal length we give an upper
bound of 1.5, a lower bound of 1.2, and show APX-hardness.
