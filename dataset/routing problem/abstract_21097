In the last two decades, many algebras of generalized functions have been
constructed, particularly the so-called generalized Sobolev algebras. Our goal
is to study the latter and some of their main properties. In this framework, we
pose and solve a nonlinear degenerated Dirichlet problem with irregular data
such as Dirac generalized functions.
