Constraint programming (CP) has been used with great success to tackle a wide
variety of constraint satisfaction problems which are computationally
intractable in general. Global constraints are one of the important factors
behind the success of CP. In this paper, we study a new global constraint, the
multiset ordering constraint, which is shown to be useful in symmetry breaking
and searching for leximin optimal solutions in CP. We propose efficient and
effective filtering algorithms for propagating this global constraint. We show
that the algorithms are sound and complete and we discuss possible extensions.
We also consider alternative propagation methods based on existing constraints
in CP toolkits. Our experimental results on a number of benchmark problems
demonstrate that propagating the multiset ordering constraint via a dedicated
algorithm can be very beneficial.
