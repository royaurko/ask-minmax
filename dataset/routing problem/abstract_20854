We introduce a new division formula on projective space which provides
explicit solutions to various polynomial division problems with sharp degree
estimates. We consider simple examples as the classical Macaulay theorem as
well as a quite recent result by Hickel, related to the effective
Nullstellensatz. We also obtain a related result that generalizes Max Noether's
classical AF+BG theorem.
