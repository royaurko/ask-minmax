This paper summarizes basic properties of PPTs and shows that each PPT
belongs to one of six different classes. Mapping an ordered sequence of PPTs
into a corresponding sequence of these six classes makes it possible to use
them in cryptography. We pose problems whose solution would facilitate such
cryptographic application.
