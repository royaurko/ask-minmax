We study the design of fixed-parameter algorithms for problems already known
to be solvable in polynomial time. The main motivation is to get more efficient
algorithms for problems with unattractive polynomial running times. Here, we
focus on a fundamental graph problem: Longest Path; it is NP-hard in general
but known to be solvable in $O(n^4)$ time on $n$-vertex interval graphs. We
show how to solve Longest Path on interval graphs, parameterized by vertex
deletion number $k$ to proper interval graphs, in $O(k^{9} n)$ time. Notably,
Longest Path is trivially solvable in linear time on proper interval graphs,
and the parameter value $k$ can be approximated up to a factor of $4$ in linear
time. From a more general perspective, we believe that the idea of using
parameterized complexity analysis for polynomial-time solvable problems offers
a very fertile ground for future studies for all sorts of algorithmic problems.
It may enable a refined understanding of efficiency aspects for polynomial-time
solvable problems similarly to what classical parameterized complexity analysis
does for NP-hard problems.
