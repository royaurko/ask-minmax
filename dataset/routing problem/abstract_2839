The class $\mathcal{UP}$ of `ultimate polynomial time' problems over $\mathbb
C$ is introduced; it contains the class $\mathcal P$ of polynomial time
problems over $\mathbb C$.
  The $\tau$-Conjecture for polynomials implies that $\mathcal{UP}$ does not
contain the class of non-deterministic polynomial time problems definable
without constants over $\mathbb C$.
  This latest statement implies that $\mathcal P \ne \mathcal{NP}$ over
$\mathbb C$.
  A notion of `ultimate complexity' of a problem is suggested. It provides
lower bounds for the complexity of structured problems.
