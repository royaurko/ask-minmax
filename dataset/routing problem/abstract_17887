As modern industry shifts toward significant globalization, robust and
adaptable network capability is increasingly vital to the success of business
enterprises. Large quantities of information must be distilled and presented in
a single integrated picture in order to maintain the health, security and
performance of global networks. We present a design for a network situational
awareness display that visually aggregates large quantities of data, identifies
problems in a network, assesses their impact on critical company mission areas
and clarifies the utilization of resources. This display facilitates the
prioritization of network problems as they arise by explicitly depicting how
problems interrelate. It also serves to coordinate mitigation strategies with
members of a team.
