In 30's Hassler Whitney considered and completely solved the problem $(WP)$
of describing the classes of graphs $G$ having the same cycle matroid $M(G)$. A
natural analog $(WP)'$ of Whitney's problem $(WP)$ is to describe the classes
of graphs $G$ having the same matroid $M'(G)$, where $M'(G)$ is a matroid (on
the edge set of $G$) distinct from $M(G)$. For example, the corresponding
problem $(WP)'= (WP)_{\theta }$ for the so-called bicircular matroid $M_{\theta
}(G)$ of graph $G$ was solved by Coulard, Del Greco and Wagner. We define the
so-called {\em $k$-circular matroid} $M_k(G)$ on the edge set of graph $G$ for
any non-negative integer $k$ so that $M(G) = M_0(G)$ and $M_{\theta }(G) =
M_1(G)$. It is natural to consider the corresponding analog $(WP)_k$ of
Whitney's problem $(WP)$ not only for $k=0$ and $k=1$ but also for any integer
$k \ge 2$. In this paper we give a characterization of the $k$-circular matroid
$M_k(G)$ by describing the main constituents (circuits, bases, and cocircuits)
in terms of graph $G$ and establish some important properties of the
$k$-circular matroid. The results of this paper will be used in our further
research on the problem $(WP)_k$. In our next paper we use these results to
study a particular problem of $(WP)_k$ on graphs uniquely defined by their
$k$-circular matroids.
