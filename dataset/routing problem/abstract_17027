In this paper, we propose a Bayesian MAP estimator for solving the
deconvolution problems when the observations are corrupted by Poisson noise.
Towards this goal, a proper data fidelity term (log-likelihood) is introduced
to reflect the Poisson statistics of the noise. On the other hand, as a prior,
the images to restore are assumed to be positive and sparsely represented in a
dictionary of waveforms such as wavelets or curvelets. Both analysis and
synthesis-type sparsity priors are considered. Piecing together the data
fidelity and the prior terms, the deconvolution problem boils down to the
minimization of non-smooth convex functionals (for each prior). We establish
the well-posedness of each optimization problem, characterize the corresponding
minimizers, and solve them by means of proximal splitting algorithms
originating from the realm of non-smooth convex optimization theory.
Experimental results are conducted to demonstrate the potential applicability
of the proposed algorithms to astronomical imaging datasets.
