A concise method for following the evolving geometry of a moving surface
using Lagrangian coordinates is described. All computations can be done in the
fixed geometry of the initial surface despite the evolving complexity of the
moving surface. The method is applied to three problems in nonlinear
elasticity: the bulging of a thin plate under pressure (the original motivation
for Foeppl-von Karman theory), the buckling of a spherical shell under
pressure, and the phenomenon of capillary wrinkles induced by surface tension
in a thin film. In this last problem the inclusion of a gravitational potential
energy term in the total energy improves the agreement with experiment.
