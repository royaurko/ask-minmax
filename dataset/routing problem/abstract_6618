In this expository article we review the problem of finding Einstein metrics
on compact K\"ahler manifolds and Sasaki manifolds. In the former half of this
article we see that, in the K\"ahler case, the problem fits better with the
notion of stability in Geometric Invariant Theory if we extend the problem to
that of finding extremal K\"ahler metrics or constant scalar curvature K\"ahler
(cscK) metrics. In the latter half of this paper we see that most of ideas in
K\"ahler geometry extend to Sasaki geometry as transverse K\"ahler geometry. We
also summarize recent results about the existence of toric Sasaki-Einstein
metrics.
