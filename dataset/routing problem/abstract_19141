Dirac algorithm allows to construct Hamiltonian systems for singular systems,
and so contributing to its successful quantization. A drawback of this method
is that the resulting quantized theory does not have manifest Lorentz
invariance. This motivated the quest of alternatives to the usual Hamiltonian
theory on the space of sections; a particular instance of this search is the so
called restricted Hamiltonian theory, where the equations of motion of a field
theory are formulated by means of a multisymplectic structure, a kind of
generalization of the symplectic form to the multidimensional context, and even
a constraint algorithm working in this context has been proposed. In the
present article we will try to provide partial aswers to two questions
intimately related with these issues: First, to assign multisymplectic spaces
to variational problems in the Griffiths formalism in such a way that the
equations of motion can be written as restricted Hamiltonian systems, and
second, to propose a covariant Dirac-like algorithm suitable to work with them;
it must be recalled that given the Griffiths formalism contains the classical
variational problems as particular instances, it yields to a novel covariant
algorithm for deal with constraints in field theory. Moreover, in this
formulation the constraint algorithm becomes simply the Cartan algorithm
designed for deal with Pfaffian systems.
