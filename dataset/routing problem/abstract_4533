Although rare, collisions of two or more bodies in the N-body problem are
apparent obstacles at which Newton's Law of Gravity ceases to make sense.
Without understanding the nature of collisions, a complete understanding of the
N-body problem can not be achieved. Historically, several methods have been
developed to probe the nature of collisions in the N-body problem. One of these
methods removes, or regularizes, certain types of collisions entirely, thereby
relating not only analytically, but also numerically, the dynamics of such
collision motions with their near collision motions. By understanding the
dynamics of collision motions in the regularized setting, a better
understanding of the dynamics of near-collision motions is achieved.
