Materials that undergo internal transformations are usually described in
solid mechanics by multi-well energy functions that account for both elastic
and transformational behavior. In order to separate the two effects, physicists
use instead phase-field-type theories where conventional linear elastic strain
is quadratically coupled to an additional field that describes the evolution of
the reference state and solely accounts for nonlinearity. In this paper we
propose a systematic method allowing one to split the non-convex energy into
harmonic and nonharmonic parts and to convert a nonconvex mechanical problem
into a partially linearized phase-field problem. The main ideas are illustrated
using the simplest framework of the Peierls-Nabarro dislocation model.
