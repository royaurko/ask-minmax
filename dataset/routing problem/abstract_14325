This paper considers the problem of identifying multivariate autoregressive
(AR) sparse plus low-rank graphical models. Based on the corresponding problem
formulation recently presented, we use the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) to efficiently solve it and scale it to sizes encountered in
neuroimaging applications. We apply this decomposition on synthetic and real
neuroimaging datasets with a specific focus on the information encoded in the
low-rank structure of our model. In particular, we illustrate that this
information captures the spatio-temporal structure of the original data,
generalizing classical component analysis approaches.
