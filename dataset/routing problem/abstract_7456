SelectScript is an extendable, adaptable, and declarative domain-specific
language aimed at information retrieval from simulation environments and
robotic world models in an SQL-like manner. In this work we have extended the
language in two directions. First, we have implemented hierarchical queries;
second, we improve efficiency enabling manual design space exploration on
different "search" strategies. As depicted in the teaser above, we demonstrate
the applicability of such extensions in two application problems; the basic
language concepts are explained by solving the classical problem of the Towers
of Hanoi and then a common path planning problem in a complex 3D environment is
implemented.
