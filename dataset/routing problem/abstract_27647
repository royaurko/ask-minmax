We consider representing of natural numbers by expressions using 1's,
addition, multiplication and parentheses. $\left\| n \right\|$ denotes the
minimum number of 1's in the expressions representing $n$. The logarithmic
complexity $\left\| n \right\|_{\log}$ is defined as $\left\| n
\right\|/{\log_3 n}$. The values of $\left\| n \right\|_{\log}$ are located in
the segment $[3, 4.755]$, but almost nothing is known with certainty about the
structure of this "spectrum" (are the values dense somewhere in the segment
etc.). We establish a connection between this problem and another difficult
problem: the seemingly "almost random" behaviour of digits in the base 3
representations of the numbers $2^n$.
  We consider also representing of natural numbers by expressions that include
subtraction, and the so-called $P$-algorithms - a family of "deterministic"
algorithms for building representations of numbers.
