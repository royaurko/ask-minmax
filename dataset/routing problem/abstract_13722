We study the scalar, conformally invariant wave equation on a
four-dimensional Minkowski background in spherical symmetry, using a fully
pseudospectral numerical scheme. Thereby, our main interest is in a suitable
treatment of spatial infinity, which is represented as a cylinder. We consider
both Cauchy problems, where we evolve data from a Cauchy surface to future null
infinity, as well as characteristic initial value problems with data at past
null infinity, and demonstrate that highly accurate numerical solutions can be
obtained for a small number of grid points.
