We provide a new result on the existence of extremal solutions for
second-order Dirichlet problems with deviation argument. As a novelty in this
work, the nonlinearity need not be continuous or monotone. In order to obtain
this new result, we use a generalized monotone method coupled with lower and
upper solutions.
