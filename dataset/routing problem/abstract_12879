In this paper we consider the inverse problem of determining a rigid
inclusion inside a thin plate by applying a couple field at the boundary and by
measuring the induced transversal displacement and its normal derivative at the
boundary of the plate. The plate is made by non-homogeneous linearly elastic
material belonging to a general class of anisotropy. For this severely
ill-posed problem, under suitable a priori regularity assumptions on the
boundary of the inclusion, we prove a stability estimate of log-log type.
