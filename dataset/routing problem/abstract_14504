Inverse problems consist in inferring parameters of model distributions that
are able to fit properly chosen features of experimental data-sets. The Inverse
Ising problem specifically consists of searching for the maximal entropy
distribution reproducing frequencies and correlations of a binary data-set. In
order to solve this task, we propose an algorithm that takes advantage of the
provided by the data knowledge of the log-likelihood function around the
solution. We show that the present algorithm is faster than standard gradient
ascent methods. Moreover, by looking at the algorithm convergence as a
stochastic process, we properly define over-fitting and we show how the present
algorithm avoids it by construction.
