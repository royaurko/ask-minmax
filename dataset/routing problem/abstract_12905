We investigate a variational problem in the Lorentz-Minkowski space $\l^3$
whose critical points are spacelike surfaces with constant mean curvature and
making constant contact angle with a given support surface along its common
boundary. We show that if the support surface is a pseudosphere, then the
surface is a planar disc or a hyperbolic cap. We also study the problem of
spacelike hypersurfaces with free boundary in the higher dimensional
Lorentz-Minkowski space $\l^{n+1}$.
