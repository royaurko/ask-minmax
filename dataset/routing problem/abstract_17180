In this paper, we study a hierarchical SSOR (HSSOR) method which could be
used as a standalone method or as a smoother for a two-grid method. It is found
that the method leads to faster convergence compared to more costly incomplete
LU (ILU(0)) with no fill-in, the SSOR, and the Block SSOR method. Moreover, for
a two-grid method, numerical experiments suggests that HSSOR can be a better
replacement for SSOR smoother both having no storage requirements and have no
construction costs. Using Fourier analysis, ex- pressions for the eigenvalues
and the condition number of HSSOR preconditioned problem is derived for the
three-dimensional isotropic model problem.
