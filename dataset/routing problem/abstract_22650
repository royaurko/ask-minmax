The behavior of a non-spherical particle in a viscous, plane channel flow is
studied by means of a combination of analytical technique and geometrical
reasoning. An efficient implementation of Lamb's general solution is adopted,
allowing rapid calculation, in the perturbative quasi-spherical regime, of
forces and torques coming from the particle interaction with the flow gradients
and from the presence of the walls. Particular attention is given to the role
of symmetries in the problem. A classification of the effects of departures
from spherical shape on the motion of a particle in various kinds of shear flow
is provided. Additional applications to problems involving particles with
streaming boundaries are presented.
