We consider the small-angle multiple neutron scattering and a possibility of
its model-free analysis by the inverse problem method. We show that the
ill-defined problem is essentially regularized by use of a planar detector
without a "beam-stop" facility. We analyze the obtained expressions with the
examples of different models of scatterers.
