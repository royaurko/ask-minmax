We perform a calculation for the three body $N \bar{K} K$ scattering
amplitude by using the fixed center approximation to the Faddeev equations,
taking the interaction between $N$ and $\bar{K}$, $N$ and $K$, and $\bar{K}$
and $K$ from the chiral unitary approach. The resonant structures show up in
the modulus squared of the three body scattering amplitude and suggest that a
$N\bar{K}K$ hadron state can be formed. Our results are in agreement with
others obtained in previous theoretical works, which claim a new $N^*$
resonance around 1920 MeV with spin-parity $J^P=1/2^+$. The existence of these
previous works allows us to test the accuracy of the fixed center approximation
in the present problem and sets the grounds for possible application in similar
problems, as an explorative tool to determine bound or quasibound three hadron
systems.
