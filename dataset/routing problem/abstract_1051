We study spatial networks that are designed to distribute or collect a
commodity, such as gas pipelines or train tracks. We focus on the cost of a
network, as represented by the total length of all its edges, and its
efficiency in terms of the directness of routes from point to point. Using data
for several real-world examples, we find that distribution networks appear
remarkably close to optimal where both these properties are concerned. We
propose two models of network growth that offer explanations of how this
situation might arise.
