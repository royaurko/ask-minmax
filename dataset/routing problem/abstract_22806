We provide two complementary approaches to the treatment of disorder in a
fundamental nonequilibrium model, the asymmetric simple exclusion process.
Firstly, a mean-field steady state mapping is generalized to the disordered
case, where it provides a mapping of probability distributions and demonstrates
how disorder results in a new flat regime in the steady state current--density
plot for periodic boundary conditions. This effect was earlier observed by
Tripathy and Barma but we provide treatment for more general distributions of
disorder, including both numerical results and analytic expressions for the
width $2\Delta_C$ of the flat section. We then apply an argument based on
moving shock fronts to show how this leads to an increase in the high current
region of the phase diagram for open boundary conditions. Secondly, we show how
equivalent results can be obtained easily by taking the continuum limit of the
problem and then using a disordered version of the well-known Cole--Hopf
mapping to linearize the equation. Within this approach we show that adding
disorder induces a localization transformation (verified by numerical scaling),
and $\Delta_C$ maps to an inverse localization length, helping to give a new
physical interpretation to the problem.
