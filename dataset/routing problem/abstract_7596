We present a novel algorithm for deciding whether a given planar curve is an
image of a given spatial curve, obtained by a central or a parallel projection
with unknown parameters. The motivation comes from the problem of establishing
a correspondence between an object and an image, taken by a camera with unknown
position and parameters. A straightforward approach to this problem consists of
setting up a system of conditions on the projection parameters and then
checking whether or not this system has a solution. The computational advantage
of the algorithm presented here, in comparison to algorithms based on the
straightforward approach, lies in a significant reduction of a number of real
parameters that need to be eliminated in order to establish existence or
non-existence of a projection that maps a given spatial curve to a given planar
curve. Our algorithm is based on projection criteria that reduce the projection
problem to a certain modification of the equivalence problem of planar curves
under affine and projective transformations. To solve the latter problem we
make an algebraic adaptation of signature construction that has been used to
solve the equivalence problems for smooth curves. We introduce a notion of a
classifying set of rational differential invariants and produce explicit
formulas for such invariants for the actions of the projective and the affine
groups on the plane.
