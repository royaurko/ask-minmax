We prove a dynamical version of the Mordell-Lang conjecture for subvarieties
of quasiprojective varieties X, endowed with the action of a morphism f:X -->
X. We use an analytic method based on the technique of Skolem, Mahler, and
Lech, along with results of Herman and Yoccoz from nonarchimedean dynamics.
