We examine rare evolutionary routes of binary systems where the initially
more massive primary star of ~5.5-8.5Mo, forms a white dwarf (WD), while the
secondary star of 4Mo < M_2,0 < M_1,0 accretes mass from the evolved primary
and later terminates as a core collapse supernova (CCSN). In such a WD-NS
reverse evolution a neutron star (NS) or a potential NS-progenitor massive core
is formed after the WD. These SN explosions are likely to be preceded by strong
interaction of the WD with the giant secondary's core, leading to an
Intermediate-Luminosity Optical Transient (ILOT; Red Transient; Red Nova)
event, weeks to years before the explosion. The common envelope phase of the WD
and the giant ends with a merger that forms an ILOT, or an envelope ejection
that leads, after a CCSN of the giant's core, to a NS-NS or WD-NS surviving
binary. The WD could suffer a thermonuclear explosion, that might be observed
as a Type Ia SN. Most of these CCSN and thermonuclear explosions will be
peculiar. We calculate the stellar evolution of representative cases using
Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). The occurrence rate of
these systems is ~3-5 percent of that of CCSNe.
