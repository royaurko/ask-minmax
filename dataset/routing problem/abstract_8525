In this paper, we use variational minimizing method to prove the existence of
hyperbolic solution with a prescribed positive energy for N-body type problems
with strong forces. Firstly, we get periodic solutions using suitable
constraints, then by taking limit about a sequence of periodic solutions, we
get the hyperbolic orbits.
