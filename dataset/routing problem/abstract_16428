In recent years the Cache-Oblivious model of external memory computation has
provided an attractive theoretical basis for the analysis of algorithms on
massive datasets. Much progress has been made in discovering algorithms that
are asymptotically optimal or near optimal. However, to date there are still
relatively few successful experimental studies. In this paper we compare two
different Cache-Oblivious priority queues based on the Funnel and Bucket Heap
and apply them to the single source shortest path problem on graphs with
positive edge weights. Our results show that when RAM is limited and data is
swapping to external storage, the Cache-Oblivious priority queues achieve
orders of magnitude speedups over standard internal memory techniques. However,
for the single source shortest path problem both on simulated and real world
graph data, these speedups are markedly lower due to the time required to
access the graph adjacency list itself.
