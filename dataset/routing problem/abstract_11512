The first part of this paper is devoted to an analysis of moment problems in
R^n with supports contained in a closed set defined by finitely many
polynomial inequalities. The second part of the paper uses the representation
results of positive functionals on certain spaces of rational functions
developed in the first part, for decomposing a polynomial which is positive on
such a semi-algebraic set into a canonical sum of squares of rational
functions times explicit multipliers.
