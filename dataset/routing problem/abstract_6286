We consider the initial value problem for a pseudodifferential equation with
first order hyperbolic part, and an order $\gamma > 0$ dissipative term. Under
an assumption, depending on an integer parameter $L \geq 2$ such that $2 \gamma
< L$, we construct for this initial value problem a parametrix that is a
Fourier integral operator of type $\rho = 1 - \gamma/L$. The assumption implies
that where the principal symbol of the dissipative term is zero, the terms of
order up to $L-1$ in its Taylor series also vanish.
