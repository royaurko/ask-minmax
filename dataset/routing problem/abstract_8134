We give an algorithm with complexity $O(f(R)^{k^2} k^3 n)$ for the integer
multiflow problem on instances $(G,H,r,c)$ with $G$ an acyclic planar digraph
and $r+c$ Eulerian. Here, $f$ is a polynomial function, $n = |V(G)|$, $k =
|E(H)|$ and $R$ is the maximum request $\max_{h \in E(H)} r(h)$. When $k$ is
fixed, this gives a polynomial algorithm for the arc-disjoint paths problem
under the same hypothesis.
