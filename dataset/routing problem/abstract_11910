Clifford codes can be understood as a generalization of stabilizer codes. To
show the existence of a true Clifford code which is better than any stabilizer
code is a well known open problem in the theory of Clifford codes. One of the
main difficulties in solving this problem is that we know only about 110
examples of codes which are Clifford but not stabilizer codes. In this paper,
we obtain infinite examples of Clifford codes which are not stabilizer codes.
We expect our examples to be useful in the study of Clifford codes.
