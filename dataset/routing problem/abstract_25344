The growing need to manage and exploit the proliferation of online data
sources is opening up new opportunities for bringing people closer to the
resources they need. For instance, consider a recommendation service through
which researchers can receive daily pointers to journal papers in their fields
of interest. We survey some of the known approaches to the problem of technical
paper recommendation and ask how they can be extended to deal with multiple
information sources. More specifically, we focus on a variant of this problem -
recommending conference paper submissions to reviewing committee members -
which offers us a testbed to try different approaches. Using WHIRL - an
information integration system - we are able to implement different
recommendation algorithms derived from information retrieval principles. We
also use a novel autonomous procedure for gathering reviewer interest
information from the Web. We evaluate our approach and compare it to other
methods using preference data provided by members of the AAAI-98 conference
reviewing committee along with data about the actual submissions.
