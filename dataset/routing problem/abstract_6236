The Bogomolny equations for Yang-Mills-Higgs monopoles follow from a system
of linear equations which may be solved through a parametric Riemann-Hilbert
problem. We extend this approach to noncommutative R^3 and use it to
(re)construct noncommutative Dirac, Wu-Yang, and BPS monopole configurations in
a unified manner. In all cases we write down the underlying matrix-valued
functions for multi-monopoles and solve the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert
problems for charge one.
