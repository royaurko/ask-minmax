Characterization problems in free probability are studied here. Using
subordination of free additive and free multiplicative convolutions we
generalize some known characterizations in free probability to random variables
with unbounded support. Using this technique we also prove a new
characterization of distributions of free random variables. A similar technique
is used to study Laha-Lukacs regressions for monotonically independent random
variables.
