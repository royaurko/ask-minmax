Large scale simulations of Centaurs have yielded vast amounts of data, the
analysis of which allows interesting but uncommon scenarios to be studied. One
such rare phenomenon is the temporary capture of Centaurs as Trojans of the
giant planets. Such captures are generally short (10 kyr to 100 kyr), but occur
with sufficient frequency (about 40 objects larger than 1 km in diameter every
Myr) that they may well contribute to the present-day populations. Uranus and
Neptune seem to have great difficulty capturing Centaurs into the 1:1
resonance, while Jupiter captures some, and Saturn the most (80 %). We
conjecture that such temporary capture from the Centaur population may be the
dominant delivery route into the Saturnian Trojans. Photometric studies of the
Jovian Trojans may reveal outliers with Centaur-like as opposed to asteroidal
characteristics, and these would be prime candidates for captured Centaurs.
