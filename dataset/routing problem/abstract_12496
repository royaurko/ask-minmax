In this paper, we consider a contact problem with adhesion between a
viscoelastic body and a rigid support, taking thermal effects into account. The
PDE system we deal with is derived within the modelling approach proposed by M.
Fremond and, in particular, includes the entropy balance equations, describing
the evolution of the temperatures of the body and of the adhesive material. Our
main result consists in showing the existence of global in time solutions (to a
suitable variational formulation) of the related initial and boundary value
problem.
