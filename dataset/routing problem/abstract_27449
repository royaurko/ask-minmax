Given a coercive Hamiltonian which is quasi-convex with respect to the
gradient variable and periodic with respect to time and space at least "far
away from the origin", we consider the solution of the Cauchy problem of the
corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation posed on the real line. Compact
perturbations of coercive periodic quasi-convex Hamiltonians enter into this
framework for example. We prove that the rescaled solution converges towards
the solution of the expected effective Hamilton-Jacobi equation, but whose
"flux" at the origin is "limited" in a sense made precise by the contributors in
\cite{im}. In other words, the homogenization of such a Hamilton-Jacobi
equation yields to supplement the expected homogenized Hamilton-Jacobi equation
with a junction condition at the single discontinuous point of the effective
Hamiltonian. We also illustrate possible applications of such a result by
deriving, for a traffic flow problem, the effective flux limiter generated by
the presence of a finite number of traffic lights on an ideal road. We also
provide meaningful qualitative properties of the effective limiter.
