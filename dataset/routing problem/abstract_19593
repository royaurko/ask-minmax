Two targeting schemes have been known for the density matrix renormalization
group (DMRG) applied to non-Hermitian problems; one uses an asymmetric density
matrix and the other uses symmetric density matrix. We compare the numerical
efficiency of these two targeting schemes when they are used for the finite
temperature DMRG.
