We propose an algorithm of generating hard instances for the Satisfying
Assignment Search Problem (in short, SAT). The algorithm transforms instances
of the integer factorization problem into SAT instances efficiently by using
the Chinese Remainder Theorem. For example, it is possible to construct SAT
instances with about 5,600 variables that is as hard as factorizing 100 bit
integers.
