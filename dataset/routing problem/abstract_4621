We propose a splitting method for solving an equilibrium problem involving
the sum of two bifunctions satisfying standard conditions. We prove that this
problem is equivalent to find a zero of two appropriate maximally monotone
operators. Our algorithm is a consequence of the Douglas--Rachford splitting
applied to this auxiliary monotone inclusion. Connections between monotone
inclusions and equilibrium problems are studied.
