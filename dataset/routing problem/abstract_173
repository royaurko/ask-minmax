This article first addresses applicability of Euclidean models to the domain
of Internet routing. Those models are found (limitedly) applicable. Then a
simplistic model of routing is constructed for Euclidean plane densely covered
with points-routers. The model guarantees low stretch and logarithmical size of
routing tables at any node. The paper concludes with a discussion on
applicability of the model to real-world Internet routing.
