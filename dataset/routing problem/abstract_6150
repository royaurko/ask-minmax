We study a variation of the graph colouring problem on random graphs of
finite average connectivity. Given the number of colours, we aim to maximise
the number of different colours at neighbouring vertices (i.e. one edge
distance) of any vertex. Two efficient algorithms, belief propagation and
Walksat are adapted to carry out this task. We present experimental results
based on two types of random graphs for different system sizes and identify the
critical value of the connectivity for the algorithms to find a perfect
solution. The problem and the suggested algorithms have practical relevance
since various applications, such as distributed storage, can be mapped onto
this problem.
