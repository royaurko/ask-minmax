In this paper, we handle the problem of the motion of the Foucault pendulum.
We explore a new method induced from the De Alembert Principle giving the
motional equations without small-amplitude oscillation approximation. The
result of the problem is illustrated by numerical analysis showing the
non-linear features and then with a comparison with a common method, showing
the merit of this new original method. The result also shows that the argument
changes in near-harmonic mode and the swing plane changes in pulsing way.
