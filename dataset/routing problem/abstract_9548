For a triangle $\Delta$, let (P) denote the problem of the existence of
points in the plane of $\Delta$, that are at rational distance to the 3
vertices of $\Delta$. Answer to (P) is known to be positive in the following
situation: $\Delta$ has one rational side and the square of all sides are
rational. Further, the set of solution-points is dense in the plane of
$\Delta$. See [3] The reader can convince himself that the rationality of one
side is a reasonable minimum condition to set out, otherwise problem (P) would
stay somewhat hazy and scattered. Now, even with the assumption of one rational
side, problem (P) stays hard. In this note, we restrict our attention to
isosceles triangles, and provide a \textit{complete description} of such
triangles for which (P) has a positive answer.
