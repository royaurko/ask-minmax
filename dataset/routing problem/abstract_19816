The predictions of SU(5) supergravity models with radiative breaking
constrained by experimental proton decay bounds are discussed. It is shown that
cosmological constraints further restrict the parameter space but can be
satisfied for a wide range of parameters. It is also shown that no serious fine
tuning problems (either at $M_{SUSY}$ or $M_{GUT}$) exist.
