In 1978, Schaefer proved his famous dichotomy theorem for generalized
satisfiability problems. He defined an infinite number of propositional
satisfiability problems, showed that all these problems are either in P or
NP-complete, and gave a simple criterion to determine which of the two cases
holds. This result is surprising in light of Ladner's theorem, which implies
that there are an infinite number of complexity classes between P and
NP-complete (under the assumption that P is not equal to NP).
  Schaefer also stated a dichotomy theorem for quantified generalized Boolean
formulas, but this theorem was only recently proven by Creignou, Khanna, and
Sudan, and independently by Dalmau: Determining truth of quantified Boolean
formulas is either PSPACE-complete or in P.
  This paper looks at alternation-bounded quantified generalized Boolean
formulas. In their unrestricted forms, these problems are the canonical
problems complete for the levels of the polynomial hierarchy. In this paper, we
prove dichotomy theorems for alternation-bounded quantified generalized Boolean
formulas, by showing that these problems are either $\Sigma_i^p$-complete or in
P, and we give a simple criterion to determine which of the two cases holds.
This is the first result that obtains dichotomy for an infinite number of
classes at once.
