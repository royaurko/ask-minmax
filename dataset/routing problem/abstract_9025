The cosmological moduli problem has been recently reconsidered. Papers [1,2]
show that even heavy moduli (m_\phi > 10^5 GeV) can be a problem for cosmology
if a branching ratio of the modulus into gravitini is large. In this paper, we
discuss the tachyonic decay of moduli into the Standard Model's degrees of
freedom, e.g. Higgs particles, as a resolution to the moduli-induced gravitino
problem. Rough estimates on model dependent parameters set a lower bound on the
allowed moduli at around 10^8 ~ 10^9 GeV.
