In this article we present a review of the Radon transform and the
instability of the tomographic reconstruction process. We show some new
mathematical results in tomography obtained by a variational formulation of the
reconstruction problem based on the minimization of a Mumford-Shah type
functional. Finally, we exhibit a physical interpretation of this new technique
and discuss some possible generalizations.
