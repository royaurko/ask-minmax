Motivated by holography, we explore higher derivative corrections to
four-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) gravity. We point out that in such a
theory the variational problem is generically not well-posed given only a
boundary condition for the metric. However, when one evaluates the higher
derivative terms perturbatively on a leading order Einstein solution, the
equations of motion are always second order and therefore the variational
problem indeed requires only a boundary condition for the metric. The equations
of motion required to compute the spectrum around the corrected background are
still generically higher order, with the additional boundary conditions being
associated with new operators in the dual conformal field theory. We discuss
which higher derivative curvature invariants are expected to arise in the
four-dimensional action from a top-down perspective and compute the corrections
to planar AdS black holes and to the spectrum around AdS in various cases.
Requiring that the dual theory is unitary strongly constrains the higher
derivative terms in the action, as the operators associated with the extra
boundary conditions generically have complex conformal dimensions and
non-positive norms.
