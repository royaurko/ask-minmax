The growing diffusion of wireless-enabled portable devices and the recent
advances in Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs) open new scenarios where users can
benefit from anywhere and at any time for impromptu collaboration. However,
energy constrained nodes, low channel bandwidth, node mobility, high channel
error rates, channel variability and packet loss are some of the limitations of
MANETs. MANETs presents also security challenges. These networks are prone to
malicious users attack, because any device within the frequency range can get
access to the MANET. There is a need for security mechanisms aware of these
challenges. Thus, this work aims to provide a secure MANET by changing the
frequency of data transmission. This security approach was tested, and the
results shows an interesting decreased of throughput from malicious node when
the number of frequency used is increased, that way the MANET will not waste
it's resources treating malicious packets. The other contribution of this work
is a mobility aware routing approach, which aims to provide a more reliable
routing by handling effectively the nodes mobility.
