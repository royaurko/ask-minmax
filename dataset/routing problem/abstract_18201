We consider algorithms for "smoothed online convex optimization" problems, a
variant of the class of online convex optimization problems that is strongly
related to metrical task systems. Prior literature on these problems has
focused on two performance metrics: regret and the competitive ratio. There
exist known algorithms with sublinear regret and known algorithms with constant
competitive ratios; however, no known algorithm achieves both simultaneously.
We show that this is due to a fundamental incompatibility between these two
metrics - no algorithm (deterministic or randomized) can achieve sublinear
regret and a constant competitive ratio, even in the case when the objective
functions are linear. However, we also exhibit an algorithm that, for the
important special case of one-dimensional decision spaces, provides sublinear
regret while maintaining a competitive ratio that grows arbitrarily slowly.
