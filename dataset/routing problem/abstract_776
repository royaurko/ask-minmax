Routing policies used in the Internet can be restrictive, limiting
communication between source-destination pairs to one path, when often better
alternatives exist. To avoid route flapping, recovery mechanisms may be
dampened, making adaptation slow. Unstructured overlays have been proposed to
mitigate the issues of path and performance failures in the Internet by routing
through an indirect-path via overlay peer(s). Choosing alternate-paths in
overlay networks is a challenging issue. Ensuring both availability and
performance guarantees on alternate paths requires aggressive monitoring of all
overlay paths using active probing; this limits scalability. An alternate
technique to select an overlay-path is to bias its selection based on physical
disjointness criteria to bypass the failure on the primary-path. Recently,
several techniques have emerged which can optimize the selection of a
disjoint-path without incurring the high costs associated with probing paths.
In this paper, we show that using only commodity approaches, i.e. running
infrequent traceroutes between overlay hosts, a lot of information can be
revealed about the underlying physical path diversity in the overlay network
which can be used to make informed-guesses for alternate-path selection. We
test our approach using datasets between real-world hosts in AMP and RIPE
networks.
