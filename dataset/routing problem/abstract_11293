We identify an integrable one-dimensional inhomogeneous three-site open spin
chain which arises in the problem of diagonalization of twist-three quark-gluon
evolution equations in QCD in the chiral-odd sector. Making use of the
existence of a non-trivial `hidden' integral of motion the problem of
diagonalization of the evolution kernels is reduced to the study of a second
order finite-difference equation which is solved in WKB approximation for large
conformal spins of the three-particle system. The energies (alias anomalous
dimensions) of eigenstates with different scale dependence are found in
limiting cases and compared with numerical calculations.
