I revisit the so called "bispectral problem" introduced in a joint paper with
Hans Duistermaat a long time ago, allowing now for the differential operators
to have matrix coefficients and for the eigenfunctions, and one of the
eigenvalues, to be matrix valued too. In the last example we go beyond this and
allow both eigenvalues to be matrix valued.
