In this chapter, we show why parallel MATLAB is useful, provide a comparison
of the different parallel MATLAB choices, and describe a number of applications
in Signal and Image Processing: Audio Signal Processing, Synthetic Aperture
Radar (SAR) Processing and Superconducting Quantum Interference Filters
(SQIFs). Each of these applications have been parallelized using different
methods (Task parallel and Data parallel techniques). The applications
presented may be considered representative of type of problems faced by signal
and image processing researchers. This chapter will also strive to serve as a
guide to new signal and image processing parallel programmers, by suggesting a
parallelization strategy that can be employed when developing a general
parallel algorithm. The objective of this chapter is to help signal and image
processing algorithm developers understand the advantages of using parallel
MATLAB to tackle larger problems while staying within the powerful environment
of MATLAB.
