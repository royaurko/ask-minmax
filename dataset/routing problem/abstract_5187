We present constructive solutions to the following P\'olya-Schur problems
concerning linear operators on the space of univariate polynomials: Given
subsets $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ of the complex plane, determine operators
that map all polynomials having no zeros in $\Omega_1$ to polynomials having no
zeros in $\Omega_2$, or to the zero polynomial. We describe an explicit class
consisting of rank 1 operators and product-composition operators that solve the
stated problems for arbitrary $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$; and this class is
shown to comprise all solutions when $\Omega_1$ is bounded and $\Omega_2$ has
non-empty interior. The latter result encompasses a number of open problems
and, moreover, gives explicit solutions in cases of circular domains
$\Omega_1=\Omega_2$ where existing characterizations are non-constructive. The
paper also treats problems stemming from digital signal processing that are
analogous to P\'olya-Schur problems. Specifically, we describe all bounded
linear operators on Hardy space that preserve the class of outer functions, as
well as those that preserve shifted outer functions.
