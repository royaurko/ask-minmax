We comment on the power of the 'standard' solutions to the SUSY flavour and
CP problem based on supergravity and its derivates like mSUGRA in comparison to
the flavour symmetry approach. It is argued that flavour symmetries, and SU(3)
in particular, can not only mimic the situation in supergravity frameworks in
this respect, but sometimes do even better providing at the same time a further
link between the soft and Yukawa sectors, that could be testable at future
experimental facilities.
