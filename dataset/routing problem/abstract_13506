We design, implement, and evaluate GPU-based algorithms for the maximum
cardinality matching problem in bipartite graphs. Such algorithms have a
variety of applications in computer science, scientific computing,
bioinformatics, and other areas. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the
first study which focuses on GPU implementation of the maximum cardinality
matching algorithms. We compare the proposed algorithms with serial and
multicore implementations from the literature on a large set of real-life
problems where in majority of the cases one of our GPU-accelerated algorithms
is demonstrated to be faster than both the sequential and multicore
implementations.
