This is the expanded version of my talk at the workshop "Groups of
Automorphisms in Birational and Affine Geometry", October 29--November 3, 2012,
Levico Terme, Italy. The first section is focused on Jordan groups in abstract
setting, the second on that in the settings of automorphisms groups and groups
of birational self-maps of algebraic varieties. The appendix is the expanded
version of my notes on open problems posted on the site of this workshop. It
contains formulations of some open problems and the relevant comments.
