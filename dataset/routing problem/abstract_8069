The asymptotic state discrimination problem with simple hypotheses is
considered for a cubic lattice of bosons. A complete solution is provided for
the problems of the Chernoff and the Hoeffding bounds and Stein's lemma in the
case when both hypotheses are gauge-invariant Gaussian states with
translation-invariant quasi-free parts.
