Exterior inverse problem for the circular means transform (CMT) arises in the
intravascular photoacoustic imaging (IVPA), in the intravascular ultrasound
imaging (IVUS), as well as in radar and sonar. The reduction of the IPVA to the
CMT is quite straightforward. As shown in the paper, in IVUS the circular means
can be recovered from measurements by solving a certain Volterra integral
equation. Thus, a tomography reconstruction in both modalities requires solving
the exterior problem for the CMT.
  Numerical solution of this problem usually is not attempted due to the
presence of "invisible" wavefronts, which results in severe instability of the
reconstruction. The novel inversion algorithm proposed in this paper yields a
stable partial reconstruction: it reproduces the "visible" part of the image
and blurs the "invisible" part. If the image contains little or no invisible
wavefronts (as frequently happens in the IVPA and IVUS) the reconstruction is
quantitatively accurate. The presented numerical simulations demonstrate the
feasibility of tomography-like reconstruction in these modalities.
