The idea of using fast sweeping methods for solving stationary systems of
conservation laws has previously been proposed for efficiently computing
solutions with sharp shocks. We further develop these methods to allow for a
more challenging class of problems including problems with sonic points, shocks
originating in the interior of the domain, rarefaction waves, and
two-dimensional systems. We show that fast sweeping methods can produce
higher-order accuracy. Computational results validate the claims of accuracy,
sharp shock curves, and optimal computational efficiency.
