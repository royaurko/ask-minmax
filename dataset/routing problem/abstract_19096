It has long been speculated that the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of
SO(D) occurs in matrix models obtained by dimensionally reducing super
Yang-Mills theory in D=6,10 dimensions. In particular, the D=10 case
corresponds to the IIB matrix model, which was proposed as a nonperturbative
formulation of superstring theory, and the SSB may correspond to the dynamical
generation of four-dimensional space-time. Recently, it has been shown by using
the Gaussian expansion method that the SSB indeed occurs for D=6 and D=10, and
interesting nature of the SSB common to both cases has been suggested. Here we
study the same issue from first principles by a Monte Carlo method in the D=6
case. In spite of a severe complex-action problem, the factorization method
enables us to obtain various quantities associated with the SSB, which turn out
to be consistent with the previous results obtained by the Gaussian expansion
method. This also demonstrates the usefulness of the factorization method as a
general approach to systems with the complex-action problem or the sign
problem.
