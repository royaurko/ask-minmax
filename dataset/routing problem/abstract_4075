We solve Hilbert's fifth problem for local groups: every locally euclidean
local group is locally isomorphic to a Lie group. Jacoby claimed a proof of
this in 1957, but this proof is seriously flawed. We use methods from
nonstandard analysis and model our solution after a treatment of Hilbert's
fifth problem for global groups by Hirschfeld.
