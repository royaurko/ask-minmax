We study the efficient approximability of basic graph and logic problems in
the literature when instances are specified hierarchically as in \cite{Le89} or
are specified by 1-dimensional finite narrow periodic specifications as in
\cite{Wa93}. We show that, for most of the problems $\Pi$ considered when
specified using {\bf k-level-restricted} hierarchical specifications or
$k$-narrow periodic specifications the following holds:
  \item Let $\rho$ be any performance guarantee of a polynomial time
approximation algorithm for $\Pi$, when instances are specified using standard
specifications. Then $\forall \epsilon > 0$, $ \Pi$ has a polynomial time
approximation algorithm with performance guarantee $(1 + \epsilon) \rho$. \item
$\Pi$ has a polynomial time approximation scheme when restricted to planar
instances. \end{romannum}
  These are the first polynomial time approximation schemes for PSPACE-hard
hierarchically or periodically specified problems. Since several of the
problems considered are PSPACE-hard, our results provide the first examples of
natural PSPACE-hard optimization problems that have polynomial time
approximation schemes. This answers an open question in Condon et. al.
\cite{CF+93}.
