Recently, the tensor complementarity problem (TCP for short) has been
investigated in the literature. An important question involving the property of
global uniqueness and solvability (GUS-property) for a class of TCPs was
proposed by Song and Qi in their paper "Properties of Some Classes of
Structured Tensors". In the present paper, we give an answer to this question
by constructing two counter-examples. We also show that the solution set of
this class of TCPs is nonempty and compact. In particular, we introduce a class
of related structured tensors, and show that the corresponding TCP has the
GUS-property.
