We present three new complexity results for classes of planning problems with
simple causal graphs. First, we describe a polynomial-time algorithm that uses
macros to generate plans for the class 3S of planning problems with binary
state variables and acyclic causal graphs. This implies that plan generation
may be tractable even when a planning problem has an exponentially long minimal
solution. We also prove that the problem of plan existence for planning
problems with multi-valued variables and chain causal graphs is NP-hard.
Finally, we show that plan existence for planning problems with binary state
variables and polytree causal graphs is NP-complete.
