The main contribution of this work is twofold. First, we apply, for the first
time, a framework borrowed from economics to a problem in the smart grid
namely, the design of signaling schemes between a consumer and an electricity
aggregator when these have non-aligned objectives. The consumer's objective is
to meet its need in terms of power and send a request (a message) to the
aggregator which does not correspond, in general, to its actual need. The
aggregator, which receives this request, not only wants to satisfy it but also
wants to manage the cost induced by the residential electricity distribution
network. Second, we establish connections between the exploited framework and
the quantization problem. Although the model assumed for the payoff functions
for the consumer and aggregator is quite simple, it allows one to extract
insights of practical interest from the analysis conducted. This allows us to
establish a direct connection with quantization, and more importantly, to open
a much more general challenge for source and channel coding.
