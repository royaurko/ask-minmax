The concern of this paper is the Cauchy problem for the Prandtl equation.
This problem is known to be well-posed for analytic data, or for data with
monotonicity properties. We prove here that it is linearly ill-posed in Sobolev
type spaces. The key of the analysis is the construction, at high tangential
frequencies, of unstable quasimodes for the linearization around solutions with
non-degenerate critical points. Interestingly, the strong instability is due to
vicosity, which is coherent with well-posedness results obtained for the
inviscid version of the equation. A numerical study of this instability is also
provided.
