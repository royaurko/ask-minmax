Triethylsilylethynyl anthradithiophene (TESADT) holds considerable promise
for organic transistor applications due to the high electrical mobilities
attained by post-deposition crystallization using solvent vapour annealing. We
have studied thermal annealing as an alternative route to post-deposition
crystallization of TESADT films. Thermal annealing initially appears promising,
producing mm-sized crystal domains, but poor electrical performance is
obtained, which we attribute to a combination of crack formation and
potentially also structural transition during the anneal process. We also find
that illumination has a significant positive effect on crystallization,
possibly due to an optically-induced enhancement in molecular mobility during
annealing. This suggests further studies of how solvent exposure, heat,
substrate surface properties and particularly light exposure influence the
ordering kinetics of TESADT are warranted.
