We characterize the multipartite entanglement of a system of n qubits in
terms of the distribution function of the bipartite purity over all balanced
bipartitions. We search for those (maximally multipartite entangled) states
whose purity is minimum for all bipartitions and recast this optimization
problem into a problem of statistical mechanics.
