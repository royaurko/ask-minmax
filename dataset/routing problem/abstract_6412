First a set of coherent states a la Klauder is formally constructed for the
Coulomb problem in a curved space of constant curvature. Then the flat-space
limit is taken to reduce the set for the radial Coulomb problem to a set of
hydrogen atom coherent states corresponding to both the discrete and the
continuous portions of the spectrum for a fixed \ell sector.
