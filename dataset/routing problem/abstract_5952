When faced with the problem of learning a model of a high-dimensional
environment, a common approach is to limit the model to make only a restricted
set of predictions, thereby simplifying the learning problem. These partial
models may be directly useful for making decisions or may be combined together
to form a more complete, structured model. However, in partially observable
(non-Markov) environments, standard model-learning methods learn generative
models, i.e. models that provide a probability distribution over all possible
futures (such as POMDPs). It is not straightforward to restrict such models to
make only certain predictions, and doing so does not always simplify the
learning problem. In this paper we present prediction profile models:
non-generative partial models for partially observable systems that make only a
given set of predictions, and are therefore far simpler than generative models
in some cases. We formalize the problem of learning a prediction profile model
as a transformation of the original model-learning problem, and show
empirically that one can learn prediction profile models that make a small set
of important predictions even in systems that are too complex for standard
generative models.
