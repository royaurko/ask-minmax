Simple cubic lattice (SC lattice) can be viewed as plane triangular lattice
(PT lattice) by viewing it along its principle diagonal lines. By viewing thus
we establish the exact one-to-one correspondence between the closed graphs on
SC lattice and the corresponding closed graphs on PT lattice. We thus see that
the propagator for PT lattice (with suitable modifications) can be used to
solve, at least in principle, the 3D Ising problem for SC lattice in the
absence of external magnetic field. A new method is then proposed to generate
high temperature expansion for the partition function. This method is
applicable to 2D as well as 3D lattices. This method does not require explicit
counting of closed graphs and this counting is achieved in an indirect way and
thus exact series expansion can be achieved up to any sufficiently large order.
