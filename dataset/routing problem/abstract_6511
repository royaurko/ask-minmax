Estimating the p-th frequency moment of data stream is a very heavily studied
problem. The problem is actually trivial when p = 1, assuming the strict
Turnstile model. The sample complexity of our proposed algorithm is essentially
O(1) near p=1. This is a very large improvement over the previously believed
O(1/eps^2) bound. The proposed algorithm makes the long-standing problem of
entropy estimation an easy task, as verified by the experiments included in the
appendix.
