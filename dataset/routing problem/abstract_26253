The tensor decomposition addressed in this paper may be seen as a
generalisation of Singular Value Decomposition of matrices. We consider general
multilinear and multihomogeneous tensors. We show how to reduce the problem to
a truncated moment matrix problem and give a new criterion for flat extension
of Quasi-Hankel matrices. We connect this criterion to the commutation
characterisation of border bases. A new algorithm is described. It applies for
general multihomogeneous tensors, extending the approach of J.J. Sylvester to
binary forms. An example illustrates the algebraic operations involved in this
approach and how the decomposition can be recovered from eigenvector
computation.
