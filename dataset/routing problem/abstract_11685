We construct all possible noncommutative deformations of a Kleinian
singularity ${\mathbb C}^2/\Gamma$ of type $D_n$ in terms of generators and
relations, and solve the problem of when two deformations are isomorphic. We
prove that all isomorphisms arise naturally from the action of the normalizer
$N_{\SL(2)}(\Gamma)$ on ${\mathbb C}/\Gamma$. We deduce that the moduli space
of isomorphism classes of noncommutative deformations in type $D_n$ is
isomorphic to a vector space of dimension $n$.
