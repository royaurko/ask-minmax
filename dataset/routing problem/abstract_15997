The problem with the temperature dependence of the Casimir force is
investigated. Specifically, the entropy behavior in the low temperature limit,
which caused debates in the literature, is analyzed. It is stressed that the
behavior of the relaxation frequency in the $T\to0$ limit does not play a
physical role since the anomalous skin effect dominates in this range. In
contrast with the previous works, where the approximate Leontovich impedance
was used for analysis of nonlocal effects, we give description of the problem
in terms of exact nonlocal impedances. It is found that the Casimir entropy is
going to zero at $T\to0$ only in the case when $s$ polarization does not
contribute to the classical part of the Casimir force. However, the entropy
approaching zero from the negative side that, in our opinion, cannot be
considered as thermodynamically satisfactory. The resolution of the negative
entropy problem proposed in the literature is analyzed and it is shown that it
cannot be considered as complete. The crisis with the thermal Casimir effect is
stressed.
