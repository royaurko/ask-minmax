This paper considers the problem of estimating multiple related Gaussian
graphical models from a $p$-dimensional dataset consisting of different
classes. Our work is based upon the formulation of this problem as group
graphical lasso. This paper proposes a novel hybrid covariance thresholding
algorithm that can effectively identify zero entries in the precision matrices
and split a large joint graphical lasso problem into small subproblems. Our
hybrid covariance thresholding method is superior to existing uniform
thresholding methods in that our method can split the precision matrix of each
individual class using different partition schemes and thus split group
graphical lasso into much smaller subproblems, each of which can be solved very
fast. In addition, this paper establishes necessary and sufficient conditions
for our hybrid covariance thresholding algorithm. The superior performance of
our thresholding method is thoroughly analyzed and illustrated by a few
experiments on simulated data and real gene expression data.
