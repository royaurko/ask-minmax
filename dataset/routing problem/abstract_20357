The fundamental structure of the full set of solutions of the BCS $^3 P_2$
pairing problem in neutron matter is established. The relations between
different spin-angle components in these solutions are shown to be practically
independent of density, temperature, and the specific form of the pairing
interaction. The spectrum of pairing energies is found to be highly degenerate.
