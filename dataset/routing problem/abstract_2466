We carry over to a quite general noncommutative setting some of the basic
tools of differential geometry, using from the very beginning the setting of
convenient vector spaces developed by Froelicher and Kriegl, which allows to
carry all of multilinear algebra into this kind of functional analysis with
suitably completed tensor products. In the first section we give a short
description of the setting of convenient spaces elaborating those aspects
which are needed later. Then we repeat the usual construction of
noncommutative differential forms for convenient algebras. Next they show that
the bimodule $\Omega\sb n (A)$ of universal non-commutative $n$-forms
represents the functor of the normalized Hochschild $n$-cocycles. In the third
section we introduce the noncommutative version of the Froelicher-Nijenhuis
bracket by investigating all bounded graded derivations of the algebra of
differential forms. This bracket is then used to formulate the concept of
integrability and involutiveness for distributions and to indicate a route
towards a theorem of Frobenius. This is then used to discuss bundles and
connections in the noncommutative setting and to go some steps towards a
noncommutative Chern-Weil homomorphism. In the final section we give a brief
description of the noncommutative version of the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket
and describe Poisson structures.
