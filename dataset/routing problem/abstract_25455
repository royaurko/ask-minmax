We establish some new cases of Artin's conjecture. Our results apply to
Galois representations over $\Q$ with image $S_5$ satisfying certain local
hypotheses, the most important of which is that complex conjugation is
conjugate to $(12)(34)$. In fact, we prove the stronger claim conjectured by
Langlands that these representations are automorphic.
  For the irreducible representations of dimensions 4 and 6, our result follows
from known 2-dimensional cases of Artin's conjecture (proved by Sasaki) as well
as the functorial properties of the Asai transfer proved by Ramakrishnan.
  For the irreducible representations of dimension 5, we encounter the problem
of descending an automorphic form from a quadratic extension compatibly with
the Galois representation. This problem is partly solved by working instead
with a four dimensional representation of some central extension of $S_5$. Our
modularity results in this case are contingent on the non-vanishing of a
certain Dedekind zeta function on the real line in the critical strip. A result
of Booker show that one can (in principle) explicitly verify this
non-vanishing, and with Booker's help we give an example, verifying Artin's
conjecture for representations coming from the (Galois closure) of the quintic
field $K$ of smallest discriminant (1609).
