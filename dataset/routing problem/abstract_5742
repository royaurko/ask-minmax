This paper is concerned with the study of inverse transmission problems for
magnetic Schr\"odinger operators on bounded domains and in all of the Euclidean
space, in the self-adjoint case. Assuming that the magnetic and electric
potentials are known outside of a transparent obstacle, in the bounded domain
case, we show that the obstacle, the transmission coefficients, as well as the
magnetic field and electric potential inside the obstacle are uniquely
determined from the knowledge of the set of the Cauchy data for the
transmission problem, given on an open subset of the boundary of the domain. In
the case of the transmission scattering problem, we obtain the same conclusion,
when the scattering amplitude at a fixed frequency is known. The problems
studied in this work were proposed in [15].
