The problem of recovering a vector from the absolute values of its inner
products against a family of measurement vectors has been well studied in
mathematics and engineering. A generalization of this phase retrieval problem
also exists in engineering: recovering a vector from measurements consisting of
norms of its orthogonal projections onto a family of subspaces. There exist
semidefinite programming algorithms to solve this problem, but much remains
unknown for this more general case. Can families of subspaces for which such
measurements are injective be completely classified? What is the minimal number
of subspaces required to have injectivity? How closely does this problem
compare to the usual phase retrieval problem with families of measurement
vectors? In this paper, we answer or make incremental steps toward these
questions. We provide several characterizations of subspaces which yield
injective measurements, and through a concrete construction, we prove the
surprising result that phase retrieval can be achieved with $2M-1$ projections
of arbitrary rank in $\HH_M$.
  Finally we present several open problems as we discuss issues unique to the
phase retrieval problem with subspaces.
