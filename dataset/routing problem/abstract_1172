We propose the phase dynamics induced by spin waves in a
superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor (SC/FM/SC) Josephson junction. The
resistively shunted junction (RSJ) model, which describes the dynamics of
superconducting phase difference, is extended to include the spin wave
excitation by ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) using the gauge invariant phase
difference between two s-wave superconductors. The current-voltage
characteristics show step structures when the magnetization in FM is driven by
tuning the microwave frequency to FMR in the SC/FM/SC junction. The result
presents a new route to observe the spin wave excitation using the Josephson
effect.
