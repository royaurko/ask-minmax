We deal with the problem of preserving various versions of completeness in
(< kappa) --support iterations of forcing notions, generalizing the case ``S
--complete proper is preserved by CS iterations for a stationary co-stationary
S subseteq omega_1''. We give applications to Uniformization and the Whitehead
problem. In particular, for a strongly inaccessible cardinal kappa and a
stationary set S subseteq kappa with fat complement we can have uniformization
for < A_delta : delta in S'>, A_delta subseteq delta = sup A_delta,
cf(delta)=otp(A_delta) and a stationary non-reflecting set S' subseteq S .
