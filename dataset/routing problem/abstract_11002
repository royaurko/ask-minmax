Correlation functions of the XXZ spin chain in the critical regime is studied
at zero-temperature. They are exactly represented in the Fredholm determinant
form and are related with an operator-valued Riemann-Hilbert problem. Analyzing
this problem we prove that a two-point correlation function consisting of
sufficiently separated spin operators is expressed by power-functions of the
distance between those operators.
