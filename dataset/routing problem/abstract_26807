A common approach to scaling transactional databases in practice is
horizontal partitioning, which increases system scalability, high availability
and self-manageability. Usu- ally it is very challenging to choose or design an
optimal partitioning scheme for a given workload and database. In this
technical report, we propose a fine-grained hyper-graph based database
partitioning system for transactional work- loads. The partitioning system
takes a database, a workload, a node cluster and partitioning constraints as
input and out- puts a lookup-table encoding the final database partitioning
decision. The database partitioning problem is modeled as a multi-constraints
hyper-graph partitioning problem. By deriving a min-cut of the hyper-graph, our
system can min- imize the total number of distributed transactions in the
workload, balance the sizes and workload accesses of the partitions and satisfy
all the partition constraints imposed. Our system is highly interactive as it
allows users to im- pose partition constraints, watch visualized partitioning
ef- fects, and provide feedback based on human expertise and indirect domain
knowledge for generating better partition- ing schemes.
