This paper aims to show that there exist non-symmetry constraints which yield
integrable Hamiltonian systems through nonlinearization of spectral problems of
soliton systems, like symmetry constraints. Taking the AKNS spectral problem as
an illustrative example, a class of such non-symmetry constraints is introduced
for the AKNS system, along with two-dimensional integrable Hamiltonian systems
generated from the AKNS spectral problem.
