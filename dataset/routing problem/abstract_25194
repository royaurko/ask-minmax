The study of systems with multiple (not necessarily degenerate) metastable
states presents subtle difficulties from the mathematical point of view related
to the variational problem that has to be solved in these cases. We introduce
the notion of relaxation height in a general energy landscape and we prove
sufficient conditions which are valid even in presence of multiple metastable
states. We show how these results can be used to approach the problem of
multiple metastable states via the use of the modern theories of metastability.
We finally apply these general results to the Blume--Capel model for a
particular choice of the parameters ensuring the existence of two multiple, and
not degenerate in energy, metastable states.
