"Reverse Nearest Neighbor" query finds applications in decision support
systems, profile-based marketing, emergency services etc. In this paper, we
point out a few flaws in the branch and bound algorithms proposed earlier for
computing monochromatic RkNN queries over data points stored in hierarchical
index. We give suitable counter examples to validate our claims and propose a
correct algorithm for the corresponding problem. We show that our algorithm is
correct by identifying necessary conditions behind correctness of algorithms
for this problem.
