MgB2 wires and tapes suffer from a limitation of the transport current
densities, especially at low field, due to an unsufficient thermal
stabilization caused by hot spots from a non-homogeneous microstructure, the
presence of secondary phases and voids. For the preparation of MgB2 wires and
tapes two different precursor routes, using MgB2 (ex-situ process) or Mg + B
(in-situ process) are applied. The in-situ approach allows variation of many
parameters in the wire preparation and the improvement of this approach is the
central topic of this paper. We present an improved in-situ approach, the
characterization of the filament microstructure, effects from stoichiometry and
the corresponding superconducting properties. The transport current capability
of such in-situ wires could be improved to the level of the reference ex-situ
wires.
