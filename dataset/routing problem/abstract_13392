By using some elementary techniques from operator theory, we prove
constructively prove the existence of solutions to Dirichl\'et problems for
planar Jordan domains with at least two boundary curves. An iterative method is
thus obtained, and explicit bounds on the error in the resulting approximations
are given. Finally, a closed form for the solution is given. No amount of
differentiability of the boundary is assumed.
