Following the continuing interest in the Urysohn space and, more
specifically, the recent problem area of finding and comparing group structures
on the Urysohn space we prove that there exists a non-abelian group structure
on the Urysohn universal metric space. More precisely, we introduce a variant
of the Graev metric that enables us to construct a free group with countably
many generators equipped with a two-sided invariant metric that is isometric to
the rational Urysohn space. We provide several open questions and problems
related to this subject.
