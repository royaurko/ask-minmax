We study the variational problem for $N$-parallel curves on a Finslerian
surface by means of Exterior Differential Systems using Griffiths' method. We
obtain the conditions when these curves are extremals of a length functional
and write the explicit form of Euler-Lagrange equations for this type of
variational problem.
