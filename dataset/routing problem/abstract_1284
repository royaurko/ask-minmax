Using the functional renormalization group technique we demonstrate a route
for potentially high-temperature odd-parity superconductivity in ferromagnetic
materials caused by repulsive electron interactions, where the superconducting
pairing is driven by charge-density wave fluctuations. Our model is directly
applicable to a lightly cobalt-doped LaNiO$_3$ bilayer grown in the (111)
direction. As the on-site repulsive interaction grows, a charge-density wave
state with a charge pattern that respects all point-group symmetries of the
bilayer is replaced by a superconducting state with an f-wave pairing.
