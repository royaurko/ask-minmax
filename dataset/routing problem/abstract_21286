We investigate two open questions in a cohomology theory relative to the
family of finite subgroups. The problem of whether the F-cohomological
dimension is subadditive is reduced to extensions by groups of prime order. We
show that every finitely generated regular branch group has infinite rational
cohomological dimension. Moreover, we prove that the first Grigorchuk group G
is not contained in Kropholler's class HF .
