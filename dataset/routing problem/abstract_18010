We consider a multi-class G/G/1 queue with a finite shared buffer. There is
task admission and server scheduling control which aims to minimize the cost
which consists of holding and rejection components. We construct a policy that
is asymptotically optimal in the heavy traffic limit. The policy stems from
solution to Harrison-Taksar (HT) free boundary problem and is expressed by a
single free boundary point. We show that the HT problem solution translated
into the queuelength processes follows a specific {\it triangular} form. This
form implies the queuelength control policy which is different from the known
$c\mu$ priority rule and has a novel structure.
  We exemplify that the probabilistic methods we exploit can be successfully
applied to solving scheduling and admission problems in cloud computing.
