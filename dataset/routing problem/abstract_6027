In this paper we characterize all the solutions of the three body problem on
which one body with mass $m_1$ remains in a fixed line and the other two bodies
have the same mass $m_2$. We show that all the solutions with negative total
energy (potential plus kinetic), never collide. "Explicit" solutions of the
motion of all the three bodies are given in term of just one solution of an
ordinary differential equation of order two of one real value function. We show
that the solutions of a big subfamily of this family remains bounded for all
time. The same results are shown for the n-body problem. When the body on the
line remains constant, we have provide exact formulas for the solutions --for
any n-- in the same way as we have for the two body problem. Once we have shown
that there are infinitely many periodic solutions, we provide several examples
of periodic examples for the 3-Body, 4-Body, 5-Body and 6-Body problem. This is
a first version. Comments and suggestions for references are welcome. A YouTube
video explaining one of this solutions has been posted on
