This paper is the second part of my overview on photon colliders given at the
conference ``The photon: its first hundred years and the future'' (PHOTON2005 +
PLC2005). The first paper describes the first 25 years of the history and
evolution of photon colliders. The present paper considers the photon collider
at the ILC: possible parameters, technical problems and present status.
