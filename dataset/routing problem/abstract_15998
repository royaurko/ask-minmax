Second order SUSY transformations between real and complex potentials for
three important from physical point of view Sturm-Liouville problems, namely,
problems with the Dirichlet boundary conditions for a finite interval, for a
half axis and for the whole real line are analyzed. For every problem
conditions on transformation functions are formulated when transformations are
irreducible, i.e. when either the intermediate Hamiltonian is not well defined
in the same Hilbert space as the initial and final Hamiltonians or its
eigenfunctions cannot be obtained by applying transformation operator either on
eigenfunctions of the initial Hamiltonian or on these of the final Hamiltonian.
Obtained results are illustrated by numerous simple examples.
