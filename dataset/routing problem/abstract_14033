Statements about entities occur everywhere, from newspapers and web pages to
structured databases. Correlating references to entities across systems that
use different identifiers or names for them is a widespread problem. In this
paper, we show how shared knowledge between systems can be used to solve this
problem. We present "reference by description", a formal model for resolving
references. We provide some results on the conditions under which a randomly
chosen entity in one system can, with high probability, be mapped to the same
entity in a different system.
