Project ILATO focuses on Improving Limited Angle computed Tomography by
Optical data integration in order to enhance image quality and shorten
acquisition times in X-ray based industrial quality inspection. Limited angle
computed tomography is indicated whenever specimen dimensions exceed cone beam
limits or the object is impenetrable from certain angles. Thus, acquiring only
a subset of a full circle CT scan poses problems for reconstruction algorithms
due to incomplete data which introduces blurred edges and other artifacts. To
support volumetric data reconstruction algorithm a surface mesh of the object
obtained via structured light optical scan acts as a mask defining boundaries
of the reconstructed image. The registration of optically acquired surfaces
with data acquired from computed tomography is our current challenge. This
article presents our setup, the methods applied and discusses the problems
arising from registration of data sets created with considerably different
imaging techniques.
