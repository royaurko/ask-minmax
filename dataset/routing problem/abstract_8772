Some of the guiding problems in partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms in
3-manifolds are the following: (1) ergodicity (2) dynamical coherence (3)
classification. A few years ago, the last three contributors posed conjectures
concerning these subjects. In this paper we survey the state of the art in
these problems, and pose new questions.
