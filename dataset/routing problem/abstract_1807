In a magnetic shape memory alloy system, we vary composition following
phenomenological arguments to tune macroscopic properties. We achieve
significantly higher shift in austenite to martensitic phase transition
temperature with magnetic field. This enhancement is accompanied by significant
broadening of the transition and by field-induced arrest of kinetics, both of
which are related to the dynamics of the coexisting phases. This reveals
hitherto unknown interrelationship between different length-scales. This may
serve as an effective route for comprehensive understanding of similar
multicomponent systems which show considerable variation in physical properties
by minor change in microscopic parameters.
