Recently, computational modelling became a very important research tool that
enables us to study problems that for decades evaded scientific analysis.
Evolutionary systems are certainly examples of such problems: they are composed
of many units that might reproduce, diffuse, mutate, die, or in some cases for
example communicate. These processes might be of some adaptive value, they
influence each other and occur on various time scales. That is why such systems
are so difficult to study. In this paper we briefly review some computational
approaches, as well as our contributions, to the evolution of ecosystems and
language. We start from Lotka-Volterra equations and the modelling of simple
two-species prey-predator systems. Such systems are canonical example for
studying oscillatory behaviour in competitive populations. Then we describe
various approaches to study long-term evolution of multi-species ecosystems. We
emphasize the need to use models that take into account both ecological and
evolutionary processes. Finally, we address the problem of the emergence and
development of language. It is becoming more and more evident that any theory
of language origin and development must be consistent with darwinian principles
of evolution. Consequently, a number of techniques developed for modelling
evolution of complex ecosystems are being applied to the problem of language.
We briefly review some of these approaches.
