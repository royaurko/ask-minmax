A branch and bound algorithm is developed for global optimization. Branching
in the algorithm is accomplished by subdividing the feasible set using
ellipses. Lower bounds are obtained by replacing the concave part of the
objective function by an affine underestimate. A ball approximation algorithm,
obtained by generalizing of a scheme of Lin and Han, is used to solve the
convex relaxation of the original problem. The ball approximation algorithm is
compared to SEDUMI as well as to gradient projection algorithms using randomly
generated test problems with a quadratic objective and ellipsoidal constraints.
