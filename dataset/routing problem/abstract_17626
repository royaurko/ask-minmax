We provide the differential equations that generalize the Newtonian N-body
problem of celestial mechanics to spaces of constant Gaussian curvature, k, for
all k real. In previous studies, the equations of motion made sense only for k
nonzero. The system derived here does more than just include the Euclidean case
in the limit when k tends to 0: it recovers the classical equations for k=0.
This new expression of the laws of motion allows the study of the N-body
problem in the context of constant curvature spaces and thus offers a natural
generalization of the Newtonian equations that includes the classical case. We
end the paper with remarks about the bifurcations of the first integrals.
