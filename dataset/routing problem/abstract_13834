In this work we analyze the problem of phase retrieval from Fourier
measurements with random diffraction patterns. To this end, we consider the
recently introduced PhaseLift algorithm, which expresses the problem in the
language of convex optimization. We provide recovery guarantees which require
O(log^2 d) different diffraction patterns, thus improving on recent results by
Candes et al. [arXiv:1310.3240], which require O(log^4 d) different patterns.
