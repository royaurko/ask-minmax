These lectures discuss the $\theta$ parameter of QCD. After an introduction
to anomalies in four and two dimensions, the parameter is introduced. That such
topological parameters can have physical effects is illustrated with two
dimensional models, and then explained in QCD using instantons and current
algebra. Possible solutions including axions, a massless up quark, and
spontaneous CP violation are discussed.
