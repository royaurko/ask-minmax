We consider the problem of link scheduling for throughput maximization in
multihop wireless networks. Majority of previous methods are restricted to
graph-based interference models. In this paper we study the link scheduling
problem using a more realistic physical interference model. Through some key
observations about this model, we develop efficient link scheduling algorithms
by exploiting the intrinsic connections between the physical interference model
and the graph-based interference model. For one variant of the problem where
each node can dynamically adjust its transmission power, we design a scheduling
method with O(g(E)) approximation to the optimal throughput capacity where g(E)
denotes length diversity. For the other variant where each node has a fixed but
possible different transmission powers for different nodes, we design a method
with O(g(E))-approximation ratio when the transmission powers of all nodes are
within a constant factor of each other, and in general with an approximation
ratio of O(g(E)log\rho) where log\rho is power diversity.
  We further prove that our algorithm for fixed transmission power case retains
O(g(E)) approximation for any length-monotone, sub-linear fixed power setting.
Furthermore, all these approximation factors are independent of network size.
