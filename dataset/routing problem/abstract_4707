We study an inverse first-hitting problem for a one-dimensional,
time-homogeneous diffusion $X(t)$ reflected between two boundaries $a$ and $b,$
which starts from a random position $\eta.$ Let $a \le S \le b$ be a given
threshold, such that $P( \eta \in [a,S])=1,$ and $F$ an assigned distribution
function. The problem consists of finding the distribution of $\eta$ such that
the first-hitting time of $X$ to $S$ has distribution $F.$ This is a
generalization of the analogous problem for ordinary diffusions, i.e. without
reflecting, previously considered by the contributor.
