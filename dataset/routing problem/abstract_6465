We revisit singularities of two distinct kinds in the Cauchy problem of
general scalar-tensor theories of gravity (previously discussed in the
literature), and of metric and Palatini f(R) gravity, in both their Jordan and
Einstein frame representations. Examples and toy models are used to shed light
onto the problem and it is shown that, contrary to common lore, the two
conformal frames are equivalent with respect to the initial value problem.
