We show that arbitrary homeomorphic solutions to the Beltrami equations with
generalized derivatives satisfy certain moduli inequalities. On this basis, we
develope the theory of the boundary behavior of such solutions and prove a
series of criteria for the existence of regular, pseudoregular and multi-valued
solutions for the Dirichlet problem to the Beltrami equations in arbitrary
Jordan domains and in arbitrary finitely connected domains bounded by mutually
disjoint Jordan curves, correspondingly.
