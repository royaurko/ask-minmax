In this paper, we prove the existence of a classical solution to a Neumann
boundary problem for Hessian equations in uniformly convex domain. The methods
depend upon the established of a priori derivative estimates up to second
order. So we give a affirmative answer to a conjecture of N. Trudinger in 1986.
