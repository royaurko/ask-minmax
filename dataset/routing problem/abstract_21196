In this work, based on a realization of an inhomogeneous Poisson process
whose intensity function depends on a real unknown parameter, we consider a
simple hypothesis against a sequence of close (contiguous) alternatives. Under
certain regularity conditions we obtain the power loss of the score test with
respect to the Neyman-Pearson test. The power loss measures the performance of
a second order efficient test by the help of third order asymptotic properties
of the problem under consideration.
