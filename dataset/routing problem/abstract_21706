We study the (non-uniform) quantified constraint satisfaction problem QCSP(H)
as H ranges over partially reflexive cycles. We obtain a complexity-theoretic
dichotomy: QCSP(H) is either in NL or is NP-hard. The separating conditions are
somewhat esoteric hence the epithet "wavy line of tractability".
