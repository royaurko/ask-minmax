We present a principled spectral approach to the well-studied constrained
clustering problem. It reduces clustering to a generalized eigenvalue problem
on Laplacians. The method works in nearly-linear time and provides concrete
guarantees for the quality of the clusters, at least for the case of 2-way
partitioning. In practice this translates to a very fast implementation that
consistently outperforms existing spectral approaches. We support this claim
with experiments on various data sets: our approach recovers correct clusters
in examples where previous methods fail, and handles data sets with millions of
data points - two orders of magnitude larger than before.
