We revisit a one-step control problem over an adversarial packet-dropping
link. The link is modeled as a set of binary channels controlled by a strategic
jammer whose intention is to wage a `denial of service' attack on the plant by
choosing a most damaging channel-switching strategy. The paper introduces a
class of zero-sum games between the jammer and controller as a scenario for
such attack, and derives necessary and sufficient conditions for these games to
have a nontrivial saddle-point equilibrium. At this equilibrium, the jammer's
optimal policy is to randomize in a region of the plant's state space, thus
requiring the controller to undertake a nontrivial response which is different
from what one would expect in a standard stochastic control problem over a
packet dropping channel.
