The now-famous Majumdar-Papapetrou exact solution of the Einstein-Maxwell
equations describes, in general, $N$ static, maximally charged black holes
balanced under mutual gravitational and electrostatic interaction. When $N=2$,
this solution defines the two-black-hole spacetime, and the relativistic
two-center problem is the problem of geodesic motion on this static background.
Contopoulos and a number of other workers have recently discovered through
numerical experiments that in contrast with the Newtonian two-center problem,
where the dynamics is completely integrable, relativistic null-geodesic motion
on the two black-hole spacetime exhibits chaotic behavior. Here I identify the
geometric sources of this chaotic dynamics by first reducing the problem to
that of geodesic motion on a negatively curved (Riemannian) surface.
