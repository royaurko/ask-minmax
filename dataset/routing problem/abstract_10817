This paper extends the recent investigation of the string theory landscape in
hep-th/0605266, where it was found that the decay rate of dS vacua to a
collapsing space with a negative vacuum energy can be quite large. The parts of
space that experience a decay to a collapsing space, or to a Minkowski vacuum,
never return back to dS space. The channels of irreversible vacuum decay serve
as sinks for the probability flow. The existence of such sinks is a
distinguishing feature of the string theory landscape. We describe relations
between several different probability measures for eternal inflation taking
into account the existence of the sinks. The local (comoving) description of
the inflationary multiverse suffers from the so-called Boltzmann brain (BB)
problem unless the probability of the decay to the sinks is sufficiently large.
We show that some versions of the global (volume-weighted) description do not
have this problem even if one ignores the existence of the sinks. We argue that
if the number of different vacua in the landscape is large enough, the
anthropic solution of the cosmological constant problem in the string landscape
scenario should be valid for a broad class of the probability measures which
solve the BB problem. If this is correct, the solution of the cosmological
constant problem may be essentially measure-independent. Finally, we describe a
simplified approach to the calculations of anthropic probabilities in the
landscape, which is less ambitious but also less ambiguous than other methods.
