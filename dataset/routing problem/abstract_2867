Motivated by a nonlocal free boundary problem, we study uniform properties of
solutions to a singular perturbation problem for a boundary-reaction-diffusion
equation, where the reaction term is of combustion type. This boundary problem
is related to the fractional Laplacian. After an optimal uniform H\"older
regularity is shown, we pass to the limit to study the free boundary problem it
leads to.
