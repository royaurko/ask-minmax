A stochastic cellular automata (CA) model for pedestrian dynamics is
presented. Our goal is to simulate different types of pedestrian movement, from
regular to panic. But here we emphasize regular situations which imply that
pedestrians analyze environment and choose their route more carefully. And
transition probabilities have to depict such effect. The potentials of floor
fields and environment analysis are combined in the model obtained. People
patience is included in the model. This makes simulation of pedestrians
movement more realistic. Some simulation results are presented and comparison
with basic FF-model is made.
