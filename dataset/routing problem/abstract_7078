Boucksom, Favre and Jonsson establish in [4] an analog of Diskant's
inequality in convex geometry for nef and big line bundles on a complete
algebraic variety over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero
(Theorem F [4]), from which they deduce a solution (Theorem D [4]) to a problem
of Teissier (Problem B [29]) on proportionality of nef divisors. In this paper
we extend these results to a complete variety over an arbitrary field k.
