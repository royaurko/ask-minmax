In this paper we describe an original computational model for solving
different types of Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problems (DCSP). The
proposed model is called Controller-Agents for Constraints Solving (CACS). This
model is intended to be used which is an emerged field from the integration
between two paradigms of different nature: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the
Constraint Satisfaction Problem paradigm (CSP) where all constraints are
treated in central manner as a black-box. This model allows grouping
constraints to form a subset that will be treated together as a local problem
inside the controller. Using this model allows also handling non-binary
constraints easily and directly so that no translating of constraints into
binary ones is needed. This paper presents the implementation outlines of a
prototype of DCSP solver, its usage methodology and overview of the CACS
application for timetabling problems.
