We consider the problem of computing upper and lower bounds on the price of a
European basket call option, given prices on other similar baskets. Although
this problem is very hard to solve exactly in the general case, we show that in
some instances the upper and lower bounds can be computed via simple
closed-form expressions, or linear programs. We also introduce an efficient
linear programming relaxation of the general problem based on an integral
transform interpretation of the call price function. We show that this
relaxation is tight in some of the special cases examined before.
