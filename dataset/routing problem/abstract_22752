The problem of the classical deterministic dynamics of a particle in a
periodic asymmetric potential of the ratchet type is addressed. When the
inertial term is taken into account, the dynamics can be chaotic and modify the
transport properties. By a comparison between the bifurcation diagram and the
current, we identify the origin of the current reversal as a bifurcation from a
chaotic to a periodic regime. Close to this bifurcation, we observed
trajectories revealing intermittent chaos and anomalous deterministic
diffusion. We extend our previous analysis of this problem to include multiple
current reversal and the orbits in phase space.
