In this paper, we consider the nonlinear fractional Schr\"odinger equations
with Hartree type nonlinearity. We obtain the existence of standing waves by
studying the related constrained minimization problems by applying the
concentration-compactness principle. Via symmetric decreasing rearrangements,
we also show that the standing waves, up to a translations and phases, are
positive symmetric nonincreasing functions. Moreover, we prove that the set of
minimizers is a stable set for the initial value problem of the equations, that
is, a solution whose initial data is near the set will remain near it for all
time.
