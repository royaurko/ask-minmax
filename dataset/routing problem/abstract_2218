In two-dimensional multivalley semiconductors, at low doping, even a moderate
electron-electron interaction enhances the response to any perturbation
inducing a valley polarization. If the valley polarization is due to the
electron-phonon coupling, the electron-electron interaction results in an
enhancement of the superconducting critical temperature. By performing first
principles calculations beyond density functional theory, we prove that this
effect accounts for the unconventional doping-dependence of the superconducting
transition-temperature (T$_c$) and of the magnetic susceptibility measured in
Li$_x$ZrNCl. By finding the conditions for a maximal T$_c$ enhancement, we show
how weakly-doped two-dimensional semiconductors provide a route towards high
T$_c$ superconductivity.
