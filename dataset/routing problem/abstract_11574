Let E and F be Banach spaces, let A be a subset of E, and let s \ge 0. A map
f: A -> F is an s-nearisometry if |x-y|-s \le |fx-fy| \le |x-y|+s for all x,y
in A. The article gives a survey on the stability problem: How well can an
s-nearisometry be approximated by a true isometry? The first result on this
problem was given by Hyers and Ulam in 1945 for surjective nearisometries
between Hilbert spaces.
  The present article contains an addendum to the published paper, giving
recent results on nearsurjective maps of Banach spaces.
