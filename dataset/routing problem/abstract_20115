We discuss adjunction formulas for fiber spaces and embeddings, extending the
known results along the lines of the Adjunction Conjecture, independently
proposed by Y. Kawamata and V.V. Shokurov.
  As an application, we simplify Koll\'ar's proof for the Anghern and Siu's
quadratic bound in the Fujita's Conjecture. We also connect adjunction and its
precise inverse to the problem of building isolated log canonical
singularities.
