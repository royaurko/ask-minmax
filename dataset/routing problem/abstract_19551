We present the results of 16 hours of ongoing observations of the galactic
center region (including Sagittarius A*) with the Whipple High Energy Gamma-Ray
Telescope. We apply a data analysis method optimized for large zenith angle
observations on an independent Crab Nebula data set. We discuss possible
systematic problems associated with observations of extended sources in the
galactic plane.
