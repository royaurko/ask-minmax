A phase transition, like the one already found on Boolean satisfiability
problem by Kirkpatrick and Selman, is found on max clique problem on ER graphs.
Although number of the datapoints is limited, the transition seems to obey
finite size scaling. The transition also shows concentration of the graph
instances which need particularly large CPU time to solve.
