This is a study of a problem in geodesy with methods from complex algebraic
geometry: for a fixed number of measure points and target points at unknown
position in the Euclidean plane, we study the problem of determining their
relative position when the viewing angles between target points seen from
measure points are known. In particular, we determine all situations in which
there is more than one solution.
