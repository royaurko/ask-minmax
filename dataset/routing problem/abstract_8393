In this paper, we develop several related finite dimensional variational
principles for discrete optimal transport (DOT), Minkowski type problems for
convex polytopes and discrete Monge-Ampere equation (DMAE). A link between the
discrete optimal transport, discrete Monge-Ampere equation and the power
diagram in computational geometry is established.
