Euclidean dense matter generically suffers from the fermion sign problem.
However, we argue that the sign problem is absent if one considers only
low-energy degrees of freedom. Specifically, the low energy effective theory of
dense QCD has positive Euclidean path integral measure, which allows one to
establish rigorous inequalities showing that the color-flavor locked (CFL)
phase is the true vacuum of three flavor, massless QCD. We then describe a
method for simulating dense QCD on the lattice. We also discuss applications to
electronic systems in condensed matter, such as generalized Hubbard models.
