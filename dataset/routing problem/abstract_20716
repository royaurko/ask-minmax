Scattering problem for electrons in monolayer graphene with short-range
perturbations of the types "local chemical potential" and "local gap" has been
solved. Zero gap and non-zero gap kinds of graphene are considered. The
determined S-matrix can be used for calculation of such observables as
conductance and optical absorption.
