Various string models of mesons and baryons include a string carrying 2 or 3
massive points (quarks or antiquarks). Rotational states (planar uniform
rotations) of these systems generate quasilinear Regge trajectories and may be
used for describing excited hadron states on these trajectories. For different
string models of baryon we are to solve the problem of choice between them and
the stability problem for their rotational states. An unexpected result is that
for the Y string baryon model these rotations are unstable with respect to
small disturbances on the classical level. This instability has specific
feature, disturbances grow linearly, whereas for the linear string baryon model
they grow exponentially and may increase predictions for baryon's width
$\Gamma$. The classical instability of rotational states and nonstandard Regge
slope are the arguments in favor of the stable simplest model of string with
massive ends both for baryons and mesons. Rotational states of this model with
two types of spin-orbit correction are used to describe Regge trajectories for
light, strange, charmed, bottom mesons and for $N$, $\Delta$, $\Sigma$,
$\Lambda$ and $\Lambda_c$ baryons.
