We construct solutions of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations with
nonlinear boundary conditions in spaces where the problem is supercritical and
show the nonlinear balance required between the nonlinear terms in order to
obtain a dissipative system. Assuming this balance, the dynamics of the
solutions is the same that take place in subcritical spaces.
