We study solvability of the {\it generalized Possio integral equation} - a
tool in analysis of a boundary value problem in 2D subsonic aeroelasticity with
the Kutta-Joukowski condition - {\it "zero pressure discontinuity"} -
$\psi(x,0,t)=0$ on the complement of a finite interval in the whole real line
$\R$. The corresponding problem with boundary condition on finite intervals
adjacent to the "chord" was considered in \cite{P}.
