We investigate the properties of the operator
\Delta(\sigma\Delta.):H^2_0(\Omega)-> H^{-2}(\Omega), where \sigma is a given
parameter whose sign can change on the bounded domain \Omega. Here,
H^2_0(\Omega) denotes the subspace of H^2(\Omega) made of the functions w such
that w=\nu.\nabla w=0 on the boundary. The study of this problem arises when
one is interested in some configurations of the Interior Transmission
Eigenvalue Problem. We prove that \Delta(\sigma\Delta.):H^2_0(\Omega)->
H^{-2}(\Omega) is a Fredholm operator of index zero as soon as \sigma\in
L^{\infty}(\Omega), with \sigma^{-1}\in L^{\infty}(\Omega), is such that \sigma
remains uniformly positive (or uniformly negative) in a neighbourhood of the
boundary. We also study configurations where \sigma changes sign on the
boundary and we prove that Fredholm property can be lost for such situations.
In the process, we examine in details the features of a simpler problem where
the boundary condition \nu.\nabla v=0 is replaced by \sigma\Delta v=0.
