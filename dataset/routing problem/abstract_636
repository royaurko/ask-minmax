Two different Reverse Monte Carlo strategies, 'RMC++' and 'RMCPOW', have been
compared for determining the microscopic structure of some liquid and amorphous
solid systems on the basis of neutron diffraction measurements. The first,
'$g(r)$ route', exploits the isotropic nature of liquids and calculates the
total scattering structure factor, $S(Q)$, via a one-dimensional Fourier
transform of the radial distribution function. The second, called
'crystallography' route, is based on the direct calculation of $S(Q)$ in the
reciprocal space from the atomic positions in the simulation box. We describe
these two methods and apply them to four disordered systems of increasing
complexity. The two approaches yield structures in good agreement to the level
of two- and three body correlations; consequently, it has been proven that the
'crystallography route' can also deal perfectly with disordered materials. This
finding is important for future studies of liquids confined in porous media,
where handling Bragg and diffuse scattering simultaneously is unavoidable.
