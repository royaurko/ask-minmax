We studied an electron-induced metal-insulator transition in a two-terminal
device based on oxide NdNiO3. In our device, the NdNiO3 is electrostatically
doped by the voltage applied between the terminals, resulting in an asymmetric
conductivity with respect to the bias polarity. The asymmetry is
temperature-dependent and is most significant near the metal-insulator
transition. The I-V characteristics exhibit a strong dependence both on the
thermal history and the history of the applied voltage bias. Our two-terminal
device represents a simple and efficient route for studies of the effect of
electron doping on the metal-insulator transition.
