The seesaw mechanism is attractive not only because it "explains'' small
neutrino mass, but also because of its packaging with the SUSY-GUT,
leptogenesis, Dark Matter, and electroweak symmetry breaking. However, this
package has the flavor, CP, and gravitino problems. I discuss two alternatives
to the seesaw mechanism. In one of them, the anomaly-mediated supersymmetry
breaking solves these problems, while predicts naturally light Dirac neutrinos.
In the other, the light Majorana neutrinos arise from supersymmetry breaking
with right-handed neutrinos below TeV, and the Dark Matter and collider
phenomenology are significantly different.
