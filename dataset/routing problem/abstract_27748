Dense particulate flow simulations using integral equation methods demand
accurate evaluation of Stokes layer potentials on arbitrarily close interfaces.
In this paper, we generalize techniques for close evaluation of Laplace
double-layer potentials in J. Helsing and R. Ojala, J. Comput. Phys. 227 (2008)
2899-2921. We create a "globally compensated" trapezoid rule quadrature for the
Laplace single-layer potential on the interior and exterior of smooth curves.
This exploits a complex representation, a product quadrature (in the style of
Kress) for the sawtooth function, careful attention to branch cuts, and
second-kind barycentric-type formulae for Cauchy integrals and their
derivatives. Upon this we build accurate single- and double-layer Stokes
potential evaluators by expressing them in terms of Laplace potentials. We test
their convergence for vesicle-vesicle interactions, for an extensive set of
Laplace and Stokes problems, and when applying the system matrix in a boundary
value problem solver in the exterior of multiple close-to-touching ellipses. We
achieve typically 12 digits of accuracy using very small numbers of
discretization nodes per curve. We provide documented codes for other
researchers to use.
