State-space models (SSMs) are increasingly used in ecology to model
time-series such as animal movement paths and population dynamics. This type of
hierarchical model is often structured to account for two levels of
variability: biological stochasticity and measurement error. SSMs are flexible.
They can model linear and nonlinear processes using a variety of statistical
distributions. Recent ecological SSMs are often complex, with a large number of
parameters to estimate. Through a simulation study, we show that even simple
linear Gaussian SSMs can suffer from parameter- and state-estimation problems.
Using the ecological example that led us to discover this problem, we show how
these estimation problems can affect ecological inference. Biased parameter
estimates of a SSM describing the movement of polar bears (\textit{Ursus
maritimus}) result in overestimating their energy expenditure. We suggest
potential solutions, but show that it often remains difficult to estimate
parameters. While SSMs are powerful tools, they can give misleading results and
we urge ecologists to assess whether the parameters can be estimated accurately
before drawing ecological conclusions from their results.
