We consider the complete Euler system describing the time evolution of an
inviscid non-isothermal gas. We show that the rarefaction wave solutions of the
1D Riemann problem are stable, in particular unique, in the class of all
bounded weak solutions to the associated multi-D problem. This may be seen as a
counterpart of the non-uniqueness results of physically admissible solutions
emanating from 1D shock waves constructed recently by the method of convex
integration.
