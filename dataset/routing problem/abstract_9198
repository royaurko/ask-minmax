In this paper we investigate the complexity of abduction, a fundamental and
important form of non-monotonic reasoning. Given a knowledge base explaining
the world's behavior it aims at finding an explanation for some observed
manifestation. In this paper we consider propositional abduction, where the
knowledge base and the manifestation are represented by propositional formulae.
The problem of deciding whether there exists an explanation has been shown to
be \SigPtwo-complete in general. We focus on formulae in which the allowed
connectives are taken from certain sets of Boolean functions. We consider
different variants of the abduction problem in restricting both the
manifestations and the hypotheses. For all these variants we obtain a
complexity classification for all possible sets of Boolean functions. In this
way, we identify easier cases, namely \NP-complete, \coNP-complete and
polynomial cases. Thus, we get a detailed picture of the complexity of the
propositional abduction problem, hence highlighting sources of intractability.
Further, we address the problem of counting the explanations and draw a
complete picture for the counting complexity.
