We propose using the predictability of human motion to eliminate the overhead
of distributed location services in human-carried MANETs, dubbing the technique
location profile routing. This method outperforms the Geographic Hashing
Location Service when nodes change locations 2x more frequently than they
initiate connections (e.g., start new TCP streams), as in applications like
text- and instant-messaging. Prior characterizations of human mobility are used
to show that location profile routing achieves a 93% delivery ratio with a
1.75x first-packet latency increase relative to an oracle location service.
