Search is a central problem in artificial intelligence, and BFS and DFS the
two most fundamental ways to search. In this report we derive results for
average BFS and DFS runtime: For tree search, we employ a probabilistic model
of goal distribution; for graph search, the analysis depends on an additional
statistic of path redundancy and average branching factor. As an application,
we use the results on two concrete grammar problems. The runtime estimates can
be used to select the faster out of BFS and DFS for a given problem, and may
form the basis for further analysis of more advanced search methods. Finally,
we verify our results experimentally; the analytical approximations come
surprisingly close to empirical reality.
