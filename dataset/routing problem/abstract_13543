We propose a new formulation of the problem of prime factorization of
integers. With replica exchange Monte Carlo simulation, the behavior which is
seemed to indicate exponential computational hardness is observed. But this
formulation is expected to give a new insight into the computational complexity
of this problem from a statistical mechanical point of view.
