The Quantize & Forward (QF) scheme for two-way relaying is studied with a
focus on its rate-distortion properties. A sum rate maximization problem is
formulated and the associated quantizer optimization problem is investigated.
An algorithm to approximately solve the problem is proposed. Under certain
cases scalar quantizers maximize the sum rate.
