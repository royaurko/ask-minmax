First part of this paper was published in CEJM (2)(4) (2004), 1-15. It is
proved now that $$ \int_0^T|E^*(t)|^5{\rm d}t \ll_\epsilon T^{2+\epsilon}. $$
Here $$ E^*(t) = E(t) - 2\pi\Delta^*(t/2\pi), \Delta^*(x) = - \Delta(x)
+2\Delta(2x) - {1\over2}\Delta(4x), $$ where $E(t)$ is the error term in the
mean square formula for $|\zeta(1/2+it)|$ and $\Delta(x)$ is the error term in
the Dirichlet divisor problem. It is also shown how bounds for moments of
$|E^*(t)|$ lead to bounds for moments of $|\zeta(1/2+it)|$.
