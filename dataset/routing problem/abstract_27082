In a dissipative system the time to reach an attractor is often influenced by
the peculiarities of the model and in particular by the strength of the
dissipation. In particular, as a dissipative model we consider the spin-orbit
problem providing the dynamics of a triaxial satellite orbiting around a
central planet and affected by tidal torques. The model is ruled by the
oblateness parameter of the satellite, the orbital eccentricity, the
dissipative parameter and the drift term. We devise a method which provides a
reliable indication on the transient time which is needed to reach an attractor
in the spin-orbit model; the method is based on an analytical result, precisely
a suitable normal form construction. This method provides also information
about the frequency of motion. A variant of such normal form used to
parametrize invariant attractors provides a specific formula for the drift
parameter, which in turn yields a constraint - which might be of interest in
astronomical problems - between the oblateness of the satellite and its orbital
eccentricity.
