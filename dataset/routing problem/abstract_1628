Internet is a complex network composed by several networks: the Autonomous
Systems, each one designed to transport information efficiently. Routing
protocols aim to find paths between nodes whenever it is possible (i.e., the
network is not partitioned), or to find paths verifying specific constraints
(e.g., a certain QoS is required). As connectivity is a measure related to both
of them (partitions and selected paths) this work provides a formal lower bound
to it based on core-decomposition, under certain conditions, and low complexity
algorithms to find it. We apply them to analyze maps obtained from the
prominent Internet mapping projects, using the LaNet-vi open-source software
for its visualization.
