Recent advances in computing, communication, and data storage have led to an
increasing number of large digital libraries publicly available on the
Internet. Main problem of content-based video retrieval is inferring semantics
from raw video data. Video data play an important role in these libraries.
Instead of words, a video retrieval system deals with collections of video
records. Therefore, the system is confronted with the problem of video
understanding. Because machine understanding of the video data is still an
unsolved research problem, text annotations are usually used to describe the
content of video data according to the annotator's understanding and the
purpose of that video data. Most of proposed systems for video annotation are
domain dependent. In addition, in many of these systems, an important feature
of video data, temporality, is disregarded. In this paper, we proposed a
framework for video temporal annotation. The proposed system uses domain
knowledge and a time ontology to perform temporal annotation of input video.
