The paper presents formulation and solution for the problem of determination
of spatial spectrum of artificial ionospheric irregularities from vertical HF
radio sounding data on anomalous attenuation. The suggested method uses the
dependence of extraordinary wave attenuation caused by multiple scattering from
the irregularities on frequency to obtain the spectrum parameters. The method
is applied to the data obtained in experiments with Sura heating facility
carried out on September 6-9, 1999.
