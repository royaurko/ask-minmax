In this paper, we introduce a split general quasi-variational inequality
problem which is a natural extension of split variational inequality problem,
quasi-variational and variational inequality problems in Hilbert spaces. Using
projection method, we propose an iterative algorithm for the split general
quasi-variational inequality problem and discuss some its special cases.
Further, we discuss the convergence criteria of these iterative algorithms. The
results presented in this paper generalize, unify and improve the previously
known many results for the quasi-variational and variational inequality
problems.
