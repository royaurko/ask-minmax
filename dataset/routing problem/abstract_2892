The value 1 problem is a decision problem for probabilistic automata over
finite words: are there words accepted by the automaton with arbitrarily high
probability? Although undecidable, this problem attracted a lot of attention
over the last few years. The aim of this paper is to review and relate the
results pertaining to the value 1 problem. In particular, several algorithms
have been proposed to partially solve this problem. We show the relations
between them, leading to the following conclusion: the Markov Monoid Algorithm
is the most correct algorithm known to (partially) solve the value 1 problem.
