Creating virtual models of real spaces and objects is cumbersome and time
consuming. This paper focuses on the problem of geometric reconstruction from
sparse data obtained from certain image-based modeling approaches. A number of
elegant and simple-to-state problems arise concerning when the geometry can be
reconstructed. We describe results and counterexamples, and list open problems.
