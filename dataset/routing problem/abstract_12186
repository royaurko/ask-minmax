We study the Cauchy problem for a quasilinear wave equation with
low-regularity data. A space-time $L^2$ estimate for the variable coefficient
wave equation plays a central role for this purpose. Assuming radial symmetry,
we establish the almost global existence of a strong solution for every small
initial data in $H^2 \times H^1$. We also show that the initial value problem
is locally well-posed.
