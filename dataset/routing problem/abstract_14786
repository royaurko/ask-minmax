Equations for correlation functions, here referred to as Reynolds-
Kraichnan-Lewis equations (RKLE), are considered and their wide application is
indicated. Perturbation and non-perturbation solutions are given. To elucidate
a closure problem - various forms of equations are presented. Exact, closed
equations for the projected correlation functions are derived.
