The 18Ne(a,p)21Na reaction provides one of the main HCNO-breakout routes into
the rp-process in X-ray bursts. The 18Ne(a,p_0)21Na reaction cross section has
been determined for the first time in the Gamow energy region for peak
temperatures T=2GK by measuring its time-reversal reaction 21Na(p,a)18Ne in
inverse kinematics. The astrophysical rate for ground-state to ground-state
transitions was found to be a factor of 2 lower than Hauser-Feshbach
theoretical predictions. Our reduced rate will affect the physical conditions
under which breakout from the HCNO cycles occurs via the 18Ne(a,p)21Na
reaction.
