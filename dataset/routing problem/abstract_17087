A new method for the solution of initial-boundary value problems for
\textit{linear} and \textit{integrable nonlinear} evolution PDEs in one spatial
dimension was introduced by one of the contributors in 1997 \cite{F1997}. This
approach was subsequently extended to initial-boundary value problems for
evolution PDEs in two spatial dimensions, first in the case of linear PDEs
\cite{F2002b} and, more recently, in the case of integrable nonlinear PDEs, for
the Davey-Stewartson and the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili II equations on the
half-plane (see \cite{FDS2009} and \cite{MF2011} respectively). In this work,
we study the analogous problem for the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili I equation; in
particular, through the simultaneous spectral analysis of the associated Lax
pair via a d-bar formalism, we are able to obtain an integral representation
for the solution, which involves certain transforms of all the initial and the
boundary values, as well as an identity, the so-called global relation, which
relates these transforms in appropriate regions of the complex spectral plane.
