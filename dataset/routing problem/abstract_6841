Post Embedding Problems are a family of decision problems based on the
interaction of a rational relation with the subword embedding ordering, and are
used in the literature to prove non multiply-recursive complexity lower bounds.
We refine the construction of Chambart and Schnoebelen (LICS 2008) and prove
parametric lower bounds depending on the size of the alphabet.
