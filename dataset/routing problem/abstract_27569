The model averaging problem is to average multiple models to achieve a
prediction accuracy not much worse than that of the best single model in terms
of mean squared error. It is known that if the models are misspecified, model
averaging is superior to model selection. Specifically, let $n$ be the sample
size, then the worst case regret of the former decays at a rate of $O(1/n)$
while the worst case regret of the latter decays at a rate of $O(1/\sqrt{n})$.
The recently proposed $Q$-aggregation algorithm solves the model averaging
problem with the optimal regret of $O(1/n)$ both in expectation and in
deviation; however it suffers from two limitations: (1) for continuous
dictionary, the proposed greedy algorithm for solving $Q$-aggregation is not
applicable; (2) the formulation of $Q$-aggregation appears ad hoc without clear
intuition. This paper examines a different approach to model averaging by
considering a Bayes estimator for deviation optimal model averaging by using
exponentiated least squares loss. We establish a primal-dual relationship of
this estimator and that of $Q$-aggregation and propose new computational
procedures that satisfactorily resolve the above mentioned limitations of
$Q$-aggregation.
