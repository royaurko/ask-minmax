We stress that a natural solution of the $\mu$ problem requires two
ingredients: a symmetry that would enforce $\mu = 0$ as well as the occurence
of a small breaking parameter that generates a nonzero $\mu$. It is suggested
that both the Peccei-Quinn symmetry and the spontaneously broken $R$ symmetry
may be the sources of the needed $\mu$ term in the minimal supersymmetric
standard model provided that they are spontaneously broken at a scale
$10^{10}-10^{12}$ GeV. To solve the strong CP problem with a hidden sector
confining group, both of these symmetries are needed in superstring models with
an anomalous $U(1)_A$.
