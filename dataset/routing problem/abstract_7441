As standardly implemented in R or in the Tetrad program, causal search
algorithms that have been most widely or effectively used in scientific
problems have severe dimensionality constraints. However, implementation
improvements are possible that extend the feasible dimensionality of search
problems by several orders of magnitude. We describe optimizations for the
Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) that allow search on 50,000 variable problems
in 13 minutes for sparse models with 1000 samples, on a 4 processor 8G laptop
computer, and in 18 hours for sparse models with 1000 samples on 1,000,000
variables on a supercomputer node at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center with
40 processors and 384 G RAM, on data generated i.i.d. from a linear, Gaussian
model.
