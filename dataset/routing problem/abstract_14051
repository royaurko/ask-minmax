We consider the problem of converting offline estimators into an online
predictor or estimator with small extra regret. Formally this is the problem of
merging a collection of probability measures over strings of length 1,2,3,...
into a single probability measure over infinite sequences. We describe various
approaches and their pros and cons on various examples. As a side-result we
give an elementary non-heuristic purely combinatoric derivation of Turing's
famous estimator. Our main technical contribution is to determine the
computational complexity of online estimators with good guarantees in general.
