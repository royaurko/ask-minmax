We investigate the stability of few body symmetrical dynamical systems which
include four and five body symmetrical dynamical systems. Research presented in
this thesis includes the following original investigations: determination of
some analytical solutions of the four body problem; stability analysis of the
near symmetric coplanar CSFBP ; derivation of the analytical stability
criterion valid for all time for a special symmetric configuration of the
general five-body problem, the CS5BP, which exhibits many of the salient
characteristics of the general five body problem; numerical investigation of
the hierarchical stability of the CS5BP and derivation of the stability
criterion for the CSNBP.
