We discuss two versions of the Fr\'echet distance problem in weighted planar
subdivisions. In the first one, the distance between two points is the weighted
length of the line segment joining the points. In the second one, the distance
between two points is the length of the shortest path between the points. In
both cases, we give algorithms for finding a (1+epsilon)-factor approximation
of the Fr\'echet distance between two polygonal curves. We also consider the
Fr\'echet distance between two polygonal curves among polyhedral obstacles in
R^3 and present a (1+epsilon)-factor approximation algorithm.
