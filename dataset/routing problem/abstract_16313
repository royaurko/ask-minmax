We study symmetric systems with dissipative boundary conditions. The
solutions of the mixed problems for such systems are given by a contraction
semigroup $V(t)f = e^{tG_b}f, t \geq 0$. The solutions $u(t, x) = V(t)f$, where
$f$ is an eigenfunction of the generator $G_b$ with eigenvalue $\lambda,\Re
\lambda < 0,$ are called asymptotically disappearing (ADS). We prove that the
wave operators are not complete if there exist (ADS). This is the case for
Maxwell system with special boundary conditions in the exterior of the sphere.
We obtain a representation of the scattering kernel and we examine the inverse
back-scattering problem related to the leading term of the scattering kernel.
