One of our result is that 5 measurable sets in $R^8$ always admit an
equipartition by 2 hyperplanes. This is an instance of a general equipartition
problem (formulated by B. Gr{\" u}nbaum and H. Hadwiger) which can be reduced
to the question of (non)existence of a $W_k$-equivariant map where $W_k$ is the
group of symmetries of a $k$-cube. We show that the computation of relevant
cohomology/bordism obstruction classes often reduces to the question of
enumerating the classes of immersed curves in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with a prescribed
type and number of intersections with the coordinate axes, which in turn leads
to a problem of enumerating classes of cyclic signed $AB$-words.
