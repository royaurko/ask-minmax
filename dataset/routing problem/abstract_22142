This paper addresses source localization problem in a random shallow water
channel. We present an extension of the generalized MUSIC method to the case,
%in which when the signal correlation matrix is imprecisely known. The
algorithm is validated by %simulations and its application to the experimental
data observed in the Barents Sea. It has been found that the approach proposed
demonstrates its excellent performance.
