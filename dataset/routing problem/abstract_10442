The nature of binary black hole coalescence is the final, uncharted frontier
of the relativistic Kepler problem. In the United States, binary black hole
coalescence has been identified as a computational ``Grand Challenge'' whose
solution is the object of a coordinated effort, just reaching its half-way
point, by more than two-score researchers at nearly a dozen institutions. In
this report I highlight what I see as the most serious problems standing
between us and a general computational solution to the problem of binary black
hole coalescence:
  * the computational burden associated of the problem based on reasonable
extrapolations of present-day computing algorithms and near-term hardware
developments;
  * some of the computational issues associated with those estimates, and
how, through the use of different or more sophisticated computational
algorithms we might reduce the expected burden; and
  * some of the physical problems associated with the development of a
numerical solution of the field equations for a binary black hole system,
with particular attention to work going on in, or in association with, the
Grand Challenge.
