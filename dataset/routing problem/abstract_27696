This paper develops upper and lower bounds for the probability of Boolean
functions by treating multiple occurrences of variables as independent and
assigning them new individual probabilities. We call this approach dissociation
and give an exact characterization of optimal oblivious bounds, i.e. when the
new probabilities are chosen independent of the probabilities of all other
variables. Our motivation comes from the weighted model counting problem (or,
equivalently, the problem of computing the probability of a Boolean function),
which is #P-hard in general. By performing several dissociations, one can
transform a Boolean formula whose probability is difficult to compute, into one
whose probability is easy to compute, and which is guaranteed to provide an
upper or lower bound on the probability of the original formula by choosing
appropriate probabilities for the dissociated variables. Our new bounds shed
light on the connection between previous relaxation-based and model-based
approximations and unify them as concrete choices in a larger design space. We
also show how our theory allows a standard relational database management
system (DBMS) to both upper and lower bound hard probabilistic queries in
guaranteed polynomial time.
