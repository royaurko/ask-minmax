In this paper, we use various ansatzes with undetermined functions and the
technique of moving frame to find solutions with parameter functions modulo the
Lie point symmetries for the classical non-steady boundary layer problems.
These parameter functions enable one to find the solutions of some related
practical models and boundary value problems.
