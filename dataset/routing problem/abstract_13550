In this paper, the feasibility of using finite totally ordered probability
models under Alelinnas's Theory of Probabilistic Logic [Aleliunas, 1988] is
investigated. The general form of the probability algebra of these models is
derived and the number of possible algebras with given size is deduced. Based
on this analysis, we discuss problems of denominator-indifference and
ambiguity-generation that arise in reasoning by cases and abductive reasoning.
An example is given that illustrates how these problems arise. The
investigation shows that a finite probability model may be of very limited
usage.
