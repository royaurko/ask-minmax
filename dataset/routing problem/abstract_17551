In this paper we propose a scalarization proximal point method to solve
multiobjective unconstrained minimization problems with locally Lipschitz and
quasiconvex vector functions. We prove, under natural assumptions, that the
sequence generated by the method is well defined and converges globally to a
Pareto-Clarke critical point. Our method may be seen as an extension, for the
non convex case, of the inexact proximal method for multiobjective convex
minimization problems studied by Bonnel et al. (SIAM Journal on Optimization
15, 4, 953-970, 2005).
