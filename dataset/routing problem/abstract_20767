Autoregressive processes are intensively studied in statistics and other
fields of applied stochastics. For many applications the overshoot and the
threshold-time are of special interest. When the upward innovations are in the
class of phasetype distributions we determine the joint distribution of this
two quantities and apply this result to problems of optimal stopping. Using a
principle of continuous fit this leads to explicit solutions.
