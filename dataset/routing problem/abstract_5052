The inverse problem of diffraction theory in essence amounts to the
reconstruction of the atomic positions of a solid from its diffraction image.
  From a mathematical perspective, this is a notoriously difficult problem,
even in the idealised situation of perfect diffraction from an infinite
structure.
  Here, the problem is analysed via the autocorrelation measure of the
underlying point set, where two point sets are called homometric when they
share the same autocorrelation. For the class of mathematical quasicrystals
within a given cut and project scheme, the homometry problem becomes equivalent
to Matheron's covariogram problem, in the sense of determining the window from
its covariogram. Although certain uniqueness results are known for convex
windows, interesting examples of distinct homometric model sets already emerge
in the plane.
  The uncertainty level increases in the presence of diffuse scattering.
Already in one dimension, a mixed spectrum can be compatible with structures of
different entropy. We expand on this example by constructing a family of mixed
systems with fixed diffraction image but varying entropy. We also outline how
this generalises to higher dimension.
