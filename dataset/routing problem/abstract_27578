In this paper, the paper is devoted to study the Cauchy problem for the
inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation that arises naturally in many physical
applications related to the radiation field, vibration phenomena. Under
specific assumptions, we prove the ill-posedness of the problem in a particular
situation. Applying the truncation regularization method, we establish the
regularized solution and show that it converges to the exact solution as the
perturbation in given data tends to zero. Besides, the error estimate and
regularization parameter are formulated. Our theoretical result is guaranteed
by a numerical example.
