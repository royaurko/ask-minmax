We explore the problems in calculating the decay constant for heavy-light
mesons using the quenched Wilson quark action for both heavy and light quarks.
We find that the continuum limit of the decay constant is reasonably converged
among different prescriptions after the continuum limit is taken. A number of
technical problems associated with prescriptions are also addressed.
