A celebrated theorem of Savitch states that NSPACE(S) is contained in
DSPACE(S^2). In particular, Savitch gave a deterministic algorithm to solve
ST-CONNECTIVITY (an NL-complete problem) using O(log^2{n}) space, implying NL
is in DSPACE(log^2{n}). While Savitch's theorem itself has not been improved in
the last four decades, studying the space complexity of several special cases
of ST-CONNECTIVITY has provided new insights into the space-bounded complexity
classes.
  In this paper, we introduce new kind of graph connectivity problems which we
call graph realizability problems. All of our graph realizability problems are
generalizations of UNDIRECTED ST-CONNECTIVITY. ST-REALIZABILITY, the most
general graph realizability problem, is LogCFL-complete. We define the
corresponding complexity classes that lie between L and LogCFL and study their
relationships.
  As special cases of our graph realizability problems we define two natural
problems, BALANCED ST-CONNECTIVITY and POSITIVE BALANCED ST-CONNECTIVITY, that
lie between L and NL. We present a deterministic O(lognloglogn) space algorithm
for BALANCED ST-CONNECTIVITY. More generally we prove that SGSLogCFL, a
generalization of BALANCED ST-CONNECTIVITY, is contained in
DSPACE(lognloglogn). To achieve this goal we generalize several concepts (such
as graph squaring and transitive closure) and algorithms (such as parallel
algorithms) known in the context of UNDIRECTED ST-CONNECTIVITY.
