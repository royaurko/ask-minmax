This paper provides an analysis of human mobility data in an urban area using
the amount of available bikes in the stations of the community bicycle program
Bicing in Barcelona. The data was obtained by periodic mining of a KML-file
accessible through the Bicing website. Although in principle very noisy, after
some preprocessing and filtering steps the data allows to detect temporal
patterns in mobility as well as identify residential, university, business and
leisure areas of the city. The results lead to a proposal for an improvement of
the bicing website, including a prediction of the number of available bikes in
a certain station within the next minutes/hours. Furthermore a model for
identifying the most probable routes between stations is briefly sketched.
