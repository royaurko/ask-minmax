We discuss the efficient implementation of Hamiltonian BVMs (HBVMs), a
recently introduced class of energy preserving methods for canonical
Hamiltonian systems, via their blended formulation. We also discuss the case of
separable problems, for which the structure of the problem can be exploited to
gain efficiency.
