In the present paper we consider an inverse source problem for
time-fractional mixed parabolic-hyperbolic equation with the Caputo derivative.
In case, when hyperbolic part of the considered mixed type equation is wave
equation, the uniqueness of source and solution are strongly influenced by
initial time and generally is ill-posed. However, when the hyperbolic part is
time fractional, the problem is well posed if end time is large. Our method
relies on the orthonormal system of eigenfunctions of the operator with respect
to space variable. We proved the uniqueness and stability of certain weak
solutions for considered problems.
