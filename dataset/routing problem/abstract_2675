Building on the technological success of the IceCube neutrino telescope, we
outline a prospective low-energy extension that utilizes the clear ice of the
South Pole. Aiming at a 10 Mton effective volume and a 10 MeV threshold, the
detector would provide sufficient sensitivity to detect neutrino bursts from
core-collapse supernovae (SNe) in nearby galaxies. The detector geometry and
required density of instrumentation are discussed along with the requirements
to control the various sources of background, such as solar neutrinos. In
particular, the suppression of spallation events induced by atmospheric muons
poses a challenge that will need to be addressed. Assuming this background can
be controlled, we find that the resulting detector will be able to detect SNe
from beyond 10 Mpc, delivering between 10 and 41 regular core-collapse SN
detections per decade. It would further allow to study more speculative
phenomena, such as optically dark (failed) SNe, where the collapse proceeds
directly to a black hole, at a detection rate similar to that of regular SNe.
We find that the biggest technological challenge lies in the required number of
large area photo-sensors, with simultaneous strict limits on the allowed noise
rates. If both can be realized, the detector concept we present will reach the
required sensitivity with a comparatively small construction effort and hence
offers a route to future routine observations of SNe with neutrinos.
