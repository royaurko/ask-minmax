Solving the Kohn-Sham eigenvalue problem constitutes the most computationally
expensive part in self-consistent density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
In a previous paper, we have proposed a nonlinear Chebyshev-filtered subspace
iteration method, which avoids computing explicit eigenvectors except at the
first SCF iteration. The method may be viewed as an approach to solve the
original nonlinear Kohn-Sham equation by a nonlinear subspace iteration
technique, without emphasizing the intermediate linearized Kohn-Sham eigenvalue
problem. It reaches self-consistency within a similar number of SCF iterations
as eigensolver-based approaches. However, replacing the standard
diagonalization at each SCF iteration by a Chebyshev subspace filtering step
results in a significant speedup over methods based on standard
diagonalization. Here, we discuss an approach for implementing this method in
multi-processor, parallel environment. Numerical results are presented to show
that the method enables to perform a class of highly challenging DFT
calculations that were not feasible before.
