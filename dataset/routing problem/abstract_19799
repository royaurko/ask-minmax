In this proceeding we propose a new procedure to impose the Schroedinger
functional Dirichlet boundary condition on the overlap Dirac operator and the
domain-wall fermion using an orbifolding projection.
 With this procedure the zero mode problem with Dirichlet boundary condition
can easily be avoided.
