We provide a unified treatment of a broad class of noisy structure recovery
problems, known as structured normal means problems. In these problems, the
goal is to identify, from a finite collection of Gaussian distributions with
different means, the distribution that produced the observed data. Recent work
has studied several special cases including sparse vectors, biclusters, and
graph-based structures. We establish nearly matching upper and lower bounds on
the minimax probability of error for any structured normal means problem. We
also derive an optimality certificate for the maximum likelihood estimator,
which can be applied to many instantiations. We consider an experimental design
setting, where we generalize our minimax bounds and derive an algorithm for
computing a design strategy with a certain optimality property. We show that
our results give tight minimax bounds for many structure recovery problems and
consider some consequences for interactive sampling.
