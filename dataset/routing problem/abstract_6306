We study, from a constructive computational point of view, the techniques
used to solve the conjugacy problem in the "generic" lattice-ordered group
Aut(R) of order automorphisms of the real line. We use these techniques in
order to show that for each choice of parameters f,g in Aut(R), the equation
xfx=g is effectively solvable in Aut(R).
