We apply the Ginzburg criterion to the dimer problem and we solve the
apparent contradiction of a system with mean field $\alpha={1\over2}$, the
typical value of tricritical systems, and upper critical dimension $D_{cr}=6$.
We find that the system has upper critical dimension $D_{cr}=6$ , while for
$D\le4$ it should undergo a first order phase transition. We comment on the
latter wrong result examining the approximation we used.
