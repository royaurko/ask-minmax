We investigate detailed kinematical properties of simulated collisionless
merger remnants of disk galaxies with mass ratios of 1:1 and 3:1. The
simulations were performed by direct summation using the new special hardware
device GRAPE-5. In agreement with observations, the shape of the line-of-sight
velocity distribution (LOSVD) is Gaussian with small deviations. For most cases
we find that the retrograde wings of the LOSVD are steeper than the prograde
ones. This is in contradiction with observations which show broad retrograde
and steep prograde wings. This serious problem in the collisionless formation
scenario of massive elliptical galaxies can be solved if all rotating
ellipticals, even boxy ones, contain an additional stellar disk component with
$\propto 15%$ of the total stellar mass and a scale length of order the
effective radius of the spheroid. We propose that the progenitor galaxies of
massive ellipticals must have contained a significant amount of gas that did
not condense into stars during the merger process itself but formed an extended
gaseous disk before the star formation epoch. The heating source that prevented
the gas from forming stars early and the origin of the large specific angular
momentum required for the gas component to form an extended disk are still
unsolved problems.
