The problem of the stability of a nonlinear thermomagnetic wave with respect
to small thermal and electromagnetic perturbations in hard superconductors was
studied. It is shown that spatially bounded solutions may correspond only to
the perturbations decaying with time, which implies stability of the nonlinear
thermomagnetic wave.
