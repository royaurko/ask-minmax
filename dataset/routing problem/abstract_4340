The Neumann problem in two-dimensional domain with a narrow slit is studied.
The width of the slit is a small parameter. The complete asymptotic expansion
for the eigenvalue of the perturbed problem converging to a simple eigenvalue
of the limiting problem is constructed by means of the method of the matched
asymptotic expansions. It is shown that the regular perturbation theory can
formally be applied in a natural way up to terms of order $\epsilon^2$.
However, the result obtained in that way is false. The correct result can be
obtained only by means of inner asymptotic expansion.
