Topological insulators are a new class of materials that support
topologically protected electronic surface states. Potential applications of
the surface states in low dissipation electronic devices have motivated efforts
to create nanoscale samples with large surface-to-volume ratios and highly
controlled stoichiometry. Se vacancies in Bi2Se3 give rise to bulk conduction,
which masks the transport properties of the surface states. We have therefore
developed a new route for the synthesis of topological insulator nanostructures
using metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). MOCVD allows for control
of the Se/Bi flux ratio during growth. With the aim of rational growth, we vary
the Se/Bi flux ratio, growth time, and substrate temperature, and observe
morphological changes which indicate a growth regime in which nanoribbon
formation is limited by the Bi precursor mass-flow. MOCVD growth of Bi2Se3
nanostructures occurs via a distinct growth mechanism that is nucleated by gold
nanoparticles at the base of the nanowire. By tuning the reaction conditions,
we obtain either single-crystalline ribbons up to 10 microns long or thin
micron-sized platelets.
