The Busemann-Petty problem asks whether origin-symmetric convex bodies in
$\mathbb{R}^n$ with smaller central hyperplane sections necessarily have
smaller $n$-dimensional volume. It is known that the answer to this problem is
affirmative if $n\le 4$ and negative if $n\ge 5$. We study this problem in
hyperbolic and spherical spaces.
