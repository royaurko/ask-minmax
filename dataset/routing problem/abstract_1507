We present a new framework for the crucial challenge of self-organization of
a large sensor network. The basic scenario can be described as follows: Given a
large swarm of immobile sensor nodes that have been scattered in a polygonal
region, such as a street network. Nodes have no knowledge of size or shape of
the environment or the position of other nodes. Moreover, they have no way of
measuring coordinates, geometric distances to other nodes, or their direction.
Their only way of interacting with other nodes is to send or to receive
messages from any node that is within communication range. The objective is to
develop algorithms and protocols that allow self-organization of the swarm into
large-scale structures that reflect the structure of the street network,
setting the stage for global routing, tracking and guiding algorithms.
