We derive several kinetic equations to model the large scale, low Fresnel
number behavior of the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation with a rapidly
fluctuating random potential. There are three types of kinetic equations the
longitudinal, the transverse and the longitudinal with friction. For these
nonlinear kinetic equations we address two problems: the rate of dispersion and
the singularity formation.
  For the problem of dispersion, we show that the kinetic equations of the
longitudinal type produce the cubic-in-time law, that the transverse type
produce the quadratic-in-time law and that the one with friction produces the
linear-in-time law for the variance prior to any singularity.
  For the problem of singularity, we show that the singularity and blow-up
conditions in the transverse case remain the same as those for the homogeneous
NLS equation with critical or supercritical self-focusing nonlinearity, but
they have changed in the longitudinal case and in the frictional case due to
the evolution of the Hamiltonian.
