We consider the model checking problem for probabilistic pushdown automata
(pPDA) and properties expressible in various probabilistic logics. We start
with properties that can be formulated as instances of a generalized random
walk problem. We prove that both qualitative and quantitative model checking
for this class of properties and pPDA is decidable. Then we show that model
checking for the qualitative fragment of the logic PCTL and pPDA is also
decidable. Moreover, we develop an error-tolerant model checking algorithm for
PCTL and the subclass of stateless pPDA. Finally, we consider the class of
omega-regular properties and show that both qualitative and quantitative model
checking for pPDA is decidable.
