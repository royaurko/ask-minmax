In this article, we collect the recent results concerning the representations
of integers as sums of an even number of squares that are inspired by
conjectures of Kac and Wakimoto. We start with a sketch of Milne's proof of two
of these conjectures. We also show an alternative route to deduce these two
conjectures from Milne's determinant formulas for sums of $4s^2$, respectively
$4s(s+1)$, triangular numbers. This approach is inspired by Zagier's proof of
the Kac--Wakimoto formulas via modular forms. We end the survey with recent
conjectures of the first contributor and Chua.
