A steady scalar convection-diffusion problem has been studied for one and two
dimensional cases. The major problem of unrealistic oscillations of the
convection dominated problems is relaxed thanks to the wide range of the
elements FEMLAB 3.1 benefits. The FEMLAB 3.1 solution has been presented for
the problems, unique features and illustrations of the software have been used
and results have been tested against analytic solution.
