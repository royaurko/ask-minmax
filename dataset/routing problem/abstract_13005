We study the probability distribution and the escape rate in systems with
delayed dissipation that comes from the coupling to a thermal bath. To
logarithmic accuracy in the fluctuation intensity, the problem is reduced to a
variational problem. It describes the most probable fluctuational paths, which
are given by acausal equations due to the delay. In thermal equilibrium, the
most probable path passing through a remote state has time reversal symmetry,
even though one cannot uniquely define a path that starts from a state with
given system coordinate and momentum. The corrections to the distribution and
the escape activation energy for small delay and small noise correlation time
are obtained in the explicit form.
