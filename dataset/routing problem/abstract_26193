This paper deals with the problem of reconstructing a band-limited signal
when a finite subset of its samples and of its derivative are missing. The
technique used, due to P.J.S.G. Ferreira, is based on the use of a particular
frame for band-limited functions and the relative oversampling formulas. We
study the eigenvalues of the matrices arising in the procedure of recovering
the lost samples, finding estimates of their eigenvalues and their dependence
on the oversampling parameter and on the number of missing samples.
  When the missing samples are consecutive, the problem may become very
ill-conditioned. We present a numerical procedure to overcome this difficulty,
also in presence of noisy data, by using Tikhonov regularization techniques.
