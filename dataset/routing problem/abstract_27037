An important problem in time series analysis is the discrimination between
non-stationarity and longrange dependence. Most of the literature considers the
problem of testing specific parametric hypotheses of non-stationarity (such as
a change in the mean) against long-range dependent stationary alternatives. In
this paper we suggest a simple nonparametric approach, which can be used to
test the null-hypothesis of a general non-stationary short-memory against the
alternative of a non-stationary long-memory process. This test is working in
the spectral domain and uses a sieve of approximating tvFARIMA models to
estimate the time varying long-range dependence parameter nonparametrically. We
prove uniform consistency of this estimate and asymptotic normality of an
averaged version. These results yield a simple test (based on the quantiles of
the standard normal distribution), and it is demonstrated in a simulation study
that - despite of its nonparametric nature - the new test outperforms the
currently available methods, which are constructed to discriminate between
specific parametric hypotheses of non-stationarity short- and stationarity
long-range dependence.
