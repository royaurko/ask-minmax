The problem of quickest change detection is studied, where there is an
additional constraint on the cost of observations used before the change point
and where the post-change distribution is composite. Minimax formulations are
proposed for this problem. It is assumed that the post-change family of
distributions has a member which is least favorable in some sense. An algorithm
is proposed in which on-off observation control is employed using the least
favorable distribution, and a generalized likelihood ratio based approach is
used for change detection. Under the additional condition that either the
post-change family of distributions is finite, or both the pre- and post-change
distributions belong to a one parameter exponential family, it is shown that
the proposed algorithm is asymptotically optimal, uniformly for all possible
post-change distributions.
