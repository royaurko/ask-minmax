Within the framework of variational modelling we derive a two-phase moving
boundary problem that describes the motion of a semipermeable membrane
separating two viscous liquids in a fixed container. The model includes the
effects of osmotic pressure and surface tension of the membrane. For this
problem we prove that the manifold of steady states is locally exponentially
attractive.
