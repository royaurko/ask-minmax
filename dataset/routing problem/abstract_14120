We consider the mixed matrix moments for the complex Ginibre ensemble. These
are well-known. We consider the relation to the expected overlap functions of
Chalker and Mehlig. This leads to new asymptotic problems for the overlap. We
obtain some results, but we also state some remaining open problems.
