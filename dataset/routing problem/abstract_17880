Let $c, k$ be two positive integers and let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph. The
$(c,k)$-Load Coloring Problem (denoted $(c,k)$-LCP) asks whether there is a
$c$-coloring $\varphi: V \rightarrow [c]$ such that for every $i \in [c]$,
there are at least $k$ edges with both endvertices colored $i$. Gutin and Jones
(IPL 2014) studied this problem with $c=2$. They showed $(2,k)$-LCP to be fixed
parameter tractable (FPT) with parameter $k$ by obtaining a kernel with at most
$7k$ vertices. In this paper, we extend the study to any fixed $c$ by giving
both a linear-vertex and a linear-edge kernel. In the particular case of $c=2$,
we obtain a kernel with less than $4k$ vertices and less than $8k$ edges. These
results imply that for any fixed $c\ge 2$, $(c,k)$-LCP is FPT and that the
optimization version of $(c,k)$-LCP (where $k$ is to be maximized) has an
approximation algorithm with a constant ratio for any fixed $c\ge 2$.
