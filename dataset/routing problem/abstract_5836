We address the Monge problem in metric spaces with a geodesic distance: (X,
d) is a Polish space and dL is a geodesic Borel distance which makes (X,dL) a
non branching geodesic space. We show that under the assumption that geodesics
are d-continuous and locally compact, we can reduce the transport problem to
1-dimensional transport problems along geodesics. We introduce two assumptions
on the transport problem {\pi} which imply that the conditional probabilities
of the first marginal on each geodesic are continuous or absolutely continuous
w.r.t. the 1- dimensional Hausdorff distance induced by dL. It is known that
this regularity is sufficient for the construction of a transport map. We study
also the dynamics of transport along the geodesic, the stability of our
conditions and show that in this setting dL-cyclical monotonicity is not
sufficient for optimality.
