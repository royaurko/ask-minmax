We obtain exact solutions of Dirac equation at zero kinetic energy for radial
power-law relativistic potentials. It turns out that these are the relativistic
extension of a subclass of exact solutions of Schrodinger equation with
two-term power-law potentials at zero energy. The latter is solved by point
canonical transformation of the exactly solvable problem of the three
dimensional oscillator. The wavefunction solutions are written in terms of the
confluent hypergeometric functions and almost always square integrable. For
most cases these solutions support bound states at zero energy. Some
exceptional unbounded states are normalizable for non-zero angular momentum.
Using a generalized definition, degeneracy of the nonrelativistic states is
demonstrated and the associated degenerate observable is defined.
