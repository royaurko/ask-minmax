This paper studies a resilient control problem for discrete-time, linear
time-invariant systems subject to state and input constraints. State
measurements and control commands are transmitted over a communication network
and could be corrupted by adversaries. In particular, we consider the replay
attackers who maliciously repeat the messages sent from the operator to the
actuator. We propose a variation of the receding-horizon control law to deal
with the replay attacks and analyze the resulting system performance
degradation. A class of competitive (resp. cooperative) resource allocation
problems for resilient networked control systems is also investigated.
