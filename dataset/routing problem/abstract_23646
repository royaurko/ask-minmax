The notion of isomorphism of stable AF-C*-algebras is considered in this
paper in the case when the corresponding Bratteli diagram is stationary, i.e.,
is associated with a single square primitive nonsingular incidence matrix.
C*-isomorphism induces an equivalence relation on these matrices, called
C*-equivalence. We show that the associated isomorphism equivalence problem is
decidable, i.e., there is an algorithm that can be used to check in a finite
number of steps whether two given primitive nonsingular matrices are
C*-equivalent or not.
