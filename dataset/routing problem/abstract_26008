This paper combines the idea of a hierarchical distributed genetic algorithm
with different inter-agent partnering strategies. Cascading clusters of
sub-populations are built from bottom up, with higher-level sub-populations
optimising larger parts of the problem. Hence higher-level sub-populations
search a larger search space with a lower resolution whilst lower-level
sub-populations search a smaller search space with a higher resolution. The
effects of different partner selection schemes for (sub-)fitness evaluation
purposes are examined for two multiple-choice optimisation problems. It is
shown that random partnering strategies perform best by providing better
sampling and more diversity.
