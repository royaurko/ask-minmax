We propose an attractive scenario of grand unified theories in which
doublet-triplet splitting is beautifully realized in SO(10) unification using
Dimopoulos-Wilczek mechanism. The anomalous U(1)_A gauge symmetry plays
essential roles in the doublet-triplet splitting mechanism. It is interesting
that the anomalous U(1)_A charges determine the unification scale and mass
spectrum of additional particles as well as the order of Yukawa couplings of
quarks and leptons. For the neutrino sector, bi-maximal mixing angles are
naturally obtained and proton decay via dimension 5 operators is suppressed. It
is suggestive that the anomalous U(1)_A gauge symmetry motivated by superstring
theory excellently solves the two biggest problems in grand unified theories,
fermion mass hierarchy problem and doublet-triplet splitting problem.
