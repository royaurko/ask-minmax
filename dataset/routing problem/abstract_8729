We study a 2-phase free boundary problem for harmonic measure first
considered by Kenig and Toro and prove a sharp H\"older regularity result. The
central difficulty is that there is no a priori non-degeneracy in the free
boundary condition. Thus we must establish non-degeneracy by means of
monotonicity formulae.
