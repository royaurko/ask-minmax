The four major asymptotic level density laws of random matrix theory may all
be showcased though their Jacobi parameter representation as having a bordered
Toeplitz form. We compare and contrast these laws, completing and exploring
their representations in one place. Inspired by the bordered Toeplitz form, we
propose an algorithm for the finite moment problem by proposing a solution
whose density has a bordered Toeplitz form.
