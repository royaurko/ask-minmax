We consider power allocation for an access-controlled transmitter with energy
harvesting capability based on causal observations of the channel fading state.
We assume that the system operates in a time-slotted fashion and the channel
gain in each slot is a random variable which is independent across slots.
Further, we assume that the transmitter is solely powered by a renewable energy
source and the energy harvesting process can practically be predicted. With the
additional access control for the transmitter and the maximum power constraint,
we formulate the stochastic optimization problem of maximizing the achievable
rate as a Markov decision process (MDP) with continuous state. To efficiently
solve the problem, we define an approximate value function based on a piecewise
linear fit in terms of the battery state. We show that with the approximate
value function, the update in each iteration consists of a group of convex
problems with a continuous parameter. Moreover, we derive the optimal solution
to these convex problems in closed-form. Further, we propose power allocation
algorithms for both the finite- and infinite-horizon cases, whose computational
complexity is significantly lower than that of the standard discrete MDP method
but with improved performance. Extension to the case of a general payoff
function and imperfect energy prediction is also considered. Finally,
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms closely approach
the optimal performance.
