At NNLO it is particularly important to have a Variable-Flavour Number Scheme
(VFNS) to deal with heavy quarks because there are major problems with both the
zero mass variable-flavour number scheme and the fixed-flavour number scheme. I
illustrate these problems and present a general formulation of a
Variable-Flavour Number Scheme (VFNS)for heavy quarks that is explicitly
implemented up to NNLO in the strong coupling constant alpha_S, and may be used
in NNLO global fits for parton distributions. The procedure combines elements
of the ACOT(chi) scheme and the Thorne-Roberts scheme. Despite the fact that at
NNLO the parton distributions are discontinuous as one changes the number of
active quark flavours, all physical quantities are continuous at flavour
transitions and the comparison with data is successful.
