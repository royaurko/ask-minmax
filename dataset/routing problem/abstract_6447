This is a preliminary version of an article to appear in the forthcoming
Ashgate Companion to the New Philosophy of Physics. I don't advocate any
particular approach to the measurement problem (not here, at any rate!) but I
do focus on the importance of decoherence theory to modern attempts to solve
the measurement problem, and I am fairly sharply critical of some aspects of
the "traditional" formulation.
