An inequality for the reverse Bossel-Daners inequality is derived by means of
the harmonic transplantation and the first shape derivative. This method is
then applied to elliptic boundary value problems with inhomogeneous Neumann
conditions. The first variation is computed and an isoperimetric inequality is
derived for the minimal energy.
