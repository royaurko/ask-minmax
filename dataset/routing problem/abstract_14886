This paper presents the design and analysis of parallel approximation
algorithms for facility-location problems, including $\NC$ and $\RNC$
algorithms for (metric) facility location, $k$-center, $k$-median, and
$k$-means. These problems have received considerable attention during the past
decades from the approximation algorithms community, concentrating primarily on
improving the approximation guarantees. In this paper, we ask, is it possible
to parallelize some of the beautiful results from the sequential setting?
  Our starting point is a small, but diverse, subset of results in
approximation algorithms for facility-location problems, with a primary goal of
developing techniques for devising their efficient parallel counterparts. We
focus on giving algorithms with low depth, near work efficiency (compared to
the sequential versions), and low cache complexity. Common in algorithms we
present is the idea that instead of picking only the most cost-effective
element, we make room for parallelism by allowing a small slack (e.g., a
$(1+\vareps)$ factor) in what can be selected---then, we use a clean-up step to
ensure that the behavior does not deviate too much from the sequential steps.
All the algorithms we developed are ``cache efficient'' in that the cache
complexity is bounded by $O(w/B)$, where $w$ is the work in the EREW model and
$B$ is the block size.
