There have been conflicting points of view concerning the Riemann--Lanczos
problem in 3 and 4 dimensions. Using direct differentiation on the defining
partial differential equations, Massa and Pagani (in 4 dimensions) and Edgar
(in dimensions n > 2) have argued that there are effective constraints so that
not all Riemann tensors can have Lanczos potentials; using Cartan's criteria of
integrability of ideals of differential forms Bampi and Caviglia have argued
that there are no such constraints in dimensions n < 5, and that, in these
dimensions, all Riemann tensors can have Lanczos potentials. In this paper we
give a simple direct derivation of a constraint equation, confirm explicitly
that known exact solutions of the Riemann-Lanczos problem satisfy it, and argue
that the Bampi and Caviglia conclusion must therefore be flawed. In support of
this, we refer to the recent work of Dolan and Gerber on the three dimensional
problem; by a method closely related to that of Bampi and Caviglia, they have
found an 'internal identity' which we demonstrate is precisely the three
dimensional version of the effective constraint originally found by Massa and
Pagani, and Edgar.
