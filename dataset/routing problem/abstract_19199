We consider the problem of identifying a subset of nodes in a network that
will enable the fastest spread of information in a decentralized communication
environment. For a model of communication based on a random walk on a connected
undirected graph, the optimal set over all sets $A$ of the same or smaller
cardinality, minimizes $F(A)$-the sum of the mean first arrival times to the
set by random walkers starting at nodes outside of $A$. This problem was
originally posed by Borkar, Nair and Sanketh (2010) who proved that the set
function $F$ is supermodular. Unfortunately, the problem as stated is probably
NP-complete. In this paper, we introduce an extension of the greedy algorithm
that leverages the properties of the underlying graph to produce exact and
approximate solutions of pre-defined quality $\nu$. The method requires the
evaluation of $F$ for sets of some fixed cardinality $m$, where $m$ is much
smaller than the cardinality of the optimal set. When $F$ has forward elemental
curvature $\kappa$, we can provide a rough description of the trade-off between
solution quality $\nu$ and computational effort $m$ in terms of $\kappa$.
