Genetic Programming (GP) has found various applications. Understanding this
type of algorithm from a theoretical point of view is a challenging task. The
first results on the computational complexity of GP have been obtained for
problems with isolated program semantics. With this paper, we push forward the
computational complexity analysis of GP on a problem with dependent program
semantics. We study the well-known sorting problem in this context and analyze
rigorously how GP can deal with different measures of sortedness.
