This paper settles the computational complexity of the problem of integrating
a polynomial function f over a rational simplex. We prove that the problem is
NP-hard for arbitrary polynomials via a generalization of a theorem of Motzkin
and Straus. On the other hand, if the polynomial depends only on a fixed number
of variables, while its degree and the dimension of the simplex are allowed to
vary, we prove that integration can be done in polynomial time. As a
consequence, for polynomials of fixed total degree, there is a polynomial time
algorithm as well. We conclude the article with extensions to other polytopes,
discussion of other available methods and experimental results.
