Despite offering several promising concepts, the Language/Action Perspective
(LAP) is still not in the mainstream of Information Systems Development (ISD).
Since at present there is only a limited understanding of LAP theory and
practice, it remains unclear whether the lack of LAP's impact is due to
shortcomings in LAP theory itself. One classic problem within ISD is the
dichotomy between social perspectives and technical perspectives. LAP claims it
offers a solution to this problem. This paper investigates this claim as a
means to review LAP theory. To provide a structure to a critical analysis of
DEMO - an example methodology that belongs to the LAP research community - this
paper utilizes a paradigmatic framework. This framework is augmented by the
opinion of several DEMO practitioners by means of an expert discussion. With
use of a comparative evaluation of LAP theory and DEMO theory, the implication
of DEMO's reflection upon LAP is determined. The paper concludes by outlining
an agenda for further research if LAP is to improve its footprint in the field.
