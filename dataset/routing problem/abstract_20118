We consider the problem of existence of representations of topological
groupoids on a principal bundle and the classification of such representations
up to gauge transformation. Such representations naturally occur in various
contexts such as gauge theory, lattice gauge fields, equivariant bundles, etc.
In the course of the proofs, some new facts about Milnor's classifying spaces
and gauge groups are established.
