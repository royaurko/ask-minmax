It is well known that the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries may
lead to conflict with big-bang cosmology. This is due to formation of domain
walls which give unacceptable contribution to the energy density of the
universe. On the other hand it is expected that gravity breaks global
symmetries explicitly. In this work we propose that this could provide a
natural solution to the domain-wall problem.
