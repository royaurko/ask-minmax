A free particle is constrained to move on a knot obtained by winding around a
putative torus. The classical equations of motion for this system are solved in
a closed form. The exact energy eigenspectrum, in the thin torus limit, is
obtained by mapping the time-independent Schrodinger equation to the Mathieu
equation. In the general case, the eigenvalue problem is described by the Hill
equation. Finite-thickness corrections are incorporated perturbatively by
truncating the Hill equation. Comparisons and contrasts between this problem
and the well-studied problem of a particle on a circle (planar rigid rotor) are
performed throughout.
