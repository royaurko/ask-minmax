In the present paper we study the problem of constructing a family of
surfaces (surface pencils) from a given curve in 4-dimensional Euclidean space
$\mathbb{E}^{4}$. We have shown that generalized rotation surfaces in
$\mathbb{E}^{4}$ are the special type of surface pencils. Further, the
curvature properties of these surfaces are investigated. Finally, we give some
examples of flat surface pencils in $\mathbb{E}^{4}$.
