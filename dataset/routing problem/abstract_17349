Matching the demand for resources ("load") with the supply of resources
("capacity") is a basic problem occurring across many fields of engineering,
logistics, and economics, and has been considered extensively both in the
Internet and in wireless networks. The ongoing evolution of cellular
communication networks into dense, organic, and irregular heterogeneous
networks ("HetNets") has elevated load-awareness to a central problem, and
introduces many new subtleties. This paper explains how several long-standing
assumptions about cellular networks need to be rethought in the context of a
load-balanced HetNet: we highlight these as three deeply entrenched myths that
we then dispel. We survey and compare the primary technical approaches to
HetNet load balancing: (centralized) optimization, game theory, Markov decision
processes, and the newly popular cell range expansion (a.k.a. "biasing"), and
draw design lessons for OFDMA-based cellular systems. We also identify several
open areas for future exploration.
