We perform the bifurcation analysis of the Kepler problem on $S^3$ and $L^3$.
An analogue of the Delaunay variables is introduced. We investigate the motion
of a point mass in the field of the Newtonian center moving along a geodesic on
$S^2$ and $L^2$ (the restricted two-body problem). When the curvature is small,
the pericenter shift is computed using the perturbation theory. We also present
the results of the numerical analysis based on the analogy with the motion of
rigid body.
