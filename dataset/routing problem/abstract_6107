Our research on variable objects based on the VSNET collaborations has
achieved much progress in understanding the nature of many kinds of phenomena.
Many problems have appeared, instead. Among them, we here review three newly
arising problems in the research of SU UMa-type dwarf novae: 1) how do EI Psc
and V485 Cen evolve as a cataclysmic variable?, 2) is the early superhump a
particular phenomenon for WZ Sge-type dwarf novae?, and 3) what parameters
determine variations of the superhump period?
