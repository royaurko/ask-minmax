We present and analyze an hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method
for the time-harmonic Maxwell equations. The divergence-free condition is
enforced on the electric field, then a Lagrange multiplier is introduced, and
the problem becomes in solving a mixed curl-curl formulation of the Maxwell's
problem. The method is shown to be an absolutely stable HDG method for the
indefinite time-harmonic Maxwell equations with high wave number. By exploiting
the duality argument, the dependence of convergence of the HDG method on wave
number $\kappa$, mesh size $h$ and polynomial order $p$ is obtained.
