A novel method of asymptotic factorization of $n \times n$ matrix functions
is proposed. Considered class of matrices is motivated by certain problems
originated in the elasticity theory. An example is constructed to illustrate
effectiveness of the proposed procedure. Further applications of the method is
discussed.
