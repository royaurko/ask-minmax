Partial-wave analysis is one step in a process connecting experimental
measurements to the N* states we are studying. Progress has been made in the
area of `model-independent' analysis. However, more model-dependent approaches
are needed to cover broader energy ranges. An example of the problems faced by
these more ambitious analyses is given.
