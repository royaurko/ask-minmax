We present a new general, complete closed-form solution of the Stark problem
in terms of Weierstrass elliptic and related functions. With respect to
previous treatments of the problem, our analysis is exact and valid for all
values of the external force field, and it is expressed via unique formul\ae{}
valid for all initial conditions and parameters of the system. The simple form
of the solution allows us to perform a thorough investigation of the properties
of the dynamical system, including the identification of quasi-periodic and
periodic orbits, the formulation of a simple analytical criterion to determine
the boundness of the trajectory, and the characterisation of the equilibrium
points.
