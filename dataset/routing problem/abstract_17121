We introduce an automata model for data words, that is words that carry at
each position a symbol from a finite alphabet and a value from an unbounded
data domain. The model is (semantically) a restriction of data automata,
introduced by Bojanczyk, et. al. in 2006, therefore it is called weak data
automata. It is strictly less expressive than data automata and the expressive
power is incomparable with register automata. The expressive power of weak data
automata corresponds exactly to existential monadic second order logic with
successor +1 and data value equality \sim, EMSO2(+1,\sim). It follows from
previous work, David, et. al. in 2010, that the nonemptiness problem for weak
data automata can be decided in 2-NEXPTIME. Furthermore, we study weak B\"uchi
automata on data omega-strings. They can be characterized by the extension of
EMSO2(+1,\sim) with existential quantifiers for infinite sets. Finally, the
same complexity bound for its nonemptiness problem is established by a
nondeterministic polynomial time reduction to the nonemptiness problem of weak
data automata.
