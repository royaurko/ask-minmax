Let $P$ be a set of $2n$ points in the plane, and let $M_{\rm C}$ (resp.,
$M_{\rm NC}$) denote a bottleneck matching (resp., a bottleneck non-crossing
matching) of $P$. We study the problem of computing $M_{\rm NC}$. We first
prove that the problem is NP-hard and does not admit a PTAS. Then, we present
an $O(n^{1.5}\log^{0.5} n)$-time algorithm that computes a non-crossing
matching $M$ of $P$, such that $bn(M) \le 2\sqrt{10} \cdot bn(M_{\rm NC})$,
where $bn(M)$ is the length of a longest edge in $M$. An interesting
implication of our construction is that $bn(M_{\rm NC})/bn(M_{\rm C}) \le
2\sqrt{10}$.
