Optical gas detection in microsystems is limited by the short micron scale
optical path length available. Recently, the concept of slow-light enhanced
absorption has been proposed as a route to compensate for the short path length
in miniaturized absorption cells. We extend the previous perturbation theory to
the case of a Bragg stack infiltrated by a spectrally strongly dispersive gas
with a narrow and distinct absorption peak. We show that considerable signal
enhancement is possible. As an example, we consider a Bragg stack consisting of
PMMA infiltrated by O2. Here, the required optical path length for visible to
near-infrared detection (~760 nm) can be reduced by at least a factor of 10^2,
making a path length of 1 mm feasible. By using this technique, optical gas
detection can potentially be made possible in microsystems.
