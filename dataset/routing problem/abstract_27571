Various fields of science and engineering rely on linear algebra for large
scale data analysis, modeling and simulation, machine learning, and other
applied problems. Linear algebra computations often dominate the execution time
of such applications. Meanwhile, experts in these domains typically lack the
training or time required to develop efficient, high-performance
implementations of linear algebra algorithms. In the Lighthouse project, we
enable developers with varied backgrounds to readily discover and effectively
apply the best available numerical software for their problems. We have
developed a search-based expert system that combines expert knowledge, machine
learningbased classification of existing numerical software collections, and
automated code generation and optimization. Lighthouse provides a novel
software engineering environment aimed at maximizing both developer
productivity and application performance for dense and sparse linear algebra
computations.
