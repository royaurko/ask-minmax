The paper contains a simple proof of the Finch-Patch-Rakesh inversion formula
for the spherical mean Radon transform in odd dimensions. This transform arises
in thermoacoustic tomography. Applications are given to the Cauchy problem for
the Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation with initial data on the cylindrical
surface. The argument relies on the idea of analytic continuation and known
properties of Erdelyi-Kober fractional integrals.
