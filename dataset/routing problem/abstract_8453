The solutions to the Dirichlet problem for two degenerate elliptic fully
nonlinear equations in $n+1$ dimensions, namely the real Monge-Amp\`ere
equation and the Donaldson equation, are shown to have maximum rank in the
space variables when $n \leq 2$. A constant rank property is also established
for the Donaldson equation when $n=3$.
