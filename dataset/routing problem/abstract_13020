Unscrupulous outdoor lighting produces a number of effects that are currently
included under the term light pollution. Its consequences (e.g. loss of
resources by energy waste), are being recognized for some time, as well as the
possibility to mitigate this pollution. In the present work, we present some
lines of action developed at the Facultad Regional San Nicol\'as of National
Technological University (UTN) of Argentina to include the CL as a regular
topic of study in the problems of air pollution.
