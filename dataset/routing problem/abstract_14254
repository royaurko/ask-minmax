As structured documents with rich metadata (such as products, movies, etc.)
become increasingly prevalent, searching those documents has become an
important IR problem. Although advanced search interfaces are widely available,
most users still prefer to use keyword-based queries to search those documents.
Query keywords often imply some hidden restrictions on the desired documents,
which can be represented as document facet-value pairs. To achieve high
retrieval performance, it's important to be able to identify the relevant
facet-value pairs hidden in a query. In this paper, we study the problem of
identifying document facet-value pairs that are relevant to a keyword-based
search query. We propose a machine learning approach and a set of useful
features, and evaluate our approach using a movie data set from INEX.
