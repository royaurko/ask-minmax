In this paper, we propose an approximate semi-definite programming framework
for demodulation and equalization of non-coherent ultra-wide-band communication
systems with inter-symbol-interference. It is assumed that the communication
systems follow non-linear second-order Volterra models. We formulate the
demodulation and equalization problems as semi-definite programming problems.
We propose an approximate algorithm for solving the formulated semi-definite
programming problems. Compared with the existing non-linear equalization
approaches, the proposed semi-definite programming formulation and approximate
solving algorithm have low computational complexity and storage requirements.
We show that the proposed algorithm has satisfactory error probability
performance by simulation results. The proposed non-linear equalization
approach can be adopted for a wide spectrum of non-coherent ultra-wide-band
systems, due to the fact that most non-coherent ultra-wide-band systems with
inter-symbol-interference follow non-linear second-order Volterra signal
models.
