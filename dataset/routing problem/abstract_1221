Coupled and shape-tailored metallic nanoparticles are known to exhibit
hybridized plasmon resonances. This Letter discuss the optical properties of a
complementary system formed by overlapped nanovoid dimers buried in gold and
filled with silica. This is an alternative route for plasmon engineering that
benefits from vanishing radiation losses. Our analysis demonstrates the
possibility of designing artificial plasmon molecules on the basis of void
plasmon hybridization, which allows fine mode tuning by varying the overlap
between voids. The proposed structures could find application to both signal
processing through buried optical elements and tunable-plasmon biosensing.
