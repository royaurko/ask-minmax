We show existence and give an implicit formula for the escape rate of the
n-centre problem of celestial mechanics for high energies. Furthermore we give
precise computable estimates of this rate. This exponential decay rate plays an
important role especially in semiclassical scattering theory of n-atomic
molecules. Our result shows that the diameter of a molecule is measurable in a
(classical) high-energy scattering experiment.
