State discrimination with the aim to minimize the error probability is a well
studied problem. Instead, here the binary decision problem for operators with a
given prior is investigated. A black box containing the unknown operator is
probed by selected wave functions. The output is analyzed with conventional
methods developed for state discrimination. An error probability bound for all
binary operator choices is provided, and it is shown how probe entanglement
enhances the result.
