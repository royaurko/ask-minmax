We present observations of the emission of XUV supercontinua in the 20-37 eV
region by high harmonic generation (HHG) with 4-7 fs pulses focused onto a Kr
gas jet. The underlying mechanism relies on coherent control of the relative
delays and phases between individually generated attosecond pulses, achievable
by adjusting the chirp of the driving pulses and the interaction geometry.
Under adequate chirp and phase matching conditions the resulting interference
will yield a supercontinuum XUV spectrum. This technique opens the route for
modifying the phase of individual attosecond pulses and for the coherent
synthesis of XUV supercontinua without the need of an isolated attosecond
burst.
