Here, non-minimally coupled tachyon to gravity is considered as a source of
"dark energy". It is demonstrated that with expansion of the universe, tachyon
dark energy decays to "dark matter" providing a solution to "cosmic coincidence
problem".Moreover, it is found that universe undergoes accelerated expansion
simultaneously.
