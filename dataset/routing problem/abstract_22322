We modify the action of Mannheim's conformally invariant model by changing
the sign of two coefficients. This breaks conformal symmetry, but results in a
cosmology that has a positive effective G and at the same time retains one of
the main advantages of the Mannheim model, a possible solution of the
cosmological constant problem.
