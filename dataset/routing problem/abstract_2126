Subwavelength modulators play an indispensable role in integrated
photonic-electronic circuits. Due to weak light-matter interactions, it is
always a challenge to develop a modulator with a nanometer scale footprint, low
switching energy, low insertion loss and large modulation depth. In this paper,
we propose the design of a vanadium dioxide dual-mode plasmonic waveguide
electroabsorption modulator using a metal-insulator-VO$_2$-insulator-metal
(MIVIM) waveguide platform. By varying the index of vanadium dioxide, the
modulator can route plasmonic waves through the low-loss dielectric insulator
layer during the "on" state and high-loss VO$_2$ layer during the "off" state,
thereby significantly reducing the insertion loss while maintaining a large
modulation depth. This ultracompact waveguide modulator, for example, can
achieve a large modulation depth of ~10dB with an active size of only
200x50x220nm$^3$ (or ~{\lambda}$^3$/1700), requiring a drive-voltage of ~4.6V.
This high performance plasmonic modulator could potentially be one of the keys
towards fully-integrated plasmonic nanocircuits in the next-generation chip
technology.
