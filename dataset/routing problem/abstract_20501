We solve the eigenvalue problem of the five-qubit anisotropic Heisenberg
model, without use of Bethe's Ansatz, and give analytical results for
entanglement and mixedness of two nearest-neighbor qubits. The entanglement
takes its maximum at Delta= (Delta>1) for the case of zero (finite) temperature
with Delta being the anisotropic parameter. In contrast, the mixedness takes
its minimum at Delta=1 (Delta>1) for the case of zero (finite) temperature.
