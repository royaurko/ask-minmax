In 2009, Kong, Wang, and Lee began work on the problem of finding the
edge-balanced index sets (EBI) of complete bipartite graphs K_{m,n} by solving
the cases where n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and also the case where m = n. In 2011,
Krop and Sikes expanded upon that work by finding EBI(K_{m,m-2a}) for odd m > 5
and 1 <= a <= (m-3)/4. In this paper, we provide a general solution to the
edge-balanced index set problem for all complete odd bipartite graphs, thereby
concluding the problem for this case.
