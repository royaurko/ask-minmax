More than a century after its proposal, the Towers of Hanoi puzzle with 4
pegs was solved by Thierry Bousch in a breakthrough paper in 2014. The general
problem with p pegs is still open, with the best lower bound on the minimum
number of moves due to Chen and Shen. We use some of Bousch's new ideas to
obtain an asymptotic improvement on this bound for all p >= 5.
