We give a $2^{n+o(n)}$-time and space randomized algorithm for solving the
exact Closest Vector Problem (CVP) on $n$-dimensional Euclidean lattices. This
improves on the previous fastest algorithm, the deterministic
$\widetilde{O}(4^{n})$-time and $\widetilde{O}(2^{n})$-space algorithm of
Micciancio and Voulgaris.
  We achieve our main result in two steps. First, we show how to modify the
sampling algorithm from ADRS15 to solve the problem of discrete Gaussian
sampling over lattice shifts, $L- \vec{t}$, with very low parameters. While the
actual algorithm is a natural generalization of ADRS15, the analysis uses
substantial new ideas. This yields a $2^{n+o(n)}$-time algorithm for
approximate CVP with the very good approximation factor $\gamma =
1+2^{-o(n/\log n)}$. Second, we show that the near-closest vectors to a target
vector $\vec{t}$ can be grouped into "lower-dimensional clusters," and we use
this to obtain a recursive algorithm based on our sampler that solves exact CVP
in $2^{n + o(n)}$ time.
  The analysis of both steps depends crucially on some new properties of the
discrete Gaussian distribution, which might be of independent interest.
