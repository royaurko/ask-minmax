We investigate existence of a priori estimates for differential operators in
$L^1$ norm: for anisotropic homogeneous differential operators $T_1, \ldots ,
T_{\ell}$, we study the conditions under which the inequality $$ \|T_1
f\|_{L_1(\mathbb{R}^d)} \lesssim \sum\limits_{j = 2}^{\ell}\|T_j
f\|_{L_1(\mathbb{R}^d)} $$ holds true. We also discuss a similar problem for
martingale transforms.
