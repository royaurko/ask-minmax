The system of hydrodynamic-type equations, derived by two-side distribution
function for a stratified gas in gravity field is applied to a problem of
ultrasound. The theory is based on Gross-Jackson kinetic equation, which
solution is built by means of locally equilibrium distribution function with
different local parameters for molecules moving "up"and "down". The linearized
version of the obtained system is studied and compared with other results and
experiments at arbitrary Knudsen numbers. The problem of a generation by a
moving plane in a rarefied gas is explored. The WKB solutions for ultrasound in
a stratified medium are constructed in explicit form, evaluated and plotted.
