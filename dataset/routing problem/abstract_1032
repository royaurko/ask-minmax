The self-organization of a chemi-sorbed mono-layer is studied as a two
dimensional ordering process in presence of surface stress. As proved
previously for a single phase separation, a steady surface state is yielded
from the competition between the domain boundary energy and the surface stress
elastic energy. In the present letter, the resulting patterns are shown to
depend on the interplay between the symmetries of both the internal layer order
and the underlying crystal. For experimental relevance, our study is focussed
on a (001) copper surface and we believe to enhance a route to stabilize novel
surface nanostructures.
