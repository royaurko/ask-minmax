Glycolaldehyde is a simple monosaccharide sugar linked to prebiotic
chemistry. Recently it was detected in a molecular core in the star-forming
region G31.41+0.31 at a reasonably high abundance. We investigate the formation
of glycolaldehyde at 10K to determine whether it can form efficiently under
typical dense core conditions. Using an astrochemical model, we test five
different reaction mechanisms that have been proposed in the astrophysical
literature, finding that a gas-phase formation route is unlikely. Of the
grain-surface formation routes, only two are efficient enough at very low
temperatures to produce sufficient glycolaldehyde to match the observational
estimates, with the mechanism culminating in CH3OH + HCO being favoured.
However, when we consider the feasibility of these mechanisms from a reaction
chemistry perspective, the second grain-surface route looks more promising,
H3CO + HCO.
