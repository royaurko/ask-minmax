We study the transmission of a set of correlated sources $(U_1,\cdots,U_K)$
over a Gaussian multiple access relay channel with time asynchronism between
the encoders. We assume that the maximum possible offset
${\mathsf{d_{max}}}(n)$ between the transmitters grows without bound as the
block length $n \rightarrow \infty$ while the relative ratio
${{\mathsf{d_{max}}}(n) / n}$ of the maximum possible offset to the block
length asymptotically vanishes. For such a joint source-channel coding problem,
and under specific gain conditions, we derive necessary and sufficient
conditions for reliable communications and show that separate source and
channel coding achieves optimal performance. In particular, we first derive a
general outer bound on the source entropy content for all channel gains as our
main result. Then, using Slepian-Wolf source coding combined with the channel
coding scheme introduced in \cite{Cover_McEliece:81} on top of block Markov
coding, we show that the thus achieved inner bound matches the outer bound.
Consequently, as a corollary, we also address the problem of sending a pair of
correlated sources over a two user interference channel in the same context.
