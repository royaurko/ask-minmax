Pirillo and Varricchio, and independently, Halbeisen and Hungerbuhler
considered the following problem, open since 1994: Does there exist an infinite
word w over a finite subset of Z such that w contains no two consecutive blocks
of the same length and sum? We consider some variations on this problem in the
light of van der Waerden's theorem on arithmetic progressions.
