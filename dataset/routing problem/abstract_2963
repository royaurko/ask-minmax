The paper presents a method for obtaining problems whose conclusions contain
disjunctive propositions. These problems constitute a version of inverse
problems with a given logical structure. The logical models in the groups of
problems studied have been interpreted comprehensively. Equivalent problems
have been given by keeping or not keeping the condition of homogeneity in their
conclusion.
