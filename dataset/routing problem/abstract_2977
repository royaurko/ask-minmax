In the original index coding problem, each user has a set of uncoded packets
as side information, and wants to decode some other packets from the source
node. Shum et al, (2013) considered the more general problem where side
information can be also coded. We refer to this class of problems as index
coding with coded side-information (ICCSI). We describe a generalized min-rank
for the ICCSI problem, and obtain bounds on this quantity taking an algebraic
approach rather than one from graph theory. We also consider error correction
for the ICCSI problem, both for the Hamming and rank metric and address the
question of the main index coding problem for error correcting index codes
(ECIC).
