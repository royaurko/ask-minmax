The known algorithms approximate the roots of a univariate polynomial in
nearly optimal arithmetic and Boolean time. They are, however, quite involved
and require a high precision of computing when the degree of the input
polynomial is large, which causes numerical stability problems. We observe that
these difficulties do not appear at the initial stages of the algorithms, and
in our present paper we extend one of these stages, analyze it, and avoid the
cited problems, still achieving the solution within a nearly optimal complexity
estimates, provided that some mild initial isolation of the roots of the input
polynomial has been ensured. The resulting algorithms promise to be of some
practical value for root-finding and can be extended to the problem of
polynomial factorization, which is of interest on its own right. We conclude
with outlining such an extension, which enables us to cover the cases of
isolated multiple roots and root clusters.
