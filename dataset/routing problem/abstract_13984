Cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) is a key tool for problems in real
algebraic geometry and beyond. When using CAD there is often a choice over the
variable ordering to use, with some problems infeasible in one ordering but
simple in another. Here we discuss a recent experiment comparing three
heuristics for making this choice on thousands of examples.
