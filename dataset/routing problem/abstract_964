Wireless Body Area Sensor Networks (WBASNs) consist of on-body or in-body
sensors placed on human body for health monitoring. Energy conservation of
these sensors, while guaranteeing a required level of performance, is a
challenging task. Energy efficient routing schemes are designed for the
longevity of network lifetime. In this paper, we propose a routing protocol for
measuring fatigue of a soldier. Three sensors are attached to soldier's body
that monitor specific parameters. Our proposed protocol is an event driven
protocol and takes three scenarios for measuring the fatigue of a soldier. We
evaluate our proposed work in terms of network lifetime, throughput, remaining
energy of sensors and fatigue of a soldier.
