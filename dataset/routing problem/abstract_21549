Both dissipation of helicity and it spectrum we are study on the basis of
asymptotic model. Introduction into model dependence of angle between turbulent
components vorticity and velocity on the governing parameters leads to the
spectra of helicity observed experimentally and obtained by DNS model
computations by various contributors. At the same time, it settles the problem of
helicity dissipation divergence with growing Reynolds number.
