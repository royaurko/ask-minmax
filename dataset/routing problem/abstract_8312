We investigate the vacuum in nonisentropic gas dynamics in one space
variable, with the most general equation of states allowed by thermodynamics.
We recall physical constraints on the equations of state and give explicit and
easily checkable conditions under which vacuums occur in the solution of the
Riemann problem. We then present a class of models for which the Riemann
problem admits unique global solutions without vacuums.
