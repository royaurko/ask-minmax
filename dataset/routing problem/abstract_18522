Does a given system of linear equations with nonnegative constraints have an
integer solution? This is a fundamental question in many areas. In statistics
this problem arises in data security problems for contingency table data and
also is closely related to non-squarefree elements of Markov bases for sampling
contingency tables with given marginals. To study a family of systems with no
integer solution, we focus on a commutative semigroup generated by a finite
subset of $\Z^d$ and its saturation. An element in the difference of the
semigroup and its saturation is called a ``hole''. We show the necessary and
sufficient conditions for the finiteness of the set of holes. Also we define
fundamental holes and saturation points of a commutative semigroup. Then, we
show the simultaneous finiteness of the set of holes, the set of non-saturation
points, and the set of generators for saturation points. We apply our results
to some three- and four-way contingency tables. Then we will discuss the time
complexities of our algorithms.
