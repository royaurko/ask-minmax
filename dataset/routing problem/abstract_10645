Consider the problem of joint uplink scheduling and power allocation. Being
inherent to almost any wireless system, this resource allocation problem has
received extensive attention. Yet, most common techniques either adopt
classical power control, in which mobile stations are received with the same
Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio, or use centralized schemes, in which
base stations coordinate their allocations.
  In this work, we suggest a novel scheduling approach in which each base
station, besides allocating the time and frequency according to given
constraints, also manages its uplink power budget such that the aggregate
interference, "Noise Rise", caused by its subscribers at the neighboring cells
is bounded. Our suggested scheme is distributed, requiring neither coordination
nor message exchange.
  We rigorously define the allocation problem under noise rise constraints,
give the optimal solution and derive an efficient iterative algorithm to
achieve it. We then discuss a relaxed problem, where the noise rise is
constrained separately for each sub-channel or resource unit. While
sub-optimal, this view renders the scheduling and power allocation problems
separate, yielding an even simpler and more efficient solution, while the
essence of the scheme is kept. Via extensive simulations, we show that the
suggested approach increases overall performance dramatically, with the same
level of fairness and power consumption.
