We review some applications of central limit theorems and extreme values
statistics in the context of disordered systems. We discuss several problems,
in particular concerning Random Matrix Theory and the generalisation of the
Tracy-Widom distribution when the disorder has ``fat tails''. We underline the
relevance of power-law tails for Directed Polymers and mean-field Spin Glasses,
and we point out various open problems and conjectures on these matters. We
find that in many instances the assumption of Gaussian disorder cannot be taken
for granted.
