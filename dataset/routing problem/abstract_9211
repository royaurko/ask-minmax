The development of the relativistic all-order method where all single,
double, and partial triple excitations of the Dirac-Hartree-Fock wave function
are included to all orders of perturbation theory led to many important results
for study of fundamental symmetries, development of atomic clocks, ultracold
atom physics, and others, as well as provided recommended values of many atomic
properties critically evaluated for their accuracy for large number of
monovalent systems. This approach requires iterative solutions of the
linearized coupled-cluster equations leading to convergence issues in some
cases where correlation corrections are particularly large or lead to an
oscillating pattern. Moreover, these issues also lead to similar problems in
the CI+all-order method for many-particle systems. In this work, we have
resolved most of the known convergence problems by applying two different
convergence stabilizer methods, reduced linear equation (RLE) and direct
inversion of iterative subspace (DIIS). Examples are presented for B, Al,
Zn$^+$, and Yb$^+$. Solving these convergence problems greatly expands the
number of atomic species that can be treated with the all-order methods and is
anticipated to facilitate many interesting future applications.
