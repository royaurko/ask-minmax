A comparative study of the structural, optical and morphological properties
of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films prepared by two different techniques was
performed. One consists of sequential evaporation of the elemental metallic
precursors under a flux of sulphur supplied by evaporation from an effusion
cell (physical vapor deposition-PVD) and the second one is a solution-based
chemical route where thin layers of CuS, SnS and ZnS are deposited sequentially
by diffusion membrane- assisted chemical bath deposition techniques; the
membranes are used to optimize the kinetic growth through a moderate control of
the release of the metal into CBD solution by osmosis. The present comparative
study is helpful to the synthesis of kesterite nanostructured thin films.
