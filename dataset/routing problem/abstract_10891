We study the critical curves, caustics, and multiple imaging due to one of
the simplest many-body gravitational lens configurations: equal-mass point
masses on the vertices of a regular polygon. Some examples of the critical
curves and caustics are also displayed. We pose the problem of determining the
maximum number of lensed images due to regular-polygon and general point mass
configurations. Our numerical simulations suggest a maximum that is linear,
rather than quadratic, in the number of point masses.
