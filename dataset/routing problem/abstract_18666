Fisher's Method of Maximum Likelihood is shown to be a procedure for the
construction of likelihood intervals or regions, instead of a procedure of
point estimation. Based on Fisher's articles and books it is justified that by
estimation Fisher meant the construction of likelihood intervals or regions
from appropriate likelihood function and that an estimate is a statistic, that
is, a function from a sample space to a parameter space such that the
likelihood function obtained from the sampling distribution of the statistic at
the observed value of the statistic is used to construct likelihood intervals
or regions. Thus Problem of Estimation is how to choose the 'best' estimate.
Fisher's solution for the problem of estimation is Maximum Likelihood Estimate
(MLE). Fisher's Theory of Statistical Estimation is a chain of ideas used to
justify MLE as the solution of the problem of estimation. The construction of
confidence intervals by the delta method from the asymptotic normal
distribution of MLE is based on Fisher's ideas, but is against his 'logic of
statistical inference'. Instead the construction of confidence intervals from
the profile likelihood function of a given interest function of the parameter
vector is considered as a solution more in line with Fisher's 'ideology'. A new
method of calculation of profile likelihood-based confidence intervals for
general smooth interest functions in general statistical models is considered.
