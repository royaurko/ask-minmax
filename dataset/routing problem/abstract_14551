This letter considers the problem of recovering a positive stream of Diracs
on a sphere from its projection onto the space of low-degree spherical
harmonics, namely, from its low-resolution version. We suggest recovering the
Diracs via a tractable convex optimization problem. The resulting recovery
error is proportional to the noise level and depends on the density of the
Diracs. We validate the theory by numerical experiments.
