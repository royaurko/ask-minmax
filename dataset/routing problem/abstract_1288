Nanoscrolls (papyrus-like nanostructures) are very attractive structures for
a variety of applications, due to their tunable diameter values and large
accessible surface area. They have been successfully synthesized from different
materials. In this work we have investigated, through fully atomistic molecular
dynamics simulations, the dynamics of scroll formation for a series of
graphenelike carbon nitride (CN) twodimensional systems: gCN, triazinebased
gC3N4, and heptazinebased gC3N4. Our results show that stable nanoscrolls can
be formed for all of these structures. Possible synthetic routes to produce
these nanostructures are also addressed.
