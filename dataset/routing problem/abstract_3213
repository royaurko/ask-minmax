We discuss how a class of difficult kinematic problems can play an important
role in an introductory course in stimulating students' reasoning on more
complex physical situations. The problems presented here have an elementary
analysis once certain symmetry features of the motion are revealed. We also
explore some unexpected directions these problems lead us.
