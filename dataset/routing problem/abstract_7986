This paper describes the variational formulation of template matching
problems of computational anatomy (CA); introduces the EPDiff evolution
equation in the context of an analogy between CA and fluid dynamics; discusses
the singular solutions for the EPDiff equation and explains why these singular
solutions exist (singular momentum map). Then it draws the consequences of
EPDiff for outline matching problem in CA and gives numerical examples.
