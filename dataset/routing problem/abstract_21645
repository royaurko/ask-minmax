We consider the problem of solving dual monotone inclusions involving sums of
composite parallel-sum type operators. A feature of this work is to exploit
explicitly the cocoercivity of some of the operators appearing in the model.
Several splitting algorithms recently proposed in the literature are recovered
as special cases.
