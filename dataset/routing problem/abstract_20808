A procedure to obtain differentiation matrices is extended straightforwardly
to yield new differentiation matrices useful to obtain derivatives of complex
rational functions. Such matrices can be used to obtain numerical solutions of
some singular differential problems defined in the complex domain. The
potential use of these matrices is illustrated with the case of elliptic
functions.
