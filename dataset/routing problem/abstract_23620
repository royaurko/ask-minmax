The purpose of these notes is to give an introduction to Deligne-Mumford
stacks and their moduli spaces, with emphasis on the moduli problem for curves.
The paper has 4 sections. In section 1 we discuss the general problem of
constructing a moduli "space" of curves. In section 2 we give an introduction
to Deligne-Mumford stacks and their moduli spaces. In section 3 we return to
curves and outline Deligne and Mumford's proof that the stack of stable curves
is a smooth and irreducible Deligne-Mumford stack which is proper over Spec Z.
In section 4 we explain how to use geometric invariant to construct moduli
spaces for quotient stacks. Finally, we briefly outline Gieseker's geometric
invariant theory construction of the moduli scheme of projective curves defined
over an algebraically closed field.
  These notes are a slightly revised version of notes which the contributor has
circulated privately for several years, and are based on lectures the contributor
gave at the Weizmann Institute in July 1994. They are also available at the URL
