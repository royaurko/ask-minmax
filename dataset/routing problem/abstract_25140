In this paper, we tackle the open problem of snap-stabilization in
message-passing systems. Snap-stabilization is a nice approach to design
protocols that withstand transient faults. Compared to the well-known
self-stabilizing approach, snap-stabilization guarantees that the effect of
faults is contained immediately after faults cease to occur. Our contribution
is twofold: we show that (1) snap-stabilization is impossible for a wide class
of problems if we consider networks with finite yet unbounded channel capacity;
(2) snap-stabilization becomes possible in the same setting if we assume
bounded-capacity channels. We propose three snap-stabilizing protocols working
in fully-connected networks. Our work opens exciting new research perspectives,
as it enables the snap-stabilizing paradigm to be implemented in actual
networks.
