During the loading phase of a vessel, only the containers that are on top of
their stack are directly accessible. If the container that needs to be loaded
next is not the top container, extra moves have to be performed, resulting in
an increased loading time. One way to resolve this issue is via a procedure
called premarshalling. The goal of premarshalling is to reshuffle the
containers into a desired lay-out prior to the arrival of the vessel, in the
minimum number of moves possible. This paper presents an exact algorithm based
on branch and bound, that is evaluated on a large set of instances. The
complexity of the premarshalling problem is also considered, and this paper
shows that the problem at hand is NP-hard, even in the natural case of stacks
with fixed height.
