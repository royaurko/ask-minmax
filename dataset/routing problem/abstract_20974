Let $\Delta(x)$ be the error term of the Dirichlet divisor problem. The
asymptotic formula of the integral $\int_1^T\Delta^k(x)dx$ is established for
any integer $3\leq k\leq 9$ by an unified method. Similar results are also
established for some other well-known error terms in the analytic number theory.
