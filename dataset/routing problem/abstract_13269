Recently the theory of widths of Kolmogorov-Gelfand has received a great deal
of interest due to its close relationship with the newly born area of
Compressive Sensing in Signal Processing. However fundamental problems of the
theory of widths in multidimensional Theory of Functions remain untouched, as
well as analogous problems in the theory of multidimensional Signal Analysis.
In the present paper we provide a multidimensional generalization of the
original result of Kolmogorov about the widths of an "ellipsoidal sets"
consisting of functions defined on an interval.
