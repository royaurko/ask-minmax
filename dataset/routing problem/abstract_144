Wireless distributed sensor network consists of randomly deployed sensors
having low energy assets. These networks can be used for monitoring a variety
of environments. Major problems of these networks are energy constraints and
their finite lifetimes. To overcome these problems different routing protocols
and clustering techniques are introduced. We propose DREEM-ME which uses a
unique technique for clustering to overcome these two problems efficiently.
DREEM-ME elects a fix number of cluster heads (CHs) in each round instead of
probabilistic selection of CHs. Packet Drop Technique is also implemented in
our protocol to make it more comprehensive and practical. In DREEM-ME
confidence interval is also shown in each graph which helps in visualising the
maximum deviation from original course. Our simulations and results show that
DREEM-ME is much better than existing protocols of the same nature.
