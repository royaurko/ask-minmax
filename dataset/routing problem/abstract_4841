We consider the {\em Capacitated Domination} problem, which models a
service-requirement assignment scenario and is also a generalization of the
well-known {\em Dominating Set} problem. In this problem, given a graph with
three parameters defined on each vertex, namely cost, capacity, and demand, we
want to find an assignment of demands to vertices of least cost such that the
demand of each vertex is satisfied subject to the capacity constraint of each
vertex providing the service. In terms of polynomial time approximations, we
present logarithmic approximation algorithms with respect to different demand
assignment models for this problem on general graphs, which also establishes
the corresponding approximation results to the well-known approximations of the
traditional {\em Dominating Set} problem. Together with our previous work, this
closes the problem of generally approximating the optimal solution. On the
other hand, from the perspective of parameterization, we prove that this
problem is {\it W[1]}-hard when parameterized by a structure of the graph
called treewidth. Based on this hardness result, we present exact
fixed-parameter tractable algorithms when parameterized by treewidth and
maximum capacity of the vertices. This algorithm is further extended to obtain
pseudo-polynomial time approximation schemes for planar graphs.
