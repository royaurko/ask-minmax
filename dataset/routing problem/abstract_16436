Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph without isolated vertices. A set $S\subseteq V$ is a
paired-domination set if every vertex in $V-S$ is adjacent to a vertex in $S$
and the subgraph induced by $S$ contains a perfect matching. The
paired-domination problem is to determine the paired-domination number, which
is the minimum cardinality of a paired-dominating set. Motivated by a mistaken
algorithm given by Chen, Kang and Ng [ Paired domination on interval and
circular-arc graphs, Disc. Appl. Math. 155(2007),2077-2086], we present two
linear time algorithms to find a minimum cardinality paired-dominating set in
block and interval graphs. In addition, we prove that paired-domination problem
is {\em NP}-complete for bipartite graphs, chordal graphs, even split graphs.
