Chemists and material scientists have often focused on the properties of
previously reported compounds, leaving out numerous unreported but chemically
plausible compounds that could have interesting properties. For example, the
18-valence electron ABX family of compounds includes the half-Heusler subgroup,
and features examples of topological insulators, thermoelectrics and
superconductors, but only 83 out of 483 of these possible compounds have been
made. Using first-principles thermodynamics we have examined the theoretical
stability of 400 unreported members and predict that 54 should be stable. 15
previously missing materials, now predicted stable, were grown in this study;
X-ray studies agreed with the predicted crystal structure in all 15 cases.
Among the characterized properties of the missing compounds are potential
transparent conductors, thermoelectric materials and topological semimetals.
This integrated process-prediction of functionality in unreported compounds
followed by laboratory synthesis and characterization-could be a route to the
systematic discovery of hitherto missing, realizable functional materials.
