This work is intended as an attempt to study the non-perturbative
renormalization of bound state problem of finitely many Dirac-delta
interactions on Riemannian manifolds, S^2, H^2 and H^3. We formulate the
problem in terms of a finite dimensional matrix, called the characteristic
matrix. The bound state energies can be found from the characteristic equation.
The characteristic matrix can be found after a regularization and
renormalization by using a sharp cut-off in the eigenvalue spectrum of the
Laplacian, as it is done in the flat space, or using the heat kernel method.
These two approaches are equivalent in the case of compact manifolds. The heat
kernel method has a general advantage to find lower bounds on the spectrum even
for compact manifolds as shown in the case of S^2. The heat kernels for H^2 and
H^3 are known explicitly, thus we can calculate the characteristic matrix.
Using the result, we give lower bound estimates of the discrete spectrum.
