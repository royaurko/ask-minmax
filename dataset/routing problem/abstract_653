It has been suggested that after brane-antibrane inflation in a
Klebanov-Strassler (KS) warped throat, metastable Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations
can be formed due to nearly-conserved angular momenta along isometric
directions in the throat. If sufficiently long-lived, these relics could
conflict with big bang nucleosynthesis or baryogenesis by dominating the energy
density of the universe. We make a detailed estimate of the decay rate of such
relics using the low energy effective action of type IIB string theory
compactified on the throat geometry, with attention to powers of the warp
factor. We find that it is necessary to turn on SUSY-breaking deformations of
the KS background in order to ensure that the most dangerous relics will decay
fast enough. The decay rate is found to be much larger than the naive guess
based on the dimension of the operators which break the angular isometries of
the throat. For an inflationary warp factor of order $w\sim 10^{-4}$, we obtain
the bound $M_{3/2} \gsim 10^9$ GeV on the scale of SUSY breaking to avoid
cosmological problems from the relics, which is satisfied in the KKLT
construction assumed to stabilize the compactification. Given the requirement
that the relics decay before nucleosynthesis or baryogenesis, we place bounds
on the mass of the relic as a function of the warp factor in the throat for
more general warped backgrounds.
