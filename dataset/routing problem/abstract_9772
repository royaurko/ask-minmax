In this article, we present a family of numerical approaches to solve
high-dimensional linear non-symmetric problems. The principle of these methods
is to approximate a function which depends on a large number of variates by a
sum of tensor product functions, each term of which is iteratively computed via
a greedy algorithm. There exists a good theoretical framework for these methods
in the case of (linear and nonlinear) symmetric elliptic problems. However, the
convergence results are not valid any more as soon as the problems considered
are not symmetric. We present here a review of the main algorithms proposed in
the literature to circumvent this difficulty, together with some new
approaches. The theoretical convergence results and the practical
implementation of these algorithms are discussed. Their behaviors are
illustrated through some numerical examples.
