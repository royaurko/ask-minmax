Classification problems have been introduced by M. Ziegler as a
generalization of promise problems. In this paper we are concerned with
solvability and unsolvability questions with respect to a given set or language
family, especially with cores of unsolvability. We generalize the results about
unsolvability cores in promise problems to classification problems. Our main
results are a characterization of unsolvability cores via cohesiveness and
existence theorems for such cores in unsolvable classification problems. In
contrast to promise problems we have to strengthen the conditions to assert the
existence of such cores. In general unsolvable classification problems with
more than two components exist, which possess no cores, even if the set family
under consideration satisfies the assumptions which are necessary to prove the
existence of cores in unsolvable promise problems. But, if one of the
components is fixed we can use the results on unsolvability cores in promise
problems, to assert the existence of such cores in general. In this case we
speak of conditional classification problems and conditional cores. The
existence of conditional cores can be related to complexity cores. Using this
connection we can prove for language families, that conditional cores with
recursive components exist, provided that this family admits an uniform
solution for the word problem.
