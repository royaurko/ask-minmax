The motion of a eukaryotic cell presents a variety of interesting and
challenging problems from both a modeling and a computational perspective. The
processes span many spatial scales (from molecular to tissue) as well as
disparate time scales, with reaction kinetics on the order of seconds, and the
deformation and motion of the cell occurring on the order of minutes. The
computational difficulty, even in 2D, resides in the fact that the problem is
inherently one of deforming, non-stationary domains, bounded by an elastic
perimeter, inside of which there is redistribution of biochemical signaling
substances. Here we report the results of a computational scheme using the
immersed boundary method to address this problem. We adopt a simple
reaction-diffusion system that represents an internal regulatory mechanism
controlling the polarization of a cell, and determining the strength of
protrusion forces at the front of its elastic perimeter. Using this
computational scheme we are able to study the effect of protrusive and elastic
forces on cell shapes on their own, the distribution of the reaction-diffusion
system in irregular domains on its own, and the coupled mechanical-chemical
system. We find that this representation of cell crawling can recover important
aspects of the spontaneous polarization and motion of certain types of crawling
cells.
