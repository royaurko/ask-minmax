A model consisting of a Harmonic Oscillator well and a linear potential,
coupled by Dirac delta function, is solved. We find the exact analytical
expressions for Green's function for this problem. This Green's functions are
used to calculate the Raman excitation profile and electronic absorption
spectrum.
