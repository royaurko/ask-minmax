Let $D$ be a digraph without digons. Seymour's second neighborhood conjecture
states that $D$ has a vertex $v$ such that $d^+(v)\leq d^{++}(v)$. Under some
conditions, we prove this conjecture for digraphs missing $n$ disjoint stars.
Weaker conditions are required when $n=2$ or 3. In some cases we exhibit 2 such
vertices.
