In these lectures, given in '96 summer schools in Beg-Rohu (France) and
Budapest, I discuss the fundamental principles of thermodynamic and dynamic
Monte Carlo methods in a simple light-weight fashion. The keywords are MARKOV
CHAINS, SAMPLING, DETAILED BALANCE, A PRIORI PROBABILITIES, REJECTIONS,
ERGODICITY, "FASTER THAN THE CLOCK ALGORITHMS".
  The emphasis is on ORIENTATION, which is difficult to obtain (all the
mathematics being simple). A firm sense of orientation helps to avoid getting
lost, especially if you want to leave safe trodden-out paths established by
common usage.
  Even though I remain quite basic (and, I hope, readable), I make every effort
to drive home the essential messages, which are easily explained: the
crystal-clearness of detail balance, the main problem with Markov chains, the
great algorithmic freedom, both in thermodynamic and dynamic Monte Carlo, and
the fundamental differences between the two problems.
