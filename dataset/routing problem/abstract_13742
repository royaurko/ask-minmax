In various applications the search for certificates for certain properties
(e.g., stability of dynamical systems, program termination) can be formulated
as a quantified constraint solving problem with quantifier prefix
exists-forall. In this paper, we present an algorithm for solving a certain
class of such problems based on interval techniques in combination with
conservative linear programming approximation. In comparison with previous
work, the method is more general - allowing general Boolean structure in the
input constraint, and more efficient - using splitting heuristics that learn
from the success of previous linear programming approximations.
