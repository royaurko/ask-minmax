Let $G$ be a finite group. A faithful $G$-variety $X$ is called strongly
incompressible if every dominant $G$-equivariant rational map of $X$ onto
another faithful $G$-variety $Y$ is birational. We settle the problem of
existence of strongly incompressible $G$-curves for any finite group $G$ and
any base field $k$.
