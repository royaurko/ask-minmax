In this paper we propose a crossover operator for evolutionary algorithms
with real values that is based on the statistical theory of population
distributions. The operator is based on the theoretical distribution of the
values of the genes of the best individuals in the population. The proposed
operator takes into account the localization and dispersion features of the
best individuals of the population with the objective that these features would
be inherited by the offspring. Our aim is the optimization of the balance
between exploration and exploitation in the search process. In order to test
the efficiency and robustness of this crossover, we have used a set of
functions to be optimized with regard to different criteria, such as,
multimodality, separability, regularity and epistasis. With this set of
functions we can extract conclusions in function of the problem at hand. We
analyze the results using ANOVA and multiple comparison statistical tests. As
an example of how our crossover can be used to solve artificial intelligence
problems, we have applied the proposed model to the problem of obtaining the
weight of each network in a ensemble of neural networks. The results obtained
are above the performance of standard methods.
