In this article, we establish some new second main theorems for meromorphic
mappings of $\mathbb C^m$ into $\mathbb P^n(\mathbb C)$ and moving
hypersurfaces with truncated counting functions. A uniqueness theorem for these
mappings sharing few moving hypersurfaces without counting multiplicity is also
given. This result is an improvement of the recent result of Dethloff - Tan
[3]. Moreover the meromorphic mappings in our result may be algebraically
degenerate. The last purpose of this article is to study uniqueness problem in
the case where the meromorphic mappings agree on small identical sets.
