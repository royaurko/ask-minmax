When a semigroup has a unary operation, it is possible to define two binary
operations, namely, left and right division. In addition it is well known that
groups can be defined in terms of those two divisions. The aim of this paper is
to extend those results to other classes of unary semigroups. In the first part
of the paper we provide characterizations for several classes of unary
semigroups, including (a special class of) E-inversive, regular, completely
regular, inverse, Clifford, etc., in terms of left and right division. In the
second part we solve a problem that was posed elsewhere. The paper closes with
a list of open problems.
