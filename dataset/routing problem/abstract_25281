Supervisory control of discrete-event systems with a global safety
specification and with only local supervisors is a difficult problem. For
global specifications the equivalent conditions for local control synthesis to
equal global control synthesis may not be met. This paper formulates and solves
a control synthesis problem for a generator with a global specification and
with a combination of a coordinator and local controllers. Conditional
controllability is proven to be an equivalent condition for the existence of
such a coordinated controller. A procedure to compute the least restrictive
solution is also provided in this paper and conditions are stated under which
the result of our procedure coincides with the supremal controllable
sublanguage.
