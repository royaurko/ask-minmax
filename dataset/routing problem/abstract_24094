The discrete Painlev\'e I equation (dP$\rm_I$) is an integrable difference
equation which has the classical first Painlev\'e equation (P$\rm_I$) as a
continuum limit. dP$\rm_I$ is believed to be integrable because it is the
discrete isomonodromy condition for an associated (single-valued) linear
problem. In this paper, we derive higher-order difference equations as
isomonodromy conditions that are associated to the same linear deformation
problem. These form a hierarchy that may be compared to hierarchies of
integrable ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We strengthen this
comparison by continuum limit calculations that lead to equations in the
P$\rm_I$ hierarchy. We propose that our difference equations are discrete
versions of higher-order Painlev\'e equations.
