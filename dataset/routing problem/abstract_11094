We present a method that gives highly accurate electrostatic potentials for
systems where we have periodic boundary conditions in two spatial directions
but free boundary conditions in the third direction. These boundary conditions
are needed for all kind of surface problems. Our method has an O(N log N)
computational cost, where N is the number of grid points, with a very small
prefactor. This Poisson solver is primarily intended for real space methods
where the charge density and the potential are given on a uniform grid.
