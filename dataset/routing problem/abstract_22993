The feedback capacity of additive stationary Gaussian noise channels is
characterized as the solution to a variational problem. Toward this end, it is
proved that the optimal feedback coding scheme is stationary. When specialized
to the first-order autoregressive moving average noise spectrum, this
variational characterization yields a closed-form expression for the feedback
capacity. In particular, this result shows that the celebrated
Schalkwijk-Kailath coding scheme achieves the feedback capacity for the
first-order autoregressive moving average Gaussian channel, positively
answering a long-standing open problem studied by Butman, Schalkwijk-Tiernan,
Wolfowitz, Ozarow, Ordentlich, Yang-Kavcic-Tatikonda, and others. More
generally, it is shown that a k-dimensional generalization of the
Schalkwijk-Kailath coding scheme achieves the feedback capacity for any
autoregressive moving average noise spectrum of order k. Simply put, the
optimal transmitter iteratively refines the receiver's knowledge of the
intended message.
