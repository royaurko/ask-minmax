Strong convergence of a new iterative process based on the Shrinking
projection method to a common element of the set of common fixed points of an
infinite family of relatively quasi-nonexpansive multivalued mappings and the
solution set of an equilibrium problem in a Banach space is established. Our
results improved and extend the corresponding results announced by many others.
