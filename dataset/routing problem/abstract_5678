We argue that strong dynamics at the Planck scale can solve the cosmological
moduli problem. We discuss its implications for inflation models, and find that
a certain type of multi-field inflation model is required for this mechanism to
work, since otherwise it would lead to the serious eta-problem. Combined with
the inflaton-induced gravitino problem, we show that a chaotic inflation with a
discrete symmetry naturally avoids both problems. Interestingly, the focus
point supersymmetry is predicted when this mechanism is applied to the Polonyi
model.
