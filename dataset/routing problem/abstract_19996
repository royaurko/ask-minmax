Within mass perturbation theory, already the first order contribution to the
chiral condensate of the massive Schwinger model is UV divergent. We discuss
the problem of choosing a proper normalization and, by making use of some
bosonization results, we are able to choose a normalization so that the
resulting chiral condensate may be compared, e.g., with lattice data.
