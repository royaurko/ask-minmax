The goal of Geometric Constraint Solving is to find 2D or 3D placements of
some geometric primitives fulfilling some geometric constraints. The common
guideline is to solve them by a numerical iterative method (e.g. Newton-Raphson
method). A sole solution is obtained whereas many exist. But the number of
solutions can be exponential and methods should provide solutions close to a
sketch drawn by the user. Assuming that a decomposition-recombination planner
is used, we consider irreducible problems. Geometric reasoning can help to
simplify the underlying system of equations by changing a few equations and
triangularizing it. This triangularization is a geometric construction of
solutions, called construction plan. We aim at finding several solutions close
to the sketch on a one-dimensional path defined by a global parameter-homotopy
using the construction plan. Some numerical instabilities may be encountered
due to specific geometric configurations. We address this problem by changing
on-the-fly the construction plan. Numerical results show that this hybrid
method is efficient and robust.
