We discuss some problems posed by Ciesielski. For example we show that,
consistently, d_c is a singular cardinal and e_c<d_c. Next we prove that the
Martin Axiom for sigma --centered forcing notions implies that for every
function f:R^2 ---> R there are functions g_n,h_n:R ---> R, n< omega, such
that f(x,y)= sum_{n=0}^{infty} g_n(x)h_n(y). Finally, we deal with countably
continuous functions and we show that in the Cohen model they are exactly the
functions f with the property that (for all U in [R]^{aleph_1})(exists U^* in
[U]^{aleph_1}) (f restriction U^* is continuous).
