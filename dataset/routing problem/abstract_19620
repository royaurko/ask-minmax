Given a spatially dependent mass we obtain the two-point Green's function for
exactly solvable nonrelativistic problems. This is accomplished by mapping the
wave equation for these systems into well-known exactly solvable Schrodinger
equations with constant mass using point canonical transformation. The
one-dimensional oscillator class is considered and examples are given for
several mass distributions.
