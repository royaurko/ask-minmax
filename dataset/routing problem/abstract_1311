A few exact results concerning topological currents in field theories are
obtained. It is generally shown that, a topological charge can not generate any
kind of symmetry transformation on fields. It is also proven that, the
existence of a charge that does not generate any kind of symmetry
transformation on fields, has to be of topological origin. As a consequence, it
is found that in a given theory, superconductivity via Anderson-Higgs route can
only occur if the gauge coupling with other fields is minimal. Several physical
implications of these results are studied.
