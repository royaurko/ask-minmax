We consider the inverse boundary value problem for the Schrodinger operator
with time-dependent electromagnetic potentials in domains with obstacles. We
extend the resuls of the contributor's works [E1], [E2], [E3] to the case of
time-dependent potentials. We relate our results to the Aharonov-Bohm effect
caused by magnetic and electric fluxes.
