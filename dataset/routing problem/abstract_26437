A simple one-dimensional model is proposed, in which N spinless repulsively
interacting fermions occupy M>N degenerate states. It is argued that the energy
spectrum and the wavefunctions of this system strongly resemble the spectrum
and wavefunctions of 2D electrons in the lowest Landau level (the problem of
the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect). In particular, Laughlin-type wavefunctions
describe ground states at filling factors v = N/M = 1(2m+1). Within this model
the complimentary wavefunction for v = 1-1/(2m + 1) is found explicitly and
extremely simple ground state wavefunctions for arbitrary odd-denominator
filling factors are proposed.
