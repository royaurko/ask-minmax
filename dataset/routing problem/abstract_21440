Landau examined the partial sums of the M\"obius function and the Liouville
function for a number field $K$. First we shall try again the same problem by
using a new Perron's formula due to Liu and Ye. Next we consider the equivalent
theorem of the grand Riemann hypothesis for the Dedekind zeta-function of $K$
and that of the prime ideal theorem.
