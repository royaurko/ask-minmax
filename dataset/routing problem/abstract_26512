The reachability analysis of recursive programs that communicate
asynchronously over reliable FIFO channels calls for restrictions to ensure
decidability. Our first result characterizes communication topologies with a
decidable reachability problem restricted to eager runs (i.e., runs where
messages are either received immediately after being sent, or never received).
The problem is EXPTIME-complete in the decidable case. The second result is a
doubly exponential time algorithm for bounded context analysis in this setting,
together with a matching lower bound. Both results extend and improve previous
work from La Torre et al.
