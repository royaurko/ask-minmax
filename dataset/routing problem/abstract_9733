The problem for selection of appropriate assets investing composition
projects such as assets rationalization plays an important role in promotion of
business systems. We consider the assets investing composition plan problems
subject to grey multiobjective programming with the grey inequality
constraints. In this paper, we show in detail the entire process of the
application from modeling the case problem to generating its solution. To solve
the grey multi objective programming problem, we then develop and apply an
algorithm of grey multiple objective programming by weighting method and an
algorithm of grey multiple objective programming based on q -positioned
programming method. These algorithms all regard as of great importance
uncertainty (greyness) at grey multiobjective programming and simple and easy
the calculating process. The calculating examples of paper also show ability
and effectiveness of algorithms.
