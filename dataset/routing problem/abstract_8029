A study of assisted problem solving formalized via decompositions of
deterministic finite automata is initiated. The landscape of new types of
decompositions of finite automata this study uncovered is presented. Languages
with various degrees of decomposability between undecomposable and perfectly
decomposable are shown to exist.
