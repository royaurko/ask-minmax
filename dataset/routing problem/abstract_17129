We study global monotone solutions of the free boundary problem that arises
from minimizing the energy functional $I(u) = \int |\nabla u|^2 + V(u)$, where
$V(u)$ is the characteristic function of the interval $(-1,1)$. This functional
is a close relative of the scalar Ginzburg-Landau functional $J(u) = \int
|\nabla u|^2 + W(u)$, where $W(u) = (1-u^2)^2/2$ is a standard double-well
potential. According to a famous conjecture of De Giorgi, global critical
points of $J$ that are bounded and monotone in one direction have level sets
that are hyperplanes, at least up to dimension $8$. Recently, Del Pino,
Kowalczyk and Wei gave an intricate fixed-point-argument construction of a
counterexample in dimension $9$, whose level sets ``follow" the entire minimal
non-planar graph, built by Bombieri, De Giorgi and Giusti (BdGG). In this paper
we turn to the free boundary variant of the problem and we construct the
analogous example; the advantage here is that of geometric transparency as the
interphase $\{|u| < 1\}$ will be contained within a unit-width band around the
BdGG graph. Furthermore, we avoid the technicalities of Del Pino, Kowalczyk and
Wei's fixed-point argument by using barriers only.
