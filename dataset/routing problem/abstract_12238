Constraint problems can be trivially solved in parallel by exploring
different branches of the search tree concurrently. Previous approaches have
focused on implementing this functionality in the solver, more or less
transparently to the user. We propose a new approach, which modifies the
constraint model of the problem. An existing model is split into new models
with added constraints that partition the search space. Optionally, additional
constraints are imposed that rule out the search already done. The advantages
of our approach are that it can be implemented easily, computations can be
stopped and restarted, moved to different machines and indeed solved on
machines which are not able to communicate with each other at all.
