We develop abstract learning frameworks (ALFs) for synthesis that embody the
principles of CEGIS (counter-example based inductive synthesis) strategies that
have become widely applicable in recent years. Our framework defines a general
abstract framework of iterative learning, based on a hypothesis space that
captures the synthesized objects, a sample space that forms the space on which
induction is performed, and a concept space that abstractly defines the
semantics of the learning process. We show that a variety of synthesis
algorithms in current literature can be embedded in this general framework.
While studying these embeddings, we also generalize some of the synthesis
problems these instances are of, resulting in new ways of looking at synthesis
problems using learning. We also investigate convergence issues for the general
framework, and exhibit three recipes for convergence in finite time. The first
two recipes generalize current techniques for convergence used by existing
synthesis engines. The third technique is a more involved technique of which we
know of no existing instantiation, and we instantiate it to concrete synthesis
problems.
