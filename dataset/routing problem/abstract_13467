In this paper, we introduce a definition of BV functions for (non-Gaussian)
differentiable measure in a Gelfand triple which is an extension of the
definition of BV functions in [RZZ12], using Dirichlet form theory. By this
definition, we can analyze the reflected stochastic quantization problem
associated with a self-adjoint operator $A$ and a cylindrical Wiener process on
a convex set $\Gamma$ in a Banach space $E$. We prove the existence of a
martingale solution of this problem if $\Gamma$ is a regular convex set.
