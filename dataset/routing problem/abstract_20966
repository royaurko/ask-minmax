Suppose the edges of the complete graph on n vertices are coloured using r
colours; how large a k-connected subgraph are we guaranteed to find, which uses
only at most s of the colours? This question is due to Bollobas, and the case s
= 1 was considered in a preivous paper by the same contributors. Here we consider
the case s >= 2, and mention some open problems.
