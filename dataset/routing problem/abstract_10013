A path in an edge-colored graph is rainbow if no two edges of it are colored
the same. The graph is said to be rainbow connected if there is a rainbow path
between every pair of vertices. If there is a rainbow shortest path between
every pair of vertices, the graph is strong rainbow connected. We consider the
complexity of the problem of deciding if a given edge-colored graph is rainbow
or strong rainbow connected. These problems are called Rainbow connectivity and
Strong rainbow connectivity, respectively. We prove both problems remain $\sf
NP$-complete on chordal outerplanar graphs and $k$-regular graphs for $k \geq
3$. Previously, no graph class was known where the complexity of the two
problems would differ. We show that for block graphs, which form a subclass of
chordal graphs, Rainbow connectivity is $\sf NP$-complete while Strong rainbow
connectivity is in $\sf P$.
