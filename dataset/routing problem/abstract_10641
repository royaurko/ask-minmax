Walsh [Wal10, Wal09], Davies et al. [DKNW10, DKNW11], and Narodytska et al.
[NWX11] studied various voting systems empirically and showed that they can
often be manipulated effectively, despite their manipulation problems being
NP-hard. Such an experimental approach is sorely missing for NP-hard control
problems, where control refers to attempts to tamper with the outcome of
elections by adding/deleting/partitioning either voters or candidates. We
experimentally tackle NP-hard control problems for Bucklin and fallback voting.
Among natural voting systems with efficient winner determination, fallback
voting is currently known to display the broadest resistance to control in
terms of NP-hardness, and Bucklin voting has been shown to behave almost as
well in terms of control resistance [ER10, EPR11, EFPR11]. We also investigate
control resistance experimentally for plurality voting, one of the first voting
systems analyzed with respect to electoral control [BTT92, HHR07]. Our findings
indicate that NP-hard control problems can often be solved effectively in
practice. Moreover, our experiments allow a more fine-grained analysis and
comparison-across various control scenarios, vote distribution models, and
voting systems-than merely stating NP-hardness for all these control problems.
