A generic surface in Euclidean 3-space is determined uniquely by its metric
and curvature. Classification of all special surfaces where this is not the
case, i.e. of surfaces possessing isometries which preserve the mean curvature,
is known as the Bonnet problem. Regarding the Bonnet problem, we show how
analytic methods of the theory of integrable systems
 -- such as finite-gap integration, isomonodromic deformation, and loop group
description -- can be applied for studying global properties of special
surfaces.
