This is a survey of the rationality problem in invariant theory.
  It also contains some new results, in particular in Chapter 2 on moduli
spaces of plane curves with a theta-characteristic, and a detailed account of
the relation of the Hesselink stratification of the Hilbert nullcone to the
rationality problem, with an application to the rationality of the moduli space
of plane curves of degree 34.
