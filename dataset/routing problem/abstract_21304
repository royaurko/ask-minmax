We derive sufficient conditions for the solvability of the observer design
problem for a wide class of nonlinear time-varying systems, including those
having triangular structure. We establish that, under weaker assumptions than
those imposed in the existing works in the literature, it is possible to
construct a switching sequence of time-varying noncausal dynamics, exhibiting
the state determination of our system.
