The problem of quantization of general relativity is considered in the
framework of noncommutative differential geometry. Operator analogues for
interval, scalar curvature, values of the Einstein tensor are proposed. Quantum
measurements of these observables lead to a paradox: different procedures of
measurements can supply non equivalent geometrical pictures of space-time. A
concrete example of such situation is provided.
