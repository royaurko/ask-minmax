The chiral langasite Ba$\_3$NbFe$\_3$Si$\_2$O$\_{14}$ is a multiferroic
compound. While its magnetic order below T$\_N$=27 K is now well characterised,
its polar order is still controversial. We thus looked at the phonon spectrum
and its temperature dependence to unravel possible crystal symmetry breaking.
We combined optical measurements (both infrared and Raman spectroscopy) with ab
initio calculations and show that signatures of a polar state are clearly
present in the phonon spectrum even at room temperature. An additional symmetry
lowering occurs below 120~K as seen from emergence of softer phonon modes in
the THz range. These results confirm the multiferroic nature of this langasite
and open new routes to understand the origin of the polar state.
