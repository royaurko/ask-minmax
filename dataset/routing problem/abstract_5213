The well-known two-capacitor problem, in which exactly half the stored energy
disappears when a charged capacitor is connected to an identical capacitor is
discussed based on the mechanical harmonic oscillator model approach. In the
mechanical harmonic oscillator model, it is shown first that \emph {exactly
half} the work done by a constant applied force is dissipated irrespective of
the form of dissipation mechanism when the system comes to a new equilibrium
after a constant force is abruptly applied. This model is then applied to the
energy loss mechanism in the capacitor charging problem or the two-capacitor
problem. This approach allows a simple explanation of the energy dissipation
mechanism in these problems and shows that the dissipated energy should always
be \emph {exactly half} the supplied energy whether that is caused by the Joule
heat or by the radiation. This paper which provides a simple treatment of the
energy dissipation mechanism in the two-capacitor problem is suitable for all
undergraduate class level.
