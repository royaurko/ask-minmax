The problem of finding the set of all multi-model robust PID and three-term
stabilizers for discrete-time systems is solved in this paper. The method uses
the fact that decoupling of parameter space at singular frequencies is
invariant under a linear transformation. The resulting stable regions are
composed by convex polygonal slices. The design problem includes the assertion
of intervals with stable polygons and the detection of stable polygons. This
paper completes the solutions to both problems.
