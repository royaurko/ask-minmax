We argue that the existence of genus one fibrations with multisections of
high degree on certain Calabi-Yau threefolds implies the existence of pairs of
such varieties that are not birational, but are derived equivalent. It also
(likely) implies the existence of non-birational counterexamples to the Torelli
problem for Calabi-Yau threefolds.
