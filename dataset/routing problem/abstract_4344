The problem of two fixed centers is a classical integrable problem, stated
and integrated by Euler in 1760. The integrability is due to the unexpected
first integral $G$. Some straightforward generalizations of the problem still
have the generalization of $G$ as a first integral, but do not possess the
energy integral. We present some numerical integrations suggesting that in the
domain of bounded orbits the behavior of these {\it a priori} non hamiltonian
systems is very similar to the behavior of usual quasi-integrable systems.
