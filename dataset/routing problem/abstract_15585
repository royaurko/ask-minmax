We propose a generalized car parking problem where cars of two different
sizes are sequentially parked on a line with a given probability $q$. The free
parameter $q$ interpolates between the classical car parking problem of only
one car size and the competitive random sequential adsorption (CRSA) of a
binary mixture. We give an exact solution to the CRSA rate equations and find
that the final coverage, the jamming limit, of the line is always larger for a
binary mixture than for the uni-sized case. The analytical results are in good
agreement with our direct numerical simulations of the problem.
