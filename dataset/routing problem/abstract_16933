Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) models many important intractable
NP-hard problems such as propositional satisfiability problem (SAT). Algorithms
with non-trivial upper bounds on running time for restricted SAT with bounded
clause length k (k-SAT) can be classified into three styles: DPLL-like,
PPSZ-like and Local Search, with local search algorithms having already been
generalized to CSP with bounded constraint arity k (k-CSP). We generalize a
DPLL-like algorithm in its simplest form and a PPSZ-like algorithm from k-SAT
to k-CSP. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to use PPSZ-like
strategy to solve k-CSP, and before little work has been focused on the
DPLL-like or PPSZ-like strategies for k-CSP.
