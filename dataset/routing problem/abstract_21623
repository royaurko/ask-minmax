In this paper we present the discontinuous Galerkin method to solve the
problem of the two-dimensional air pollution model. The resulting system of
ordinary differential equations is called the semidiscrete formulation. We show
the existence and uniqueness of the ODE system and provide the error estimates
for the numerical error.
