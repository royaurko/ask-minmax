Two algorithms are presented for "compiling" influence diagrams into a set of
simple decision rules. These decision rules define simple-to-execute, complete,
consistent, and near-optimal decision procedures. These compilation algorithms
can be used to derive decision procedures for human teams solving time
constrained decision problems.
