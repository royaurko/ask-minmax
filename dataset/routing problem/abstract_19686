Using an analogue of Myers' theorem for minimal surfaces and three
dimensional topology, we prove the diameter sphere theorem for Ricci curvature
in dimension three and a corresponding eigenvalue pinching theorem. This
settles these two open problems for closed 3 manifolds with positive Ricci
curvature since they are both false in dimensions greater than three.
