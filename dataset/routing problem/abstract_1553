The baryon octet and decuplet masses and Bethe-Salpeter vertex and wave
functions are calculated in the ladder approximation to the quark exchange
between a scalar or axialvector diquark and a constituent quark. These
functions reflecting full Lorentz covariance are given in terms of an expansion
in Gegenbauer polynomials. In the rest frame of the baryon, a complete partial
wave decomposition of the Bethe-Salpeter wave function is performed. The
confinement of quarks and diquarks is implemented via a parametrisation of the
corresponding propagators. We also discuss some aspects of the momentum routing
in the ladder approximation to the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Numerical results
for the octet and decuplet masses with broken flavour SU(3) in the conserved
isospin limit are presented.
