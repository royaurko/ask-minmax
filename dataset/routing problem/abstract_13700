The Tree Evaluation Problem was introduced by Cook et al. in 2010 as a
candidate for separating P from L and NL. The most general space lower bounds
known for the Tree Evaluation Problem require a semantic restriction on the
branching programs and use a connection to well-known pebble games to generate
a bottleneck argument. These bounds are met by corresponding upper bounds
generated by natural implementations of optimal pebbling algorithms. In this
paper we extend these ideas to a variety of restricted families of both
deterministic and non-deterministic branching programs, proving tight lower
bounds under these restricted models. We also survey and unify known lower
bounds in our "pebbling argument" framework.
