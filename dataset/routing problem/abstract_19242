This work studies the problem of distributed compression of correlated
sources with an action-dependent joint distribution. This class of problems is,
in fact, an extension of the Slepian-Wolf model, but where cost-constrained
actions taken by the encoder or the decoder affect the generation of one of the
sources. The purpose of this work is to study the implications of actions on
the achievable rates.
  In particular, two cases where transmission occurs over a rate-limited link
are studied; case A for actions taken at the decoder and case B where actions
are taken at the encoder. A complete single-letter characterization of the set
of achievable rates is given in both cases. Furthermore, a network coding setup
is investigated for the case where actions are taken at the encoder. The
sources are generated at different nodes of the network and are required at a
set of terminal nodes, yet transmission occurs over a general, acyclic,
directed network. For this setup, generalized cut-set bounds are derived, and a
full characterization of the set of achievable rates using single-letter
expressions is provided. For this scenario, random linear network coding is
proved to be optimal, even though this is not a classical multicast problem.
Additionally, two binary examples are investigated and demonstrate how actions
taken at different nodes of the system have a significant affect on the
achievable rate region in comparison to a naive time-sharing strategy.
