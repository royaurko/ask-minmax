We present the applications of variation -- wavelet analysis to
polynomial/rational approximations for orbital motion in transverse plane for a
single particle in a circular magnetic lattice in case when we take into
account multipolar expansion up to an arbitrary finite number and additional
kick terms. We reduce initial dynamical problem to the finite number (equal to
the number of n-poles) of standard algebraical problems. We have the solution
as a multiresolution (multiscales) expansion in the base of compactly supported
wavelet basis.
