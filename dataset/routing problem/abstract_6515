In this paper we investigate the existence of model-equivalence reduction
between NP-logic systems which are logic systems with model existence problem
in NP. It is shown that among all NP-systems with model checking problem in NP,
the existentially quantified propositional logic (\exists PF) is maximal with
respect to poly-time model-equivalent reduction. However, \exists PF seems not
a maximal NP-system in general because there exits a NP-system with model
checking problem D^P-complete.
