We present an alternative approach to solve the hardware (HW) and software
(SW) partitioning problem, which uses Bounded Model Checking (BMC) based on
Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) in conjunction with a multi-core support
using Open Multi-Processing. The multi-core SMT-based BMC approach allows
initializing many verification instances based on processors cores numbers
available to the model checker. Each instance checks for a different optimum
value until the optimization problem is satisfied. The goal is to show that
multi-core model-checking techniques can be effective, in particular cases, to
find the optimal solution of the HW-SW partitioning problem using an SMT-based
BMC approach. We compare the experimental results of our proposed approach with
Integer Linear Programming and the Genetic Algorithm.
