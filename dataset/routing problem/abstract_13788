We obtain uncountably many periodic solutions to the singular Yamabe problem
on a round sphere, that blow up along a great circle. These are (complete)
constant scalar curvature metrics on the complement of $S^1$ inside $S^m$,
$m\geq 5$, that are conformal to the round (incomplete) metric and "periodic"
in the sense of being invariant under a discrete group of conformal
transformations. These solutions come from bifurcating branches of constant
scalar curvature metrics on compact quotients of $S^m \setminus S^1\cong
S^{m-2}\times H^2$.
