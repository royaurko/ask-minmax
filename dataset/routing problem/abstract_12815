SLR technique has being used for determination of ERP during over twenty
years. Most of results contributed to IERS are based on analysis of
observations of Lageos 1&2 satellites collected at the global tracking network
of about 40 stations. Now 5 analysis centers submit operative (with 2-15 days
delay) solutions and about 10 analysis centers yearly contribute final (up to
23 years) ERP series. Some statistics related to SLR observations and analysis
is presented and analyzed. Possible problems in SLR observations and analysis
and ways of its solution are discussed.
