We find that there are three axions in standard--like superstring models in
the four dimensional free fermionic formulation. These axions are either
harmful or very heavy. Therefore, they cannot solve the strong CP problem. We
show that this is a general result in superstring models with chiral
generations from the $Z_2$ twisted sectors which use a $Z_4$ twist.
