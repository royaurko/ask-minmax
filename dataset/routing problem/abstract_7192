It is well known that a direct Lagrangian description of radiation damping is
still missing. In this paper a specific approach of this problem was used,
which is the standard way to treat the radiation damping problem. A $N=2$
supersymmetric extension for the model describing the radiation damping on the
noncommutative plane with electric and magnetic interactions was obtained. The
entire supercharge algebra and the total Hamiltonian for the system were
analyzed. Finally, noncommutativity features were introduced and its
consequences were explored..
