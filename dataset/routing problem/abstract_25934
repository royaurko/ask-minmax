We prove a Schwarz lemma for a domain E in 3-dimensional complex space that
arises in connection with a problem in H infinity control theory. We describe a
class of automorphisms of E and determine the distinguished boundary of E. We
obtain a type of Schwarz-Pick lemma for a two by two mu-synthesis problem.
