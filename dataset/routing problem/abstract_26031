In this paper we consider a tank containing fluid and we want to estimate the
horizontal currents when the fluid surface height is measured. The fluid motion
is described by shallow water equations in two horizontal dimensions. We build
a simple non-linear observer which takes advantage of the symmetries of fluid
dynamics laws. As a result its structure is based on convolutions with smooth
isotropic kernels, and the observer is remarkably robust to noise. We prove the
convergence of the observer around a steady-state. In numerical applications
local exponential convergence is expected. The observer is also applied to the
problem of predicting the ocean circulation. Realistic simulations illustrate
the relevance of the approach compared with some standard oceanography
techniques.
