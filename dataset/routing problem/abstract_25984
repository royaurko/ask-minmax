The nuclear equation of state (EoS) at high densities and/or extreme isospin
is one of the longstanding problems of nuclear physics. In the last years
substantial progress has been made to constrain the EoS both, from the
astrophysical side and from accelerator based experiments. Heavy ion
experiments support a soft EoS at moderate densities while the possible
existence of high mass neutron star observations favors a stiff EoS. Ab initio
calculations for the nuclear many-body problem make predictions for the density
and isospin dependence of the EoS far away from the saturation point. Both, the
constraints from astrophysics and accelerator based experiments are shown to be
in agreement with the predictions from many-body theory.
