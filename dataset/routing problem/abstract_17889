We study reconfiguration problems for cliques in a graph, which determine
whether there exists a sequence of cliques that transforms a given clique into
another one in a step-by-step fashion. As one step of a transformation, we
consider three different types of rules, which are defined and studied in
reconfiguration problems for independent sets. We first prove that all the
three rules are equivalent in cliques. We then show that the problems are
PSPACE-complete for perfect graphs, while we give polynomial-time algorithms
for several classes of graphs, such as even-hole-free graphs and cographs. In
particular, the shortest variant, which computes the shortest length of a
desired sequence, can be solved in polynomial time for chordal graphs,
bipartite graphs, planar graphs, and bounded treewidth graphs.
