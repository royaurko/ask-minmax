Density level sets are mainly estimated using one of three methodologies:
plug-in, excess mass, or a hybrid approach. The plug-in methods are based on
replacing the unknown density by some nonparametric estimator, usually the
kernel. Thus, the bandwidth selection is a fundamental problem from a practical
point of view. Recently, specific selectors for level sets have been proposed.
However, if some a priori information about the geometry of the level set is
available, then excess mass algorithms can be useful. In this case, a density
estimator is not necessary, and the problem of bandwidth selection can be
avoided. The third methodology is a hybrid of the others. As in the excess mass
method, it assumes a mild geometric restriction on the level set and, like the
plug-in approach, requires a pilot nonparametric estimator of the density. One
interesting open question concerns the practical performance of these methods.
In this work, existing methods are reviewed, and two new hybrid algorithms are
proposed. Their practical behaviour is compared through extensive simulations.
