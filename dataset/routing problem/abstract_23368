We analyze the expected signals of two future neutrino experiments, kamLAND
and BOREXINO. We show that with just these experiments, we will hopefully be
able to determine which of the existing solutions to the solar neutrino problem
is the real solution. We also analyze existing solar neutrino data and
determine the best-fit points in the oscillation-parameter space finding that
with the inclusion of SNO-charged current, the global-rates analysis gives a
favored LMA solution with a goodness of fit (g.o.f) of just 32.63%, whereas the
g.o.f of the SMA solution is 9.83%. Nonetheless, maximal and quasi-maximal
mixing is not favored. If we include the Superkamiokande spectrum in our \chi^2
analysis, we obtain a LMA solution with a g.o.f. of 84.38%.
