We consider a new fundamental question regarding the point-to-point
memoryless channel. The source-channel separation theorem indicates that random
codebook construction for lossy source compression and channel coding can be
independently constructed and paired to achieve optimal performance for
coordinating a source sequence with a reconstruction sequence. But what if we
want the channel input to also be coordinated with the source and
reconstruction? Such situations arise in network communication problems, where
the correlation inherent in the information sources can be used to correlate
channel inputs.
  Hybrid codes have been shown to be useful in a number of network
communication problems. In this work we highlight their advantages over purely
digital codebook construction by applying them to the point-to-point setting,
coordinating both the channel input and the reconstruction with the source.
