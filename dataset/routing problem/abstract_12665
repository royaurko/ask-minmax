We consider the problem of testing means from samples of two populations for
which the labels are not defined with certainty. We show that this problem is
connected to another one that is testing expected values of components of
mixture-models from two data samples. The underlying mixture-model is
associated with known varying mixing-weights. We provide a testing procedure
that performs well. Then we point out the loss of performance of our method due
to the mixing-effect by comparing its numerical performances to the Welch's
t-test on means which would have been done if true labels were available.
