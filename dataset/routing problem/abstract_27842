In this paper, we propose a novel method for image fusion with a
high-resolution panchromatic image and a low-resolution multispectral image at
the same geographical location. The fusion is formulated as a convex
optimization problem which minimizes a linear combination of a least-squares
fitting term and a dynamic gradient sparsity regularizer. The former is to
preserve accurate spectral information of the multispectral image, while the
latter is to keep sharp edges of the high-resolution panchromatic image. We
further propose to simultaneously register the two images during the fusing
process, which is naturally achieved by virtue of the dynamic gradient sparsity
property. An efficient algorithm is then devised to solve the optimization
problem, accomplishing a linear computational complexity in the size of the
output image in each iteration. We compare our method against seven
state-of-the-art image fusion methods on multispectral image datasets from four
satellites. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
substantially outperforms the others in terms of both spatial and spectral
qualities. We also show that our method can provide high-quality products from
coarsely registered real-world datasets. Finally, a MATLAB implementation is
provided to facilitate future research.
