We demonstrate how the solution to an exterior Dirichlet boundary value
problem of the axisymmetric, stationary Einstein equations can be found in
terms of generalized solutions of the Backlund type. The proof that this
generalization procedure is valid is given, which also proves conjectures about
earlier representations of the gravitational field corresponding to rotating
disks of dust in terms of Backlund type solutions.
