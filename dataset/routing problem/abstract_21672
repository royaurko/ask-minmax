In this research, we consider a mixture of genome fragments of a certain
bacteria set. The problem of mixture separation is studied under the assumption
that all the genomes present in the mixture are completely sequenced or are
close to those already sequenced. Such assumption is relevant, e.g., in regular
observations of ecological or biomedical objects, where the possible set of
microorganisms is known and it is only necessary to follow their
concentrations.
