A Brownian time process is a Markov process subordinated to the absolute
value of an independent one-dimensional Brownian motion. Its transition
densities solve an initial value problem involving the square of the generator
of the original Markov process. An apparently unrelated class of processes,
emerging as the scaling limits of continuous time random walks, involve
subordination to the inverse or hitting time process of a classical stable
subordinator. The resulting densities solve fractional Cauchy problems, an
extension that involves fractional derivatives in time. In this paper, we will
show a close and unexpected connection between these two classes of processes,
and consequently, an equivalence between these two families of partial
differential equations.
