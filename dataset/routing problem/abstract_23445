The tetrahedron $A_4$ group has been widely used in studying neutrino mixing
matrix. It provides a natural framework of model building for the tri-bimaximal
mixing matrix. In this class of models, it is necessary to have two Higgs
fields, $\chi$ and $\chi'$, transforming under $A_4$ as 3 with one of them
having vacuum expectation values for the three components to be equal and
another having only one of the components to be non-zero. These specific vev
structures require separating $\chi$ and $\chi'$ from communicating with each
other. The clash of the different vev structures for $\chi$ and $\chi'$ is the
so called sequestering problem. In this work, I show that it is possible to
construct renormalizable supersymmetric models producing the tri-bimaximal
neutrino mixing with no sequestering problem.
