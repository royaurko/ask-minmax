The problem of phaseless aperture synthesis is of current interest in
phase-unstable VLBI with a small number of elements when either the use of
closure phases is not possible (a two-element interferometer) or their quality
and number are not enough for acceptable image reconstruction by standard
adaptive calibration methods. Therefore, we discuss the problem of unique image
reconstruction only from the spectrum magnitude of a source. We suggest an
efficient method for phaseless VLBI mapping of compact extragalactic radio
sources. This method is based on the reconstruction of the spectrum magnitude
for a source on the entire UV plane from the measured visibility magnitude on a
limited set of points and the reconstruction of the sought-for image of the
source by Fienup's method from the spectrum magnitude reconstructed at the
first stage. We present the results of our mapping of the extragalactic radio
source 2200 +420 using astrometric and geodetic observations on a global VLBI
array. Particular attention is given to studying the capabilities of a
two-element interferometer in connection with the putting into operation of a
Russian-made radio interferometer based on Quasar RT-32 radio telescopes.
