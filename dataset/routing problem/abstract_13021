The significance of the DDoS problem and the increased occurrence,
sophistication and strength of attacks has led to the dawn of numerous
prevention mechanisms. Each proposed prevention mechanism has some unique
advantages and disadvantages over the others. In this paper, we present a
classification of available mechanisms that are proposed in literature on
preventing Internet services from possible DDoS attacks and discuss the
strengths and weaknesses of each mechanism. This provides better understanding
of the problem and enables a security administrator to effectively equip his
arsenal with proper prevention mechanisms for fighting against DDoS threat.
