We consider the problem of approximating discrete-time plants with
finite-valued sensors and actu- ators by deterministic finite memory systems
for the purpose of certified-by-design controller synthesis. Building on ideas
from robust control, we propose a control-oriented notion of finite state
approximation for these systems, demonstrate its relevance to the control
synthesis problem, and discuss its key features.
