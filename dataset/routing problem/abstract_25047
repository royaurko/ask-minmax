We prove that each overtwisted contact structure has knot types that are
represented by infinitely many distinct transverse knots all with the same
self-linking number. In some cases, we can even classify all such knots. We
also show similar results for Legendrian knots and prove a "folk" result
concerning loose transverse and Legendrian knots (that is knots with
overtwisted complements) which says that such knots are determined by their
classical invariants (up to contactomorphism). Finally we discuss how these
results partially fill in our understanding of the "geography" and "botany"'
problems for Legendrian knots in overtwisted contact structures, as well as
many open questions regarding these problems.
