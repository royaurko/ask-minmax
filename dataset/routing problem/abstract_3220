Geometric programming (GP) provides a power tool for solving a variety of
optimization problems. In the real world, many applications of geometric
programming (GP) are engineering design problems in which some of the problem
parameters are estimating of actual values. This paper develops a solution
procedure to solve nonlinear programming problems using GP technique by
splitting the cost coefficients, constraint coefficients and exponents with the
help of binary numbers. The equivalent mathematical programming problems are
formulated to find their corresponding value of the objective function based on
the duality theorem. The ability of calculating the cost coefficients,
constraint coefficients and exponents developed in this paper might help lead
to more realistic modeling efforts in engineering design areas. Standard
nonlinear programming software has been used to solve the proposed optimization
problem. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the method.
