We show that the see-saw neutrino mass mechanism can coexist naturally with
an extended gauge symmetry (i.e. without any gauge heirarchy problem) provided
that the gauge symmetry contains gauged lepton number differences. The simplest
such `natural' see-saw models are constructed and their implications for
neutrino anomalies discussed.
