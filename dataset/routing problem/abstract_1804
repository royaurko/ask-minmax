We present a procedure for direct characterization of the dephasing noise
acting on a single qubit by making repeated measurements of the qubit coherence
under suitably chosen sequences of controls. We show that this allows a
numerical reconstruction of the short time noise correlation function and that
it can be combined with a series of measurements under free evolution to allow
a characterization of the noise correlation function over many orders of
magnitude range in timescale. We also make an analysis of the robustness and
reliability of the estimated correlation functions. Application to a simple
model of two uncorrelated noise fluctuators using decoupling pulse sequences
shows that the approach provides a useful route for experimental
characterization of dephasing noise and its statistical properties in a variety
of condensed phase and atomic systems.
