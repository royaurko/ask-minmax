The aim of edge editing or modification problems is to change a given graph
by adding and deleting of a small number of edges in order to satisfy a certain
property. We consider the Edge Editing to a Connected Graph of Given Degrees
problem that asks for a graph G, non-negative integers d,k and a function
\delta:V(G)->{1,...,d}, whether it is possible to obtain a connected graph G'
from G such that the degree of v is \delta(v) for any vertex v by at most k
edge editing operations. As the problem is NP-complete even if \delta(v)=2, we
are interested in the parameterized complexity and show that Edge Editing to a
Connected Graph of Given Degrees admits a polynomial kernel when parameterized
by d+k. For the special case \delta(v)=d, i.e., when the aim is to obtain a
connected d-regular graph, the problem is shown to be fixed parameter tractable
when parameterized by k only.
