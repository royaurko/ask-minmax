There are many challenges when designing and deploying wireless sensor
networks (WSNs). One of the key challenges is how to make full use of the
limited energy to prolong the lifetime of the network, because energy is a
valuable resource in WSNs. The status of energy consumption should be
continuously monitored after network deployment. In this paper, we propose
coverage and connectivity aware neural network based energy efficient routing
in WSN with the objective of maximizing the network lifetime. In the proposed
scheme, the problem is formulated as linear programming (LP) with coverage and
connectivity aware constraints. Cluster head selection is proposed using
adaptive learning in neural networks followed by coverage and connectivity
aware routing with data transmission. The proposed scheme is compared with
existing schemes with respect to the parameters such as number of alive nodes,
packet delivery fraction, and node residual energy. The simulation results show
that the proposed scheme can be used in wide area of applications in WSNs.
