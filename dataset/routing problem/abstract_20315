We give a global version of the Bryant representation of surfaces of constant
mean curvature one (cmc-1) in hyperbolic space. This allows to set the
associated non-abelian period problem in the framework of flat unitary vector
bundles on Riemann surfaces. We use this machinery to prove the existence of
certain cmc-1 surfaces having prescribed global monodromy.
