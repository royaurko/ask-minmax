Suppose that we are given two independent sets $I_0$ and $I_r$ of a graph
such that $|I_0| = |I_r|$, and imagine that a token is placed on each vertex in
$I_0$. The token jumping problem is to determine whether there exists a
sequence of independent sets which transforms $I_0$ into $I_r$ so that each
independent set in the sequence results from the previous one by moving exactly
one token to another vertex. This problem is known to be PSPACE-complete even
for planar graphs of maximum degree three, and W[1]-hard for general graphs
when parameterized by the number of tokens. In this paper, we present a
fixed-parameter algorithm for the token jumping problem on planar graphs, where
the parameter is only the number of tokens. Furthermore, the algorithm can be
modified so that it finds a shortest sequence for a yes-instance. The same
scheme of the algorithms can be applied to a wider class of graphs,
$K_{3,t}$-free graphs for any fixed integer $t \ge 3$, and it yields
fixed-parameter algorithms.
