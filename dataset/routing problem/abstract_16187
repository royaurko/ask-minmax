We present a number of positive and negative results for variants of the
matroid secretary problem. Most notably, we design a constant-factor
competitive algorithm for the "random assignment" model where the weights are
assigned randomly to the elements of a matroid, and then the elements arrive
on-line in an adversarial order (extending a result of Soto \cite{Soto11}).
This is under the assumption that the matroid is known in advance. If the
matroid is unknown in advance, we present an $O(\log r \log n)$-approximation,
and prove that a better than $O(\log n / \log \log n)$ approximation is
impossible. This resolves an open question posed by Babaioff et al.
\cite{BIK07}.
  As a natural special case, we also consider the classical secretary problem
where the number of candidates $n$ is unknown in advance. If $n$ is chosen by
an adversary from $\{1,...,N\}$, we provide a nearly tight answer, by providing
an algorithm that chooses the best candidate with probability at least
$1/(H_{N-1}+1)$ and prove that a probability better than $1/H_N$ cannot be
achieved (where $H_N$ is the $N$-th harmonic number).
