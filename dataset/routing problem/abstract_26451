We consider the problem of N identical fermions of mass M and one
distinguishable particle of mass m interacting via short-range interactions in
a confined quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) geometry. For N=2 and mass ratios
M/m<13.6, we find non-Efimov trimers that smoothly evolve from 2D to 3D. In the
limit of strong 2D confinement, we show that the energy of the N+1 system can
be approximated by an effective two-channel model. We use this approximation to
solve the 3+1 problem and we find that a bound tetramer can exist for mass
ratios M/m as low as 5 for strong confinement, thus providing the first example
of a universal, non-Efimov tetramer involving three identical fermions.
