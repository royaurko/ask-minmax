In this work, we critique two papers, "A Polynomial-Time Solution to the
Clique Problem" by Tamta, Pande, and Dhami, and "A Polynomial-Time Algorithm
For Solving Clique Problems" by LaPlante. We summarize and analyze both papers,
noting that the algorithms presented in both papers are flawed. We conclude
that neither contributor has successfully established that P = NP.
