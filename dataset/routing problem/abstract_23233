Supersymmetry breaking in the early universe induces scalar soft potentials
with curvature of order the Hubble constant. This has a dramatic effect on the
coherent production of scalar fields along flat directions. For the moduli
problem it generically gives a concrete realization of the problem by
determining the field value subsequent to inflation. However it might suggest a
solution if the minimum of the induced potential coincides with the true
minimum. The induced Hubble scale mass also has important implications for the
Affleck-Dine mechanism of baryogenesis. This mechanism requires large squark or
slepton expectation values to develop along flat directions in the early
universe. This is generally not the case if the induced mass squared is
positive, but does occur if it is negative. The resulting baryon to entropy
ratio depends mainly on the dimension of the nonrenormalizable operator in the
superpotential which stabilizes the flat direction, and the reheat temperature
after inflation. Unlike the original scenario, it is possible to obtain an
acceptable baryon asymmetry without subsequent entropy releases.
