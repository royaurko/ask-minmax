Based on a new explicit representation of the solution to the Poisson
equation with respect to single birth processes, the unified treatment for
various criteria on classical problems (including uniqueness, recurrence,
ergodicity, exponential ergodicity, strong ergodicity, as well as extinction
probability etc.) for the processes are presented.
