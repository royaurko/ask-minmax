We analyse Wallace's adaptation of Decision Theory to formally prove the Born
Rule in Everettian Quantum Mechanics. His proof was reorganized with some
improvements, and many details were filled in. In the process, we detected some
inconsistencies in his concepts and axioms, as well as other problems, which,
if not fixed, would invalidate the proof.
