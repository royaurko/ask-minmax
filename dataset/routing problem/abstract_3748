In this paper we propose a new method to stabilise non-symmetric indefinite
problems. The idea is to solve a forward and an adjoint problem simultaneously
using a suitable stabilised finite element method. Both stabilisation of the
element residual and jumps of certain derivatives of the discrete solution over
element faces may be used. Under the assumption of well posedness of the
partial differential equation and its associated adjoint problem we prove
optimal error estimates in $H^1$ and $L^2$ norms in an abstract framework. Some
examples of problems that are neither symmetric nor coercive, but that enter
the abstract framework are given. First we treat indefinite
convection-diffusion equations, with non-solenoidal transport velocity and
either pure Dirichlet conditions or pure Neumann conditions and then a Cauchy
problem for the Helmholtz operator. Some numerical illustrations are given.
