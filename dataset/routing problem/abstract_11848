We put forward a conjecture about an universal asymptotical behaviour of the
symbol of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator (considered as a pseudodifferential
operator) in the 2D exterior problem for the Hemholtz equation. The conjecture
is motivated by simple explicit examples and backed by numerical calculations,
even in the case of a non-convex obstacle. It implies (at a physical level of
rigor) Kirhhoff's approximation.
