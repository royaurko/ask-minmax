We present a simulation of a dripping faucet system. A new algorithm based on
Lagrangian description is introduced. The shape of drop falling from a faucet
obtained by the present algorithm agrees quite well with experimental
observations. Long-term behavior of the simulation can reproduce period-one,
period-two, intermittent and chaotic oscillations widely observed in
experiments. Possible routes to chaos are discussed.
