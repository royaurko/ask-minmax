We show that the approaches to global regularity of the d-bar Neumann problem
via the methods listed in the title are equivalent when the conditions involved
are suitably modified. These modified conditions are also equivalent to one
that is relevant in the context of Stein neighborhood bases and Mergelyan type
approximation.
