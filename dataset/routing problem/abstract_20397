We show the presence of an electromagnetic field can cause a gravitational
Meissner effect and, as a result, a gravitational shielding. With this aim in
view we must first unveil the following problems : generalized Maxwell
equations, generalized London equations, generalized Meissner effect,
generalized shielding, etc.
