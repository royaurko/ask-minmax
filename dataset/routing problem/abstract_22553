A systolic algorithm rhythmically computes and passes data through a network
of processors. We investigate the performance of systolic algorithms for
implementing the gravitational N-body problem on distributed-memory computers.
Systolic algorithms minimize memory requirements by distributing the particles
between processors. We show that the performance of systolic routines can be
greatly enhanced by the use of non-blocking communication, which allows
particle coordinates to be communicated at the same time that force
calculations are being carried out. Hyper-systolic algorithms reduce the
communication complexity at the expense of increased memory demands. As an
example of an application requiring large N, we use the systolic algorithm to
carry out direct-summation simulations using 10^6 particles of the Brownian
motion of the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. We
predict a 3D random velocity of 0.4 km/s for the black hole.
