In the recent years, many solutions for Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V)
communication were proposed to overcome failure problems (also known as dead
ends). This paper proposes a novel framework for V2V failure recovery using
Device-to-Device (D2D) communications. Based on the unified Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS) architecture, LTE-based D2D mechanisms can improve
V2V dead ends failure recovery delays. This new paradigm of hybrid V2V-D2D
communications overcomes the limitations of traditional V2V routing techniques.
According to NS2 simulation results, the proposed hybrid model decreases the
end to end delay (E2E) of messages delivery. A complete comparison of different
D2D use cases (best & worst scenarios) is presented to show the enhancements
brought by our solution compared to traditional V2V techniques.
