This paper studies secure layered video transmission in a multiuser
multiple-input single-output (MISO) beamforming downlink communication system.
The power allocation algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex
optimization problem for minimizing the total transmit power while guaranteeing
a minimum received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the
desired receiver. In particular, the proposed problem formulation takes into
account the self-protecting architecture of layered transmission and artificial
noise generation to prevent potential information eavesdropping. A
semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation based power allocation algorithm is
proposed to obtain an upper bound solution. A sufficient condition for the
global optimal solution is examined to reveal the tightness of the upper bound
solution. Subsequently, two suboptimal power allocation schemes with low
computational complexity are proposed for enabling secure layered video
transmission. Simulation results demonstrate significant transmit power savings
achieved by the proposed algorithms and layered transmission compared to the
baseline schemes.
