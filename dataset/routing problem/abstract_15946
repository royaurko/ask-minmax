In this article we considered the integrable problems of three vortices on a
plane and sphere for noncompact case. We investigated explicitly the problems
of a collapse and a scattering of vortices and obtained the conditions of its
realization. We completed the bifurcation analysis and investigated for
collinear and Thomson's configurations the dependence of stability in linear
approximation and frequency of rotation in relative coordinates from value of a
full moment. We indicated the geometric interpretation for characteristic
situations. We constructed a phase portrait and geometric projection for the
integrable configuration of four vortices on a plane.
