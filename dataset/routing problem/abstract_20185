Nash proved that every irreducible component of the space of arcs through a
singularity corresponds to an exceptional divisor that occurs on every
resolution. He asked if the converse also holds: does every such exceptional
divisor correspond to an arc family? We prove that the converse holds for toric
singularities but fails in general.
