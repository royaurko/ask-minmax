We study generalized Killing spinors on compact Einstein manifolds with
positive scalar curvature. This problem is related to the existence compact
Einstein hypersurfaces in manifolds with parallel spinors, or equivalently, in
Riemannian products of flat spaces, Calabi-Yau, hyperkaehler, G_2 and Spin(7)
manifolds.
