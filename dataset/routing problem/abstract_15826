The spectral analysis of discretized one-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger
operators is a very difficult problem which has been studied by numerous
mathematicians. A natural problem at the interface of numerical analysis and
operator theory is that of finding finite dimensional matrices whose
eigenvalues approximate the spectrum of an infinite dimensional operator. In
this note we observe that the seminal work of Pimsner-Voiculescu on AF
embeddings of irrational rotation algebras provides a nice answer to the finite
dimensional spectral approximation problem for a broad class of operators
including the quasiperiodic case of the Schr\"{o}dinger operators mentioned
above. Indeed, the theory of continued fractions not only provides good matrix
models for spectral computations (i.e. the Pimsner-Voiculescu construction) but
also yields {\em sharp} rates of convergence for spectral approximations of
operators in irrational rotation algebras.
