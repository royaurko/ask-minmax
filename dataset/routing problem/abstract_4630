Numerical integration of ODEs by standard numerical methods reduces a
continuous time problems to discrete time problems. Discrete time problems have
intrinsic properties that are absent in continuous time problems. As a result,
numerical solution of an ODE may demonstrate dynamical phenomena that are
absent in the original ODE. We show that numerical integration of system with
one fast rotating phase lead to a situation of such kind: numerical solution
demonstrate phenomenon of scattering on resonances that is absent in the
original system.
