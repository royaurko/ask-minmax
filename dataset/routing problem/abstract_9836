In the {\em Movement Repairmen (MR)} problem we are given a metric space $(V,
d)$ along with a set $R$ of $k$ repairmen $r_1, r_2, ..., r_k$ with their start
depots $s_1, s_2, ..., s_k \in V$ and speeds $v_1, v_2, ..., v_k \geq 0$
respectively and a set $C$ of $m$ clients $c_1, c_2, ..., c_m$ having start
locations $s'_1, s'_2, ..., s'_m \in V$ and speeds $v'_1, v'_2, ..., v'_m \geq
0$ respectively. If $t$ is the earliest time a client $c_j$ is collocated with
any repairman (say, $r_i$) at a node $u$, we say that the client is served by
$r_i$ at $u$ and that its latency is $t$. The objective in the (\smr{}) problem
is to plan the movements for all repairmen and clients to minimize the sum
(average) of the clients latencies. The motivation for this problem comes, for
example, from Amazon Locker Delivery \cite{amazon} and USPS gopost
\cite{gopost}. We give the first $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm for the
\smr{} problem.
