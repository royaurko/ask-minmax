We obtain a nonsmooth extension of Noether's symmetry theorem for variational
problems with delayed arguments. The result is proved to be valid in the class
of Lipschitz functions, as long as the delayed Euler-Lagrange extremals are
restricted to those that satisfy the DuBois-Reymond necessary optimality
condition. The important case of delayed variational problems with higher-order
derivatives is considered as well.
