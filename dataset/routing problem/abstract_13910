By using Moreau's decomposition theorem for projecting onto cones, the
problem of projecting onto a simplicial cone is reduced to finding the unique
solution of a nonsmooth system of equations. It is shown that a semi-smooth
Newton method applied to the system of equations associated to the problem of
projecting onto a simplicial cone is always well defined, and the generated
sequence is bounded for any starting point and under a somewhat restrictive
assumption it is finite. Besides, under a mild assumption on the simplicial
cone, the generated sequence converges linearly to the solution of the
associated system of equations.
