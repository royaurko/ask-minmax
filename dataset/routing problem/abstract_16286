Clarksons algorithm is a two-staged randomized algorithm for solving linear
programs. This algorithm has been simplified and adapted to fit the framework
of LP-type problems. In this framework we can tackle a number of non-linear
problems such as computing the smallest enclosing ball of a set of points in
R^d . In 2006, it has been shown that the algorithm in its original form works
for violator spaces too, which are a proper general- ization of LP-type
problems. It was not clear, however, whether previous simplifications of the
algorithm carry over to the new setting. In this paper we show the following
theoretical results: (a) It is shown, for the first time, that Clarksons second
stage can be simplified. (b) The previous simplifications of Clarksons first
stage carry over to the violator space setting. (c) Furthermore, we show the
equivalence of violator spaces and partitions of the hypercube by hypercubes.
