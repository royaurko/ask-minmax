This paper gives a note on an application of the enclosure method to an
inverse obstacle scattering problem governed by the Helmholtz equation in two
dimensions. It is shown that one can uniquely determine the convex hull of an
unknown sound-hard polygonal obstacle from the trace of the total wave that was
exerted by a single point source onto a known circle surrounding the obstacle
provided the source is sufficiently far from the obstacle. The result contains
a formula that extracts the value of the support function of the obstacle at a
generic direction. Some other applications to thin obstacles, obstacles in a
layered medium and the far-field equation in the linear sampling method are
also included.
