The elastic collision between two ortho-positronium (e.g. S=1) atoms is
studied using an ab-initio static-exchange model (SEM) in the center of mass
(CM) frame considering the system as a four-body Coulomb problem where all the
Coulomb interaction terms in the direct and exchange channels are treated
exactly. A coupled-channel methodology in momentum space is used to solve
Lippman-Schwinger equation following the integral approach. A new SEM code is
developed in which the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) scattering amplitude acts as input
to derive the SEM amplitude adapting the partial wave analysis. The s-, p- and
d- wave elastic phase shifts and the corresponding partial cross sections for
the spin alignment S=0, i.e. singlet (+) and S=2, i.e. triplet (-) states are
studied. An augmented-Born approximation is used to include the contribution of
higher partial waves more accurately to determine the total/integrated elastic
cross section ( ), the quenching cross section ( ) and ortho to para conversion
ratio ( ). The effective range theory is used to determine the scattering
lengths and effective ranges in the s-wave elastic scattering. The theory
includes the non-adiabatic short-range effects due to exchange.
