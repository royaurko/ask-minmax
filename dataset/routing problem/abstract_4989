Different theoretical approaches to the famous two state Landau - Zener
problem are briefly discussed. Apart from traditional methods of the adiabatic
perturbation theory, Born - Oppenheimer approximation with geometric phase
effects, two-level approach, and momentum space representation, the problem is
treated semiclassically also in the coordinate space. Within the framework of
the instanton approach we present a full and unified description of 1D
Landau-Zener problem of level crossing. The method enables us to treat
accurately all four transition points (appearing at two levels crossing), while
the standard WKB approach takes into account only two of them. The latter
approximation is adequate for calculating of the transition probability or for
studying of scattering processes, however it does not work for finding
corresponding chemical reactions rates, where very often for typical range of
parameters all four transition points can be relevant. Applications of the
method and of the results may concern the various systems in physics, chemistry
and biology.
