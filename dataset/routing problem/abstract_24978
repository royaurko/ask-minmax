A static and axisymmetric solution of the Einstein vacuum equations with a
finite number of Relativistic Multipole Moments (RMM) is written in MSA
coordinates up to certain order of approximation, and the structure of its
metric components is explicitly shown. From the equation of equatorial
geodesics we obtain the Binet equation for the orbits and it allows us to
determine the gravitational potential that leads to the equivalent classical
orbital equations of the perturbed Kepler problem. The relativistic corrections
to Keplerian motion are provided by the different contributions of the RMM of
the source starting from the Monopole (Schwarzschild correction). In
particular, the perihelion precession of the orbit is calculated in terms of
the quadrupole and 2$^4$-pole moments. Since the MSA coordinates generalize the
Schwarzschild coordinates, the result obtained allows measurement of the
relevance of the quadrupole moment in the first order correction to the
perihelion frequency-shift.
