This talk presents a list of problems related to the double-elliptic (Dell)
integrable systems with elliptic dependence on both momenta and coordinates. As
expected, in the framework of Seiberg-Witten theory the recently discovered
explicit self-dual family of 2-particle Dell Hamiltonians provides a
perturbative period matrix which is a logarithm of the ratio of the
(momentum-space) theta-functions.
