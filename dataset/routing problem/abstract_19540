We present a five-dimensional gravitational theory in a space-time-velocity
Riemannian manifold. The equations of motion of a star moving around a galaxy
are shown to be the Tully-Fisher law. The problem of the cosmological constant
is discussed, and a new formula for the cosmological redshift is derived.
