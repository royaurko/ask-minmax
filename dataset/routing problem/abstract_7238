We prove existence and multiplicity results for a $N$-Laplacian problem with
a critical exponential nonlinearity that is a natural analog of the
Brezis-Nirenberg problem for the borderline case of the Sobolev inequality.
This extends results in the literature for the semilinear case $N = 2$ to all
$N \ge 2$. When $N > 2$ the nonlinear operator $- \Delta_N$ has no linear
eigenspaces and hence this extension requires new abstract critical point
theorems that are not based on linear subspaces. We prove new abstract results
based on the ${\mathbb Z}_2$-cohomological index and a related pseudo-index
that are applicable here.
