This paper considers the problem of selecting a subset of nodes in a two-hop
wireless network to act as relays in aiding the communication between the
source-destination pair. Optimal relay subset selection with the objective of
maximizing the overall throughput is a difficult problem that depends on
multiple factors including node locations, queue lengths and power consumption.
A partial decode-and-forward strategy is applied in this paper to improve the
tractability of the relay selection problem and performance of the overall
network.
  Note that the number of relays selected ultimately determines the performance
of the network. This paper benchmarks this performance by determining the net
diversity achieved using the relays selected and the partial decode-and-forward
strategy. This framework is subsequently used to further transform relay
selection into a simpler relay placement problem, and two proximity-based
approximation algorithms are developed to determine the appropriate set of
relays to be selected in the network. Other selection strategies such as random
relay selection and a greedy algorithm that relies on channel state information
are also presented. This paper concludes by showing that the proposed
proximity-based relay selection strategies yield near-optimal expected rates
for a small number of selected relays.
