Cavity loss factors can be easily computed for ultrarelativistic beams using
time-domain codes like MAFIA or ABCI. However, for non-ultrarelativistic beams
the problem is more complicated because of difficulties with its numerical
formulation in the time domain. We calculate the loss factors of a
non-ultrarelativistic bunch and compare results with the relativistic case.
