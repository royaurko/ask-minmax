Recently, very interesting results have been obtained concerning the Fourier
spectra of power permutations over a finite field. In this note we survey the
recent ideas of Aubry, Feng, Katz, and Langevin, and we pose new open problems
related to old conjectures proposed by Helleseth in the middle of the
seventies.
