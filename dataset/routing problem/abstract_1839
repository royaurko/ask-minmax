This paper reports on a new and swift hydrothermal chemical route to prepare
titanate nanostructures (TNS) avoiding the use of crystalline TiO2 as starting
material. The synthesis approach uses a commercial solution of TiCl3 as
titanium source to prepare an amorphous precursor, circumventing the use of
hazardous chemical compounds. The influence of the reaction temperature and
dwell autoclave time on the structure and morphology of the synthesised
materials was studied. Homogeneous titanate nanotubes with a high
length/diameter aspect ratio were synthesised at 160^{\circ}C and 24 h. A band
gap of 3.06\pm0.03 eV was determined for the TNS samples prepared in these
experimental conditions. This value is red shifted by 0.14 eV compared to the
band gap value usually reported for the TiO2 anatase. Moreover, such samples
show better adsorption capacity and photocatalytic performance on the dye
rhodamine 6G (R6G) photodegradation process than TiO2 nanoparticles. A 98%
reduction of the R6G concentration was achieved after 45 minutes of irradiation
of a 10 ppm dye aqueous solution and 1 g/L of TNS catalyst.
