Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $p>0$, which has infinitely many
discrete valuations. We show that every finite embedding problem for $\Gal(k)$
with finitely many prescribed local conditions, whose kernel is a $p$-group, is
properly solvable. We then apply this result in studying the admissibility of
finite groups over global fields of positive characteristic. We also give
another proof for a result of Sonn.
