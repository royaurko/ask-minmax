In this paper, we study a fast approximate inference method based on
expectation propagation for exploring the posterior probability distribution
arising from the Bayesian formulation of nonlinear inverse problems. It is
capable of efficiently delivering reliable estimates of the posterior mean and
covariance, thereby providing an inverse solution together with quantified
uncertainties. Some theoretical properties of the iterative algorithm are
discussed, and the efficient implementation for an important class of problems
of projection type is described. The method is illustrated with one typical
nonlinear inverse problem, electrical impedance tomography with complete
electrode model, under sparsity constraints. Numerical results for real
experimental data are presented, and compared with that by Markov chain Monte
Carlo. The results indicate that the method is accurate and computationally
very efficient.
