We describe a new method for finding analytic solutions to some
initial-boundary problems for partial differential equations with constant
coefficients. The method is based on expanding the denominator of the Laplace
transformed Green's function of the problem into a convergent geometric series.
If the denominator is a linear combination of exponents with real powers one
obtains a closed form solution as a sum with finite but time dependent number
of terms. We call it a d'Alembert sum. This representation is computationally
most effective for small evolution times, but it remains valid even when the
system of eigenmodes is incomplete and the eigenmode expansion is unavailable.
Moreover, it simplifies in such cases.
  In vibratory problems d'Alembert sums represent superpositions of original
and partially reflected traveling waves. They generalize the d'Alembert type
formulas for the wave equation, and reduce to them when original waves can
undergo only finitely many reflections in the entire course of evolution. The
method is applied to vibrations of a bar with dampers at each end and at some
internal point. The results are illustrated by computer simulations and
comparisons to modal and FEM solutions.
