To be paired with a lightweight digital signing scheme of which the modulus
length is between 80 and 160 bits, a new non-Merkle-Damgard structure (non-MDS)
hash function is proposed by the contributors based on a multivariate permutation
problem (MPP) and an anomalous subset product problem (ASPP) to which no
subexponential time solutions are found so far. It includes an initialization
algorithm and a compression algorithm, and converts a short message of n bits
treated as only a block into a digest of m bits, where 80 <= m <= 232 and 80 <=
m <= n <= 4096. Analysis shows that the new hash is one-way, weakly
collision-free, and strongly collision-free along with a proof, and its
security against existent attacks such as birthday attack and
meet-in-the-middle attack gets the O(2^m) magnitude. Running time of its
compression algorithm is analyzed to be O(n*m^2) bit operations. A comparison
with the Chaum-Heijst-Pfitzmann hash based on a discrete logarithm problem is
made. Especially, the new hash with short input and small computation may be
used to reform a classical hash with an m-bit output and an O(2^(m/2))
magnitude security into a compact hash with an m/2-bit output and the same
security. Thus, it opens a door to convenience for utilization of lightweight
digital signing schemes.
