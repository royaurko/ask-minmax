We study the semi-classical trace formula at a critical energy level for an
$h$-pseudo-differential operator on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ whose principal symbol has
a totally degenerate critical point for that energy. This problem is studied
for a large time behavior and under the hypothesis that the principal symbol of
the operator has a local extremum at the critical point.
