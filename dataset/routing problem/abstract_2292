Recently, several femtosecond laser techniques have been developed that are
capable of bringing gas molecules to extremely fast rotation in a very short
time, while keeping their translational motion intact and relatively slow. We
investigate collisional equilibration dynamics of this new state of molecular
gases, and find that it follows a remarkable generic scenario. The route to
equilibrium starts with a durable metastable 'gyroscopic stage', in the course
of which the molecules maintain their fast rotation and orientation of the
angular momentum through many collisions. The inhibited
rotational-translational relaxation is characterized by a persistent anisotropy
in the molecular angular distribution, and is manifested in the long-lasting
optical birefringence, and anisotropic diffusion in the gas. After a certain
induction time, the 'gyroscopic stage' is abruptly terminated by a
self-accelerating explosive rotational-translational energy exchange leading
the gas towards the final thermal equilibrium. We illustrate our conclusions by
direct Molecular Dynamics simulation of super-rotors in several gases
consisting of common linear molecules (such as N_2, O_2 and CO_2).
