We consider the optimization of active extension portfolios. For this
purpose, the optimization problem is rewritten as a stochastic programming
model and solved using a clever multi-start local search heuristic, which turns
out to provide stable solutions. The heuristic solutions are compared to
optimization results of convex optimization solvers where applicable.
Furthermore, the approach is applied to solve problems with non-convex risk
measures, most notably to minimize Value-at-Risk. Numerical results using data
from both the Dow Jones Industrial Average as well as the DAX 30 are shown.
