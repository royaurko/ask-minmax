The Wiener Sausage, the volume traced out by a sphere attached to a Brownian
particle, is a classical problem in statistics and mathematical physics.
Initially motivated by a range of field-theoretic, technical questions, we
present a renormalised perturbation theory of the Wiener Sausage, which proves
to be exact for the exponents and some amplitudes. The field theoretic approach
is particularly elegant and very enjoyable to see at work on such a classic
problem. While we recover a number of known, classical results, the field
theoretic techniques deployed provide a particularly versatile framework, which
allows easy calculation with different boundary conditions even of higher
momenta and more complicated correlation functions. At the same time, we
provide a highly instructive, non-trivial example for some of the technical
particularities of the field theoretic description of stochastic processes,
such as excluded volume, lack of translational invariance and immobile
particles.
