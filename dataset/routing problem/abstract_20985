We generalise the techniques of arXiv:0908.1963 to describe derived
deformations in simplicial categories. This allows us to consider deformation
problems with higher automorphisms, such as chain complexes (which have
homotopies) and stacks (which have 2-automorphisms). We also give a general
approach for studying deformations of diagrams.
