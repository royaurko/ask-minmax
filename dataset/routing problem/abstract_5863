We show NP-hardness of the minimum latency scheduling (MLS) problem under the
physical model of wireless networking. In this model a transmission is received
successfully if the Signal to Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), is above a
given threshold. In the minimum latency scheduling problem, the goal is to
assign a time slot and power level to each transmission, so that all the
messages are received successfully, and the number of distinct times slots is
minimized.
  Despite its seeming simplicity and several previous hardness results for
various settings of the minimum latency scheduling problem, it has remained an
open question whether or not the minimum latency scheduling problem is NP-hard,
when the nodes are placed in the Euclidean plane and arbitrary power levels can
be chosen for the transmissions. We resolve this open question for all path
loss exponent values $\alpha \geq 3$.
