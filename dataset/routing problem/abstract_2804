Interfacial interactions allow the electronic properties of graphene to be
modified, as recently demonstrated by the appearance of satellite Dirac cones
in the band structure of graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrates.
Ongoing research strives to explore interfacial interactions in a broader class
of materials in order to engineer targeted electronic properties. Here we show
that at an interface with a tungsten disulfide (WS2) substrate, the strength of
the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in graphene is very strongly enhanced. The
induced SOI leads to a pronounced low-temperature weak anti-localization (WAL)
effect, from which we determine the spin-relaxation time. We find that
spin-relaxation time in graphene is two-to-three orders of magnitude smaller on
WS2 than on SiO2 or hBN, and that it is comparable to the intervalley
scattering time. To interpret our findings we have performed first-principle
electronic structure calculations, which both confirm that carriers in
graphene-on-WS2 experience a strong SOI and allow us to extract a
spin-dependent low-energy effective Hamiltonian. Our analysis further shows
that the use of WS2 substrates opens a possible new route to access topological
states of matter in graphene-based systems.
