Cluster algorithms have been recently used to eliminate sign problems that
plague Monte-Carlo methods in a variety of systems. In particular such
algorithms can also be used to solve sign problems associated with the
permutation of fermion world lines. This solution leads to the possibility of
designing fermion cluster algorithms in certain cases. Using the example of
free non-relativistic fermions we discuss the ideas underlying the algorithm.
