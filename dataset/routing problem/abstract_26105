Let M be a smooth compact oriented manifold without boundary, imbedded in a
euclidean space E and let f be a smooth map of M into a Riemannian manifold N.
An unknown state x in M is observed via X=x+su where s>0 is a small parameter
and u is a white Gaussian noise. For a given smooth prior on M and smooth
estimators g of the map f we have derived a second-order asymptotic expansion
for the related Bayesian risk (see arXiv:0705.2540). In this paper, we apply
this technique to a variety of examples.
  The second part examines the first-order conditions for equality-constrained
regression problems. The geometric tools that are utilised in our earlier paper
are naturally applicable to these regression problems.
