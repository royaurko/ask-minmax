We present a microscopic calculation of the 6He beta-decay into the ground
state of 6Li. To this end we use the impulse approximation to describe the
nuclear weak current. The ground state wave functions are obtained from the
solution of the nuclear 6-body problem. The nucleonnucleon interaction is
described via the J-matrix inverse scattering potential (JISP), and the nuclear
problem is solved using the hyperspherical-harmonics approach. This approach
results in numerical accuracy of about 2 per mil in the transition matrix
element. Bearing in mind that the contribution of meson-exchange currents to
the transition matrix element is about 5%, these results pave the way for
accurate estimation of their effect.
