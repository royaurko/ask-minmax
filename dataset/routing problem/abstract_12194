Let G be a semisimple algebraic group over an algebraically-closed field of
characteristic zero. In this note we show that every regular face of the
Littlewood-Richardson cone of G gives rise to a reduction rule: a rule which,
given a problem "on that face" of computing the multiplicity of an irreducible
component in a tensor product, reduces it to a similar problem on a group of
smaller rank. In the type A case this result has already been proved by Derksen
and Weyman using quivers, and by King, Tollu, and Tomazet using puzzles. The
proof here is geometric and type-independent.
