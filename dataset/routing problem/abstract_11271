We report the "state of the art" of the problem of $B+L$ violation in
high-energy electroweak scatterings. Results of various analyses point toward
(though do not prove rigorously yet) the "half-suppression", i.e., that the
$B+L$ violating cross section remains suppressed at least by the negative
exponent of the single instanton action, at all energies. Most interesting
techniques developed in this field are reviewed. Particular attention is paid
to unitarity constraints on the anomalous cross section, and to some conceptual
problem involving the use of the optical theorem in the presence of instantons.
