In this paper, we study the transport capacity of large multi-hop wireless
CSMA networks. Different from previous studies which rely on the use of
centralized scheduling algorithm and/or centralized routing algorithm to
achieve the optimal capacity scaling law, we show that the optimal capacity
scaling law can be achieved using entirely distributed routing and scheduling
algorithms. Specifically, we consider a network with nodes Poissonly
distributed with unit intensity on a $\sqrt{n}\times\sqrt{n}$ square
$B_{n}\subset\Re^{2}$. Furthermore, each node chooses its destination randomly
and independently and transmits following a CSMA protocol. By resorting to the
percolation theory and by carefully tuning the three controllable parameters in
CSMA protocols, i.e. transmission power, carrier-sensing threshold and
count-down timer, we show that a throughput of
$\Theta\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$ is achievable in distributed CSMA
networks. Furthermore, we derive the pre-constant preceding the order of the
transport capacity by giving an upper and a lower bound of the transport
capacity. The tightness of the bounds is validated using simulations.
