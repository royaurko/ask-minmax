This work establishes the complexity class of several instances of the
S-packing coloring problem: for a graph G, a positive integer k and a non
decreasing list of integers S = (s\_1 , ..., s\_k ), G is S-colorable, if its
vertices can be partitioned into sets S\_i , i = 1,... , k, where each S\_i
being a s\_i -packing (a set of vertices at pairwise distance greater than
s\_i). For a list of three integers, a dichotomy between NP-complete problems
and polynomial time solvable problems is determined for subcubic graphs.
Moreover, for an unfixed size of list, the complexity of the S-packing coloring
problem is determined for several instances of the problem. These properties
are used in order to prove a dichotomy between NP-complete problems and
polynomial time solvable problems for lists of at most four integers.
