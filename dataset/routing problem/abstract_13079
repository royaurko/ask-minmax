We review some recent studies on the string model of confinement inspired by
the strong-coupling regime of QCD and its application to exotic multiquark
configurations. This includes two quarks and two antiquarks, four quarks and
one antiquark, six quarks, and three quarks and three antiquarks with a careful
treatment of the corresponding few-body problem.
