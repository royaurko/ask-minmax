The classical problem of thermal explosion is modified so that the chemically
active gas is not at rest but is flowing in a long cylindrical pipe. Up to a
certain section the heat-conducting walls of the pipe are held at low
temperature so that the reaction rate is small and there is no heat release; at
that section the ambient temperature is increased and an exothermic reaction
begins. The question is whether a slow reaction regime will be established or a
thermal explosion will occur. The mathematical formulation of the problem is
presented. It is shown that when the pipe radius is larger than a critical
value, the solution of the new problem exists only up to a certain distance
along the axis. The critical radius is determined by conditions in a problem
with a uniform axial temperature. The loss of existence is interpreted as a
thermal explosion; the critical distance is the safe reactor's length. Both
laminar and developed turbulent flow regimes are considered. In a computational
experiment the loss of the existence appears as a divergence of a numerical
procedure; numerical calculations reveal asymptotic scaling laws with simple
powers for the critical distance.
