In this article, we propose a design method of selfinterference cancelers for
wireless relay stations taking account of the baseband signal subspace. The
problem is first formulated as a sampled-data $H^{\infty}$ control problem with
a generalized sampler and a generalized hold, which can be reduced to a
discretetime $\ell^2$-induced norm minimization problem. Taking account of the
implementation of the generalized sampler and hold, we adopt the filter-sampler
structure for the generalized sampler, and the uspampler-filter-hold structure
for the generalized hold. Under these implementation constraints, we
reformulate the problem as a standard discrete-time $H^{\infty}$ control
problem by using the discrete-time lifting technique. A simulation result is
shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
