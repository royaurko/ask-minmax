The inverse source problem for the radiative transfer equation is considered,
with partial data. Here it is shown that under certain smoothness conditions on
the scattering and absorption coefficients, one can recover sources supported
in a certain subset of the domain, which we call the visible set. Furthermore,
it is shown for an open dense set of $C^{\infty}$ absorption and scattering
coefficients that one can recover the part of the wave front set of the source
that is supported in the microlocally visible set, modulo a function in the
Sobolev space $H^{k}$ for $k$ arbitrarily large. This is an extension to the
full data case, which is considered in \cite{inversesource}.
