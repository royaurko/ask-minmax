We have analyzed the experimental data on K+Lambda photoproduction by using a
multipole approach. In this analysis we use the background amplitudes
constructed from appropriate Feynman diagrams in a gauge-invariant and
crossing-symmetric fashion. Results of our analysis reveal the problem of
mutual consistency between the new SAPHIR and CLAS data. We found that the
problem could lead to different conclusions on ``missing resonances''. We have
also extended our analysis to the finite Q^2 region and compared the result
with the corresponding electroproduction data.
