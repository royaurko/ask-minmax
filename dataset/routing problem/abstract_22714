A procedure is described for efficiently finding the ground state energy and
configuration for a Frenkel-Kontorova model in a periodic potential, consisting
of N parabolic segments of identical curvature in each period, through a
numerical solution of the convex minimization problem described in the
preceding paper. The key elements are the use of subdifferentials to describe
the structure of the minimization problem; an intuitive picture of how to solve
it, based on motion of quasiparticles; and a fast linear optimization method
with a reduced memory requirement. The procedure has been tested for N up to
200.
