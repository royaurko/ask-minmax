Software for the resolution of certain kind of problems, those that rate high
in the Stringent Performance Objectives adjustment factor (IFPUG scheme), can
be described using a combination of game theory and autonomous systems. From
this description it can be shown that some of those problems exhibit chaotic
behavior, an important fact in understanding the functioning of the related
software. As a relatively simple example, it is shown that chess exhibits
chaotic behavior in its configuration space. This implies that static
evaluators in chess programs have intrinsic limitations.
