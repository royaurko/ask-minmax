This paper considers the initial-boundary value problem for the heat equation
with a dynamic type boundary condition. Under some regularity, consistency and
orthogonality conditions, the existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence
upon the data of the classical solution are shown by using the generalized
Fourier method. This paper also investigates the inverse problem of finding a
time-dependent coefficient of the heat equation from the data of integral
overdetermination condition.
