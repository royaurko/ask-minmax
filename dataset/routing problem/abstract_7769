This lecture, directed to an broad audience including non-specialists,
presents a short review of the problem of strong CP symmetry maintenance. The
problem is defined and the possible solutions briefly reviewed. I discuss the
way in which Roberto Peccei and I came up with one solution, generally known as
Peccei-Quinn symmetry.
