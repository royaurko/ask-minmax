The block operator matrix theory is used to investigate the problem of a
single qubit. We will establish a connection between the Riccati operator
equation and the possibility of obtaining an exact reduced dynamics for the
qubit in question. The model of the half spin particle in the rotating magnetic
field coupling with the external environment is discussed. We show that the
model defined in such a way can be reduced to a time independent problem.
