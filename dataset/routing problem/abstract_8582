In this paper we present a first supercloseness analysis for higher-order
Galerkin FEM applied to a singularly perturbed convection-diffusion problem.
Using a solution decomposition and a special representation of our finite
element space we are able to prove a supercloseness property of order p+1/4 in
the energy norm where the polynomial order p>=3 is odd.
