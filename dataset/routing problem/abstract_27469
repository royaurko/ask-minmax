We revisit the theory of deformations of pairs $(X, E)$, where $X$ is a
compact complex manifold and $E$ is a holomorphic vector bundle over $X$, from
an analytic viewpoint \`{a} la Kodaira-Spencer. By introducing and exploiting
an auxiliary differential operator, we derive the Maurer-Cartan equation and
DGLA governing the deformation problem, and express them in terms of
differential-geometric notions such as the connection and curvature of $E$,
obtaining a Chern-Weil--type refinement of the classical results that the
tangent space and obstruction space of the moduli problem are respectively
given by the first and second cohomology groups of the Atiyah extension of $E$
over $X$. We also investigate circumstances where deformations of pairs are
unobstructed using our analytic approach.
