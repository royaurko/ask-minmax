We study a class of supersymmetric models with non-universal gaugino masses
that could arise from F-terms in a general combination of the singlet and
adjoint representations of SU(5). We explore models that satisfy present Large
Hadron Collider and other bounds, showing how the allowed parameter space is
divided into distinct "continents". Regions of parameter space that ameliorate
the supersymmetric little hierarchy problem with a small mu parameter include
the usual focus point scenario, but also natural areas with much lighter
squarks and sleptons. These models are continuously connected in parameter
space to regions in which stau co-annihilation or Higgs exchange is mostly
responsible for dark matter annihilation, and to models in which the thermal
relic abundance is achieved by slepton-mediated annihilation, reviving the bulk
region that is severely restricted in mSUGRA models. In hybrid or confluence
regions, several mechanisms combine to give the requisite dark matter
annihilation rate. In each case we study the prospects for direct detection of
dark matter. We also comment briefly on the impact of recent hints for M_h near
125 GeV from the LHC.
