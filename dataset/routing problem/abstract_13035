The problem of implementing a class of functions with particular conditions
by using monotonic multilayer functions is considered. A genetic algorithm is
used to create monotonic functions of a certain class, and these are
implemented with two-layer monotonic functions. The existence of a solution to
the given problem suggests that from two monotone functions, a monotonic
function with the same dimensions can be created. A new algorithm based on the
genetic algorithm is proposed, which easily implemented two-layer monotonic
functions of a specific class for up to six variables.
