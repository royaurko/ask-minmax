The quest for the nuclear equation of state (EoS) at high densities and/or
extreme isospin is one of the longstanding problems of nuclear physics. Ab
initio calculations for the nuclear many-body problem make predictions for the
density and isospin dependence of the EoS far away from the saturation point of
nuclear matter. On the other hand, in recent years substantial progress has
been mode to constrain the EoS both, from the astrophysical side and from
accelerator based experiments. Heavy ion experiments support a soft EoS at
moderate densities while recent neutron star observations require a ``stiff''
high density behavior. Both constraints are discussed and shown to be in
agreement with the predictions from many-body theory.
