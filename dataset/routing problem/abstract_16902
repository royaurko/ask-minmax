The problem of splitting a homotopy equivalence along a submanifold is
closely related to the surgery exact sequence and to the problem of surgery of
manifold pairs. In classical surgery theory there exist two approaches to
surgery in the category of manifolds with boundaries. In the $ rel \partial$
case the surgery on a manifold pair is considered with the given fixed manifold
structure on the boundary. In the relative case the surgery on the manifold
with boundary is considered without fixing maps on the boundary. Consider a
normal map to a manifold pair $(Y, \partial Y)\subset (X, \partial X)$ with
boundary which is a simple homotopy equivalence on the boundary $\partial X$.
This map defines a mixed structure on the manifold with the boundary in the
sense of Wall. We introduce and study groups of obstructions to splitting of
such mixed structures along submanifold with boundary $(Y, \partial Y)$. We
describe relations of these groups to classical surgery and splitting
obstruction groups. We also consider several geometric examples.
