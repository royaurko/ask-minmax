Ordinary Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy is inadequate to be used in systems
depending on a control parameter that yield different mean energy values. Such
systems fail to give the correct comparison between the off-equilibrium and
equilibrium entropy values. Klimontovich's S theorem solves this problem by
renormalizing energy and making use of escort distributions. Since nonextensive
thermostatistics is a generalization of Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy, it too
exhibits this same deficiency. In order to remedy this, we present the
nonextensive generalization of Klimontovich's S theorem. We show that this
generalization requires the use of ordinary probability and the associated
relative entropy in addition to the renormalization of energy. Lastly, we
illustrate the generalized S theorem for the Van der Pol oscillator.
