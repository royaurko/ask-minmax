We revisit the optimal investment and consumption problem with proportional
transaction costs. We prove that both the value function and the slopes of the
lines demarcating the no-trading region are analytic functions of cube root of
the transaction cost parameter. Also, we can explicitly calculate the
coefficients of the fractional power series expansions of the value function
and the no-trading region.
