In this paper, we derive non-asymptotic achievability and converse bounds on
the random number generation with/without side-information. Our bounds are
efficiently computable in the sense that the computational complexity does not
depend on the block length. We also characterize the asymptotic behaviors of
the large deviation regime and the moderate deviation regime by using our
bounds, which implies that our bounds are asymptotically tight in those
regimes. We also show the second order rates of those problems, and derive
single letter forms of the variances characterizing the second order rates.
Further, we address the equivocation rates for these problems.
