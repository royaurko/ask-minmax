We develop several aspects of the infinite-dimensional Weak KAM theory using
a random variables' approach. We prove that the infinite-dimensional cell
problem admits a viscosity solution that is a fixed point of the Lax-Oleinik
semigroup. Furthermore, we show the existence of invariant minimizing measures
and calibrated curves defined on R.
