We consider a linear finite spring mass system which is perturbed by
modifying one mass and adding one spring. From knowledge of the natural
frequencies of the original and the perturbed systems we study when masses and
springs can be reconstructed. This is a problem about rank two or rank three
type perturbations of finite Jacobi matrices where we are able to describe
quite explicitly the associated Green's functions. We give necessary and
sufficient conditions for two given sets of points to be eigenvalues of the
original and modified system respectively.
