We report appearance of superconductivity in CeO0.5F0.5BiS2. The bulk
polycrystalline samples CeOBiS2 and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 are synthesized by
conventional solid state reaction route via vacuum encapsulation technique.
Detailed structural analysis showed that the studied CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound is
crystallized in tetragonal P4/nmm space group with lattice parameters a =
4.016(3) A, c = 13.604(2) A. DC magnetization measurement (MT-curve) shows the
ferromagnetic signal at the low temperature region. The superconductivity is
established in CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 at Tconset = 2.5K by electrical transport
measurement. Under applied magnetic field both Tc onset and Tc ({\rho} =0)
decrease to lower temperatures and an upper critical field [Hc2(0)] above
1.2Tesla is estimated. The results suggest coexistence of ferromagnetism and
superconductivity for the CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample.
