We prove that Hilbert's Tenth Problem for a ring of integers in a number
field K has a negative answer if K satisfies two arithmetical conditions
(existence of a so-called division-ample set of integers and of an elliptic
curve of rank one over K). We relate division-ample sets to arithmetic of
abelian varieties.
