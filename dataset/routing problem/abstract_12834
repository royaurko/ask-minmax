Linear singularly perturbed convection-diffusion problems with characteristic
layers are considered in three dimensions. We demonstrate the sharpness of our
recently obtained upper bounds for the associated Green's function and its
derivatives in the $L_1$ norm. For this, in this paper we establish the
corresponding lower bounds. Both upper and lower bounds explicitly show any
dependence on the singular perturbation parameter.
