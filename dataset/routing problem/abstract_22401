We consider the change-point problem for the marginal distribution of
subordinated Gaussian processes that exhibit long-range dependence. The
asymptotic distributions of Kolmogorov-Smirnov- and Cram\'er-von Mises type
statistics are investigated. A special feature of distributional changes is the
fact that the Hermite rank may change, too. We consider local alternatives
covering this scenario, and as a result, we may derive the asymptotic power of
the change point tests.
