The problem of faces detection in images or video streams is a classical
problem of computer vision. The multiple solutions of this problem have been
proposed, but the question of their optimality is still open. Many algorithms
achieve a high quality classification, but at the cost of high computational
complexity. This restricts their application in the real-time systems. This
paper presents a new solution of the frontal face detection problem based on
compact convolutional neural networks cascade. The test results on FDDB and AFW
test-sets show that it is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms. This
proposed detector is implemented using three technologies: SSE/AVX/AVX2
instruction sets for Intel CPUs, Nvidia CUDA, OpenCL. The detection performance
of our approach considerably exceeds all the existing CPU-based and GPU-based
algorithms. Because of high computational efficiency, our detector can
processing 4K Ultra HD video stream in real time (up to 28 fps) on mobile
platforms (Intel Ivy Bridge CPUs and Nvidia Kepler GPUs) in searching objects
with the dimension 60x60 pixels or higher. At the same time its performance
weakly dependent on the background and number of objects in scene. This is
achieved by the asynchronous computation of stages in the cascade.
