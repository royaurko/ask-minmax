We consider the decoding problem or the problem of finding low weight
codewords for rank metric codes. We show how additional information about the
codeword we want to find under the form of certain linear combinations of the
entries of the codeword leads to algorithms with a better complexity. This is
then used together with a folding technique for attacking a McEliece scheme
based on LRPC codes. It leads to a feasible attack on one of the parameters
suggested in \cite{GMRZ13}.
