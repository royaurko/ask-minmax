We consider in this paper the Muskat problem in a periodic geometry and
incorporate capillary as well as gravity effects in the modelling. The problem
re-writes as an abstract evolution equation and we use this property to prove
well-posedness of the problem and to establish exponential stability of some
flat equilibrium. Using bifurcation theory we also find finger shaped
steady-states which are all unstable.
