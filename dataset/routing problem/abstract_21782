We obtain an asymptotic solution for the squeeze flow of a viscoplastic
medium. The standard lubrication-style expansions of the problem predict plug
speed which varies slowly in the principal flow direction. This variation
implies that the plug region cannot be truly unyielded. Our solution shows that
this region is a pseudo-plug region in which the leading order equation predict
a plug, but really it is weakly yielded at higher order.
