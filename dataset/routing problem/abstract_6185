Let $\M$ be a classical Riemannian globally symmetric space of rank one and
non-compact type. We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the
Dirichlet problem for harmonic maps into $\M$ with prescribed singularities
along a closed submanifold of the domain. This generalizes our previous work
where such maps into the hyperbolic plane were constructed. This problem, in
the case where $\M$ is the complex-hyperbolic plane, has applications to
equilibrium configurations of co-axially rotating charged black holes in
General Relativity.
