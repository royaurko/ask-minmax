Stochastic motion of charged particles in the magnetic field was first
studied almost half a century ago in the classical works by Taylor and
Kursunoglu in connection with the diffusion of electrons and ions in plasma. In
their works the long-time limits of the mean square displacement (MSD) of the
particles have been found. Later Furuse on the basis of standard Langevin
theory generalized their results for arbitrary times. The currently observed
revival of these problems is mainly related to memory effects in the diffusion
of particles, which appear when colored random forces act on the particles from
their surroundings. In the present work an exact analytical solution of the
generalized Langevin equation has been found for the motion of the particle in
an external magnetic field when the random force is exponentially correlated in
the time. The obtained MSD of the particle motion across the field contains a
term proportional to the time, a constant term, and contributions exponentially
decaying in the time. The results are more general than the previous results
from the literature and are obtained in a considerably simpler way applicable
to many other problems of the Brownian motion with memory.
