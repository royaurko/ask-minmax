In connection with the investigations of initial stages of appearance of
turbulence in the current-carrying mediums and also the investigations of
relaxation oscillations in thin-film bridges of high-temperature superconductor
$Y Ba_2 Cu_3 O_{7-x}$ some problems of estimation of asymptotical parameters of
chaotic dynamic systems are considered. The mechanism of measuring modes
matching (discretization by time and by amplitude at the limited buffer memory
of registering device) to the fixed procedure of signal handling is discussed.
It is shown that the problem of estimation of embedding dimension can be
reduced to the investigation of sufficiently simple phase transitions at the
integer-valued finite-dimensional lattices.
