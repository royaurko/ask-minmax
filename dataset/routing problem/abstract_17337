In the last few decades, significant achievements have been attained in
predicting where humans look at images through different computational models.
However, how to determine contributions of different visual features to overall
saliency still remains an open problem. To overcome this issue, a recent class
of models formulates saliency estimation as a supervised learning problem and
accordingly apply machine learning techniques. In this paper, we also address
this challenging problem and propose to use multiple kernel learning (MKL) to
combine information coming from different feature dimensions and to perform
integration at an intermediate level. Besides, we suggest to use responses of a
recently proposed filterbank of object detectors, known as Object-Bank, as
additional semantic high-level features. Here we show that our MKL-based
framework together with the proposed object-specific features provide
state-of-the-art performance as compared to SVM or AdaBoost-based saliency
models.
