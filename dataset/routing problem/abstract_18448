Consistent query answering is the problem of computing the answers from a
database that are consistent with respect to certain integrity constraints that
the database as a whole may fail to satisfy. Those answers are characterized as
those that are invariant under minimal forms of restoring the consistency of
the database. In this context, we study the problem of repairing databases by
fixing integer numerical values at the attribute level with respect to denial
and aggregation constraints. We introduce a quantitative definition of database
fix, and investigate the complexity of several decision and optimization
problems, including DFP, i.e. the existence of fixes within a given distance
from the original instance, and CQA, i.e. deciding consistency of answers to
aggregate conjunctive queries under different semantics. We provide sharp
complexity bounds, identify relevant tractable cases; and introduce
approximation algorithms for some of those that are intractable. More
specifically, we obtain results like undecidability of existence of fixes for
aggregation constraints; MAXSNP-hardness of DFP, but a good approximation
algorithm for a relevant special case; and intractability but good
approximation for CQA for aggregate queries for one database atom denials (plus
built-ins).
