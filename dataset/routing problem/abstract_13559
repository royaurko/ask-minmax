In this paper we present some results related to the problem of finding
periodic representations for algebraic numbers. In particular, we analyze the
problem for cubic irrationalities. We show an interesting relationship between
the convergents of bifurcating continued fractions related to a couple of cubic
irrationalities, and a particular generalization of the Redei polynomials.
Moreover, we give a method to construct a periodic bifurcating continued
fraction for any cubic root paired with another determined cubic root.
