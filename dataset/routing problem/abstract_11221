We discuss a gravitationally induced nonlinearity in hierarchic systems. We
consider the generation of extremely low-frequency radio waves with a frequency
of the periodic gravitational radiation; the generation is due to an induced
nonlinear self-action of electromagnetic radiation in the vicinity of the
gravitational-radiation source. These radio waves are a fundamentally new type
of response of an electrodynamic system to gravitational radiation. That is why
we here use an unconventional term: radio-wave messengers of periodic
gravitational radiation.
