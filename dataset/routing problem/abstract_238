In Heterogeneous mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) congestion occurs with
limited resources. Due to the shared wireless channel and dynamic topology,
packet transmissions suffer from interference and fading. In heterogeneous ad
hoc networks, throughput via a given route is depending on the minimum data
rate of all its links. In a route of links with various data rates, if a high
data rate node forwards more traffic to a low data rate node, there is a chance
of congestion, which leads to long queuing delays in such routes. Since hop
count is used as a routing metric in traditional routing, it do not adapt well
to mobile nodes. A congestion-aware routing metric for MANETs should
incorporate transmission capability, reliability, and congestion around a link.
In this paper, we propose to develop a hop-by-hop congestion aware routing
protocol which employs a combined weight value as a routing metric, based on
the data rate, queuing delay, link quality and MAC overhead. Among the
discovered routes, the route with minimum cost index is selected, which is
based on the node weight of all the in-network nodes. Simulation results prove
that our proposed routing protocol attains high throughput and packet delivery
ratio, by reducing the packet drop and delay.
