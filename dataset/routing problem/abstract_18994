This paper is concerned with the problem of implementing an unbounded
timestamp object from multi-writer atomic registers, in an asynchronous
distributed system of n processors with distinct identifiers where timestamps
are taken from an arbitrary universe. Ellen, Fatourou and Ruppert (2008) showed
that sqrt{n}/2-O(1) registers are required for any obstruction-free
implementation of long-lived timestamp systems from atomic registers (meaning
processors can repeatedly get timestamps). We improve this existing lower bound
in two ways. First we establish a lower bound of n/6 - O(1) registers for the
obstruction-free long-lived timestamp problem. Previous such linear lower
bounds were only known for constrained versions of the timestamp problem. This
bound is asymptotically tight; Ellen, Fatourou and Ruppert (2008) constructed a
wait-free algorithm that uses n-1 registers. Second we show that sqrt{n} - O(1)
registers are required for any obstruction-free implementation of one-shot
timestamp systems(meaning each processor can get a timestamp at most once). We
show that this bound is also asymptotically tight by providing a wait-free
one-shot timestamp system that uses fewer than 2 sqrt{n} registers, thus
establishing a space complexity gap between one-shot and long-lived timestamp
systems.
