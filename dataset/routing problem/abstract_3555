The study of solving inverse singular value problems for nonnegative matrices
has been around for decades. It is clear that an inverse singular problem is
trivial if the desirable matrix is not restricted to a certain structure.
Provided with singular values and diagonal entries, this paper presents a
numerical procedure, based on the successive projection process, to solve
inverse singular value problems for nonnegative matrices subject to given
diagonal entries. Even if we focus on the specific type of inverse singular
value problems with prescribed diagonal entries, this entire procedure can be
carried over with little effort to other types of structure. Numerical examples
are used to demonstrate the capacity and efficiency of our method.
