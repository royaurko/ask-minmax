Suppose that a fence needs to be protected (perpetually) by $k$ mobile agents
with maximum speeds $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ so that no point on the fence is left
unattended for more than a given amount of time. The problem is to determine if
this requirement can be met, and if so, to design a suitable patrolling
schedule for the agents. Alternatively, one would like to find a schedule that
minimizes the \emph{idle time}, that is, the longest time interval during which
some point is not visited by any agent. We revisit this problem, introduced by
Czyzowicz et al.(2011), and discuss several strategies for the cases where the
fence is an open and a closed curve, respectively.
  In particular: (i) we disprove a conjecture by Czyzowicz et al. regarding the
optimality of their Algorithm ${\mathcal A_2}$ for unidirectional patrolling of
a closed fence; (ii) we present an algorithm with a lower idle time for
patrolling an open fence, improving an earlier result of Kawamura and
Kobayashi.
