We construct a canonical frame for an arbitrary Gl(2)-structure thus solving
the equivalence problem for Gl(2)-structures. Our treatment includes also a
problem of contact equivalence of ordinary differential equations and applies
to certain classes of vector distributions. Additionally we characterise
Gl(2)-structures which are defined by ODEs.
