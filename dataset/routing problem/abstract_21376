In the present investigation, we introduce a new class
k-US_{s}^{{\eta}}({\lambda},{\mu},{\gamma},t) of analytic functions in the open
unit disc U with negative coefficients. The object of the present paper is to
determine coefficient estimates, neighborhoods and partial sums for functions
f(z) belonging to this class.
