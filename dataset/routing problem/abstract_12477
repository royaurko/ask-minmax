We analyze initial-boundary value problems for an integrable generalization
of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation formulated on the half-line. In
particular, we investigate the so-called linearizable boundary conditions,
which in this case are of Robin type. Furthermore, we use a particular solution
to verify explicitly all the steps needed for the solution of a well-posed
problem.
