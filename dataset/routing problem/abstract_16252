We introduce the Global Spin Model to study the static and dynamic properties
of the ultracold fermionic gas near the broad Feshbach resonance. We show that
the problem of molecular production, in a single-mode approximation, is reduced
to the linear Landau-Zener problem for operators. The strong interaction leads
to significant renormalization of the gap between adiabatic levels. In contrast
to static problem the close vicinity of exact resonance does not play
substantial role. Two main physical results of our theory is the high
sensitivity of molecular production to the initial value of magnetic field and
generation of a large BCS condensate distributed over a broad range of momenta
in a wide range of parameters. We calculate the amplitude of the condensate as
function of the initial detuning and the rate of the magnetic field sweep.
