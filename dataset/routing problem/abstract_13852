This paper presents stability and convergence analysis of a finite volume
scheme (FVS) for solving aggregation, breakage and the combined processes by
showing Lipschitz continuity of the numerical fluxes. It is shown that the FVS
is second order convergent independently of the meshes for pure breakage
problem while for pure aggregation and coupled equations, it shows second order
convergent on uniform and non-uniform smooth meshes. Furthermore, it gives only
first order convergence on non-uniform grids. The mathematical results of
convergence analysis are also demonstrated numerically for several test
problems.
