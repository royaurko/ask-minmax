We consider the decision problem for quantifier-free formulas whose atoms are
linear inequalities interpreted over the reals or rationals. This problem may
be decided using satisfiability modulo theory (SMT), using a mixture of a SAT
solver and a simplex-based decision procedure for conjunctions.
State-of-the-art SMT solvers use simplex implementations over rational numbers,
which perform well for typical problems arising from model-checking and program
analysis (sparse inequalities, small coefficients) but are slow for other
applications (denser problems, larger coefficients). We propose a simple
preprocessing phase that can be adapted on existing SMT solvers and that may be
optionally triggered. Despite using floating-point computations, our method is
sound and complete - it merely affects efficiency. We implemented the method
and provide benchmarks showing that this change brings a naive and slow
decision procedure ("textbook simplex" with rational numbers) up to the
efficiency of recent SMT solvers, over test cases arising from model-checking,
and makes it definitely faster than state-of-the-art SMT solvers on dense
examples.
