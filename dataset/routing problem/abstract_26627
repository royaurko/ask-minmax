The aim of the paper is to examine the computational complexity and
algorithmics of enumeration, the task to output all solutions of a given
problem, from the point of view of parameterized complexity. First we define
formally different notions of efficient enumeration in the context of
parameterized complexity. Second we show how different algorithmic paradigms
can be used in order to get parameter-efficient enumeration algorithms in a
number of examples. These paradigms use well-known principles from the design
of parameterized decision as well as enumeration techniques, like for instance
kernelization and self-reducibility. The concept of kernelization, in
particular, leads to a characterization of fixed-parameter tractable
enumeration problems.
