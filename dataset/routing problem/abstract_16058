A lattice-theoretic framework is introduced that permits the study of the
conditional independence (CI) implication problem relative to the class of
discrete probability measures. Semi-lattices are associated with CI statements
and a finite, sound and complete inference system relative to semi-lattice
inclusions is presented. This system is shown to be (1) sound and complete for
saturated CI statements, (2) complete for general CI statements, and (3) sound
and complete for stable CI statements. These results yield a criterion that can
be used to falsify instances of the implication problem and several heuristics
are derived that approximate this "lattice-exclusion" criterion in polynomial
time. Finally, we provide experimental results that relate our work to results
obtained from other existing inference algorithms.
