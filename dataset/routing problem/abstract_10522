There has been a tremendous growth in publicly available digital video
footage over the past decade. This has necessitated the development of new
techniques in computer vision geared towards efficient analysis, storage and
retrieval of such data. Many mid-level computer vision tasks such as
segmentation, object detection, tracking, etc. involve an inference problem
based on the video data available. Video data has a high degree of spatial and
temporal coherence. The property must be intelligently leveraged in order to
obtain better results.
  Graphical models, such as Markov Random Fields, have emerged as a powerful
tool for such inference problems. They are naturally suited for expressing the
spatial dependencies present in video data, It is however, not clear, how to
extend the existing techniques for the problem of inference over time. This
thesis explores the Path Probability Method, a variational technique in
statistical mechanics, in the context of graphical models and approximate
inference problems. It extends the method to a general framework for problems
involving inference in time, resulting in an algorithm, \emph{DynBP}. We
explore the relation of the algorithm with existing techniques, and find the
algorithm competitive with existing approaches.
  The main contribution of this thesis are the extended GBP algorithm, the
extension of Path Probability Methods to the DynBP algorithm and the
relationship between them. We have also explored some applications in computer
vision involving temporal evolution with promising results.
