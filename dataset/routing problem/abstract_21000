Recently there has been renewed interest among differential geometers in the
theory of Engel structures. We introduce holomorphic analogues of these
structures, and pose the problem of classifying projective manifolds admitting
them. Besides providing the basic properties of these varieties, we present two
series of examples and characterize them by certain positivity conditions on
the Engel structure.
