We provide a minimal solution to the mu/B_mu problem in the gauge mediated
supersymmetry breaking by introducing a Standard Model singlet filed S with a
mass around the messenger scale which couples to the Higgs and messenger
fields. This singlet is nearly supersymmetric and acquires a relatively small
Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV) from its radiatively generated tadpole term.
Consequently, both mu and B_mu parameters receive the tree-level and one-loop
contributions, which are comparable due to the small S VEV. Because there
exists a proper cancellation in such two kinds of contributions to B_mu, we can
have a viable Higgs sector for electroweak symmetry breaking.
