We provide a review of recently-develop dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT)
approaches to the general problem of strongly correlated electronic systems
with disorder. We first describe the standard DMFT approach, which is exact in
the limit of large coordination, and explain why in its simplest form it cannot
capture either Anderson localization or the glassy behavior of electrons.
Various extensions of DMFT are then described, including statistical DMFT,
typical medium theory, and extended DMFT, methods specifically designed to
overcome the limitations of the original formulation. We provide an overview of
the results obtained using these approaches, including the formation of
electronic Griffiths phases, the self-organized criticality of the Coulomb
glass, and the two-fluid behavior near Mott-Anderson transitions. Finally, we
outline research directions that may provide a route to bridge the gap between
the DMFT-based theories and the complementary diffusion-mode approaches to the
metal-insulator transition.
