The aim of this paper is to show how a weakly dispersive perturbation of the
inviscid Burgers equation improve (enlarge) the space of resolution of the
local Cauchy problem. More generally we will review several problems arising
from weak dispersive perturbations of nonlinear hyperbolic equations or
systems.
