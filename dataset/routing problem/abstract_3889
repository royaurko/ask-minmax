We characterize the biorthogonal polynomials that appear in the theory of
coupled random matrices via a Riemann-Hilbert problem. Our Riemann-Hilbert
problem is different from the ones that were proposed recently by Ercolani and
McLaughlin, Kapaev, and Bertola et al. We believe that our formulation may be
tractable to asymptotic analysis.
