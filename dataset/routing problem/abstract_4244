We show that the language equivalence problem for regular and context-free
commutative grammars is coNEXP-complete. In addition, our lower bound
immediately yields further coNEXP-completeness results for equivalence problems
for communication-free Petri nets and reversal-bounded counter automata.
Moreover, we improve both lower and upper bounds for language equivalence for
exponent-sensitive commutative grammars.
