The idea of plasma suppression of beam-beam effects at muon colliders is
discussed. It is shown that one should take into account collisions in the
plasma that were ignored before. Rough estimates show that this effect leads to
a fast ``recovery'' of the beam magnetic field. For beam parameters
characteristic for muon colliders the suppression of the magnetic component of
the beam field (1/2 of the total force) is almost absent. It is also shown that
the presence of the dense plasma (Li jet) at the interaction point leads to
enormous hadronic background (due to photo-nuclear reactions) in the detector,
about 10^{7} particles per crossing at large angles which creates serious
problems for experimentation.
