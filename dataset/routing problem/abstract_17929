One of the classical problems in group theory is determining the set of
positive integers $n$ such that every group of order $n$ has a particular
property $P$, such as cyclic or abelian. We first present the Sylow theorems
and the idea of solvable groups, both of which will be invaluable in our
analysis. We then gather various solutions to this problem for cyclic, abelian,
nilpotent, and supersolvable groups, as well as groups with ordered Sylow
towers.
  This work is an exposition of known results, but it is hoped that the reader
will find useful the presentation in a single account of the various tools that
have been used to solve this general problem. This article claims no
originality, but is meant as a synthesis of related knowledge and resources.
