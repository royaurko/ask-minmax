We study the asymptotic behavior of C^2-evolutions u = u(x,t) under a given
action of the m-Hessian evolution operators and boundary conditions. We obtain
sufficient (close to necessary) conditions for the convergence of solutions to
the first intial-boundary value problem for the m-Hessian evolution equations
to stationary functions as t tends to infinity.
