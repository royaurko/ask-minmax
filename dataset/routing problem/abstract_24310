In a functional calculus, the so called \Omega-rule states that if two terms
P and Q applied to any closed term <i>N</i> return the same value (i.e. PN =
QN), then they are equal (i.e. P = Q holds). As it is well known, in the
\lambda\beta-calculus the \Omega-rule does not hold, even when the \eta-rule
(weak extensionality) is added to the calculus. A long-standing problem of H.
Barendregt (1975) concerns the determination of the logical power of the
\Omega-rule when added to the \lambda\beta-calculus. In this paper we solve the
problem, by showing that the resulting theory is \Pi\_{1}^{1}-complete.
