An original regular approach to constructing special type symmetries for
boundary value problems, namely renormgroup symmetries, is presented. Different
methods of calculating these symmetries, based on modern group analysis are
described. Application of the approach to boundary value problems is
demonstrated with the help of a simple mathematical model.
