Algorithm portfolio and selection approaches have achieved remarkable
improvements over single solvers. However, the implementation of such systems
is often highly customised and specific to the problem domain. This makes it
difficult for researchers to explore different techniques for their specific
problems. We present LLAMA, a modular and extensible toolkit implemented as an
R package that facilitates the exploration of a range of different portfolio
techniques on any problem domain. It implements the algorithm selection
approaches most commonly used in the literature and leverages the extensive
library of machine learning algorithms and techniques in R. We describe the
current capabilities and limitations of the toolkit and illustrate its usage on
a set of example SAT problems.
