The symmetrical network theory is a framework for understanding the immune
system, that dates back to the mid 1970s. The symmetrical network theory is
based on symmetrical stimulatory, inhibitory and killing interactions between
clones that are specific for each other. Previous papers described roles for
helper and suppressor T cells in regulating immune responses and a model for
HIV pathogenesis. This paper extends the theory to account for regulatory T
cells that include three types of suppressor cells called Ts1, Ts2 and Ts3, and
two types of helper cells called Th1 and Th2. The theory leads to a concept for
an HIV vaccine, namely a reagent commonly known as IVIG, to be administered in
small amounts in an immunogenic form via an immunogenic route. Predictions are
made for experiments in mice and macaque monkeys.
