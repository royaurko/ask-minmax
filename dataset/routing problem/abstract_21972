Motivated by the fact that 2-dimensional data have become popularly used in
many applications without being much considered its integrity checking. We
introduce the problem of detecting a corrupted area in a 2-dimensional space,
and investigate two possible efficient approaches and show their time and space
complexities. Also, we briefly introduce the idea of an approximation scheme
using a hash sieve and suggest a novel "adaptive tree" structure revealing
granularity of information.
