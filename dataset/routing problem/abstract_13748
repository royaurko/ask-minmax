The structure of integral manifolds in the Kovalevskaya problem of the motion
of a heavy rigid body about a fixed point is considered. An analytic
description of a bifurcation set is obtained, and bifurcation diagrams are
constructed. The number of two-dimensional tori is indicated for each connected
component of the supplement to the bifurcation set in the space of the first
integrals constants. The main topological bifurcations of the regular tori are
described.
