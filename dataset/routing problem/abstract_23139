This paper is aimed to elaborate the problem of energy-momentum in General
Relativity. In this connection, we use the prescriptions of Einstein,
Landau-Lifshitz, Papapetrou and M\"{o}ller to compute the energy-momentum
densities for two exact solutions of Einstein field equations. The spacetimes
under consideration are the non-null Einstein-Maxwell solutions and the
singularity-free cosmological model. The electromagnetic generalization of the
G\"{o}del solution and the G\"{o}del metric become special cases of the
non-null Einstein-Maxwell solutions. It turns out that these prescriptions do
not provide consistent results for any of these spacetimes. These inconsistence
results verify the well-known proposal that the idea of localization does not
follow the lines of pseudo-tensorial construction but instead follows from the
energy-momentum tensor itself. These differences can also be understood with
the help of the Hamiltonian approach.
