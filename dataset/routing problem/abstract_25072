This paper addresses the design of a dedicated homophonic coding for a class
of communication systems which, in order to provide both reliability and
security, first encode the data before encrypting it, which is referred to as
the encoding-encryption paradigm. The considered systems employ
error-correction coding for reliability, a stream cipher for encryption, and
homophonic coding to enhance the protection of the key used in the stream
cipher, on which relies the security of all the system transmissions. This
paper presents a security evaluation of such systems from a computational
complexity point of view, which serves as a source for establishing dedicated
homophonic code design criteria. The security evaluation shows that the
computational complexity of recovering the secret key, given all the
information an attacker could gather during passive attacks he can mount, is
lower bounded by the complexity of the related LPN (Learning Parity in Noise)
problem in both the average and worst case. This gives guidelines to construct
a dedicated homophonic encoder which maximizes the complexity of the underlying
LPN problem for a given encoding overhead. Finally, this paper proposes a
generic homophonic coding strategy that fulfills the proposed design criteria
and thus both enhances security while minimizing the induced overhead.
