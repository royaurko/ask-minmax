Communication complexity is an area of classical computer science which
studies how much communication is necessary to solve various distributed
computational problems. Quantum information processing can be used to reduce
the amount of communication required to carry out some distributed problems. We
speak of pseudo-telepathy when it is able to completely eliminate the need for
communication. The matching game is the newest member of the family of
pseudo-telepathy games. After introducing a general model for pseudo-telepathy
games, we focus on the question what the smallest size of inputs is for which
the matching game is a pseudo-telepathy game.
