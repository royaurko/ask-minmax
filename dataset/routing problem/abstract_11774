We study a free interface problem related to combustion of condensed matter
and some non-equilibrium exothermal phase transitions. In spite of a variety of
non-trivial dynamical scenarios exhibited by the model the solutions are
uniformly bounded and the interface velocity is a smooth function. The main
result of the paper establishes existence of a compact connected attractor for
the classical solutions of the problem. Numerical evidence leads to the
conjecture that the fractal dimension of the attractor is finite.
