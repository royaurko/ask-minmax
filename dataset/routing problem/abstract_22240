We consider the computational complexity of counting the number of answers to
a logical formula on a finite structure. In the setting of parameterized
complexity, we present a trichotomy theorem on classes of existential positive
queries. We then proceed to study an extension of first-order logic in which
algorithms for the counting problem at hand can be naturally and conveniently
expressed.
