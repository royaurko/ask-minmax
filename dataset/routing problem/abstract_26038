The influence of a constant magnetic field on the order parameter of the
four-dimensional Nambu and Jona-Lasinio model extended by the 't Hooft
six-quark term and eight-quark interactions is considered. It is shown that the
multi-quark interactions cause the order parameter to increase sharply
(secondary magnetic catalysis) with increasing strength of the field at the
characteristic scale $H\sim 10^{14}\Lambda^2$ G/MeV^2.
