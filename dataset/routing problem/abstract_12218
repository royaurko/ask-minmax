This paper presents the solution about the threat of a VBIED (Vehicle-Born
Improvised Explosive Device) obtained with the DSmT (Dezert-Smarandache
Theory). This problem has been proposed recently to the contributors by Simon
Maskell and John Lavery as a typical illustrative example to try to compare the
different approaches for dealing with uncertainty for decision-making support.
The purpose of this paper is to show in details how a solid justified solution
can be obtained from DSmT approach and its fusion rules thanks to a proper
modeling of the belief functions involved in this problem.
