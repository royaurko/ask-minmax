Author finds the solutions of the Christoffel problem for open and closed
surfaces in Riemannian space. The Christoffel problem is reduced to the problem
of construction the continuous G-deformations preserving the sum of principal
radii of curvature for every point of surface in Riemannian space.
G-deformation transfers every normal vector of surface in parallel along the
path of the translation for each point of surface. The following analogs of the
Minkowski problem for open and closed surfaces in Riemannian space are being
considered in this article: 1) the problem of construction the surface with
prescribed mean curvature and condition of G-deformation; 2) the problem of
construction the deformations preserving the area of each arbitrary region of
surface and condition of G-deformation.
