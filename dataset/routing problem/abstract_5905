Additive or multiplicative stationary noise recently became an important
issue in applied fields such as microscopy or satellite imaging. Relatively few
works address the design of dedicated denoising methods compared to the usual
white noise setting. We recently proposed a variational algorithm to tackle
this issue. In this paper, we analyze this problem from a statistical point of
view and provide deterministic properties of the solutions of the associated
variational problems. In the first part of this work, we demonstrate that in
many practical problems, the noise can be assimilated to a colored Gaussian
noise. We provide a quantitative measure of the distance between a stationary
process and the corresponding Gaussian process. In the second part, we focus on
the Gaussian setting and analyze denoising methods which consist of minimizing
the sum of a total variation term and an $l^2$ data fidelity term. While the
constrained formulation of this problem allows to easily tune the parameters,
the Lagrangian formulation can be solved more efficiently since the problem is
strongly convex. Our second contribution consists in providing analytical
values of the regularization parameter in order to approximately satisfy
Morozov's discrepancy principle.
