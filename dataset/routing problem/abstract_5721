We study the Bayesian problems of detecting a change in the drift rate of an
observable diffusion process with linear and exponential penalty costs for a
detection delay. The optimal times of alarms are found as the first times at
which the weighted likelihood ratios hit stochastic boundaries depending on the
current observations. The proof is based on the reduction of the initial
problems into appropriate three-dimensional optimal stopping problems and the
analysis of the associated parabolic-type free-boundary problems. We provide
closed form estimates for the value functions and the boundaries, under certain
nontrivial relations between the coefficients of the observable diffusion.
