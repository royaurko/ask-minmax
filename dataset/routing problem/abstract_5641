In the kernel clustering problem we are given a large $n\times n$ positive
semi-definite matrix $A=(a_{ij})$ with $\sum_{i,j=1}^na_{ij}=0$ and a small
$k\times k$ positive semi-definite matrix $B=(b_{ij})$. The goal is to find a
partition $S_1,...,S_k$ of $\{1,... n\}$ which maximizes the quantity $$
\sum_{i,j=1}^k (\sum_{(i,j)\in S_i\times S_j}a_{ij})b_{ij}. $$ We study the
computational complexity of this generic clustering problem which originates in
the theory of machine learning. We design a constant factor polynomial time
approximation algorithm for this problem, answering a question posed by Song,
Smola, Gretton and Borgwardt. In some cases we manage to compute the sharp
approximation threshold for this problem assuming the Unique Games Conjecture
(UGC). In particular, when $B$ is the $3\times 3$ identity matrix the UGC
hardness threshold of this problem is exactly $\frac{16\pi}{27}$. We present
and study a geometric conjecture of independent interest which we show would
imply that the UGC threshold when $B$ is the $k\times k$ identity matrix is
$\frac{8\pi}{9}(1-\frac{1}{k})$ for every $k\ge 3$.
