We argue that it is possible to bind neutral atom (NA) to the ferromagnetic
wire (FW) by inequivalent quantization of the Hamiltonian. We follow the well
known von Neumann's method of self-adjoint extensions (SAE) to get this
inequivalent quantization, which is characterized by a parameter
\Sigma\in\mathbb{R}({mod}2\pi). There exists a single bound state for the
coupling constant \eta^2\in[0,1). Although this bound state should not occur
due to the existence of classical scale symmetry in the problem. But since
quantization procedure breaks this classical symmetry, bound state comes out as
a scale in the problem leading to scaling anomaly. We also discuss the strong
coupling region \eta^2< 0, which supports bound state making the problem
re-normalizable.
