When evaluating causal influence from one time series to another in a
multivariate dataset it is necessary to take into account the conditioning
effect of the other variables. In the presence of many variables, and possibly
of a reduced number of samples, full conditioning can lead to computational and
numerical problems. In this paper we address the problem of partial
conditioning to a limited subset of variables, in the framework of information
theory. The proposed approach is tested on simulated datasets and on an example
of intracranial EEG recording from an epileptic subject. We show that, in many
instances, conditioning on a small number of variables, chosen as the most
informative ones for the driver node, leads to results very close to those
obtained with a fully multivariate analysis, and even better in the presence of
a small number of samples. This is particularly relevant when the pattern of
causalities is sparse.
