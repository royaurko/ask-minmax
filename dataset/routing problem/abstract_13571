Using an identity, directly derived from the Young-Laplace equation, the
problem of the equilibrium shape of an axisymmetric sessile drop is reduced to
a one-parameter shooting method problem. Based on the method the numerical
solutions for drops with Bond number up to 15 are plotted. The agreement
between the method and the ADSA-D method as well as the experimental data is
tested. A Mathematica code based on the method is presented.
