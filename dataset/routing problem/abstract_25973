We consider a generalized Randall Sundrum (RS) brane world scenario with a
cosmological constant $\Omega$ induced on the visible brane. We show that for
$\Omega<0$, resolution of the hierarchy problem requires an upper bound on the
magnitude of $\Omega$. The corresponding tension on the visible brane can be
positive or negative. On the other hand, there is no such bound for $\Omega>0$.
However, in this case, the resolution of the hierarchy problem along with the
tuning of the value of the cosmological constant to its observed value closed
to $+10^{-124}$ (in Planck units) naturally lead to the tuning of the modulus
to a small value of inverse Planck length as estimated in the original RS
scenario.
