This paper reports on the structural and optical properties of Co-doped TiO2
thin films grown onto (0001) Al2O3 substrates by non-reactive pulsed laser
deposition (PLD) using argon as buffer gas. It is shown that by keeping
constant the substrate temperature at as low as 310 C and varying only the
background gas pressure between 7 Pa and 70 Pa, it is possible to grow either
epitaxial rutile or pure anatase thin films, as well as films with a mixture of
both polymorphs. The optical band gaps of the films are red shifted in
comparison to the values usually reported for undoped TiO2, which is consistent
with n-type doping of the TiO2 matrix. Such band gap red shift brings the
absorption edge of the Co-doped TiO2 films into the visible region, which might
favour their photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the band gap red shift
depends on the films phase composition, increasing with the increase of the
Urbach energy for increasing rutile content.
