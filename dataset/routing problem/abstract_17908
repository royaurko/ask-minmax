Half-space boundary Kramers' problem about isothermal sliding of moderate
dense gas with accomodation boundary conditions along a flat firm surface is
solving. The new method of the solution of boundary problems of the kinetic
theory is applied (see JVMMF, 2012, 52:3, 539-552). The method allows to
receive the solution with arbitrary degree of accuracy. The idea of
representation of boundary condition on distribution function in the form of
source in the kinetic equation serves as the basis for the method mentioned
above. By means of Fourier integrals the kinetic equation with a source comes
to the Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The solution has been
received in the form of Neumann's number.
