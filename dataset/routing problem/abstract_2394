The reachability problem for vector addition systems is a central problem of
net theory. This problem is known to be decidable but the complexity is still
unknown. Whereas the problem is EXPSPACE-hard, no elementary upper bounds
complexity are known. In this paper we consider the reversible reachability
problem. This problem consists to decide if two configurations are reachable
one from each other, or equivalently if they are in the same strongly connected
component of the reachability graph. We show that this problem is
EXPSPACE-complete. As an application of the introduced materials we
characterize the reversibility domains of a vector addition system.
