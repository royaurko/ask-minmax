We show that the cosmological moduli problem is solved, without relying on
huge late-time entropy production, if the universal cutoff scale of the theory
is a few orders of magnitude smaller than the Planck scale. We obtain a general
estimate of the modulus abundance in terms of the inflationary scale and the
reheating temperature, and find in particular that the reheating temperature
can be high enough for the non-thermal leptogenesis to work.
