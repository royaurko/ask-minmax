We review the role of R symmetries in models of supersymmetric unification in
four and more dimensions, and in string theory. We show that, if one demands
anomaly freedom and fermion masses, only R symmetries can forbid the
supersymmetric Higgs mass term mu. We then review the proof that R symmetries
are not available in conventional grand unified theories (GUTs) and argue that
this prevents natural solutions to the doublet-triplet splitting problem in
four dimensions. On the other hand, higher-dimensional GUTs do not suffer from
this problem. We briefly comment on an explicit string-derived model in which
the mu and dimension five proton decay problems are solved simultaneously by an
order four discrete R symmetry. We also comment on the higher-dimensional
origin of this symmetry.
