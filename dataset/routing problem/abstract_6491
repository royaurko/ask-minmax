The domains of data mining and knowledge discovery make use of large amounts
of textual data, which need to be handled efficiently. Specific problems, like
finding the maximum weight ordered common subset of a set of ordered sets or
searching for specific patterns within texts, occur frequently in this context.
In this paper we present several novel and practical algorithmic techniques for
processing textual data (strings) in order to efficiently solve multiple
problems. Our techniques make use of efficient string algorithms and data
structures, like KMP, suffix arrays, tries and deterministic finite automata.
