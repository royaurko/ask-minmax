Identification of functional elements of a genome often requires dividing a
sequence of measurements along a genome into segments differing from adjacent
segments. In many applications, the mean of the measured values at multiple
genomic locations in a segment is used to make inference of the property of
interest. The segments with non-zero means often correspond to genomic regions
with certain biological events, such as changes between two conditions. This
problem is often called the segmentation problem in the field of genomics, and
the change-point problem in other scientific disciplines. We designed an
efficient algorithm, called iSeg, for segmentation of high-throughput genomic
profiles. iSeg first utilizes dynamic programming to compute the significance
for a large number of candidate segments. It then uses tree-based data
structures to detect overlapping significant regions and update them
simultaneously. Refinement and merging of significant segments are performed at
the end to generate the final segmentation. We evaluate iSeg using both
simulated and experimental datasets and show that it performs quite well when
compared with existing methods.
