This paper reviews the constraints on the solar neutrino mixing parameters
with data collected by the Homestake, SAGE, GALLEX, Kamiokande,
SuperKamiokande, and SNO experiments. An emphasis will be given to the global
solar neutrino analyses in terms of matter-enhanced oscillation of two active
flavors. The results to-date, including both solar model dependent and
independent measurements, indicate that electron neutrinos are changing to
other active types on route to the Earth from the Sun. The total flux of solar
neutrinos is found to be in very good agreement with solar model calculations.
Future measurements will focus on greater accuracy for mixing parameters and on
better sensitivity to low neutrino energies.
