In this paper we prove existence results and asymptotic behavior for strong
solutions $u\in W^{2,2}_{\textrm{loc}}(\Omega)$ of the nonlinear elliptic
problem \begin{equation} \tag{P} \label{abstr} \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
-\Delta_{H}u+H(\nabla u)^{q}+\lambda u=f&\text{in }\Omega,\\ u\rightarrow
+\infty &\text{on }\partial\Omega, \end{array} \right. \end{equation} where $H$
is a suitable norm of $\mathbb R^{n}$, $\Omega$ is a bounded domain,
$\Delta_{H}$ is the Finsler Laplacian, $1<q\le 2$, $\lambda>0$ and $f$ is a
suitable function in $L^{\infty}_{\textrm{loc}}$. Furthermore, we are
interested in the behavior of the solutions when $\lambda\rightarrow 0^{+}$,
studying the so-called ergodic problem associated to \eqref{abstr}. A key role
in order to study the ergodic problem will be played by local gradient
estimates for \eqref{abstr}.
