Motivated by the mu-problem and the axion solution to the strong CP-problem,
we extend the MSSM with one more chiral singlet field $X_e$. The underlying
PQ-symmetry allows only one more term $X_e H_u H_d$ in the superpotential. The
spectrum of the Higgs system includes a light pseudoscalar $a_X$ (in addition
to the standard CP-even Higgs boson), predominantly decaying to two photons:
$a_X \to \gamma \gamma$. Both Higgs bosons might be in the range accessible to
current LHC experiments.
