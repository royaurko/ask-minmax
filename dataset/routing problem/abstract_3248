We investigate an overdetermined Torsion problem, with a non-constant
positively homogeneous boundary constraint on the gradient. We interpret this
problem as the Euler equation of a shape optimization problems, we prove
existence and regularity of a solution. Moreover several geometric properties
of the solution are shown.
