The macroscopic shape of liquid crystalline elastomers strongly depends on
the order parameter of the mesogenic groups. This order can be manipulated if
photoisomerisable groups, e.g. containing N=N bonds, are introduced into the
material. We have explored the large photo-mechanical response of such an
azobenzene-containing nematic elastomer at different temperatures, using force
and optical birefringence measurements, and focusing on fundamental aspects of
population dynamics and the related speed and repeatability of the response.
The characteristic time of ``on'' and ``off'' regimes strongly depends on
temperature, but is generally found to be very long. We were able to verify
that the macroscopic relaxation of the elastomer is determined by the nematic
order dynamics and not, for instance, by the polymer network relaxation.
