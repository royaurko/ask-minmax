The immune system is a cognitive system of complexity comparable to the brain
and its computational algorithms suggest new solutions to engineering problems
or new ways of looking at these problems. Using immunological principles, a two
(or three-) module algorithm is developed which is capable of launching a
specific response to an anomalous situation. Applications are being developed
for electromechanical drives and network power transformers. Experimental
results illustrate an application to fault detection in squirrel-cage electric
motors.
