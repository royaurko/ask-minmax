We find that there is no supersymmetric flavor/CP problem, mu-problem,
cosmological moduli/gravitino problem or dimension four/five proton decay
problem in a class of supersymmetric theories with O(1) GeV gravitino mass. The
cosmic abundance of the non-thermally produced gravitinos naturally explains
the dark matter component of the universe. A mild hierarchy between the mass
scale of supersymmetric particles and electroweak scale is predicted,
consistent with the null result of a search for the Higgs boson at the LEP-II
experiments. A relation to the strong CP problem is addressed. We propose a
parametrization of the model for the purpose of collider studies. The scalar
tau lepton is the next to lightest supersymmetric particle in a theoretically
favored region of the parameter space. The lifetime of the scalar tau is of
O(1000) seconds with which it is regarded as a charged stable particle in
collider experiments. We discuss characteristic signatures and a strategy for
confirmation of this class of theories at the LHC experiments.
