We study the connection between *-representations of algebras associated with
graphs, locally-scalar graph representations and the problem about the spectrum
of a sum of two Hermitian operators. For algebras associated with Dynkin graphs
we give an explicit description of the parameters for which there are
irreducible representations and an algorithm for contructing these
representations.
