We consider the problems of finding optimal identifying codes, (open)
locating-dominating sets and resolving sets of an interval or a permutation
graph. In these problems, one asks to find a subset of vertices, normally
called a \emph{solution} set, using which all vertices of the graph are
distinguished. The identification can be done by considering the neighborhood
within the solution set, or by employing the distances to the solution
vertices. Normally the goal is to minimize the size of the solution set then.
Here we give tight lower bounds for the size such solution sets when the input
graph is either a interval graph, or a unit interval graph, or a (bipartite)
permutation graph or a cograph. While such lower bounds for the general class
of graphs are in logarithmic order (or order of graph), the improved bounds in
these special classes are of the order of either quadratic root or linear in
terms of number of vertices. Moreover, the results for cographs lead to
linear-time algorithms to solve the considered problems on inputs that are
cographs.
