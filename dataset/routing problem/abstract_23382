We consider non-tachyonic hybrid inflation in the context of the braneworld
cosmology. When one considers models for brane inflation, hybrid inflation is a
natural consequence of the tachyon condensation if it appears at the end of
inflation. In this case, however, reheating is a difficult problem due to the
peculiar properties of the tachyon. In this paper we show some models for brane
inflation where a new type of hybrid inflation is realized due to the localized
matter fields. The obvious advantage of our scenario is successful reheating,
which is due to the potential that is localized on the brane. The serious
problem of the loop correction is also avoided.
