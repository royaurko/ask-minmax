In many social dilemmas, individuals tend to generate a situation with low
payoffs instead of a system optimum ("tragedy of the commons"). Is the routing
of traffic a similar problem? In order to address this question, we present
experimental results on humans playing a route choice game in a computer
laboratory, which allow one to study decision behavior in repeated games beyond
the Prisoner's Dilemma. We will focus on whether individuals manage to find a
cooperative and fair solution compatible with the system-optimal road usage. We
find that individuals tend towards a user equilibrium with equal travel times
in the beginning. However, after many iterations, they often establish a
coherent oscillatory behavior, as taking turns performs better than applying
pure or mixed strategies. The resulting behavior is fair and compatible with
system-optimal road usage. In spite of the complex dynamics leading to
coordinated oscillations, we have identified mathematical relationships
quantifying the observed transition process. Our main experimental discoveries
for 2- and 4-person games can be explained with a novel reinforcement learning
model for an arbitrary number of persons, which is based on past experience and
trial-and-error behavior. Gains in the average payoff seem to be an important
driving force for the innovation of time-dependent response patterns, i.e. the
evolution of more complex strategies. Our findings are relevant for decision
support systems and routing in traffic or data networks.
