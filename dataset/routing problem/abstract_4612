In this paper we consider the problem of communication scheduling in wireless
networks with respect to the SINR(Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio)
constraint in metric spaces. The nodes are assigned linear powers, i.e. for
each sender node the power is constant times the path loss between the sender
and corresponding receiver. This is the minimal power for a successful
transmission. We present a constant factor deterministic approximation
algorithm, which works for at least Euclidean fading metrics. Simultaneously we
obtain the approximate value of the optimal schedule length with error at most
a constant factor. To give an insight into the complexity of the problem, we
show that in some metric spaces the problem is NP-hard and cannot be
approximated within a factor less than 1.5.
