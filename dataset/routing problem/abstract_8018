We discuss a new approach to solve the low lying states of the Schroedinger
equation. For a fairly large class of problems, this new approach leads to
convergent iterative solutions, in contrast to perturbative series expansions.
These convergent solutions include the long standing difficult problem of a
quartic potential with either symmetric or asymmetric minima.
