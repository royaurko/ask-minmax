We address the problem of providing inference from a Bayesian perspective for
parameters selected after viewing the data. We present a Bayesian framework for
providing inference for selected parameters, based on the observation that
providing Bayesian inference for selected parameters is a truncated data
problem. We show that if the prior for the parameter is non-informative, or if
the parameter is a "fixed" unknown constant, then it is necessary to adjust the
Bayesian inference for selection. Our second contribution is the introduction
of Bayesian False Discovery Rate controlling methodology,which generalizes
existing Bayesian FDR methods that are only defined in the two-group mixture
model.We illustrate our results by applying them to simulated data and data
froma microarray experiment.
