We study classic scheduling problems on uniformly related machines. Efficient
polynomial time approximation schemes (EPTAS's) are fast and practical
approximation schemes. New methods and techniques are essential in developing
such improved approximation schemes, and their design is a primary goal of this
research agenda. We present EPTAS's for the scheduling problem of a set of jobs
on uniformly related machines so as to minimize the total weighted completion
time, both for the case with release dates and its special case without release
dates. These problems are NP-hard in the strong sense, and therefore EPTAS's
are the best possible approximation schemes unless P=NP. Previously, only
PTAS's were known for these two problems, while an EPTAS was known only for the
special case of identical machines without release dates.
