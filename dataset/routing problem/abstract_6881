In this study, inverse nodal problem is solved for p-Laplacian Schr\"odinger
equation with energy-dependent potential with the Drichlet conditions.
Asymptotic estimates of eigenvalues, nodal points and nodal lengths are given
by using Pr\"ufer substitution. Especially, an explicit formula for potential
function is given by using nodal lengths. Results are more general than
classical p- Laplacian Sturm Liouville problem. For the proofs, it is used the
methods given in the references <cite>lav3</cite>, <cite>Wang</cite>.
