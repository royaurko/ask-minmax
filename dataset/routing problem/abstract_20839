The discrete tomography of B-type and F-type icosahedral model sets is
investigated, with an emphasis on reconstruction and uniqueness problems. These
are motivated by the request of materials science for the unique reconstruction
of quasicrystalline structures from a small number of images produced by
quantitative high resolution transmission electron microscopy.
