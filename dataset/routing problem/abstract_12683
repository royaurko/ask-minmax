We present classical and generalized Riemann-Hilbert problem in several
contexts arising from $K$-theory and bordism theory. The language of Fredholm
pairs turns out to be useful and unavoidable. We propose an abstract
formulation of a notion of bordism in the context of Hilbert spaces equipped
with splittings.
