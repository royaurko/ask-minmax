In previous work, the dynamics of the elastic rod was recast in a Lax pair
formulation, with fiducial arc length s and time t as continuous independent
variables. However, the solution of these equations cannot apply directly to a
system where the fiducial arc length s is a discrete variable. In this paper,
we show how to discretize the continuous s variable in a way that preserves the
integrability of the original system. The t parameter is not discretized, so
this algorithm will be especially useful for solutions of the s-discrete and
t-continuous elastic rod problem, as may occur in problems where the polymeric
structure of the DNA is made explicit.
