Solving efficiently complex problems using metaheuristics, and in particular
local searches, requires incorporating knowledge about the problem to solve. In
this paper, the permutation flowshop problem is studied. It is well known that
in such problems, several solutions may have the same fitness value. As this
neutrality property is an important one, it should be taken into account during
the design of optimization methods. Then in the context of the permutation
flowshop, a deep landscape analysis focused on the neutrality property is
driven and propositions on the way to use this neutrality to guide efficiently
the search are given.
