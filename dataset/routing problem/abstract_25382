An incomplete particle identification distorts the observed event-by-event
fluctuations of the hadron chemical composition in nucleus-nucleus collisions.
A new experimental technique called the {\em identity method} was recently
proposed. It eliminated the misidentification problem for one specific
combination of the second moments in a system of two hadron species. In the
present paper this method is extended to calculate all the second moments in a
system with arbitrary number of hadron species. Special linear combinations of
the second moments are introduced. These combinations are presented in terms of
single-particle variables and can be found experimentally from the
event-by-event averaging. The mathematical problem is then reduced to solving a
system of linear equations. The effect of incomplete particle identification is
fully eliminated from the final results.
