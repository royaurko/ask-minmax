We have calculated gamma-ray radiative transport in regions of high energy
density, such as gamma-ray burst source regions, using a discrete ordinate,
discrete energy group method. The calculations include two-photon pair
production and annihilation, as well as three-photon pair annihilation. The
radiation field itself acts as an absorbing medium, and the optical depth
depends on its intensity, so the problem is intrinsically nonlinear. Spherical
divergence produces effective collimation of the flux. At high optical depth
the high energy ($E > 1$ MeV) portion of the emergent spectrum assumes a nearly
universal form. An approximate limit is derived for the high energy flux from a
gamma-ray burst source region of given size, and the implications of this limit
for the distance to the March 5, 1979 event are briefly discussed. We discuss
more generally the problem of very luminous bursts, and implications of
Galactic halo distances for flare models.
