We analyze a non-standard isoperimetric problem in the plane associated with
a metric having degenerate conformal factor at two points. Under certain
assumptions on the conformal factor, we establish the existence of curves of
least length under a constraint associated with enclosed Euclidean area. As a
motivation for and application of this isoperimetric problem, we identify these
isoperimetric curves, appropriately parametrized, as traveling wave solutions
to a bi-stable Hamiltonian system of PDE's. We also determine the existence of
a maximal propagation speed for these traveling waves through an explicit upper
bound depending on the conformal factor.
