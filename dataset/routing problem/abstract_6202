We study the consequences of the existence and breaking of a Peccei--Quinn
symmetry within the context of a dynamical model of electroweak symmetry
breaking based on broken gauged flavour symmetries. We perform an estimate of
the axion mass by including flavour instanton effects and show that, for low
cut--offs, the axion is sufficiently massive to prevent it from being
phenomenologically unacceptable. We conclude with an examination of the strong
CP problem and show that our axion cannot solve the problem, though we indicate
ways in which the model can be extended so that the strong CP problem is
solved.
