In a multicellular organism different cell types express a gene in different
amounts. Samples from which gene expression levels can be measured typically
contain a mixture of different cell types, the resulting measurements thus give
only averages over the different cell types present. Based on fluctuations in
the mixture proportions from sample to sample it is in principle possible to
reconstruct the underlying expression levels of each cell type: to deconvolute
the sample. We use a statistical mechanics approach to the problem of
deconvoluting such partial concentrations from mixed samples, give analytical
results for when and how well samples can be unmixed, and suggest an algorithm
for sample deconvolution.
