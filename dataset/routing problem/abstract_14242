The matrix Sturm-Liouville operator with an integrable potential on the
half-line is considered. We study the inverse spectral problem, which consists
in recovering of this operator by the Weyl matrix. The main result of the paper
is the necessary and sufficient conditions on the Weyl matrix of the
non-self-adjoint matrix Sturm-Liouville operator. We also investigate the
self-adjoint case and obtain the characterization of the spectral data as a
corollary of our general result.
