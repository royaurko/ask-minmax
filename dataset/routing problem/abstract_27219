We reexamine the models with gauge mediation in view of the minimality. As a
result, we arrive at a very simple model of direct gauge mediation which does
not suffer from the flavor problems nor the CP problems. We show that the
parameter space which is consistent with the Higgs boson mass at around 126 GeV
can be tested through the stable stau searches at the 14TeV run of the LHC. The
gravitino is a viable candidate for a dark matter. We also give a short
discussion on a possible connection of our model to the recently discovered
X-ray line signal at 3.5 keV in the XMM Newton X-ray observatory data.
