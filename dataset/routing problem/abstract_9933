We discuss the following family of problems, parameterized by integers $C\geq
2$ and $D\geq 1$: Does a given one-tape non-deterministic $q$-state Turing
machine make at most $Cn+D$ steps on all computations on all inputs of length
$n$, for all $n$?
  Assuming a fixed tape and input alphabet, we show that these problems are
co-NP-complete and we provide good non-deterministic and co-non-deterministic
lower bounds. Specifically, these problems can not be solved in
$o(q^{(C-1)/4})$ non-deterministic time by multi-tape Turing machines. We also
show that the complements of these problems can be solved in $O(q^{C+2})$
non-deterministic time and not in $o(q^{(C-1)/2})$ non-deterministic time by
multi-tape Turing machines.
