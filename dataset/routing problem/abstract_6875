In this article, we discuss about the resolution of the Riemann problem for a
2x2 system in nonconservative form exhibiting parabolic degeneracy. The system
can be perceived as the limiting equation (depending on a parameter tending to
0) of a 2x2 strictly hyperbolic, genuinely nonlinear, non-conservative system
arising in context of a model in elastodynamics.
