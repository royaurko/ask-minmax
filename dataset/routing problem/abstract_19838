The bound state problem for a gauge invariant quark-antiquark system is
considered in the instantaneous rest frame. Focus here is on the long range
non-perturbative interaction. A two-time Green's function is constructed for
Salpeter amplitudes. The corresponding Schr\"{o}dinger equation is found to be
in the Salpeter form with a Wilson-loop term as the instantaneous kernel.
