In a recent paper we showed that a quintessence scalar field plus a
dissipative matter fluid can drive late cosmic accelerated expansion and
simultaneously solve the coincidence problem [1]. In this brief report we
extend this result to the cases when the scalar field is replaced either by a
Chaplygin gas or a tachyonic fluid.
