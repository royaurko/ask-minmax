The Peccei Quinn (PQ) solution of the strong CP problem requires the
existence of axions, which are a viable candidate for Dark Matter. Here we show
that, if the Nambu Goldstone potential of the PQ model is replaced by a
potential V(|\Phi|) admitting a tracker solution, the scalar field |\Phi| can
account for Dark Energy, while the phase of \Phi yields axion Dark Matter. Such
Dark Matter and Dark Energy turn out to be weakly coupled. If V is a SUGRA
potential, the model essentially depends on a single parameter, the energy
scale \Lambda. Once we set \Lambda \simeq 10^{10} GeV, at the quark--hadron
transition, |\Phi| naturally passes through values suitable to solve the strong
CP problem, later growing to values providing fair amounts of Dark Matter and
Dark Energy. In this model, the linear growth factor, from recombination to
now, is quite close to \LambdaCDM. The selected \Lambda value can be an
indication of the scale where the soft breaking of SUSY occurred.
