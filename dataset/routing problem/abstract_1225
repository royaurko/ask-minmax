We analyze probe data obtained from a toroidal magnetized plasma
configuration suitable for studies of low-frequency gradient-driven
instabilities. These instabilities give rise to field-aligned convection rolls
analogous to Rayleigh-Benard cells in neutral fluids, and may theoretically
develop similar routes to chaos. When using mean-field dimension analysis, we
observe low dimensionality, but this could originate from either
low-dimensional chaos, periodicity or quasi-periodicity. Therefore, we apply
recurrence plot analysis as well as estimation of the largest Lyapunov
exponent. These analyses provide evidence of low-dimensional chaos, in
agreement with theoretical predictions.
