The classical wave equation in the space of generalized functions
(distributions)is considered. The Distributions Method of building the
solutions of nonstationary boundary value problems (NBVP) for wave equations in
coordinates spaces of different dimensions is elaborated. Dynamic analogues of
Green and Gauss formulas for solutions of wave equation in the distributions
space are built. Their regular integral representations and singular boundary
integral equations for solving the nonstationary problems are constructed for
the coordinates spaces of the 1,2,3-dimensions. The method of obtaining of
conditions on shock waves fronts is stated. The theorem on the single solution
of NBVP is proved, including shock waves.
