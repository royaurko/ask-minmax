The radiolanthanide 161Ho (2.48 h) is a promising Auger-electron emitter for
internal radiotherapy that can be produced with particle accelerators. The
excitation functions of the natDy(p,xn)161Ho and natDy(d,x)161Ho reactions were
measured up to 40 and 50 MeV respectively by using the stacked foil activation
method and gamma-ray spectrometry. The experimental data were compared with
results of the TALYS code available in the TENDL 2011 library [1]. The main
parameters of different production routes are discussed.
