We relax assumptions for a dissipative operator in Krein space to possess a
maximal non-negative invariant subspace. Our main result is a generalization of
a well-known Pontrjagin-Krein-Langer-Azizov theorem. Then we investigate the
semigroup properties of the restriction of the operator onto the invariant
subspace.
