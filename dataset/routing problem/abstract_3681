We reduce the isomorphism problem for undirected graphs without loops to the
isomorphism problems for a class of finite dimensional $2$-step nilpotent Lie
algebras over a field and for a class of finite $p$-groups. We show that the
isomorphism problem for graphs is harder than the two latter isomorphism
problems in the sense of Borel reducibility. A computable analogue of Borel
reducibility was introduced by S. Coskey, J.D. Hamkins, and R. Miller. A
relation of the isomorphism problem for undirected graphs to the well-known
problem of classifying pairs of matrices over a field (up to similarity) is
also studied.
