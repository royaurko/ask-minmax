This is a set of 288 questions written for a Moore-style course in
Mathematical Logic. I have used these (or some variation) four times in a
beginning graduate course. Topics covered are:
  propositional logic
  axioms of ZFC
  wellorderings and equivalents of AC
  ordinal and cardinal arithmetic
  first order logic, and the compactness theorem
  Lowenheim-Skolem theorems
  Turing machines, Church's Thesis
  completeness theorem and first incompleteness theorem
  undecidable theories
  second incompleteness theorem
