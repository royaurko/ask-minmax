Leveraging the spatial modes of multimode waveguides using mode-division
multiplexing (MDM) on an integrated photonic chip allows unprecedented scaling
of bandwidth density for on-chip communication. Switching channels between
waveguides is critical for future scalable optical networks, but its
implementation in multimode waveguides must address how to simultaneously
control modes with vastly different optical properties. Here we present a
platform for switching signals between multimode waveguides based on
individually processing the spatial mode channels using single-mode elements.
Using this wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) compatible platform, we
demonstrate a 1x2 multimode switch for a silicon chip which routes four data
channels with low (<-20 dB) crosstalk. We show bit-error rates below 10^-9 and
power penalties below 1.4 dB on all channels while routing 10 Gbps data when
each channel is input and routed separately. The switch exhibits an additional
power penalty of less than 2.4 dB when all four channels are simultaneously
routed.
