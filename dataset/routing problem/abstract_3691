The one of the most interesting problem of discrete mathematics is the SAT
(satisfiability) problem. Good way in SAT solver developing is to transform the
SAT problem to the problem of continuous search of global minimums of the
functional associated with the CNF. This article proves the special
construction of the functional and offers to solve the system of non-linear
algebraic equation that determines functional stationary points via modified
method of consecutive approximation. The article describes parallel versions of
the method. Also gives the schema of using the method to important problems of
cryptographic analysis of asymmetric ciphers, including determining concrete
bits of multipliers (in binary form) in large factorization problems and
concrete bits of exponent of discrete logarithm problem.
