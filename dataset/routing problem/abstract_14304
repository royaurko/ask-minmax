We investigate the large-time behavior of solutions to an outflow problem of
the full compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the half line. The
non-degenerate stationary solution is shown to be asymptotically stable under
large initial perturbation with no restriction on the adiabatic exponent
$\gamma$, provided that the boundary strength is sufficiently small. The proofs
are based on the standard energy method and the crucial step is to obtain
positive lower and upper bounds of the density and the temperature uniformly in
time and space.
