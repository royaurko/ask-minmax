We show that there is no classical regular Sturm-Liouville problem on a
finite interval whose spectrum consists of infinitely many distinct primes
numbers. In particular, this answers in the negative a question raised by Zettl
in his book on Sturm-Liouville theory. We also show that there {\it may} exist
such a problem if the parameter dependence is nonlinear.
