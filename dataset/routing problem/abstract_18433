The notion of arc consistency plays a central role in constraint
satisfaction. It is known that the notion of local consistency can be extended
to constraint optimisation problems defined by soft constraint frameworks based
on an idempotent cost combination operator. This excludes non idempotent
operators such as + which define problems which are very important in practical
applications such as Max-CSP, where the aim is to minimize the number of
violated constraints. In this paper, we show that using a weak additional axiom
satisfied by most existing soft constraints proposals, it is possible to define
a notion of soft arc consistency that extends the classical notion of arc
consistency and this even in the case of non idempotent cost combination
operators. A polynomial time algorithm for enforcing this soft arc consistency
exists and its space and time complexities are identical to that of enforcing
arc consistency in CSPs when the cost combination operator is strictly
monotonic (for example Max-CSP). A directional version of arc consistency is
potentially even stronger than the non-directional version, since it allows non
local propagation of penalties. We demonstrate the utility of directional arc
consistency by showing that it not only solves soft constraint problems on
trees, but that it also implies a form of local optimality, which we call arc
irreducibility.
