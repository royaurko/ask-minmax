We consider the stochastic solution to a Cauchy problem corresponding to a
nonnegative diffusion with zero drift, which represents a price process under
some risk-neutral measure. When the diffusion coefficient is locally Holder
continuous with some exponent in (0,1], the stochastic solution is shown to be
a classical solution. A comparison theorem for the Cauchy problem is also
proved, without the linear growth condition on the diffusion coefficient.
Moreover, we establish the equivalence: the stochastic solution is the unique
classical solution to the Cauchy problem if, and only if, a comparison theorem
holds. For the case where the stochastic solution may not be smooth, we
characterize it as a limit of smooth stochastic solutions associated with some
approximating Cauchy problems.
