In this paper we take up the quantal two-centre problem where the Coulomb
centres have arbitrary positive charges. In analogy with the symmetric case,
treated in the second paper of this series of papers, we use the knowledge on
the quasiclassical dynamics to express the contour integrals in the first- and
third-order approximations of the phase-integral quantization conditions, given
in the first paper of this series of papers, in terms of complete elliptic
integrals. For various values of the distance between these charges the
accuracy of the formulas obtained is illustrated by comparison with available
numerically exact results.
