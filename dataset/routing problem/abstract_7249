In this paper we present a new bound obtained with the probabilistic method
for the solution of the Set Covering problem with unit costs. The bound is
valid for problems of fixed dimension, thus extending previous similar
asymptotic results, and it depends only on the number of rows of the
coefficient matrix and the row densities. We also consider the particular case
of matrices that are \textit{almost} block decomposable, and show how the bound
may improve according to the particular decomposition adopted. Such final
result may provide interesting indications for comparing different matrix
decomposition strategies.
