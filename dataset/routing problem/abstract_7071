In this article, we combine the concept of a bipolar fuzzy set and a soft
set. We introduce the notion of bipolar fuzzy soft set and study fundamental
properties. We study basic operations on bipolar fuzzy soft set. We define
exdended union, intersection of two bipolar fuzzy soft set. We also give an
application of bipolar fuzzy soft set into decision making problem. We give a
general algorithm to solve decision making problems by using bipolar fuzzy soft
set.
