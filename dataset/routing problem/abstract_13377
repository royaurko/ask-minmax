The QXORSAT problem is the quantified version of the satisfiability problem
XORSAT in which the connective exclusive-or is used instead of the usual or. We
study the phase transition associated with random QXORSAT instances. We give a
description of this phase transition in the case of one alternation of
quantifiers, thus performing an advanced practical and theoretical study on the
phase transition of a quantified roblem.
