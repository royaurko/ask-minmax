We determine the rate region of the vector Gaussian one-helper source-coding
problem under a covariance matrix distortion constraint. The rate region is
achieved by a simple scheme that separates the lossy vector quantization from
the lossless spatial compression. The converse is established by extending and
combining three analysis techniques that have been employed in the past to
obtain partial results for the problem.
