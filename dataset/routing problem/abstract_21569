We prove the existence of a local time, the continuity of the local time
about $t$, and the regular property for $a.e.$ $x\in R$ of a Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
type $\{X_t,\ t\in R^+\}$ driven by a general L\'{e}vy process, under mild
regularity conditions. We discuss the asymptotic behaviour of the local time
when $X$ is ergodic. We also investigate the first passage problem. These
results give precise information about the local properties of the sample
functions.
