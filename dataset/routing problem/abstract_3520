We present the spline-interpolation approximate solution of the Dirichlet
problem for the Laplace equation in the bodies of revolution, cones and
cylinders. Our method is based on reduction of the 3D problem to the sequence
of 2D Dirichlet problems. The main advantage of the spline-interpolation
solution of the 3D Dirichlet problem is its continuity in the whole domain up
to the boundary even for the case of the linear spline.
