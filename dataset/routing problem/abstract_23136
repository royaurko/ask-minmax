Discussions on the Langevin Twins 'paradox' are most often based on a
"triangular" diagram which outlines the twins spacetime travels. It won't be
our way, avoiding what we think to be a problem at the basis of numerous
controversies. Our approach relies on a fundamentally different Equivalence
Principle, namely the so-called "Punctual Equivalence Principle", from which we
think that a very conformal aspect proceeds. We present a resolution of this
paradox in the framework of the so-called "scale gravity". This resolution
hinges on a clear determinism of the Twins proper times, in some definite
situations, and a fundamental under-determinism in some other particular ones,
the physical discrimination of which being achieved out of a precise
mathematical description of conformal geometry. Moreover, we find that the time
discrepancy between the twins, could somehow be at the root expression of the
second fundamental law of thermodynamics.
