The crystal structure of the thermoelectric material tin selenide has been
investigated with angle-dispersive synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction under
hydrostatic pressure up to 27 GPa. With increasing pressure, a continuous
evolution of the crystal structure from the GeS type to the higher-symmetry TlI
type was observed, with a critical pressure of 10.5(3) GPa. The orthorhombic
high-pressure modification, beta'-SnSe, is closely related to the
pseudo-tetragonal high-temperature modification at ambient pressure. The
similarity between the changes of the crystal structure at elevated
temperatures and at high pressures suggests the possibility that strained thin
films of SnSe may provide a route to overcoming the problem of the limited
thermal stability of beta-SnSe at high temperatures.
