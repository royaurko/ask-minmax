The probability distribution of finite-time Lyapunov exponents provides an
important characterization of dynamical attractors. We study such distributions
for strange nonchaotic attractors (SNAs) created through several different
mechanisms in quasiperiodically forced nonlinear dynamical systems. Statistical
properties of the distributions such as the variance and the skewness also
distinguish between SNAs formed by different bifurcation routes.
