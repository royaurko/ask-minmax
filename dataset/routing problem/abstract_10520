Increasing practical interest has been shown in regression problems where the
errors, or disturbances, are centred in a way that reflects particular
characteristics of the mechanism that generated the data. In economics this
occurs in problems involving data on markets, productivity and auctions, where
it can be natural to centre at an end-point of the error distribution rather
than at the distribution's mean. Often these cases have an extreme-value
character, and in that broader context, examples involving meteorological,
record-value and production-frontier data have been discussed in the
literature. We shall discuss nonparametric methods for estimating regression
curves in these settings, showing that they have features that contrast so
starkly with those in better understood problems that they lead to apparent
contradictions. For example, merely by centring errors at their end-points
rather than their means the problem can change from one with a familiar
nonparametric character, where the optimal convergence rate is slower than
$n^{-1/2}$, to one in the super-efficient class, where the optimal rate is
faster than $n^{-1/2}$. Moreover, when the errors are centred in a non-standard
way there is greater intrinsic interest in estimating characteristics of the
error distribution, as well as of the regression mean itself. The paper will
also address this aspect of the problem.
