The present book is the first publication in English considered the modern
problems of control theory and analysis connected with a concept of system
zeros. The previous book by Ye.M. Smagina (1990) had been written in Russian
and it is inaccessible to English speaking researchers. The purpose of the
offered book is to systematize and consistently to state basic theoretical
results connected with properties of multivariable system zeros. Different
zeros definitions and different types of zeros are studied. Basic numerical
algorithms of zeros computing and the zero assignment problem are also
presented. All results are illustrated by examples.
