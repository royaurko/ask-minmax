There are many fuzzy models like Fuzzy matrices, Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, Fuzzy
relational Maps, Fuzzy Associative Memories, Bidirectional Associative memories
and so on. But almost all these models can give only one sided solution like
hidden pattern or a resultant output vector dependent on the input vector
depending in the problem at hand. So for the first time we have defined a
n-adaptive fuzzy model which can view or analyze the problem in n ways (n >=2)
Though we have defined these n- adaptive fuzzy models theorectically we are not
in a position to get a n-adaptive fuzzy model for n > 2 for practical real
world problems. The highlight of this model is its capacity to analyze the same
problem in different ways thereby arriving at various solutions that mirror
multiple perspectives.
  We have used the 2-adaptive fuzzy model having the two fuzzy models, fuzzy
matrices model and BAMs viz. model to analyze the views of public about HIV/
AIDS disease, patient and the awareness program. This book has five chapters
and 6 appendices. The first chapter just recalls the definition of four fuzzy
models used in this book and gives illustration of some of them. Chapter two
introduces the new n-adaptive fuzzy models. Chapter three uses for the first
time 2 adaptive fuzzy models to study psychological and sociological problems
about HIV/AIDS. Chapter four gives an outline of the interviews. Chapter five
gives the suggestions and conclusion based on our study. Of the 6 appendices
four of them are C-program made to make the working of the fuzzy model simple.
