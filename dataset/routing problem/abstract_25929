While the invention of holography by Dennis Gabor truly constitutes an
ingenious concept, it has ever since been troubled by the so called twin image
problem limiting the information that can be obtained from a holographic
record. Due to symmetry reasons there are always two images appearing in the
reconstruction process. Thus, the reconstructed object is obscured by its
unwanted out of focus twin image. Especially for emission electron as well as
for x- and gamma-ray holography, where the source-object distances are small,
the reconstructed images of atoms are very close to their twin images from
which they can hardly be distinguished. In some particular instances only,
experimental efforts could remove the twin images. More recently, numerical
methods to diminish the effect of the twin image have been proposed but are
limited to purely absorbing objects failing to account for phase shifts caused
by the object. Here we show a universal method to reconstruct a hologram
completely free of twin images disturbance while no assumptions about the
object need to be imposed. Both, amplitude and true phase distributions are
retrieved without distortion.
