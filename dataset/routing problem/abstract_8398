In this work we establish local $C^{2,\alpha}$ regularity estimates for flat
solutions to non-convex fully nonlinear elliptic equations provided the
coefficients and the source function are of class $C^{0,\alpha}$. For problems
with merely continuous data, we prove that flat solutions are locally
$C^{1,\text{Log-Lip}}$.
