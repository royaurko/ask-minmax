We report experimental evidence of the route to spatiotemporal chaos in a
large 1D-array of hotspots in a thermoconvective system. Increasing the driving
force, a stationary cellular pattern becomes unstable towards a mixed pattern
of irregular clusters which consist of time-dependent localized patterns of
variable spatiotemporal coherence. These irregular clusters coexist with the
basic cellular pattern. The Fourier spectra corresponding to this
synchronization transition reveals the weak coupling of a resonant triad. This
pattern saturates with the formation of a unique domain of great spatiotemporal
coherence. As we further increase the driving force, a supercritical
bifurcation to a spatiotemporal beating regime takes place. The new pattern is
characterized by the presence of two stationary clusters with a characteristic
zig-zag geometry. The Fourier analysis reveals a stronger coupling and enables
to find out that this beating phenomena is produced by the splitting of the
fundamental spatiotemporal frequencies in a narrow band. Both secondary
instabilities are phase-like synchronization transitions with global and
absolute character. Far beyond this threshold, a new instability takes place
when the system is not able to sustain the spatial frequency splitting,
although the temporal beating remains inside these domains. These experimental
results may support the understanding of other systems in nature undergoing
similar clustering processes.
