We present numerical simulations of galaxy formation, one of the most
challenging problems in computational astrophysics. The key point in such
simulations is the efficient solution of the N--body problem. If the gas of a
galaxy is treated by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), the
hydrodynamic equations can be reduced to a form similar to that of the N--body
problem. A straightforward implementation requires a computational effort
$\propto N^2$, making it prohibitively expensive to simulate systems larger
than $10^5$ particles even on the largest available supercomputers. After a
description of the physical and numerical problems, we shortly review the
standard numerical methods to tackle these problems and discuss their
advantages and drawbacks. We also present a completely different approach to
perform such simulations using a workstation in combination with the special
purpose hardware {\sc Grape}. After a discussion of the main features of {\sc
Grape}, we present a simple implementation of a {\sc SPH}--N--body code on such
a configuration. Comparing results and performance of these two approaches, we
show, that with an investment of US \$ 50000, the problem can be solved up to 5
times faster than on a {\sc Cray} YMP.
