Formerly I presented a metric navigation method in the Webots mobile robot
simulator. The navigating Khepera-like robot builds an occupancy grid of the
environment and explores the square-shaped room around with a value iteration
algorithm. Now I created a topological navigation procedure based on the
occupancy grid process. The extension by a skeletonization algorithm results a
graph of important places and the connecting routes among them. I also show the
significant time profit gained during the process.
