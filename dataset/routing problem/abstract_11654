We discuss the spectral subspace perturbation problem for a self-adjoint
operator. Assuming that the convex hull of a part of its spectrum does not
intersect the remainder of the spectrum, we establish an \textit{a priori}
sharp bound on variation of the corresponding spectral subspace under
off-diagonal perturbations. This bound represents a new, \textit{a priori},
$\tan\Theta$ Theorem. We also extend the Davis--Kahan $\tan 2\Theta$ Theorem to
the case of some unbounded perturbations.
