Graphical models are frequently used to explore networks, such as genetic
networks, among a set of variables. This is usually carried out via exploring
the sparsity of the precision matrix of the variables under consideration.
Penalized likelihood methods are often used in such explorations. Yet,
positive-definiteness constraints of precision matrices make the optimization
problem challenging. We introduce nonconcave penalties and the adaptive LASSO
penalty to attenuate the bias problem in the network estimation. Through the
local linear approximation to the nonconcave penalty functions, the problem of
precision matrix estimation is recast as a sequence of penalized likelihood
problems with a weighted $L_1$ penalty and solved using the efficient algorithm
of Friedman et al. [Biostatistics 9 (2008) 432--441]. Our estimation schemes
are applied to two real datasets. Simulation experiments and asymptotic theory
are used to justify our proposed methods.
