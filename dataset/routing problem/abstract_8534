We give a quasi-complete solution of the (\Delta,N) problem for two
well-known families of digraphs used as good models for large interconnection
networks. In our study we also relate both families, the New Amsterdam and
Manhattan digraphs, with the double-step graphs (or circulant graphs with
degree two).
