The paper reports on a recent construction of M-functions and Krein resolvent
formulas for general closed extensions of an adjoint pair, and their
implementation to boundary value problems for second-order strongly elliptic
operators on smooth domains. The results are then extended to domains with
$C^{1,1}$ H\"older smoothness, by use of a recently developed calculus of
pseudodifferential boundary operators with nonsmooth symbols.
