For this special issue, the article aims at discussing a few econophysics
problems studied so far rather successfully. The following "applications" in
micro-econo-physics are considered : (i) financial crashes; it is emphasized
that one can distinguish between endogenous and exogenous causes; (ii)
portofolio control, selection and inherent risk measure; (iii) foreign currency
exchanges, also distinguishing endogenous and exogenous money control; (iv)
price and asset evolution values. It is shown that some macro-econo-physics
problem have been also tackled, like geographic/political constraints, the
globalization of the economy and country clustering. Moreover, it is daring to
suggest prospect for studies and researches, whence presenting some selection
of a few interesting perspectives.
