Thermal noise arising from mechanical dissipation in oxide coatings is a
major limitation to many precision measurement systems, including optical
frequency standards, high resolution optical spectroscopy and interferometric
gravity wave detectors. Presented here are measurements of dissipation as a
function of temperature between 7 K and 290 K in ion-beam sputtered Ta2O5 doped
with TiO2, showing a loss peak at 20 K. Analysis of the peak provides the first
evidence of the source of dissipation in doped Ta2O5 coatings, leading to
possibilities for the reduction of thermal noise effects.
