For one dimensional or multidimensional compressible Euler system of
polytropic gases, it is well known that the smooth solution will generally
develop singularities in finite time. However, for three dimensional Chaplygin
gases, due to the crucial role of "null condition" in the potential equation
which is derived by the irrotational and isentropic flow, P.Godin in [9] has
proved the global existence of a smooth 3-D spherically symmetric flow with
variable entropy when the initial data are of small smooth perturbations with
compact supports to a constant state. It is noted that there are some essential
differences on the global solution or blowup problems between 2-D and 3-D
hyperbolic systems. In this paper, we will focus on the global symmetric
solution problem of 2-D full compressible Euler system of Chaplygin gases.
Through carrying out involved analysis and finding an appropriate weight we can
derive some uniform weighted energy estimates on the small symmetric solution
to 2-D compressible Euler system of Chaplygin gases and further establish the
global existence of smooth solution by continuous induction method.
