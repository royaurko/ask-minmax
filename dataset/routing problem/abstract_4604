This paper analyzes the problem of assigning weights to edges incrementally
in a dynamic complete bipartite graph consisting of producer and consumer
nodes. The objective is to minimize the overall cost while satisfying certain
constraints. The cost and constraints are functions of attributes of the edges,
nodes and online service requests. Novelty of this work is that it models
real-time distributed resource allocation using an approach to solve this
theoretical problem. This paper studies variants of this assignment problem
where the edges, producers and consumers can disappear and reappear or their
attributes can change over time. Primal-Dual algorithms are used for solving
these problems and their competitive ratios are evaluated.
