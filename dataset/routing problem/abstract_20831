We prove an n-EXPTIME lower bound for the problem of deciding the winner in a
reachability game on Higher Order Pushdown Automata (HPDA) of level n. This
bound matches the known upper bound for parity games on HPDA. As a consequence
the mu-calculus model checking over graphs given by n-HPDA is n-EXPTIME
complete.
