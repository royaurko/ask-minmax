The problem of construction of integrable boundary conditions for the
discrete Toda chain is considered. The restricted chains for properly chosen
closure conditions are reduced to the well known discrete Painlev\'e equations
$dP_{III}$, $dP_{V}$, $dP_{VI}$. Lax representations for these discrete
Painlev\'e equations are found.
