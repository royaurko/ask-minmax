Several biological problems require the identification of regions in a
sequence where some feature occurs within a target density range: examples
including the location of GC-rich regions, identification of CpG islands, and
sequence matching. Mathematically, this corresponds to searching a string of 0s
and 1s for a substring whose relative proportion of 1s lies between given lower
and upper bounds. We consider the algorithmic problem of locating the longest
such substring, as well as other related problems (such as finding the shortest
substring or a maximal set of disjoint substrings). For locating the longest
such substring, we develop an algorithm that runs in O(n) time, improving upon
the previous best-known O(n log n) result. For the related problems we develop
O(n log log n) algorithms, again improving upon the best-known O(n log n)
results. Practical testing verifies that our new algorithms enjoy significantly
smaller time and memory footprints, and can process sequences that are orders
of magnitude longer as a result.
