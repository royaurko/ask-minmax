This article reviews some effects of disorder in percolation systems even
away from the critical density p_c. For densities below p_c, the statistics of
large clusters defines the animals problem. Its relation to the directed
animals problem and the Lee-Yang edge singularity problem is described. Rare
compact clusters give rise to Griffiths singuraties in the free energy of
diluted ferromagnets, and lead to a very slow relaxation of magnetization. In
biassed diffusion on percolation clusters, trapping in dead-end branches leads
to asymptotic drift velocity becoming zero for strong bias, and very slow
relaxation of velocity near the critical bias field.
