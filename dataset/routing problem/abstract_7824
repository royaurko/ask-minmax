Consider the probability that an arbitrary chosen lozenge tiling of the
hexagon with side lengths a, b, c, a, b, c contains the horizontal lozenge with
lowest vertex (x,y) as if it described the distribution of mass in the plane.
We compute the horizontal and the vertical moments of inertia with respect to
this distribution. This solves a problem by Propp [1, Problem 7].
