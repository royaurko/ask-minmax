The cubic Klein-Gordon equation is a simple but non-trivial partial
differential equation whose numerical solution has the main building blocks
required for the solution of many other partial differential equations. In this
study, the library 2DECOMP&FFT is used in a Fourier spectral scheme to solve
the Klein-Gordon equation and strong scaling of the code is examined on
thirteen different machines for a problem size of 512^3. The results are useful
in assessing likely performance of other parallel fast Fourier transform based
programs for solving partial differential equations. The problem is chosen to
be large enough to solve on a workstation, yet also of interest to solve
quickly on a supercomputer, in particular for parametric studies. Unlike other
high performance computing benchmarks, for this problem size, the time to
solution will not be improved by simply building a bigger supercomputer.
