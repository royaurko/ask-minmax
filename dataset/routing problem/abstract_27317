We consider information theoretic secret key agreement and secure function
computation by multiple parties observing correlated data, with access to an
interactive public communication channel. Our main result is an upper bound on
the secret key length, which is derived using a reduction of binary hypothesis
testing to multiparty secret key agreement. Building on this basic result, we
derive new converses for multiparty secret key agreement. Furthermore, we
derive converse results for the oblivious transfer problem and the bit
commitment problem by relating them to secret key agreement. Finally, we derive
a necessary condition for the feasibility of secure computation by trusted
parties that seek to compute a function of their collective data, using an
interactive public communication that by itself does not give away the value of
the function. In many cases, we strengthen and improve upon previously known
converse bounds. Our results are single-shot and use only the given joint
distribution of the correlated observations. For the case when the correlated
observations consist of independent and identically distributed (in time)
sequences, we derive strong versions of previously known converses.
