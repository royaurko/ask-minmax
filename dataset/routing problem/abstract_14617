This paper presents the first coupling application of the dual reciprocity
BEM (DRBEM) and dynamic programming filter to inverse elastodynamic problem.
The DRBEM is the only BEM method, which does not require domain discretization
for general linear and nonlinear dynamic problems. Since the size of numerical
discretization system has a great effect on the computing effort of recursive
or iterative calculations of inverse analysis, the intrinsic boundary-only
merit of the DRBEM causes a considerable computational saving. On the other
hand, the strengths of the dynamic programming filter lie in its mathematical
simplicity, easy to program and great flexibility in the type, number and
locations of measurements and unknown inputs. The combination of these two
techniques is therefore very attractive for the solution of practical inverse
problems. In this study, the spatial and temporal partial derivatives of the
governing equation are respectively discretized first by the DRBEM and the
precise integration method, and then, by using dynamic programming with
regularization, dynamic load is estimated based on noisy measurements of
velocity and displacement at very few locations. Numerical experiments involved
with the periodic and Heaviside impact load are conducted to demonstrate the
applicability, efficiency and simplicity of this strategy. The affect of noise
level, regularization parameter, and measurement types on the estimation is
also investigated.
