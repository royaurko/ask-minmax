The class of countably intersected families of sets is defined. For any such
family we define a Banach space not containing $\ell^{1}(\NN )$. Thus we
obtain counterexamples to certain questions related to the heredity problem
for W.C.G. Banach spaces. Among them we give a subspace of a W.C.G. Banach
space not containing $\ell^{1}(\NN )$ and not being itself a W.C.G. space.
