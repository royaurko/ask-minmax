In this paper we present a new approach to solve the satisfiability problem
(SAT), based on boolean networks (BN). We define a mapping between a SAT
instance and a BN, and we solve SAT problem by simulating the BN dynamics. We
prove that BN fixed points correspond to the SAT solutions. The mapping
presented allows to develop a new class of algorithms to solve SAT. Moreover,
this new approach suggests new ways to combine symbolic and connectionist
computation and provides a general framework for local search algorithms.
