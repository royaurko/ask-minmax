This contribution is an advertisement for applying effective field theory
(EFT) to many-body problems, including nuclei and cold atomic gases. Examples
involving three-body interactions are used to illustrate how EFT's quantify and
systematically eliminate model dependence, and how they make many-body
calculations simpler and more powerful.
