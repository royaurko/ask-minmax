In recent time, by working in a plane with the metric associated with wave
equation (the Special Relativity non-definite quadratic form), a complete
formalization of space-time trigonometry and a Cauchy-like integral formula
have been obtained. In this paper the concept that the solution of a
mathematical problem is simplified by using a "mathematics" with the symmetries
of the problem, actuates us for studying the wave equation (in particular "the
initial values problem") in a plane where the geometry is the one "generated"
by the wave equation itself. In this way, following a classical approach, we
point out the well known differences with respect to Laplace equation
notwithstanding their formal equivalence (partial differential equations of
second order with constant coefficients) and also show that the same conditions
stated for Laplace equation allow us to find a new solution. In particular
taking as "initial data" for the wave equation an arbitrary function given on
an arm of an equilateral hyperbola, a "Poisson-like" integral formula holds.
