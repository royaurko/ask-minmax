We consider a problem which has received considerable attention in systems
literature because of its applications to routing in delay tolerant networks
and replica placement in distributed storage systems. In abstract terms the
problem can be stated as follows: Given a random variable $X$ generated by a
known product distribution over $\{0,1\}^n$ and a target value $0 \leq \theta
\leq 1$, output a non-negative vector $w$, with $\|w\|_1 \le 1$, which
maximizes the probability of the event $w \cdot X \ge \theta$. This is a
challenging non-convex optimization problem for which even computing the value
$\Pr[w \cdot X \ge \theta]$ of a proposed solution vector $w$ is #P-hard.
  We provide an additive EPTAS for this problem which, for constant-bounded
product distributions, runs in $ \poly(n) \cdot 2^{\poly(1/\eps)}$ time and
outputs an $\eps$-approximately optimal solution vector $w$ for this problem.
Our approach is inspired by, and extends, recent structural results from the
complexity-theoretic study of linear threshold functions. Furthermore, in spite
of the objective function being non-smooth, we give a \emph{unicriterion} PTAS
while previous work for such objective functions has typically led to a
\emph{bicriterion} PTAS. We believe our techniques may be applicable to get
unicriterion PTAS for other non-smooth objective functions.
