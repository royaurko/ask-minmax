Rapid growth and proliferation of cloud computing services around the world
has increased the necessity and significance of improving the energy efficiency
of could implementations. Virtual machines (VM) comprise the backend of most,
if not all, cloud computing services. Several VMs are often consolidated on a
physical machine to better utilize its resources. We take into account the
cooling and network structure of the datacenter hosting the physical machines
when consolidating the VMs so that fewer racks and routers are employed,
without compromising the service-level agreements, so that unused routing and
cooling equipment can be turned off to reduce energy consumption. Our
experimental results on four benchmarks shows that our technique improves
energy consumption of servers, network equipment, and cooling systems by 2.5%,
18.8%, and 28.2% respectively, resulting in a total of 14.7% improvement on
average in the entire datacenter.
