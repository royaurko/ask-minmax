Studying the flow of information between different areas of the brain can be
performed by using the so-called Partial Directed Coherence. This measure is
usually evaluated by first identifying a multivariate autoregressive model, and
then by using Fourier transforms of the impulse responses identified and
applying appropriate normalizations. Here, we present another route to evaluate
the partial directed coherences in multivariate time series. The method
proposed is non parametric, and utilises the strong spectral factorization of
the inverse of the spectral density matrix of the multivariate process. To
perform the factorization, we have recourse to an algorithm developed by Davis
and his collaborators. We present simulations as well as an application on a
real data set (Local Field Potentials in the sleeping mouse) to illustrate the
methodology. A comparison to the usual approach in term of complexity is
detailed. For long AR models, the proposed approach is of interest.
