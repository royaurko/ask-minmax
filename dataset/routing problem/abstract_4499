In the present article we present a particular combination of boundary
problems for the inhomogeneous tri-analytic equation: the
Neumann-(Dirichlet-Neuman) problem and the (Dirichlet-Neumann)-Dirichlet
problem. In order to obtain the solution and solvability conditions we use an
iteration's process involving those corresponding to equations of lower order.
