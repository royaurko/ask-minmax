In this paper, we propose QoS aware MAC protocol for Wire- less Sensor
Networks and its cross layer extension to network layer for providing QoS in
delay sensitive WSN scenarios. In WSNs, there can be two types of traffic one
is event driven traffic which requires immedi- ate attention and another is
periodic reporting. Event driven traffic is classified as Class I(delay
sensitive) traffic and periodic reporting is clas- sified as Class II(Best
Effort) Traffic. MAC layer adaptation can take place in terms of (i) Dynamic
contention window adjustment per class, (ii) Reducing the delay suffered by
difference in Sleep schedules(DSS) of communicating nodes by dynamically
adjusting Duty Cycle based on Utilization and DSS delay of class I traffic,
(iii) Different DIFS (DCF Inter Frame Spacing) per class, (iv) Adjusting all
the three schemes pro- posed above simultaneously. Cross layer extension is
also proposed, in which MAC layer uses network layer's next hop information for
better adaptation of duty cycle based on DSS delay. Routing protocols can uti-
lize MAC layer parameter DSS delay to select the routes which offer least DSS
delay latency, there by minimizing the overall end-to-end delay.
