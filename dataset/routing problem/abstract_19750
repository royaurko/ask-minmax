It is argued that the initial cosmological singularity is isotropic in
spatially inhomogeneous brane-world models. This implies that brane cosmology
may naturally give rise to a set of initial data that provide the conditions
for inflation to subsequently take place, consequently offering a plausible
solution to the initial conditions problem in cosmology.
