The behavior of parallel programs is even harder to understand than the
behavior of sequential programs. Parallel programs may suffer from any of the
performance problems affecting sequential programs, as well as from several
problems unique to parallel systems. Many of these problems are quite hard (or
even practically impossible) to diagnose without help from specialized tools.
We present a proposal for a tool for profiling the parallel execution of
Mercury programs, a proposal whose implementation we have already started. This
tool is an adaptation and extension of the ThreadScope profiler that was first
built to help programmers visualize the execution of parallel Haskell programs.
