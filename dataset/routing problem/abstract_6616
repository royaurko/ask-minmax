Students learning how to apply spreadsheets to accounting problems are not
always well served by the built-in financial functions. Problems can arise
because of differences between UK and US practice, through anomalies in the
functions themselves, and because the promptings of Wizards' engender an
attitude of filling in the blanks on the screen, and hoping for the best. Some
examples of these problems are described, and suggestions are presented for
ways of improving the situation. Principally, it is suggested that spreadsheet
prompts and 'Help' screens should offer integrated guidance, covering some
aspects of financial practice, as well as matters of spreadsheet technique.
