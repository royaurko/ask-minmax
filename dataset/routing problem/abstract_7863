In this paper we extend test set based augmentation methods for integer
linear programs to programs with more general convex objective functions. We
show existence and computability of finite test sets for these wider problem
classes by providing an explicit relationship to Graver bases. One candidate
where this new approach may turn out fruitful is the Quadratic Assignment
Problem.
