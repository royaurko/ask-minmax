In this paper, we study linear programming based approaches to the maximum
matching problem in the semi-streaming model. The semi-streaming model has
gained attention as a model for processing massive graphs as the importance of
such graphs has increased. This is a model where edges are streamed-in in an
adversarial order and we are allowed a space proportional to the number of
vertices in a graph.
  In recent years, there has been several new results in this semi-streaming
model. However broad techniques such as linear programming have not been
adapted to this model. We present several techniques to adapt and optimize
linear programming based approaches in the semi-streaming model with an
application to the maximum matching problem. As a consequence, we improve
(almost) all previous results on this problem, and also prove new results on
interesting variants.
