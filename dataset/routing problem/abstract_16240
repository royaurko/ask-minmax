We consider the problem of integrability of the Poisson equations describing
spatial motion of a rigid body in the classical nonholonomic Suslov problem. We
obtain necessary conditions for their solutions to be meromorphic and show that
under some further restrictions these conditions are also sufficient. The
latter lead to a family of explicit meromorphic solutions, which correspond to
rather special motions of the body in space. We also give explicit extra
polynomial integrals in this case.
  In the more general case (but under one restriction), the Poisson equations
are transformed into a generalized third order hypergeometric equation. A study
of its monodromy group allows us also to calculate the "scattering" angle: the
angle between the axes of limit permanent rotations of the body in space.
