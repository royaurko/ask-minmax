A classic theorem of T. Ando characterises operators that have numerical
radius at most one as operators that admit a certain positive 2x2 operator
matrix completion. In this paper we consider variants of Ando's theorem, in
which the operators (and matrix completions) are constrained to a given
C*-algebra. By considering nxn matrix completions, an extension of Ando's
theorem to a multivariable setting is made. We show that the C*-algebras in
which these extended formulations of Ando's theorem hold true are precisely the
C*-algebras with the weak expectation property (WEP). We also show that a
C*-subalgebra A of B(H) has WEP if and only if whenever a certain 3x3
(operator) matrix completion problem can be solved in matrices over B(H), it
can also be solved in matrices over A. This last result gives a
characterisation of WEP that is spatial and yet is independent of the
particular representation of the C*-algebra. This leads to a new
characterisation of injective von Neumann algebras. We also give a new
equivalent formulation of the Connes Embedding Problem as a problem concerning
3x3 matrix completions.
