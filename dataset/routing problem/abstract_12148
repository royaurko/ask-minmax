We address the issue of generalizing the thermodynamic quantities via
$q$-deformation, i.e., via the $q$-algebra that describes $q$-bosons and
$q$-fermions. In this study with the application of $q$-deformation to the
Landau diamagnetism problem in two dimensions, embedded in a $D$-dimensional
space, we will attempt to get a better understanding of the $q$-deformation. We
obtain new results for q-deformed internal energy, number of particles,
magnetization and magnetic susceptibility, which recover the values already
known in the literature in the limit $q\to1$.
