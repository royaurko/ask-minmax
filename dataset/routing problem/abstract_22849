We study the effect of the composition of the genetic sequence on the melting
temperature of double stranded DNA, using some simple analytically solvable
models proposed in the framework of the wetting problem. We review previous
work on disordered versions of these models and solve them when there were not
preexistent solutions. We check the solutions with Monte Carlo simulations and
transfer matrix numerical calculations. We present numerical evidence that
suggests that the logarithmic corrections to the critical temperature due to
disorder, previously found in RSOS models, apply more generally to ASOS and
continuous models. The agreement between the theoretical models and
experimental data shows that, in this context, disorder should be the crucial
ingredient of any model while other aspects may be kept very simple, an
approach that can be useful for a wider class of problems. Our work has also
implications for the existence of correlations in DNA sequences.
