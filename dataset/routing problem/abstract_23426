Basing on the general photon eigenstate and the anomaly cancelation, we have
naturally explained the electric charge quantization in two models based on the
SU(3)_C X SU(3)_L X U(1)_X gauge group, namely in the minimal model and in the
model with right-handed neutrinos. In addition, we have shown that the electric
charges of the proton and of the electron are opposite; and the same happens
with the neutron and the neutrino. We argue that the electric charge
quantization is not dependent on the classical constraints on generating mass
to the fermions, but it is related closely with the generation number problem.
In fact, both problems are properly solved as the direct consequences of the
fermion content under the anomaly free conditions.
