We investigate the decidability and complexity status of model-checking
problems on unlabelled reachability graphs of Petri nets by considering
first-order and modal languages without labels on transitions or atomic
propositions on markings. We consider several parameters to separate decidable
problems from undecidable ones. Not only are we able to provide precise borders
and a systematic analysis, but we also demonstrate the robustness of our proof
techniques.
