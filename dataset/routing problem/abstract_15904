The equation $$ \partial_tu=u\partial^2_{xx}u-(c-1)(\partial_xu)^2 $$ is
known in literature as a qualitative mathematical model of some biological
phenomena. Here this equation is derived as a model of the groundwater flow in
a water absorbing fissurized porous rock, therefore we refer to this equation
as a filtration-absorption equation. A family of self-similar solutions to this
equation is constructed. Numerical investigation of the evolution of
non-self-similar solutions to the Cauchy problems having compactly supported
initial conditions is performed. Numerical experiments indicate that the
self-similar solutions obtained represent intermediate asymptotics of a wider
class of solutions when the influence of details of the initial conditions
disappears but the solution is still far from the ultimate state: identical
zero. An open problem caused by the nonuniqueness of the solution of the Cauchy
problem is discussed.
