We address the problem of recovering an n-vector from m linear measurements
lacking sign or phase information. We show that lifting and semidefinite
relaxation suffice by themselves for stable recovery in the setting of m = O(n
log n) random sensing vectors, with high probability. The recovery method is
optimizationless in the sense that trace minimization in the PhaseLift
procedure is unnecessary. That is, PhaseLift reduces to a feasibility problem.
The optimizationless perspective allows for a Douglas-Rachford numerical
algorithm that is unavailable for PhaseLift. This method exhibits linear
convergence with a favorable convergence rate and without any parameter tuning.
