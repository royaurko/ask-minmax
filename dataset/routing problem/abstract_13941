We consider elliptic equations of order $2m$ in a bounded domain
$Q\subset\mathbb R^n$ with nonlocal boundary-value conditions connecting the
values of a solution and its derivatives on $(n-1)$-dimensional smooth
manifolds $\Gamma_i$ with the values on manifolds $\omega_{i}(\Gamma_i)$, where
$\bigcup_i\overline{\Gamma_i}=\partial Q$ is a boundary of $Q$ and $\omega_i$
are $C^\infty$ diffeomorphisms. By proving a priori estimates for solutions and
constructing a right regularizer, we show the Fredholm solvability in weighted
space. For nonlocal elliptic problems with a parameter, we prove the unique
solvability.
