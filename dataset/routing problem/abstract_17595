We present and analyze fully discrete Nystr\"om methods for the solution of
three classes of well conditioned boundary integral equations for the solution
of two dimensional scattering problems by homogeneous dielectric scatterers.
Specifically, we perform the stability analysis of Nystr\"om discretizations of
(1) the classical second kind integral equations for transmission problems
[KressRoach, 1978], (2) the single integral equation formulations [Kleinman &
Martin,1988], and (3) recently introduced Generalized Combined Source Integral
Equations [Boubendir,Bruno, Levadoux and. Turc,2013]. The Nystr\"om method that
we use for the discretization of the various integral equations under
consideration are based on global trigonometric approximations, splitting of
the kernels of integral operators into singular and smooth components, and
explicit quadratures of products of singular parts (logarithms) and
trigonometric polynomials. The discretization of the integral equations (2) and
(3) above requires special care as these formulations feature compositions of
boundary integral operators that are pseudodifferential operators of positive
and negative orders respectively. We deal with these compositions through
Calderon's calculus and we establish the convergence of fully discrete
Nystr\"om methods in appropriate Sobolev spaces which implies pointwise
convergence of the discrete solutions. In the case of analytic boundaries, we
establish superalgebraic convergence of the method.
