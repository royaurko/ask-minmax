The problem of linking the structure of a finite linear dynamical system with
its dynamics is well understood when the phase space is a vector space over a
finite field. The cycle structure of such a system can be described by the
elementary divisors of the linear function, and the problem of determining
whether the system is a fixed point system can be answered by computing and
factoring the system's characteristic polynomial and minimal polynomial. It has
become clear recently that the study of finite linear dynamical systems must be
extended to embrace finite rings. The difficulty of dealing with an arbitrary
finite commutative ring is that it lacks of unique factorization. In this
paper, an efficient algorithm is provided for analyzing the cycle structure of
a linear dynamical system over a finite commutative ring. In particular, for a
given commutative ring $R$ such that $|R|=q$, where $q$ is a positive integer,
the algorithm determines whether a given linear system over $R^n$ is a fixed
point system or not in time $O(n^3\log(n\log(q)))$.
