Recent work in machine learning for information extraction has focused on two
distinct sub-problems: the conventional problem of filling template slots from
natural language text, and the problem of wrapper induction, learning simple
extraction procedures ("wrappers") for highly structured text such as Web
pages. For suitable regular domains, existing wrapper induction algorithms can
efficiently learn wrappers that are simple and highly accurate, but the
regularity bias of these algorithms makes them unsuitable for most conventional
information extraction tasks. This paper describes a new approach for wrapping
semistructured Web pages. The wrapper is capable of learning how to extract
relevant information from Web resources on the basis of user supplied examples.
It is based on inductive learning techniques as well as fuzzy logic rules.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves noticeably better
precision and recall coefficient performance measures than SoftMealy, which is
one of the most recently reported wrappers capable of wrapping semi-structured
Web pages with missing attributes, multiple attributes, variant attribute
permutations, exceptions, and typos.
