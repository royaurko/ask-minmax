Previously published lattice results for QCD at $\mu_B\neq0$ are compared to
analytic predictions for phase quenched QCD. We observe that the strength of
the sign problem in QCD is linked directly to the position of the phase
transition line for pion condensation in phase quenched QCD and that the number
of terms needed in the Taylor expansion approach depends on the strength of the
sign problem. Together this emphasizes the physical importance of the sign
problem and helps to clarify the range over which the Taylor expansion approach
is practically applicable. Finally, we observe that the positions of the
endpoint of the first order chiral phase transition in the QCD phase diagram
found in two successive computations by Fodor and Katz are both close to the
position of the phase transition line for pion condensation in phase quenched
QCD.
