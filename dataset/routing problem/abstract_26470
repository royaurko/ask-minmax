A problem of distributed state estimation at multiple agents that are
physically connected and have competitive interests is mapped to a distributed
source coding problem with additional privacy constraints. The agents interact
to estimate their own states to a desired fidelity from their (sensor)
measurements which are functions of both the local state and the states at the
other agents. For a Gaussian state and measurement model, it is shown that the
sum-rate achieved by a distributed protocol in which the agents broadcast to
one another is a lower bound on that of a centralized protocol in which the
agents broadcast as if to a virtual CEO converging only in the limit of a large
number of agents. The sufficiency of encoding using local measurements is also
proved for both protocols.
