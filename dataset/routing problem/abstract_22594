Recent work has made it clear that the ``standard model'' of pulsar radio
emission cannot be the full answer. Some fundamental assumptions about the
magnetic field and plasma flow in the radio-loud region have been called into
question by recent observational and theoretical work, but the solutions to the
problems posed are far from clear. It is time to formulate and carry out new
observational campaigns designed to address these problems; sensitive
low-frequency observations will an important part of such a campaign. Because
pulsars are strong at low frequencies, we believe there will be a good number
of candidates even for high-time-resolution single pulse work, as well as mean
profile and integrated spectrum measurements. Such data can push the envelope
of current models, test competing theories of the radio loud region, and
possibly provide direct measures of the state of the emitting plasma.
