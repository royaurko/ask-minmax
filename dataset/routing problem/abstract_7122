The determination of solutions of many inverse problems usually requires a
set of measurements which leads to solving systems of ill-posed equations. In
this paper we propose the Landweber iteration of Kaczmarz type with general
uniformly convex penalty functional. The method is formulated by using tools
from convex analysis. The penalty term is allowed to be non-smooth to include
the $L^1$ and total variation (TV) like penalty functionals, which are
significant in reconstructing special features of solutions such as sparsity
and piecewise constancy in practical applications. Under reasonable conditions,
we establish the convergence of the method. Finally we present numerical
simulations on tomography problems and parameter identification in partial
differential equations to indicate the performance.
