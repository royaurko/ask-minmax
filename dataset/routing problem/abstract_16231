We study the computational complexity of the Word Problem (WP) in free
solvable groups $S_{r,d}$, where $r \geq 2$ is the rank and $d \geq 2$ is the
solvability class of the group. It is known that the Magnus embedding of
$S_{r,d}$ into matrices provides a polynomial time decision algorithm for WP in
a fixed group $S_{r,d}$. Unfortunately, the degree of the polynomial grows
together with $d$, so the uniform algorithm is not polynomial in $d$. In this
paper we show that WP has time complexity $O(r n \log_2 n)$ in $S_{r,2}$, and
$O(n^3 r d)$ in $S_{r,d}$ for $d \geq 3$. However, it turns out, that a
seemingly close problem of computing the geodesic length of elements in
$S_{r,2}$ is $NP$-complete. We prove also that one can compute Fox derivatives
of elements from $S_{r,d}$ in time $O(n^3 r d)$, in particular one can use
efficiently the Magnus embedding in computations with free solvable groups. Our
approach is based on such classical tools as the Magnus embedding and Fox
calculus, as well as, on a relatively new geometric ideas, in particular, we
establish a direct link between Fox derivatives and geometric flows on Cayley
graphs.
