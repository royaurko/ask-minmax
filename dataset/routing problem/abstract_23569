A short review of the problems with the action for massive gravitons is
presented. We show that consistency problems could be resolved by employing
spontaneous symmetry breaking to give masses to gravitons. The idea is then
generalized by enlarging the SL(2,C) symmetry to $SL(2N,C)x SL(2N,C) which is
broken to $SL(2,C) spontaneously through a non-linear realization. The
requirement that the space-time metric is generated dynamically forces the
action constructed to be a four-form. It is shown that the spectrum of this
model consists of two sets of massive matrix gravitons in the adjoint
representation of SU(N) and thus are colored, as well as two singlets, one
describing a massive graviton, the other being the familiar massless graviton.
