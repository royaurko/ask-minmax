We present an exact three-dimensional wave solution to the shearing sheet
equations of motion. The existence of this solution argues against transient
amplification as a route to turbulence in unmagnetized disks. Moreover, because
the solution covers an extensive dynamical range in wavenumber space, it is an
excellent test of the dissipative properties of numerical codes.
