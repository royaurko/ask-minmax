We propose a model for unilateral contact with adhesion between a
viscoelastic body and a rigid support, encompassing thermal and frictional
effects. Following the approach by M. Fremond, adhesion is described in terms
of a surface damage parameter. The main result of the paper states the
existence of global solutions to the associated Cauchy problem. It is proved by
passing to the limit in a carefully tailored approximate problem, via
variational techniques.
