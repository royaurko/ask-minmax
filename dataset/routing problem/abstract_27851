This paper focuses on the specific problem of big data classification in a
Bayesian setup using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. It discusses the
challenges presented by the big data problems associated with classification
and the existing methods to handle them. Next, a new method based on two-stage
Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm is proposed in this context. The purpose of
of this algorithm is to reduce the exact likelihood computational cost in the
big data context. In the first stage, a new proposal is tested by the
approximate likelihood based model. The full likelihood based posterior
computation will be conducted only if the proposal passes the first stage
screening. Furthermore, this method is adopted into the consensus Monte Carlo
framework. Methods are illustrated on two large datasets.
