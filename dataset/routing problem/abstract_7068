The paper deals with the study of a satellite attracted by n primary bodies,
which form a relative equilibrium. We use orthogonal degree to prove global
bifurcation of planar and spatial periodic solutions from the equilibria of the
satellite. In particular, we analyze the restricted three body problem and the
problem of a satellite attracted by the Maxwell's ring relative equilibrium.
