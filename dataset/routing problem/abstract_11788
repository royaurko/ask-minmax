Two novel classes of many-body models with nonlinear interactions "of
goldfish type" are introduced. They are solvable provided the initial data
satisfy a single constraint (in one case; in the other, two constraints): i.
e., for such initial data the solution of their initial-value problem can be
achieved via algebraic operations, such as finding the eigenvalues of given
matrices or equivalently the zeros of known polynomials. Entirely isochronous
versions of some of these models are also exhibited: i.e., versions of these
models whose nonsingular solutions are all completely periodic with the same
period.
