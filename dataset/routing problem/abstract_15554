Using a momentum representation of a magnetic von Neumann lattice, we study a
two-dimensional electron in a uniform magnetic field and obtain one-particle
spectra of various periodic short-range potential problems in the lowest Landau
level.We find that the energy spectra satisfy a duality relation between a
period of the potential and a magnetic length. The energy spectra consist of
the Hofstadter-type bands and flat bands. We also study the connection between
a periodic short-range potential problem and a tight-binding model.
