The connection between spin and symmetry was established by Wigner in his
1939 paper on the Poincar\'e group. For a massive particle at rest, the little
group is O(3) from which the concept of spin emerges. The little group for a
massless particle is isomorphic to the two-dimensional Euclidean group with one
rotational and two translational degrees of freedom. The rotational degree
corresponds to the helicity, and the translational degrees to the gauge degree
of freedom. The question then is whether these two different symmetries can be
united. Another hard-pressing problem is Feynman's parton picture which is
valid only for hadrons moving with speed close to that of light. While the
hadron at rest is believed to be a bound state of quarks, the question arises
whether the parton picture is a Lorentz-boosted bound state of quarks. We study
these problems within Einstein's framework in which the energy-momentum
relations for slow particles and fast particles are two different
manifestations one covariant entity.
