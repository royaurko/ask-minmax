We present a Maximum Entropy method (MEM) for obtaining dynamical spectra
from Quantum Monte Carlo data which have a sign problem. By relating the sign
fluctuations to the norm of the spectra, our method properly treats the
correlations between the measured quantities and the sign. The method greatly
improves the quality and the resolution of the spectra, enabling it to produce
good spectra even for poorly conditioned data where standard MEM fails.
