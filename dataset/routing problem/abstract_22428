We study computational aspects of the General Position Subset Selection
problem defined as follows: Given a set of points in the plane, find a
maximum-cardinality subset of points in general position. We prove that General
Position Subset Selection is NP-hard, APX-hard, and give several
fixed-parameter tractability results.
