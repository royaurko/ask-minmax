A secure set $S$ in a graph is defined as a set of vertices such that for any
$X \subseteq S$ the majority of vertices in the neighborhood of $X$ belongs to
$S$. It is known that deciding whether a set $S$ is secure in a graph is
co-NP-complete. However, it is still open how this result contributes to the
actual complexity of deciding whether for a given graph $G$ and integer $k$, a
non-empty secure set for $G$ of size at most $k$ exists. While membership in
the class $\Sigma^P_2$ is rather easy to see for this existence problem,
showing $\Sigma^P_2$-hardness is quite involved. In this paper, we provide such
a hardness result, hence classifying the secure set existence problem as
$\Sigma^P_2$-complete. We do so by first showing hardness for a variant of the
problem, which we then reduce step-by-step to secure set existence. In total,
we obtain eight new completeness results for different variants of the secure
set existence problem.
