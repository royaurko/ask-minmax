nonegative matrix factorization (NMF) for data representation problems.
NMF,whichtriestorepresentanonnegativedatamatrixasaproductoftwolowrank
nonnegative matrices, has been a popular method for data representation due to
its ability to explore the latent part-based structure of data. Recent study
shows that lots of data distributions have manifold structures, and we should
respect the manifold structure when the data are represented. Recently,
manifold regularized NMF used a nearest neighbor graph to regulate the learning
of factorization parameter matrices and has shown its advantage over
traditional NMF methods for data representation problems. However, how to
construct an optimal graph to present the manifold prop- erly remains a
difficultproblem due to the graph modelselection, noisy features, and nonlinear
distributed data. In this chapter, we introduce three effective methods to
solve these problems of graph construction for manifold regularized NMF.
Multiple graph learning is proposed to solve the problem of graph model
selection, adaptive graph learning via feature selection is proposed to solve
the problem of constructing a graph from noisy features, while multi-kernel
learning-based graph construction is used to solve the problem of learning a
graph from nonlinearly distributed data.
