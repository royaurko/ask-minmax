Providing adequate tools to tackle the problem of inconsistent compliance
rules is a critical research topic. This problem is of paramount importance to
achieve automatic support for early declarative design and to support evolution
of rules in contract-based or service-based systems. In this paper we
investigate the problem of extracting temporal unsatisfiable cores in order to
detect the inconsistent part of a specification. We extend conflict-driven
SAT-solver to provide a new conflict-driven depth-first-search solver for
temporal logic. We use this solver to compute LTL unsatisfiable cores without
re-exploring the history of the solver.
