We study the complexity of the maximum coverage problem, restricted to set
systems of bounded VC-dimension. Our main result is a fixed-parameter tractable
approximation scheme: an algorithm that outputs a $(1-\eps)$-approximation to
the maximum-cardinality union of $k$ sets, in running time $O(f(\eps,k,d)\cdot
poly(n))$ where $n$ is the problem size, $d$ is the VC-dimension of the set
system, and $f(\eps,k,d)$ is exponential in $(kd/\eps)^c$ for some constant
$c$. We complement this positive result by showing that the function
$f(\eps,k,d)$ in the running-time bound cannot be replaced by a function
depending only on $(\eps,d)$ or on $(k,d)$, under standard complexity
assumptions.
  We also present an improved upper bound on the approximation ratio of the
greedy algorithm in special cases of the problem, including when the sets have
bounded cardinality and when they are two-dimensional halfspaces. Complementing
these positive results, we show that when the sets are four-dimensional
halfspaces neither the greedy algorithm nor local search is capable of
improving the worst-case approximation ratio of $1-1/e$ that the greedy
algorithm achieves on arbitrary instances of maximum coverage.
