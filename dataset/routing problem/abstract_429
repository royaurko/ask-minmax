The verification of topological superconductivity has become a major
experimental challenge. Apart from the very few spin-triplet superconductors
with p-wave pairing symmetry, another candidate system is a conventional,
two-dimensional (2D) s-wave superconductor in a magnetic field with a
sufficiently strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Typically, the required
magnetic field to convert the superconductor into a topologically non-trivial
state is however by far larger than the upper critical field H_c2, which
excludes its realization. In this article, we argue that this problem can be
overcome by rotating the magnetic field into the superconducting plane. We
explore the character of the superconducting state upon changing the strength
and the orientation of the magnetic field and show that a topological state,
established for a sufficiently strong out-of-plane magnetic field, indeed
extends to an in-plane field orientation. We present a three-band model
applicable to the superconducting interface between LaAlO_3 and SrTiO_3, which
should fulfil the necessary conditions to realize a topological superconductor.
