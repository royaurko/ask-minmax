We consider solutions to the Cauchy problem for the incompressible Euler
equations on the 3-dimensional torus which are continuous or H\"older
continuous for any exponent $\theta<\frac{1}{16}$. Using the techniques
introduced in \cite{DS12} and \cite{DS12H}, we prove the existence of
infinitely many (H\"older) continuous initial vector fields starting from which
there exist infinitely many (H\"older) continuous solutions with preassigned
total kinetic energy.
