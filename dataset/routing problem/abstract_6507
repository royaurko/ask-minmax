In this paper we study the fault codiagnosis problem for discrete event
systems given by finite automata (FA) and timed systems given by timed automata
(TA). We provide a uniform characterization of codiagnosability for FA and TA
which extends the necessary and sufficient condition that characterizes
diagnosability. We also settle the complexity of the codiagnosability problems
both for FA and TA and show that codiagnosability is PSPACE-complete in both
cases. For FA this improves on the previously known bound (EXPTIME) and for TA
it is a new result. Finally we address the codiagnosis problem for TA under
bounded resources and show it is 2EXPTIME-complete.
