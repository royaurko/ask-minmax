We investigate the behavior of the divisor function in both short intervals
and in arithmetic progressions. The latter problem was recently studied by \'E.
Fouvry, S. Ganguly, E. Kowalski, and Ph. Michel. We prove a complementary
result to their main theorem. We also show that in short intervals of certain
lengths the divisor function has a Gaussian limiting distribution. The
analogous problems for Hecke eigenvalues are also considered.
