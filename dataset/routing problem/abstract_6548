We study the metric properties of finite subsets of L_1. The analysis of such
metrics is central to a number of important algorithmic problems involving the
cut structure of weighted graphs, including the Sparsest Cut Problem, one of
the most compelling open problems in the field of approximation algorithms.
Additionally, many open questions in geometric non-linear functional analysis
involve the properties of finite subsets of L_1.
