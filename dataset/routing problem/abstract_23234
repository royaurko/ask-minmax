I advocate the virtues of a very economical version of the minimal
supersymmetric standard model which avoids cosmological problems often
encountered in dynamical SUSY-breaking and solves the SUSY-CP problem. Imposing
$m_Z=91$ GeV and $m_t \sim 175$ GeV implies that scalar masses are generally
$100-200$ GeV. The gluino and photino are massless at tree level. At 1-loop,
the gluino mass is predicted to be in the range $m_{\gluino}: 100 - 600$ MeV
and the photino mass can be estimated to be $m_{\photino}: 100 - 1400$ MeV. New
hadrons with mass $\sim 1 \frac{1}{2}$ GeV are predicted and described. The
``extra'' flavor singlet pseudoscalar observed in two experiments in the
$\iota(1440)$ region, if confirmed, is naturally interpreted as the state which
gets its mass via the QCD anomaly. Its superpartner, a gluon-gluino bound
state, generally has a lifetime longer than $5~10^{-11}$ sec and would not have
shown up in existing searches. Search strategies and other consequences of the
scenario are discussed.
