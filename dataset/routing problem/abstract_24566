We investigate the magic number problem, that is, the question whether there
exists a minimal n-state nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) whose
equivalent minimal deterministic finite automaton (DFA) has alpha states, for
all n and alpha satisfying n less or equal to alpha less or equal to exp(2,n).
A number alpha not satisfying this condition is called a magic number (for n).
It was shown in [11] that no magic numbers exist for general regular languages,
while in [5] trivial and non-trivial magic numbers for unary regular languages
were identified. We obtain similar results for automata accepting subregular
languages like, for example, combinational languages, star-free, prefix-,
suffix-, and infix-closed languages, and prefix-, suffix-, and infix-free
languages, showing that there are only trivial magic numbers, when they exist.
For finite languages we obtain some partial results showing that certain
numbers are non-magic.
