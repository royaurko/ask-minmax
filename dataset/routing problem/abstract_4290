The CP violation gives rise to severe restriction of soft breaking terms in
supersymmetric standard models. Among them, constraints on the holomorphic soft
mass of Higgs doublets (the B parameter) are difficult to satisfy due to the
other inherent problem in the Higgs potential; the mu problem. In this letter,
it is argued that these CP and mu problems can be rather relaxed provided that
B is vanishing at high-energy scale. A generic mechanism and some examples of
model are presented to dynamically realize this condition by introducing gauge
singlet fields.
