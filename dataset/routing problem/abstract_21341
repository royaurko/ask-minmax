Based on the recent study on the Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system with general
angular cutoff potentials [3, 4], we establish in this paper the global
existence of classical solutions to the Cauchy problem of the
Vlasov-Poisson-Landau system that includes the Coulomb potential. This then
provides a different approach on this topic from the recent work [8].
