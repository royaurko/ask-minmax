Graph G is the square of graph H if two vertices x,y have an edge in G if and
only if x,y are of distance at most two in H. Given H it is easy to compute its
square H^2. Determining if a given graph G is the square of some graph is not
easy in general. Motwani and Sudan proved that it is NP-complete to determine
if a given graph G is the square of some graph. The graph introduced in their
reduction is a graph that contains many triangles and is relatively dense.
Farzad et al. proved the NP-completeness for finding a square root for girth 4
while they gave a polynomial time algorithm for computing a square root of
girth at least six. Adamaszek and Adamaszek proved that if a graph has a square
root of girth six then this square root is unique up to isomorphism. In this
paper we consider the characterization and recognition problem of graphs that
are square of graphs of girth at least five. We introduce a family of graphs
with exponentially many non-isomorphic square roots, and as the main result of
this paper we prove that the square root finding problem is NP-complete for
square roots of girth five. This proof is providing the complete dichotomy
theorem for square root problem in terms of the girth of the square roots.
