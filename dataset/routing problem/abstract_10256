Einstein's first mention of the uniformly rotating disk in print was in 1912,
in his paper dealing with the static gravitational fields. After the 1912
paper, the rotating disk problem occurred in Einstein's writings only in a 1916
review paper, "The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity". Einstein
did not mention the rotating disk problem in any of his papers on gravitation
theory from 1912 until 1916. However, between 1912 and 1914 Einstein invoked
the Hole Argument. I discuss the possible connection between the 1912 rotating
disk problem and the Hole Argument and the connection between the 1916 rotating
disk problem and the Point Coincident Argument. Finally, according to Mach's
ideas we see that the possibility of an empty hole is unacceptable. In 1916
Einstein replaced the Hole Argument with the Point Coincidence Argument and
later in 1918 with Mach's principle.
