We ask if it is possible to find some particular continuous paths of unit
length in linear Brownian motion. Beginning with a discrete version of the
problem, we derive the asymptotics of the expected waiting time for several
interesting patterns. These suggest corresponding results on the
existence/non-existence of continuous paths embedded in Brownian motion. With
further effort we are able to prove some of these existence and non-existence
results by various stochastic analysis arguments. A list of open problems is
presented.
