Quasi-stationary (i.e. parametric) transitions from rotating equilibrium
configurations of fluid bodies to rotating black holes are discussed. For the
idealized model of a rotating disc of dust, analytical results derived by means
of the "inverse scattering method" are available. They are generalized by
numerical results for rotating fluid rings with various equations of state. It
can be shown rigorously that a black hole limit of a fluid body in equilibrium
occurs if and only if the gravitational mass becomes equal to twice the product
of angular velocity and angular momentum. Therefore, any quasi-stationary route
from fluid bodies to black holes passes through the extreme Kerr solution.
