In this paper we present a MATLAB version of a non-standard finite difference
scheme for the numerical solution of the perpetual American put option models
of financial markets. These models can be derived from the celebrated
Black-Scholes models letting the time goes to infinity. The considered problem
is a free boundary problem defined on a semi-infinite interval, so that it is a
non-linear problem complicated by a boundary condition at infinity. By using
non-uniform maps, we show how it is possible to apply the boundary condition at
infinity exactly. Moreover, we define a posteriori error estimator that is
based on Richardson's classical extrapolation theory. Our finite difference
scheme and error estimator are favourably tested for a simple problem with a
known exact analytical solution.
