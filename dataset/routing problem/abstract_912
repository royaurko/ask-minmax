The changes in the electronic structure of V2O3 across the metal-insulator
transition induced by temperature, doping and pressure are identified using
high resolution x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the V pre K-edge. Contrary to
what has been taken for granted so far, the metallic phase reached under
pressure is shown to differ from the one obtained by changing doping or
temperature. Using a novel computational scheme, we relate this effect to the
role and occupancy of the a1g orbitals. This finding unveils the inequivalence
of different routes across the Mott transition in V2O3
