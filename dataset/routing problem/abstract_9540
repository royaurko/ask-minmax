An iterative solution method for fully nonlinear boundary value problems
governing self-similar flows with a free boundary is presented. Specifically,
the method is developed for application to water entry problems, which can be
studied under the assumptions of an ideal and incompressible fluid with
negligible gravity and surface tension effects. The approach is based on a
pseudo time stepping procedure, which uses a boundary integral equation method
for the solution of the Laplace problem governing the velocity potential at
each iteration. In order to demonstrate the flexibility and the capabilities of
the approach, several applications are presented: the classical wedge entry
problem, which is also used for a validation of the approach, the block sliding
along an inclined sea bed, the vertical water entry of a flat plate and the
ditching of an inclined plate. The solution procedure is also applied to cases
in which the body surface is either porous or perforated. Comparisons with
numerical or experimental data available in literature are presented for the
purpose of validation.
