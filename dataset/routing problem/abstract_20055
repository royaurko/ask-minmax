We reanalyze the problem of particle creation in a 3+1 spatially closed
Robertson-Walker space-time. We compute the total number of particles produced
by this non-stationary gravitational background as well as the corresponding
total energy and find a slight discrepancy between our results and those
recently obtained in the literature
