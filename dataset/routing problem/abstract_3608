The problem of estimating multiple trajectories from unlabeled data comprises
two coupled problems. The first is a data association problem: how to map data
points onto individual trajectories. The second is, given a solution to the
data association problem, to estimate those trajectories. We construct
estimators as a solution to a variational problem which uses smoothing splines
under a $k$-means like framework and show that, as the number of data points
increases, we have stability. More precisely, we show that these estimators
converge weakly in an appropriate Sobolev space with probability one.
Furthermore, we show that the estimators converge in probability with rate
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ in the $L^2$ norm (strongly).
