We find a class of solutions of the sixth Painleve' equation appearing in the
theory of WDVV equations. This class covers almost all the monodromy data
associated to the equation, except one point in the space of the data. We find
the critical behavior close to the critical points in terms of two parameters
and solve the connection problem.
  We also study the critical behavior of Painleve' transcendents in the
Elliptic representation.
