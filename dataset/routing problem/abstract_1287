We study a Simple Route for constructing the higher order
Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson theory - both supersymmetry transformations and
Lagrangian - starting from knowledge of only the $10$-dimensional Super Yang
Mills Fermion Supersymmetry transformation. We are able to uniquely determine
the four-derivative order corrected supersymmetry transformations, to lowest
non-trivial order in Fermions, for the most general three-algebra theory. For
the special case of Euclidean three-algbera, we reproduce the result presented
in arXiv:$1207.1208$, with significantly less labour. In addition, we apply our
method to calculate the quadratic fermion terms in the higher order BLG fermion
supersymmetry transformation.
