We present a branch and bound method for maximizing an arbitrary set function
h mapping 2^V to R. By decomposing h as f-g, where f is a submodular function
and g is the cut function of a (simple, undirected) graph G with vertex set V,
our original problem is reduced to a sequence of submodular maximization
problems. We characterize a class of submodular functions, which when maximized
in the subproblems, lead the algorithm to converge to a global maximizer of
f-g. Two "natural" members of this class are analyzed; the first yields
polynomially-solvable subproblems, the second, which requires less branching,
yields NP-hard subproblems but is amenable to a polynomial-time approximation
algorithm. These results are extended to problems where the solution is
constrained to be a member of a subset system. Structural properties of the
maximizer of f-g are also proved.
