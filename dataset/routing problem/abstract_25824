We investigate the problem of determining a set S of k indistinguishable
integers in the range [1,n]. The algorithm is allowed to query an integer $q\in
[1,n]$, and receive a response comparing this integer to an integer randomly
chosen from S. The algorithm has no control over which element of S the query q
is compared to. We show tight bounds for this problem. In particular, we show
that in the natural regime where $k\le n$, the optimal number of queries to
attain $n^{-\Omega(1)}$ error probability is $\Theta(k^3 \log n)$. In the
regime where $k>n$, the optimal number of queries is $\Theta(n^2 k \log n)$.
  Our main technical tools include the use of information theory to derive the
lower bounds, and the application of noisy binary search in the spirit of
Feige, Raghavan, Peleg, and Upfal (1994). In particular, our lower bound
technique is likely to be applicable in other situations that involve search
under uncertainty.
