Nanoporous anatase TiO2 rods and rutile TiO2 chrysanthemums were successfully
synthesized via a simple ethylene glycol-mediated synthesis route. Their
morphologies, phase compositions and components were characterized by SEM, TEM,
Raman and IR, respectively. The results show that a self-assembly growth takes
place in the calcination under vacuum, which makes the titanium glycolate rods
transform into rutile TiO2/C chrysanthemums rather than anatase TiO2 rods. It
also indicates that the carbon plays an important role in the phase transition
process which promotes the phase transition to rutile TiO2 at a lower
temperature (400 oC). It provides a new approach to prepare nanoporous rutile
TiO2 nanomaterials under low temperature.
