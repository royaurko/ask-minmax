Let A be a set of nonnegative integers. For every nonnegative integer n and
positive integer h, let r_{A}(n,h) denote the number of representations of n in
the form n = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_h, where a_1, a_2,..., a_h are elements of A
and a_1 \leq a_2 \leq ... \leq a_h. The infinite set A is called a basis of
order h if r_{A}(n,h) \geq 1 for every nonnegative integer n. Erdos and Turan
conjectured that limsup_{n\to\infty} r_A(n,2) = \infty for every basis A of
order 2. This paper introduces a new class of additive bases and a general
additive problem, a special case of which is the Erdos-Turan conjecture.
Konig's lemma on the existence of infinite paths in certain graphs is used to
prove that this general problem is equivalent to a related problem about finite
sets of nonnegative integers.
