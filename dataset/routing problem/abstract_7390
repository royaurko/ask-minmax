This paper considers the problem of recovering the delays and amplitudes of a
positive superposition of pulses. This problem is motivated by a variety of
applications such as single-molecule microscopy. We show that for univariate
and bivariate stream of pulses, the recovery error of a tractable convex
optimization problem is proportional to the noise level. The recovery error
also depends on the localization properties of the pulse and on the
Rayleigh-regularity of the signal's support, namely, the maximal number of
delays within a resolution cell. We demonstrate by numerical experiments that
the recovery is robust to additive noise.
