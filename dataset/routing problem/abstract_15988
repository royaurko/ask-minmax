During the past several years the contributors have developed a new approach to
the teaching of Physical Science, a general education course typically found in
the curricula of nearly every college and university. This approach, called
`Physics in Films', uses scenes from popular movies to illustrate physical
principles and has excited student interest and improved student performance.
  The analyses of many of the scenes in `Physics in Films' are a direct
application of Fermi calculations -- estimates and approximations designed to
make solutions of complex and seemingly intractable problems understandable to
the student non-specialist. The intent of this paper is to provide instructors
with examples they can use to develop skill in recognizing Fermi problems and
making Fermi calculations in their own courses.
