A general description is given of a process of formation of an emf in a
medium with nonequilibrium carriers. The appearance of anomalous emfs is
predicted for several semiconductor structures. Such emfs appear as a result of
photogeneration of the majority carriers or, for example, due to homogeneous
heating of electrons and holes along the whole circuit. An analysis is made of
the problem of determination of an emf inside a multicomponent medium and of
recording it in an external circuit.
