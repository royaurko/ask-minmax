A truncated moment sequence (tms) of degree d is a vector indexed by
monomials whose degree is at most d. Let K be a semialgebraic set.The truncated
K-moment problem (TKMP) is: when does a tms y admit a positive Borel measure
supported? This paper proposes a semidefinite programming (SDP) approach for
solving TKMP. When K is compact, we get the following results: whether a tms y
of degree d admits a K-measure or notcan be checked via solving a sequence of
SDP problems; when y admits no K-measure, a certificate will be given; when y
admits a K-measure, a representing measure for y would be obtained from solving
the SDP under some necessary and some sufficient conditions. Moreover, we also
propose a practical SDP method for finding flat extensions, which in our
numerical experiments always finds a finitely atomic representing measure for a
tms when it admits one.
