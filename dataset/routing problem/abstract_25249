In this paper we establish local well-posedness of the KP-I problem, with
initial data small in the intersection of the natural energy space with the
space of functions which are square integrable when multiplied by the weight y.
The result is proved by the contraction mapping principle. A similar (but
slightly weaker) result was the main Theorem in the paper " Low regularity
solutions for the Kadomstev-Petviashvili I equation " by Colliander, Kenig and
Staffilani (GAFA 13 (2003),737-794 and math.AP/0204244). Ionescu found a
counterexample (included in the present paper) to the main estimate used in the
GAFA paper, which renders incorrect the proof there. The present paper thus
provides a correct proof of a strengthened version of the main result in the
GAFA paper.
