In this paper a Blaschke-Santal\'o diagram involving the area, the perimeter
and the elastic energy of planar convex bodies is considered. More precisely we
give a description of set $$\mathcal{E}:=\left\{(x,y)\in \R^2, x=\frac{4\pi
A(\Omega)}{P(\Omega)^2},y=\frac{E(\Omega)P(\Omega)}{2\pi^2},\,\Omega\mbox{convex}
\right\},$$ where $A$ is the area, $P$ is the perimeter and $E$ is the elastic
energy, that is a Willmore type energy in the plane. In order to do this, we
investigate the following shape optimization problem:
$$\min_{\Omega\in\mathcal{C}}\{E(\Omega)+\mu A(\Omega)\},$$ where $\mathcal{C}$
is the class of convex bodies with fixed perimeter and $\mu\ge 0$ is a
parameter. Existence, regularity and geometric properties of solutions to this
minimum problem are shown.
