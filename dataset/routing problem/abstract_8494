At a conference in Debrecen in October 2010 Nathanson announced some results
concerning the arithmetic diameters of certain sets. He proposed some related
results on the representation of integers by sums or differences of powers of 2
and 3. In this note we prove some results on this problem and the more general
problem about the representation by linear combinations of powers of some fixed
integers.
