This paper discusses limitations of reflexive and diagonal arguments as
methods of proof of limitative theorems (e.g. G\"odel's theorem on
Entscheidungsproblem, Turing's halting problem or Chaitin-G\"odel's theorem).
The fact, that a formal system contains a sentence, which introduces
reflexitivity, does not imply, that the same system does not contain a sentence
or a proof procedure which solves this problem. Second basic method of proof -
diagonal argument (i.e. showing non-eqiunumerosity of a program set with the
set of real numbers) does not exclude existance of a single program, capable of
computing all real numbers. In this work, we suggest an algorithm generating
real numbers (arbitrary, infinite in the limit, binary strings), and we
speculate it's meaning for theoretical computer science.
