In this paper, the problem of communicating using chemical messages
propagating using Brownian motion, rather than electromagnetic messages
propagating as waves in free space or along a wire, is considered. This problem
is motivated by nanotechnological and biotechnological applications, where the
energy cost of electromagnetic communication might be prohibitive. Models are
given for communication using particles that propagate with Brownian motion,
and achievable capacity results are given. Under conservative assumptions, it
is shown that rates exceeding one bit per particle are achievable.
