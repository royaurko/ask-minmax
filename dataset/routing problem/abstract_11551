Caro and Yuster (Electronic J.Comb 7 (2000)) studied a generalization of the
Turan problem, where a certain function (instead of the size) of an F-free
graph of order n has to be maximized. We prove that for a wide class of
functions the asymptotics of the maximum is given by complete partite graphs.
