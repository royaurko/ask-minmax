Efficiency and simplicity of random algorithms have made them a lucrative
alternative for solving complex problems in the domain of communication
networks. This paper presents a random algorithm for handling the routing
problem in Mobile Ad hoc Networks [MANETS].The performance of most existing
routing protocols for MANETS degrades in terms of packet delay and congestion
caused as the number of mobile nodes increases beyond a certain level or their
speed passes a certain level. As the network becomes more and more dynamic,
congestion in network increases due to control packets generated by the routing
protocols in the process of route discovery and route maintenance. Most of this
congestion is due to flooding mechanism used in protocols like AODV and DSDV
for the purpose of route discovery and route maintenance or for route discovery
as in the case of DSR protocol. This paper introduces the concept of random
routing algorithm that neither maintains a routing table nor floods the entire
network as done by various known protocols thereby reducing the load on network
in terms of number of control packets in a highly dynamic scenario. This paper
calculates the expected run time of the designed random algorithm.
