In the present work, we propose to investigate the Fekete-Szeg\"o
inequalities certain classes of analytic and bi-univalent functions defined by
subordination. The results in the bounds of the third coefficient which improve
many known results concerning different classes of bi-univalent functions. Some
interesting applications of the results presented here are also discussed.
