Given a program and a time deadline, does the program finish before the
deadline when executed on a given platform? With the requirement to produce a
test case when such a violation can occur, we refer to this problem as the
worst-case execution-time testing (WCETT) problem.
  In this paper, we present an approach for solving the WCETT problem for
loop-free programs by timing the execution of a program on a small number of
carefully calculated inputs. We then create a sequence of integer linear
programs the solutions of which encode the best timing model consistent with
the measurements. By solving the programs we can find the worst-case input as
well as estimate execution time of any other input. Our solution is more
accurate than previous approaches and, unlikely previous work, by increasing
the number of measurements we can produce WCETT bounds up to any desired
accuracy.
  Timing of a program depends on the properties of the platform it executes on.
We further show how our approach can be used to quantify the timing
repeatability of the underlying platform.
