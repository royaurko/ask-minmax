It is postulated that the action of the FRW-universe is the cosmological term
of Einsteins theory (no curvature term - R0 Cosmology). The expansion equation
emerging from the embedding of this most simple brane world with variable speed
of light is deduced. The universal dimensionless coupling constant of gravity
is addressed. Some implications on the deep problems of cosmology are
discussed.
