We study initial-boundary value problems for linear evolution equations of
arbitrary spatial order, subject to arbitrary linear boundary conditions and
posed on a rectangular 1-space, 1-time domain. We give a new characterisation
of the boundary conditions that specify well-posed problems using Fokas'
transform method. We also give a sufficient condition guaranteeing that the
solution can be represented using a series.
  The relevant condition, the analyticity at infinity of certain meromorphic
functions within particular sectors, is significantly more concrete and easier
to test than the previous criterion, based on the existence of admissible
functions.
