In this paper, we consider several property testing problems and ask how the
query complexity depends on the distance parameter $\eps$. We achieve new lower
bounds in this setting for the problems of testing whether a function is
monotone and testing whether the function has low Fourier degree. For
monotonicity testing, our lower bound matches the recent upper bound of
Chakrabarty and Seshadhri.
