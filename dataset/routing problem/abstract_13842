We give relatively simple sufficient conditions on a Fourier multiplier, so
that it maps functions with the H$\ddot{o}$lder property with respect to a part
of the variables to functions with the H$o$lder property with respect to all
variables. With the using of these sufficient conditions we prove the
solvability in H$\ddot{o}$lder classes of the initial-boundary value problems
for the linearized Cahn-Hilliard equation with dynamic boundary conditions of
two types. For the solutions of these problems Schauder estimates are obtained.
