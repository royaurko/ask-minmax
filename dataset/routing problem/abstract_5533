Recent techniques for inferring business relationships between ASs have
yielded maps that have extremely few invalid BGP paths in the terminology of
Gao. However, some relationships inferred by these newer algorithms are
incorrect, leading to the deduction of unrealistic AS hierarchies. We
investigate this problem and discover what causes it. Having obtained such
insight, we generalize the problem of AS relationship inference as a
multiobjective optimization problem with node-degree-based corrections to the
original objective function of minimizing the number of invalid paths. We solve
the generalized version of the problem using the semidefinite programming
relaxation of the MAX2SAT problem. Keeping the number of invalid paths small,
we obtain a more veracious solution than that yielded by recent heuristics.
