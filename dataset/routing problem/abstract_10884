A covariant Lagrangian formulation of a solution to the cosmological constant
problem, based on vizualising the fluctuations of the vacuum energy as a
non-equilibrium process with stochastic behaviour, is presented. The
variational principle yields equations of motion for the cosmological
``constant" $\Lambda$, treated as a dynamical field, together with an equation
for a Lagrange multiplier field $\phi$, and the standard Einstein field
equations with a variable cosmological constant term. A stochastic model of
$\Lambda$ yields a natural explanation for the smallness or zero value of the
constant in the present epoch and its large value in an era of inflation in the
early universe.
