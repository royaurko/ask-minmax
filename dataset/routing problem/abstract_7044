This paper constructs a certain planar four-body problem which exhibits fast
energy growth. The system considered is a quasi-periodic perturbation of the
Restricted Planar Circular three-body Problem (RPC3BP). Gelfreich-Turaev's and
de la Llave's mechanism is employed to obtain the fast energy growth. The
diffusion is created by a heteroclinic cycle formed by two Lyapunov periodic
orbits surrounding $L_1$ and $L_2$ Lagrangian points and their heteroclinic
intersections. Our model is the first known example in celestial mechanics of
the a priori chaotic case of Arnold diffusion.
