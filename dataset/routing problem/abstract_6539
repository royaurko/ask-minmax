The girth of a graph is the minimum weight of all simple cycles of the graph.
We study the problem of determining the girth of an n-node unweighted
undirected planar graph. The first non-trivial algorithm for the problem, given
by Djidjev, runs in O(n^{5/4} log n) time. Chalermsook, Fakcharoenphol, and
Nanongkai reduced the running time to O(n log^2 n). Weimann and Yuster further
reduced the running time to O(n log n). In this paper, we solve the problem in
O(n) time.
