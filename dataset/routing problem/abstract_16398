This paper present an overview of some of the applications of the martingale
inequalities of D.L. Burkholder to $L^p$-bounds for singular integral
operators, concentrating on the Hilbert transform, first and second order Riesz
transforms, the Beurling-Ahlfors operator and other multipliers obtained by
projections (conditional expectations) of transformations of stochastic
integrals. While martingale inequalities can be used to prove the boundedness
of a wider class of Calder\'on-Zygmund singular integrals, the aim of this
paper is to show results which give optimal or near optimal bounds in the
norms, hence our restriction to the above operators.
  Connections of Burkholder's foundational work on sharp martingale
inequalities to other areas of mathematics where either the results themselves
or techniques to prove them have become of considerable interest in recent
years, are discussed. These include the 1952 conjecture of C.B. Morrey on
rank-one convex and quasiconvex functions with connections to problems in the
calculus of variations and the 1982 conjecture of T. Iwaniec on the $L^p$-norm
of the Beurling-Ahlfors operator with connections to problems in the theory of
qasiconformal mappings. Open questions, problems and conjectures are listed
throughout the paper and copious references are provided.
