We consider limiting Carleman weights for Dirac operators and prove
corresponding Carleman estimates. In particular, we show that limiting Carleman
weights for the Laplacian also serve as limiting weights for Dirac operators.
As an application we consider the inverse problem of recovering a Lipschitz
continuous magnetic field and electric potential from boundary measurements for
the Pauli Dirac operator.
