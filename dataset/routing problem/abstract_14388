The aim of this note is to present a numerical method to solve the Stokes
problem in a bounded domain with a Dirac source term, which preserves
optimality for any approximation order by the finite-element method. It is
based on the knowledge of a fundamental solution to the associated operator
over the whole space. This method is motivated by the modeling of the movement
of active thin structures in a viscous fluid.
