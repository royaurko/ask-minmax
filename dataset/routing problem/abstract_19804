Calculations using staggered quarks augmented with a root of the fermion
determinant to reduce doubling give a qualitatively incorrect behavior in the
small quark mass region. Attempts to circumvent this problem for the continuum
limit involve an unproven combination of unphysical states, a loss of
unitarity, and a rather peculiar non-commutation of limits.
