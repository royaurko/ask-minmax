This paper concerns the problem of integrability of non closed distributions
on Banach manifolds. We introduce the notion of weak distribution and we look
for conditions under which these distributions admit weak integral
submanifolds. We give some applications to Banach Lie algebroid and Banach
Lie-Poisson manifold. The main results of this paper generalize the works
presented in [ChSt], [Nu] and [Gl].
