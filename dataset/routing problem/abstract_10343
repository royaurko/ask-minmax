We consider dual optimization problems to the fundamental problem of finding
the minimum distance from a point to a subspace. We provide a counterexample to
a theorem which has appeared in the literature, relating the minimum distance
problem to a maximization problem in the predual space. The theorem was stated
in a series of papers by Zames and Owen in the early 1990s in conjunction with
a non-standard definition, which together are true, but the theorem is false
when assuming standard definitions, as it would later appear. Reasons for the
failure of this theorem are discussed; in particular, the fact that the
Hahn-Banach Theorem cannot be guaranteed to provide an extension which is an
element of the predual space. The condition needed to restore the theorem is
derived; namely, that the annihilator of the pre-annihilator return the
original subspace of interest. This condition is consistent with the
non-standard definition initially used, and it is further shown to be necessary
in a sense.
