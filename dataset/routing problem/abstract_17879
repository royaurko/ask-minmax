We present an effective heuristic for the Steiner Problem in Graphs. Its main
elements are a multistart algorithm coupled with aggressive combination of
elite solutions, both leveraging recently-proposed fast local searches. We also
propose a fast implementation of a well-known dual ascent algorithm that not
only makes our heuristics more robust (by quickly dealing with easier cases),
but can also be used as a building block of an exact (branch-and-bound)
algorithm that is quite effective for some inputs. On all graph classes we
consider, our heuristic is competitive with (and sometimes more effective than)
any previous approach with similar running times. It is also scalable: with
long runs, we could improve or match the best published results for most open
instances in the literature.
