The Euahlayi people are an Australian Aboriginal language group located in
north-central New South Wales and south-central Queensland. They have a rich
culture of astronomy, and use of the night sky in resource management. Like
several other Aboriginal peoples, they did not travel extensively at night, and
so were assumed not to use the night sky for navigation. This study has
confirmed that they, like most other Aboriginal groups, travelled extensively
outside their own country for purposes of trade and ceremonies. We also found
that, previously unknown, they used star maps in the night sky for learning and
remembering waypoints along their routes of travel, but not for actual
navigation. Further research may find that this was common to many Aboriginal
groups in Australia.
