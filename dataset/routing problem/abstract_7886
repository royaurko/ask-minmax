In this paper, we propose an efficient numerical treatment for solving
contact problems with friction between deformable bodies. The discretized
normal and tangential constraints at the candidate contact interface are
expressed by using either continuous piecewise linear or piecewise constant
Lagrange multipliers. Several numerical studies corresponding to this choice
are achieved in the PLAST2 code.
