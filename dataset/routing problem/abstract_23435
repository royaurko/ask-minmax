It is shown that fine-tuning of the Higgs parameters stronger than a few % is
required at the best in the models with gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking.
With the aim of solving this problem, we consider a new type of models in which
the top Yukawa coupling is induced at TeV scale through mass mixing with
unknown matter fields. Then it is found that the fine-tuning problem can be
eliminated essentially. We discuss some phenomenological features of this model
and also consider the extension to the next-to-minimal models.
