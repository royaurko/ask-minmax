In this paper, the finite time blow-up of smooth solutions to the Cauchy
problem for full Euler-Poisson equations and isentropic Euler-Poisson equations
with repulsive forces or attractive forces in high dimensions $(n\geq3)$ is
proved for a large class of initial data. It is not required that the initial
data has compact support or contains vacuum in any finite regions.
