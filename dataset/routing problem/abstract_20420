This note discusses the problem of choosing between hypotheses in a situation
with many, correlated non-normal variables. A new method is introduced to
shrink the many variables into a smaller subset of variables with zero mean,
unit variance, and zero correlation coefficient between variables. These new
variables are well suited to use in a neural net.
