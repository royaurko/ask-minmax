In the last decade, the power of the state-of-the-art SAT and Integer
Programming solvers has dramatically increased. They implement many new
techniques and heuristics and since any NP problem can be converted to SAT or
ILP instance, we could take advantage of these techniques in general by
converting the instance of NP problem to SAT formula or Integer program. A
problem we consider, in this proof of concept, is finding a largest clique in a
graph. We ran several experiments on large random graphs and compared 3
approaches: Optimised backtrack solution, Translation to SAT and Translation to
Integer program. The last one was the fastest one.
