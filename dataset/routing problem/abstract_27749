The localization subregions of stationary waves in continuous disordered
media have been recently demonstrated to be governed by a hidden landscape that
is the solution of a Dirichlet problem expressed with the wave operator. In
this theory, the strength of Anderson localization confinement is determined by
this landscape, and continuously decreases as the energy increases. However,
this picture has to be changed in discrete lattices in which the eigenmodes
close to the edge of the first Brillouin zone are as localized as the low
energy ones. Here we show that in a 1D discrete lattice, the localization of
low and high energy modes is governed by two different landscapes, the high
energy landscape being the solution of a dual Dirichlet problem deduced from
the low energy one using the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate this
feature using the one-dimensional tight-binding Hamiltonian with random on-site
potentials as a prototype model. Moreover we show that, besides unveiling the
subregions of Anderson localization, these dual landscapes also provide an
accurate overal estimate of the localization length over the energy spectrum,
especially in the weak disorder regime.
