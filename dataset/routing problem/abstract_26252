A spectral element method (SEM) is developed to solve polarized radiative
transfer in multidimensional participating medium. The angular discretization
is based on the discrete-ordinates approach, and the spatial discretization is
conducted by spectral element approach. Chebyshev polynomial is used to build
basis function on each element. Four various test problems are taken as
examples to verify the performance of the SEM. The effectiveness of the SEM is
demonstrated. The h and the p convergence characteristics of the SEM are
studied. The convergence rate of p-refinement follows the exponential decay
trend and is superior to that of h-refinement. The accuracy and efficiency of
the higher order approximation in the SEM is well demonstrated for the solution
of the VRTE. The predicted angular distribution of brightness temperature and
Stokes vector by the SEM agree very well with the benchmark solutions in
references. Numerical results show that the SEM is accurate, flexible and
effective to solve multidimensional polarized radiative transfer problems.
