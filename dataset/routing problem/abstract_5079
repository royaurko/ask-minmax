Generalisation of the El Farol bar problem to that of many bars here leads to
the Kolkata restaurant problem, where the decision to go to any restaurant or
not is much simpler (depending on the previous experience of course, as in the
El Farol bar problem). This generalised problem can be exactly analysed in some
limiting cases discussed here. The fluctuation in the restaurant service can be
shown to have precisely an inverse cubic behavior, as widely seen in the stock
market fluctuations.
