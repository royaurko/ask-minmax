The classical electrodynamic system of field and a single point-like source
is considered in even-dimensional space-time. The problem of self-interaction
is discussed. It is manifestly shown that all singular terms appearing in these
equations can be regularized. Relations between formulae for radiation and
radiation friction are discussed.
