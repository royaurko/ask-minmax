The Second Parameter (2ndP) Problem recognizes the remarkable role played by
horizontal branch (HB) morphology in the development of our understanding of
globular clusters, and the Galaxy, over the last 50 years. I will describe the
historical development of the 2ndP and discuss recent advances that are finally
providing some answers. I will discuss how the controversies surrounding the
nature of the 2ndP can be reconciled if we acknowledge that there are actually
two distinct problems with entirely different solutions.
