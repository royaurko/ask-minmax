This paper presents a fast algorithm for full-polarisation, direction
dependent calibration in radio interferometry. It is based on Wirtinger's
approach to complex differentiation. Compared to the classical case, and under
reasonable approximations, the Jacobian appearing in the Levenberg-Maquardt
iterative scheme presents a sparse structure, allowing for high gain in terms
of algorithmic cost.
