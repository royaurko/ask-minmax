Flaws and ambiguities are pointed out upon examining the comment attempting
to solve a problem as raised recently --- the currently accepted formulation of
electromagnetic radiation of an accelerated charge violates the principle of
conservation of energy. This problem is not solved by the comment, due to a
misunderstanding in the meaning of the total radiated power crossing a sphere.
An experiment is suggested to determine whether on not the currently accepted
formulation is valid.
