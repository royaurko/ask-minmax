An empty spot refers to an empty hard-to-fill space which can be found in the
records of the social interaction, and is the clue to the persons in the
underlying social network who do not appear in the records. This contribution
addresses a problem to predict relevant empty spots in social interaction.
Homogeneous and inhomogeneous networks are studied as a model underlying the
social interaction. A heuristic predictor function approach is presented as a
new method to address the problem. Simulation experiment is demonstrated over a
homogeneous network. A test data in the form of baskets is generated from the
simulated communication. Precision to predict the empty spots is calculated to
demonstrate the performance of the presented approach.
