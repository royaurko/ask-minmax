Some numerical algorithms for elliptic eigenvalue problems are proposed,
analyzed, and numerically tested. The methods combine advantages of the
two-grid algorithm, two-space method, the shifted inverse power method, and the
polynomial preserving recovery technique . Our new algorithms compare favorably
with some existing methods and enjoy superconvergence property.
