We discuss anomalous gauge boson couplings at hadron supercolliders. We
review the usual description of these couplings, as well as the studies of a
strongly interacting electroweak symmetry breaking sector. We present an
effective field theory formulation of the problem that relates the two
subjects, and that allows a consistent and systematic analysis. We end with
some phenomenology.
