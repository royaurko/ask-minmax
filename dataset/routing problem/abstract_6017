In this paper we focus on the map matching problem where the goal is to find
a path through a planar graph such that the path through the vertices closely
matches a given polygonal curve. The map matching problem is usually approached
with the Fr\'echet distance matching the edges of the path as well. Here, we
formally define the discrete map matching problem based on the discrete
Fr\'echet distance. We then look at the complexities of some variations of the
problem which allow for vertices in the graph to be unique or reused, and
whether there is a bound on the length of the path or the number of vertices
from the graph used in the path. We prove several of these problems to be
NP-complete, and then conclude the paper with some open questions.
