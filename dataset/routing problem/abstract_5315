We consider the problem of reconstructing the shape of an impenetrable
sound-soft obstacle from scattering measurements. The input data is assumed to
be the far-field pattern generated when a plane wave impinges on an unknown
obstacle from one or more directions and at one or more frequencies. It is well
known that this inverse scattering problem is both ill posed and nonlinear. It
is common practice to overcome the ill posedness through the use of a penalty
method or Tikhonov regularization. Here, we present a more physical
regularization, based simply on restricting the unknown boundary to be
band-limited in a suitable sense. To overcome the nonlinearity of the problem,
we use a variant of Newton's method. When multiple frequency data is available,
we supplement Newton's method with the recursive linearization approach due to
Chen.
  During the course of solving the inverse problem, we need to compute the
solution to a large number of forward scattering problems. For this, we use
high-order accurate integral equation discretizations, coupled with fast direct
solvers when the problem is sufficiently large.
