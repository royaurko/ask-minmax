A combination of a telepresence system and a microscopic traffic simulator is
introduced. It is evaluated using a hotel evacuation scenario. Four different
kinds of supporting information are compared, standard exit signs, floor plans
with indicated exit routes, guiding lines on the floor and simulated agents
leading the way. The results indicate that guiding lines are the most efficient
way to support an evacuation but the natural behavior of following others comes
very close. On another level the results are consistent with previously
performed real and virtual experiments and validate the use of a telepresence
system in evacuation studies. It is shown that using a microscopic traffic
simulator extends the possibilities for evaluation, e.g. by adding simulated
humans to the environment.
