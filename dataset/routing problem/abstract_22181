It is well-known that several problems related to analysis on $s$-John
domains can be unified by certain capacity lower estimates. In this paper, we
obtain general lower bounds of $p$-capacity of a compact set $E$ and the
central Whitney cube $Q_0$ in terms of the Hausdorff $q$-content of $E$ in an
$s$-John domain $\Omega$. Moreover, we construct several examples to show the
essential sharpness of our estimates.
