Quasipatterns (two-dimensional patterns that are quasiperiodic in any spatial
direction) remain one of the outstanding problems of pattern formation. As with
problems involving quasiperiodicity, there is a small divisor problem. In this
paper, we consider 8-fold, 10-fold, 12-fold, and higher order quasipattern
solutions of the Swift-Hohenberg equation. We prove that a formal solution,
given by a divergent series, may be used to build a smooth quasiperiodic
function which is an approximate solution of the pattern-forming PDE up to an
exponentially small error.
