This article presets a review of lattice problems. Paper contains the main
eighteen problems with their reductions and referents to his cryptography
application. As an example of reduction, we detail analyze connection between
SVP and CVP. Moreover, we give an Ajtai theorem and demonstrate its role in
lattice based cryptography.
