Smoothness of generalized solutions for higher-order elliptic equations with
nonlocal boundary conditions is studied in plane domains. Necessary and
sufficient conditions upon the right-hand side of the problem and nonlocal
operators under which the generalized solutions possess an appropriate
smoothness are established.
