This paper has been withdrawn because Theorem 21 and Corollary 22 are in
error; The modeling idea is OK, but it needs 9-dimensional variables instead of
the 8-dimensional variables defined in notations 6.9.
  Examples of the correct model (with 9-index variables) are: (1) Diaby, M.,

Journal of Operational Research 8:4 (August 2010) pp. 399-427; (2) Diaby, M.,
