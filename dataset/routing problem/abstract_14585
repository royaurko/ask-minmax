Whether our universe with present day acceleration can eventually collapse is
very interesting problem. We are also interesting in such problems, whether the
universe is closed? Why it is so flat? How long to expend a period for a cycle
of the universe? In this paper a simple ``slow-fast'' type of the quintessence
potential is designed for the closed universe to realize the present
acceleration of our universe and its eventual big collapse. A detail numerical
simulation of the universe evolution demonstrates that it divides the seven
stages, a very rich story. It is unexpected that the quintessential kinetic
energy is dominated in the shrink stage of the universe with very rapid
velocity of the energy increasing. A complete analytic analysis is given for
each stage. Some very interesting new problems brought by this collapse are
discussed. Therefore our model avoids naturally the future event horizon
problem of the present accelerative expanding universe and maybe realize the
infinite cycles of the universe, which supplies a mechanism to use naturally
the anthropic principle. This paper shows that the understanding on the essence
of the cosmological constant should contain a richer content.
