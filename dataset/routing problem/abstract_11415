The pre-big-bang cosmology inspired by superstring theories has been
suggested as an alternative to slow-roll inflation. We analyze, in both the
Jordan and Einstein frames, the effect of spatial curvature on this scenario
and show that too much curvature --- of either sign --- reduces the duration of
the inflationary era to such an extent that the flatness and horizon problems
are not solved. Hence, a fine-tuning of initial conditions is required to
obtain enough inflation to solve the cosmological problems.
