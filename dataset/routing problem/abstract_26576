We present new iterative algorithms for solving a square linear system $Ax=b$
in dimension $n$ by employing the {\it Triangle Algorithm} \cite{kal12}, a
fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for testing if the convex hull of a
finite set of points in a Euclidean space contains a given point. By converting
$Ax=b$ into a convex hull problem and solving via the Triangle Algorithm,
together with a {\it sensitivity theorem}, we compute in $O(n^2\epsilon^{-2})$
arithmetic operations an approximate solution satisfying $\Vert Ax_\epsilon - b
\Vert \leq \epsilon \rho$, where $\rho= \max \{\Vert a_1 \Vert,..., \Vert a_n
\Vert, \Vert b \Vert \}$, and $a_i$ is the $i$-th column of $A$. In another
approach we apply the Triangle Algorithm incrementally, solving a sequence of
convex hull problems while repeatedly employing a {\it distance duality}. The
simplicity and theoretical complexity bounds of the proposed algorithms,
requiring no structural restrictions on the matrix $A$, suggest their potential
practicality, offering alternatives to the existing exact and iterative
methods, especially for large scale linear systems. The assessment of
computational performance however is the subject of future experimentations.
