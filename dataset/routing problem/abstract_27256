Digital controllers have several advantages with respect to their flexibility
and design's simplicity. However, they are subject to problems that are not
faced by analog controllers. In particular, these problems are related to the
finite word-length implementation that might lead to overflows, limit cycles,
and time constraints in fixed-point processors. This paper proposes a new
method to detect design's errors in digital controllers using a state-of-the
art bounded model checker based on satisfiability modulo theories. The
experiments with digital controllers for a ball and beam plant demonstrate that
the proposed method can be very effective in finding errors in digital
controllers than other existing approaches based on traditional simulations
tools.
