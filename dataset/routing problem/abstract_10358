We present a new set of axioms for a 2D TQFT formulated on the category of
the dual of ribbon graphs with edge-contraction operations as morphisms. Every
Frobenius algebra $A$ determines a contravariant functor from this category to
the category of elements of the tensor category of Frobenius algebras over
$A^*$. The functor evaluated at connected graphs is the TQFT corresponding to
$A$.
  The edge-contraction operations also form an effective tool in various graph
enumeration problems, such as counting Grothendieck's dessins d'enfants, simple
and double Hurwitz numbers. These counting problems can be solved by the
topological recursion, which is the universal mirror B-model corresponding to
these counting problems. We show that for the case of orbifold Hurwitz numbers,
the mirror objects, the spectral curves and the differential forms on it, are
constructed purely from the edge-contraction operations of the counting
problem.
