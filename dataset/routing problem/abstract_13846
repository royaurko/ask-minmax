We address the issue of the Landau diamagnetism problem via $q$-deformed
algebra of Fibonacci oscillators through its generalized sequence of two real
and independent deformation parameters $q_1$ and $q_2$. We obtain $q$-deformed
thermodynamic quantities such as internal energy, number of particles,
magnetization and magnetic susceptibility which recover their usual form in the
degenerate limit $q_1^2 + q_2^2$=1.
