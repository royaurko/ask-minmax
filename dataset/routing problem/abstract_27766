C. Bishop has constructed an example of an entire function f in
Eremenko-Lyubich class with at least two grand orbits of oscillating wandering
domains. In this paper we show that his example has exactly two such orbits,
that is, f has no unexpected wandering domains. We apply this result to the
classical problem of relating the Julia sets of composite functions with the
Julia set of its members. More precisely, we show the existence of two entire
maps f and g in Eremenko-Lyubich class such that the Fatou set of f compose
with g has a wandering domain, while all Fatou components of f or g are
preperiodic. This complements a result of A. Singh and results of W. Bergweiler
and A. Hinkkanen related to this problem.
