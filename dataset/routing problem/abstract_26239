The model checking problem for CTL is known to be P-complete (Clarke,
Emerson, and Sistla (1986), see Schnoebelen (2002)). We consider fragments of
CTL obtained by restricting the use of temporal modalities or the use of
negations---restrictions already studied for LTL by Sistla and Clarke (1985)
and Markey (2004). For all these fragments, except for the trivial case without
any temporal operator, we systematically prove model checking to be either
inherently sequential (P-complete) or very efficiently parallelizable
(LOGCFL-complete). For most fragments, however, model checking for CTL is
already P-complete. Hence our results indicate that, in cases where the
combined complexity is of relevance, approaching CTL model checking by
parallelism cannot be expected to result in any significant speedup. We also
completely determine the complexity of the model checking problem for all
fragments of the extensions ECTL, CTL+, and ECTL+.
