We obtain nontrivial solutions of a $(N,q)$-Laplacian problem with a critical
Trudinger-Moser nonlinearity in a bounded domain. In addition to the usual
difficulty of the loss of compactness associated with problems involving
critical nonlinearities, this problem lacks a direct sum decomposition suitable
for applying the classical linking theorem. We show that every Palais-Smale
sequence at a level below a certain energy threshold admits a subsequence that
converges weakly to a nontrivial critical point of the variational functional.
Then we prove an abstract critical point theorem based on a cohomological index
and use it to construct a minimax level below this threshold.
