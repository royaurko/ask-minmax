In this paper, we prove the existence of minimizers of a class of
multi-constrained variational problems. We consider systems involving a
nonlinearity that does not satisfy compactness, monotonicity, neither symmetry
properties. Our approach hinges on the concentration-compactness approach. In
the second part, we will treat orthogonal constrained problems for another
class of integrands using density matrices method.
