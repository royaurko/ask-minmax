In this review article we present regularity properties of generalized
functions which are useful in the analysis of non-linear problems. It is shown
that Schwartz distributions embedded into our new spaces of generalized
functions, with additional properties described through the association, belong
to various classical spaces with finite or infinite type of regularities.
