In this paper we study the quenching problem in nonlinear heat equations with
power nonlinearities. For nonlinearities of power p<0 and for an open set of
slowly varying initial conditions we prove that the solutions will collapse in
a finite time. We find the collapse profile and estimate the remainder.
