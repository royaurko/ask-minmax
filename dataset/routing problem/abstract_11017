The recent experiments of Crocker et al. suggest that microrheological
measurements obtained from the correlated fluctuations of widely-separatedprobe
particles determine the rheological properties of soft, complex materials more
accurately than do the more traditional particle autocorrelations. This
presents an interesting problem in viscoelastic dynamics. We develop an
important, simplifing analogy between the present viscoelastic problem and
classical electrostatics. Using this analogy and direct calculation we analyze
both the one and two particle correlations in a viscoelastic medium in order to
explain this observation.
