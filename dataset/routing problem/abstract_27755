The stretching of closed-shell molecules is a qualitative problem for
restricted Hartree-Fock that is usually circumvented by the use of unrestricted
Hartree-Fock (UHF). UHF is well known to break the spin symmetry at the
Coulson-Fischer point, leading to a discontinuous derivative in the potential
energy surface and incorrect spin density. However, this is generally not
considered as a major drawback. In this work, we present a set of two electron
molecules which magnify the problem of symmetry breaking and lead to
drastically incorrect potential energy surfaces with UHF. These molecules also
fail with unrestricted density-functional calculations where a functional such
as B3LYP gives both symmetry breaking and an unphysically low energy due to the
delocalization error. The implications for density functional theory are also
discussed.
