An electrical potential U on a bordered Riemann surface X with conductivity
function sigma>0 satisfies equation d(sigma d^cU)=0. The problem of effective
reconstruction of sigma is studied. We extend to the case of Riemann surfaces
the reconstruction scheme given, firstly, by R.Novikov (1988) for simply
connected X. We apply for this new kernels for dbar on affine algebraic Riemann
surfaces constructed in Henkin, arXiv:0804.3761
