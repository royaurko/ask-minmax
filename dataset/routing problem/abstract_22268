We present an efficient method to solve the problem of the constrained least
squares approximation of the rational B\'{e}zier curve by the B\'{e}zier curve.
The presented algorithm uses the dual constrained Bernstein basis polynomials,
associated with the Jacobi scalar product, and exploits their recursive
properties. Examples are given, showing the effectiveness of the algorithm.
