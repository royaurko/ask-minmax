One of the presuppositions of science since the times of Galileo, Newton,
Laplace, and Descartes has been the predictability of the world. This idea has
strongly influenced scientific and technological models. However, in recent
decades, chaos and complexity have shown that not every phenomenon is
predictable, even if it is deterministic. If a problem space is predictable, in
theory we can find a solution via optimization. Nevertheless, if a problem
space is not predictable, or it changes too fast, very probably optimization
will offer obsolete solutions. This occurs often when the immediate solution
affects the problem itself. An alternative is found in adaptation. An adaptive
system will be able to find by itself new solutions for unforeseen situations.
