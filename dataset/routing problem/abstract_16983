In this review, I recall the nature and the inevitability of the "sign
problem" which plagues attempts to simulate lattice QCD at finite baryon
density. I present the main approaches used to circumvent the sign problem at
small chemical potential. I sketch how one can predict analytically the
severity of the sign problem, as well as the numerically accessible range of
baryon densities. I review progress towards the determination of the
pseudo-critical temperature T_c(mu), and towards the identification of a
possible QCD critical point. Some promising advances with non-standard
approaches are reviewed.
