Within the framework of variational modelling we derive a one-phase moving
boundary problem describing the motion of a semipermeable membrane enclosing a
viscous liquid, driven by osmotic pressure and surface tension of the membrane.
For this problem we prove the existence of classical solutions for a short
time.
