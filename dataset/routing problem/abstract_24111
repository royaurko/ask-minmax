Message passing algorithms have proved surprisingly successful in solving
hard constraint satisfaction problems on sparse random graphs. In such
applications, variables are fixed sequentially to satisfy the constraints.
Message passing is run after each step. Its outcome provides an heuristic to
make choices at next step. This approach has been referred to as `decimation,'
with reference to analogous procedures in statistical physics.
  The behavior of decimation procedures is poorly understood. Here we consider
a simple randomized decimation algorithm based on belief propagation (BP), and
analyze its behavior on random k-satisfiability formulae. In particular, we
propose a tree model for its analysis and we conjecture that it provides
asymptotically exact predictions in the limit of large instances. This
conjecture is confirmed by numerical simulations.
