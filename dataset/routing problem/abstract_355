This paper presents a day-to-day re-routing relaxation approach for traffic
simulations. Starting from an initial planset for the routes, the route-based
microsimulation is executed. The result of the microsimulation is fed into a
re-router, which re-routes a certain percentage of all trips. This approach
makes the traffic patterns in the microsimulation much more reasonable.
Further, it is shown that the method described in this paper can lead to strong
oscillations in the solutions.
