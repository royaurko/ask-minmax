The nonlocal correlation mechanism between excitonic pairs is considered for
a two dimensional exciton system. On the base of the unitary decomposition of
the usual electron operator, we include the electron phase degrees of freedom
into the problem of interacting excitons. Applying the path integral formalism,
we treat the excitonic insulator state (EI) and the Bose-Einstein condensation
(BEC) of preformed excitonic pairs as two independent problems. For the BEC of
excitons the phase field variables play a crucial role. We derive the
expression of the local EI order parameter by integrating out the phase
variables. Then, considering the zero temperature limit, we obtain the
excitonic BEC transition probability function, by integrating out the fermions.
We calculate the normal excitonic Green functions for the conduction and
valence band electrons and we derive the excitonic spectral functions, both
analytically and numerically. Different values of the Coulomb interaction
parameter are considered.
