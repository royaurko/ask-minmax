We examine an interesting scenario to solve the domain wall problem recently
suggested by Preskill, Trivedi, Wilczek and Wise. The effective potential is
calculated in the presence of the QCD axial anomaly. It is shown that some
discrete symmetries such as CP and Z_2 can be anomalous due to a so-called
$K$-term induced by instantons. We point out that Z_2 domain-wall problem in
the two-doublet standard model can be resolved by two types of solutions: the
CP-conserving one and the CP-breaking one. In the first case, there exist two
Z_2-related local minima whose energy splitting is provided by the instanton
effect. In the second case, there is only one unique vacuum so that the domain
walls do not form at all. The consequences of this new source of CP violation
are discussed and shown to be well within the experimental limits in weak
interactions.
