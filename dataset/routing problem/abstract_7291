We describe some recent advances in the numerical solution of acoustic
scattering problems. A major focus of the paper is the efficient solution of
high frequency scattering problems via hybrid numerical-asymptotic boundary
element methods. We also make connections to the unified transform method due
to A.S. Fokas and co-contributors, analysing particular instances of this method,
proposed by J.A. DeSanto and co-contributors, for problems of acoustic scattering by
diffraction gratings.
