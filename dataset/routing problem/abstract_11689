Fix a non-negative integer g and a positive integer I dividing 2g-2. For any
Henselian, discretely valued field K whose residue field is perfect and admits
a degree I cyclic extension, we construct a curve C over K of genus g and index
I. We can in fact give a complete description of the finite extensions L/K such
that C has an L-rational point. Applications are discussed to the corresponding
problem over number fields. S. Sharif, in his 2006 Berkeley thesis, has
independently obtained similar (but not identical) results. Our proof, however,
is different: via deformation theory, we reduce to the problem of finding
suitable actions of cyclic groups on finite graphs.
