The ternary Goldbach conjecture, or three-primes problem, states that every
odd number $n$ greater than $5$ can be written as the sum of three primes. The
conjecture, posed in 1742, remained unsolved until now, in spite of great
progress in the twentieth century. In 2013 -- following a line of research
pioneered and developed by Hardy, Littlewood and Vinogradov, among others --
the contributor proved the conjecture.
  In this, as in many other additive problems, what is at issue is really the
proper usage of the limited information we possess on the distribution of prime
numbers. The problem serves as a test and whetting-stone for techniques in
analysis and number theory -- and also as an incentive to think about the
relations between existing techniques with greater clarity.
  We will go over the main ideas of the proof. The basic approach is based on
the circle method, the large sieve and exponential sums. For the purposes of
this overview, we will not need to work with explicit constants; however, we
will discuss what makes certain strategies and procedures not just effective,
but efficient, in the sense of leading to good constants. Still, our focus will
be on qualitative improvements.
