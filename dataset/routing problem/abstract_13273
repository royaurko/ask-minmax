We consider the detection problem of a two-dimensional function from noisy
observations of its integrals over lines. We study both rate and sharp
asymptotics for the error probabilities in the minimax setup. By construction,
the derived tests are non-adaptive. We also construct a minimax rate-optimal
adaptive test of rather simple structure.
