We establish Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases theory for Novikov algebras over a
field of characteristic $0$. As applications, a PBW type theorem in Shirshov
form is given and we show that the word problem of Novikov algebras with finite
homogeneous relations is solvable. We also construct a subalgebra of one
generated free Novikov algebra which is not free.
