We study a new problem for cubic graphs: bipartization of a cubic graph $Q$
by deleting sufficiently large independent set $I$. It can be expressed as
follows: \emph{Given a connected $n$-vertex tripartite cubic graph $Q=(V,E)$
with independence number $\alpha(Q)$, does $Q$ contain an independent set $I$
of size $k$ such that $Q-I$ is bipartite?} We are interested for which value of
$k$ the answer to this question is affirmative. We prove constructively that if
$\alpha(Q) \geq 4n/10$, then the answer is positive for each $k$ fulfilling
$\lfloor (n-\alpha(Q))/2 \rfloor \leq k \leq \alpha(Q)$. It remains an open
question if a similar construction is possible for cubic graphs with
$\alpha(Q)<4n/10$.
  Next, we show that this problem with $\alpha(Q)\geq 4n/10$ and $k$ fulfilling
inequalities $\lfloor n/3 \rfloor \leq k \leq \alpha(Q)$ can be related to
semi-equitable graph 3-coloring, where one color class is of size $k$, and the
subgraph induced by the remaining vertices is equitably 2-colored. This means
that $Q$ has a coloring of type $(k, \lceil(n-k)/2\rceil, \lfloor (n-k)/2
\rfloor)$.
