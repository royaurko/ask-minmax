We describe a method to construct well-posed initial value problems for not
necessarily integrable equations on not necessarily simply connected
quad-graphs. Although the method does not always provide a well-posed initial
value problem (not all quad-graphs admit well-posed initial value problems) it
is effective in the class of rhombic embeddable quad-graphs.
