A state-dependent 1-limited polling model with N queues is analyzed. The
routing strategy generalizes the classical Markovian polling model, in the
sense that two routing matrices are involved, the choice being made according
to the state of the last visited queue. The stationary distribution of the
position of the server is given. Ergodicity conditions are obtained by means of
an associated dynamical system. Under rotational symmetry assumptions, average
queue length and mean waiting times are computed.
