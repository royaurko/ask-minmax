We discuss the sign problem in QCD at nonzero chemical potential and its
relation with chiral symmetry breaking and the spectrum of the Dirac operator
using the framework of chiral random matrix theory. We show that the
Banks-Casher formula is not valid for theories with a sign problem and has to
be replaced by an alternative mechanism that is worked out in detail for QCD in
one dimension at nonzero chemical potential.
