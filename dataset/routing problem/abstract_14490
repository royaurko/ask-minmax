We study the problem of hierarchical clustering on planar graphs. We
formulate this in terms of an LP relaxation of ultrametric rounding. To solve
this LP efficiently we introduce a dual cutting plane scheme that uses minimum
cost perfect matching as a subroutine in order to efficiently explore the space
of planar partitions. We apply our algorithm to the problem of hierarchical
image segmentation.
