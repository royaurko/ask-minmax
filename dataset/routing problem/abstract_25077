Consider the optimal dividend problem for an insurance company whose
uncontrolled surplus precess evolves as a spectrally negative Levy process. We
assume that dividends are paid to the shareholders according to admissible
strategies whose dividend rate is bounded by a constant. The objective is to
find a dividend policy so as to maximize the expected discounted value of
dividends which are paid to the shareholders until the company is ruined.
Kyprianou, Loeffen and Perez [28] have shown that a refraction strategy (also
called threshold strategy) forms an optimal strategy under the condition that
the Levy measure has a completely monotone density. In this paper, we propose
an alternative approach to this optimal problem.
