In this paper we formulate the equilibrium equation of a beam made of
graphene material subjected to some boundary conditions and acted upon by axial
compression and nonlinear lateral constrains as a fourth-order nonlinear
boundary value problem. We also formulate the nonlinear eigenvalue for buckling
analysis of the beam. We verify the solvability of the buckling problem as an
asymptotic expansion in a ratio of the elastoplastic parameters, that the
spectrum is bounded away from zero and contains a discrete infinite sequence of
eigenvalues.We also verify, for certain ranges of the lateral forces, the
solvability of the general equations using energy methods and a suitable
iteration scheme.
