Visual learning problems such as object classification and action recognition
are typically approached using extensions of the popular bag-of-words (BoW)
model. Despite its great success, it is unclear what visual features the BoW
model is learning: Which regions in the image or video are used to discriminate
among classes? Which are the most discriminative visual words? Answering these
questions is fundamental for understanding existing BoW models and inspiring
better models for visual recognition. To answer these questions, this paper
presents a method for feature selection and region selection in the visual BoW
model. This allows for an intermediate visualization of the features and
regions that are important for visual learning. The main idea is to assign
latent weights to the features or regions, and jointly optimize these latent
variables with the parameters of a classifier (e.g., SVM). There are four main
benefits of our approach: (1) Our approach accommodates non-linear additive
kernels such as the popular Chi-square and intersection kernel; (2) our
approach is able to handle both regions in images and spatio-temporal regions
in videos in a unified way; (3) the feature selection problem is convex, and
both problems can be solved using a scalable reduced gradient method; (4) we
point out strong connections with multiple kernel learning and multiple
instance learning approaches. Experimental results in the PASCAL VOC 2007, MSR
Action Dataset II and YouTube illustrate the benefits of our approach.
