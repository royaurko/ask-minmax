Kernelization is a formalization of efficient preprocessing for NP-hard
problems using the framework of parameterized complexity. Among open problems
in kernelization it has been asked many times whether there are deterministic
polynomial kernelizations for Subset Sum and Knapsack when parameterized by the
number $n$ of items.
  We answer both questions affirmatively by using an algorithm for compressing
numbers due to Frank and Tardos (Combinatorica 1987). This result had been
first used by Marx and V\'egh (ICALP 2013) in the context of kernelization. We
further illustrate its applicability by giving polynomial kernels also for
weighted versions of several well-studied parameterized problems. Furthermore,
when parameterized by the different item sizes we obtain a polynomial
kernelization for Subset Sum and an exponential kernelization for Knapsack.
Finally, we also obtain kernelization results for polynomial integer programs.
