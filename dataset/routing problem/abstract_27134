Line scattering polarization can be strongly affected by Rayleigh scattering
by neutral hydrogen and Thompson scattering by free electrons. Often a
continuum depolarization results, but the Doppler redistribution produced by
the continuum scatterers, which are light (hence, fast), induces more complex
interactions between the polarization in spectral lines and in the continuum.
Here we formulate and solve the radiative transfer problem of scattering line
polarization with non coherent continumm scattering consistently. The problem
is formulated within the spherical tensor representation of atomic and light
polarization. The numerical method of solution is a generalization of the
Accelerated Lambda Iteration that is applied to both, the atomic system and the
radiation field. We show that the redistribution of the spectral line radiation
due to the non coherence of the continuum scattering may modify significantly
the shape of the emergent fractional linear polarization patterns, even
yielding polarization signals above the continuum level in intrinsically
unpolarizable lines.
