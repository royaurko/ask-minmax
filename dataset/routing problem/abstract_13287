The H(div)-conforming approach for the Brinkman equation is studied
numerically, verifying the theoretical a priori and a posteriori analysis in
previous work of the contributors. Furthermore, the results are extended to cover a
non-constant permeability. A hybridization technique for the problem is
presented, complete with a convergence analysis and numerical verification.
Finally, the numerical convergence studies are complemented with numerical
examples of applications to domain decomposition and adaptive mesh refinement.
