We present Spitzer observations in five wavebands between 3.6 and 24um of an
unbiased sample of 9 luminous, dusty galaxies selected at 1200um by the MAMBO
camera on the IRAM 30-m telescope, a population akin to the well-known submm or
`SCUBA' galaxies (hereafter SMGs). Owing to the coarse resolution of submm/mm
instrumentation, SMGs have traditionally been difficult to identify at other
wavelengths. We compare our multi-wavelength catalogs to show that the overlap
between 24 and 1200um must be close to complete at these flux levels. We find
that all (4/4) of the most secure >=4sigma SMGs have robust >=4sigma
counterparts at 1.4GHz, while the fraction drops to 7/9 using all >=3sigma
SMGs. We show that combining mid-IR and marginal (>=3sigma) radio detections
provides plausible identifications in the remaining cases, enabling us to
identify the complete sample. Accretion onto an obscured central engine is
betrayed by the shape of the mid-IR continuum emission for several sources,
confirming Spitzer's potential to weed out active galaxies. We demonstrate the
power of a S(24um)/S(8um) vs S(8um)/S(4.5um) color-color plot as a diagnostic
for this purpose. However, we conclude that the majority (~75%) of SMGs have
rest-frame mid-/far-IR SEDs commensurate with obscured starbursts. Sensitive
24-um observations are clearly a useful route to identify and characterize
reliable counterparts to high-redshift far-IR-bright galaxies, complementing
what is possible via deep radio imaging.
