We consider the dyadic model, which is a toy model to test issues of
well-posedness and blow-up for the Navier-Stokes and Euler equations. We prove
well-posedness of positive solutions of the viscous problem in the relevant
scaling range which corresponds to Navier-Stokes. Likewise we prove
well-posedness for the inviscid problem (in a suitable regularity class) when
the parameter corresponds to the strongest transport effect of the
non-linearity.
