Abelian periodicity of strings has been studied extensively over the last
years. In 2006 Constantinescu and Ilie defined the abelian period of a string
and several algorithms for the computation of all abelian periods of a string
were given. In contrast to the classical period of a word, its abelian version
is more flexible, factors of the word are considered the same under any
internal permutation of their letters. We show two O(|y|^2) algorithms for the
computation of all abelian periods of a string y. The first one maps each
letter to a suitable number such that each factor of the string can be
identified by the unique sum of the numbers corresponding to its letters and
hence abelian periods can be identified easily. The other one maps each letter
to a prime number such that each factor of the string can be identified by the
unique product of the numbers corresponding to its letters and so abelian
periods can be identified easily. We also define weak abelian periods on
strings and give an O(|y|log(|y|)) algorithm for their computation, together
with some other algorithms for more basic problems.
