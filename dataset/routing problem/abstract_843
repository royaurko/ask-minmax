We give a qualitative description of two main routes to chaos in
three-dimensional maps. We discuss Shilnikov scenario of transition to spiral
chaos and a scenario of transition to discrete Lorenz-like and figure-eight
strange attractors. The theory is illustrated by numerical analysis of
three-dimensional Henon-like maps and Poincare maps in models of nonholonomic
mechanics.
