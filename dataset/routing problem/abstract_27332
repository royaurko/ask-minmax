Heuristic Rating Estimation (HRE) is a newly proposed method supporting
decisions analysis based on the use of pairwise comparisons. It allows that the
ranking values of some alternatives (herein referred to as concepts) are
initially known, whilst the ranks for the other concepts have yet to be
estimated. To calculate the missing ranks it is assumed that the priority of
every single concept can be determined as the weighted arithmetic mean of
priorities of all the other concepts. It has been shown that the problem has
admissible solution if the inconsistency of pairwise comparisons is not too
high. The proposed approach adopts the heuristics according to which to
determine the missing priorities a weighted geometric mean is used. In this
approach, despite an increased complexity, the solution always exists and their
existence does not depend on the inconsistency of the input matrix. Thus, the
presented approach might be appropriate for a larger number of problems than
the previous method. The formal definition of the proposed geometric heuristics
is accompanied by two numerical examples.
