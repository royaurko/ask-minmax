New variational ansatz for the large-radius Fr\"ohlich polaron is considered.
The corresponding operator estimation for the energy of polaron proves to be
very similar to the result found by Feynman on the basis of the variational
principle for the functional integral of the system. It allows us to make clear
the problem of ``phase transition'' and to anylize the structure of the
localized state of the polaron in the intermediate coupling regime. It is shown
that the analogous state exists also for the model of particle-field
interaction with the divergent perturbation theory.
