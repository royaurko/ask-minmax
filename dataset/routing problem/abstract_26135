We study the dynamics of a few stochastic learning strategies for the
'Kolkata Paise Restaurant' problem, where N agents choose among N equally
priced but differently ranked restaurants every evening such that each agent
tries get to dinner in the best restaurant (each serving only one customer and
the rest arriving there going without dinner that evening). We consider the
learning strategies to be similar for all the agents and assume that each
follow the same probabilistic or stochastic strategy dependent on the
information of the past successes in the game. We show that some 'naive'
strategies lead to much better utilization of the services than some relatively
'smarter' strategies. We also show that the service utilization fraction as
high as 0.80 can result for a stochastic strategy, where each agent sticks to
his past choice (independent of success achieved or not; with probability
decreasing inversely in the past crowd size). The numerical results for
utilization fraction of the services in some limiting cases are analytically
examined.
