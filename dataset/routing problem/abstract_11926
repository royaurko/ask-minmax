The semigroup decomposition formalism makes use of the functional model for
$C_{.0}$ class contractive semigroups for the description of the time evolution
of resonances. For a given scattering problem the formalism allows for the
association of a definite Hilbert space state with a scattering resonance. This
state defines a decomposition of matrix elements of the evolution into a term
evolving according to a semigroup law and a background term. We discuss the
case of multiple resonances and give a bound on the size of the background
term. As an example we treat a simple problem of scattering from a square
barrier potential on the half-line.
