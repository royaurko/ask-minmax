We study a generalization of the porous medium equation involving nonlocal
terms. More precisely, explicit self-similar solutions with compact support
generalizing the Barenblatt solutions are constructed. We also present a formal
argument to get the $L^p$ decay of weak solutions of the corresponding Cauchy
problem.
