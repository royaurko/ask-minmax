Numerical simulations of strongly correlated electron systems suffer from the
notorious fermion sign problem which has prevented progress in understanding if
systems like the Hubbard model display high-temperature superconductivity. Here
we show how the fermion sign problem can be solved completely with
meron-cluster methods in a large class of models of strongly correlated
electron systems, some of which are in the extended Hubbard model family and
show s-wave superconductivity. In these models we also find that on-site
repulsion can even coexist with a weak chemical potential without introducing
sign problems. We argue that since these models can be simulated efficiently
using cluster algorithms they are ideal for studying many of the interesting
phenomena in strongly correlated electron systems.
