We consider formation of composite strings and domain walls as a result of
fusion of two elementary objects (elementary strings in the first case and
elementary walls in the second) located at a distance from each other. The
tension of the composite object T_2 is assumed to be less than twice the
tension of the elementary object T_1, so that bound states are possible. If in
the initial state the distance d between the fusing strings or walls is much
larger than their thickness and satisfies the conditions T_1 d^2 >> 1 (in the
string case) and T_1 d^3 >> 1 (in the wall case), the problem can be fully
solved quasiclassically. The fusion probability is determined by the first,
"under the barrier" stage of the process. We find the bounce configuration and
its extremal action S_B. In the wall problem e^{-S_B} gives the fusion
probability per unit time per unit area. In the string case, due to a
logarithmic infrared divergence, the problem is well formulated only for
finite-length strings. The fusion probability per unit time can be found in the
limit in which the string length is much larger than the distance between two
merging strings.
