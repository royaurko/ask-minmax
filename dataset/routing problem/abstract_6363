A method of looking for boundary conditions consistent with the integrability
property of multidimensional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) type equations is
discussed. The method is based on involutions of the Lax pair taken at the
border plane. New classes of boundary conditions for the KP and Hirota
equations are proposed consistent with the Lax pair. The boundary problem on
the stripe 0<y<1 for the KP equation is discussed, its exact solutions are
found. Ward's problem on discrete versions of the generalized Toda chains is
briefly discussed.
