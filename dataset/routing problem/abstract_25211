We give a rigorous version of the classical Balian-Bloch trace formula, a
semiclassical expansion around a periodic reflecting ray of the (regularized)
resolvent of the Dirichlet Laplacian on a bounded smooth plane domain. It is
equivalent to the Poisson relation (or wave trace formula) between spectrum and
closed geodesics. We view it primarily as a computational device for explicitly
calculating wave trace invariants. Its effectiveness will be illustrated in
subsquent articles in the series in which concrete inverse spectral results are
proved.
