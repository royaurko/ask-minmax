Making use of integral representations, we develop a unified approach to
establish blow up profiles, compactness and existence of positive solutions of
the conformally invariant equations $P_\sigma(v)=
Kv^{\frac{n+2\sigma}{n-2\sigma}}$ on the standard unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^n$
for all $\sigma\in (0,n/2)$, where $P_\sigma$ is the intertwining operator of
order $2\sigma$. Finding positive solutions of these equations is equivalent to
seeking metrics in the conformal class of the standard metric on spheres with
prescribed certain curvatures. When $\sigma=1$, it is the prescribing scalar
curvature problem or the Nirenberg problem, and when $\sigma=2$, it is the
prescribing $Q$-curvature problem.
