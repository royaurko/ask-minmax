We present a new route for the fabrication of ultrathin (~1 nm) carbon films
and membranes, whose electrical behavior can be tuned from insulating to
conducting. Self-assembled monolayers of biphenyls are cross-linked by
electrons, detached from the surfaces and subsequently pyrolized. Above 1000K,
the cross-linked aromatic monolayer forms a mechanically stable graphitic
phase. The transition is accompanied by a drop of the sheet resistivity from
~10^8 to ~10^2 kOhm/sq and a mechanical stiffening of the nanomembranes from
~10 to ~50 GPa. The technical applicability of the nanosheets is demonstrated
by incorporating them into a microscopic pressure sensor
