We consider the problem of detecting a cycle in a directed graph that grows
by arc insertions, and the related problems of maintaining a topological order
and the strong components of such a graph. For these problems, we give two
algorithms, one suited to sparse graphs, and the other to dense graphs. The
former takes the minimum of O(m^{3/2}) and O(mn^{2/3}) time to insert m arcs
into an n-vertex graph; the latter takes O(n^2 log(n)) time. Our sparse
algorithm is considerably simpler than a previous O(m^{3/2})-time algorithm; it
is also faster on graphs of sufficient density. The time bound of our dense
algorithm beats the previously best time bound of O(n^{5/2}) for dense graphs.
Our algorithms rely for their efficiency on topologically ordered vertex
numberings; bounds on the size of the numbers give bound on running times.
