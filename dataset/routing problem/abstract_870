We study the properties of several proximity measures for the vertices of
weighted multigraphs and multidigraphs. Unlike the classical distance for the
vertices of connected graphs, these proximity measures are applicable to
weighted structures and take into account not only the shortest, but also all
other connections, which is desirable in many applications. To apply these
proximity measures to unweighted structures, every edge should be assigned the
same weight which determines the proportion of taking account of two routes,
from which one is one edge longer than the other. Among the proximity measures
we consider path accessibility, route accessibility, relative forest
accessibility along with its components, accessibility via dense forests, and
connection reliability. A number of characteristic conditions is introduced and
employed to characterize the proximity measures. A topological interpretation
is obtained for the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of the Laplacian matrix
of a weighted multigraph.
