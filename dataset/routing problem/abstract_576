We prove a limit shape theorem describing the asymptotic shape of bumping
routes when the Robinson-Schensted algorithm is applied to a finite sequence of
independent, identically distributed random variables with the uniform
distribution $U[0,1]$ on the unit interval, followed by an insertion of a
deterministic number $\alpha$. The bumping route converges after scaling, in
the limit as the length of the sequence tends to infinity, to an explicit,
deterministic curve depending only on $\alpha$. This extends our previous
result on the asymptotic determinism of Robinson-Schensted insertion, and
answers a question posed by Moore in 2006.
