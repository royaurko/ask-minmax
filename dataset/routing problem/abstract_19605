The duality approach in 2-{\it dim} two-component regular checkerboards was
extended onto piezoelectricity and piezomagnetism problems. There are found a
relation for effective piezoelectric and piezomagnetic modules for the
checkerboard with $p6^{\prime} mm^{\prime}$-plane symmetry group ({\em
dichromatic triangle}).
