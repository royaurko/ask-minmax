We explain the essence of perturbation problems. The key to understanding is
the structure of chain homotopy equivalence -- the standard one must be
replaced by a finer notion which we call a strong chain homotopy equivalence.
We prove an Ideal Perturbation Lemma and show how both new and classical
results follow from this ideal statement.
