A procedure which obviates the constraint imposed by the conflict between
consistent quantization and the invariance of the Hamiltonian description under
nonlinear canonical transformation is proposed. This new quantization scheme
preserves the Noether point symmetries of the underlying Lagrangian in order to
construct the Schr\"odinger's equation. As an example, the quantization of the
`goldfish' many-body problem extensively studied by Calogero et al. is
presented.
