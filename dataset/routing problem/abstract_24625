The Standard Model (SM) is usually considered to be unnatural because the
scalar Higgs mass receives a quadratic divergent correction. We suggest a new
way to solve the naturalness problem from point of view of renormalization
group method. Our approach is illustrated through the familiar $\phi^4$ theory.
A renormalization group equation for scalar field mass is proposed by
introducing a subtraction scale. We give a non-trivial prediction: the Higss
mass at short-distance is a damping exponential function of the energy scale.
It follows from a characteristic of the SM that the couplings to Higgs are
proportional to field masses, in particular the Higgs self-interactions. In the
ultraviolent limit, the Higgs mass approaches to a mass called by Veltman mass
which is at the order of the electroweak scale. The fine-tuning is not
necessary. The Higgs naturalness problem is solved by radiative corrections
themselves.
