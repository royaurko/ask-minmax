We consider some models of f(R) gravity that can be used to describe, in a
suitable weak-field limit, the gravitational field of the Sun. Using a
perturbative approach, we focus on the impact that the modifications of the
gravitational field, due to the non-linearity of the gravity Lagrangian, have
on the Solar System dynamics. We compare the theoretical predictions for the
precession of the longitude of the pericentre $\varpi$ of a test particle with
the corrections to the standard Newtonian-Einsteinian precessions of the
longitudes of perihelia of some planets of the Solar System recently estimated
by E.V. Pitjeva by fitting large data sets with various versions of the EPM
ephemerides.
