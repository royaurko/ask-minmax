We consider the initial/boundary value problem for a diffusion equation
involving multiple time-fractional derivatives on a bounded convex polyhedral
domain. We analyze a space semidiscrete scheme based on the standard Galerkin
finite element method using continuous piecewise linear functions. Nearly
optimal error estimates for both cases of initial data and inhomogeneous term
are derived, which cover both smooth and nonsmooth data. Further we develop a
fully discrete scheme based on a finite difference discretization of the
time-fractional derivatives, and discuss its stability and error estimate.
Extensive numerical experiments for one and two-dimension problems confirm the
convergence rates of the theoretical results.
