We consider the sum of power weighted nearest neighbor distances in a sample
of size n from a multivariate density f of possibly unbounded support. We give
various criteria guaranteeing that this sum satisfies a law of large numbers
for large n, correcting some inaccuracies in the literature on the way.
Motivation comes partly from the problem of consistent estimation of certain
entropies of f.
