We observe that a significant class of Nash equilibrium problems in
non-potential games can be associated with monotone inclusion problems. We
propose splitting techniques to solve such problems and establish their
convergence. Applications to generalized Nash equilibria, zero-sum games, and
cyclic proximity problems are demonstrated.
