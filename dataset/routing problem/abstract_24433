We provide details on a recent solution of the nucleon's covariant Faddeev
equation in an explicit three-quark approach. The full Poincare-covariant
structure of the three-quark amplitude is implemented through an orthogonal
basis obtained from a partial-wave decomposition. We employ a rainbow-ladder
gluon exchange kernel which allows for a comparison with meson Bethe-Salpeter
and baryon quark-diquark studies. We describe the construction of the
three-quark amplitude in full detail and compare it to a notation widespread in
recent publications. Finally, we discuss first numerical results for the
nucleon's amplitude.
