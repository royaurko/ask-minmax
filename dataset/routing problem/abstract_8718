We provide a complete proof that there are no nontrivial eigenvalues of the
integral operator $\mathcal{K}_l$ outside the interval $(0,1/k)$.
$\mathcal{K}_l$ arises naturally from the deflection problem of a beam with
length $l$ resting horizontally on an elastic foundation with spring constant
$k$, while some vertical load is applied to the beam.
