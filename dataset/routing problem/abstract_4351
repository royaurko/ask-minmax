The results of the Sudbury experiments have seemingly solved the solar
neutrino problem. However, we must remain open to the possibility that these
results may be subjected to new theoretical interpretations in the future.
Should such a reinterpretation transpire, then we may find that the solar
neutrino problem has not been solved. Should that be the case, this paper will
constitute a possible alternative solution to the problem which presents new
theoretical physics.
