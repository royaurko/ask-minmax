In this paper we present a correlation inequality with respect to Cauchy type
measures. To prove our inequality, we transport the problem onto the Riemannian
sphere then state and solve some special cases for a spherical correlation
problem. This method, as we shall explain, opens up a new class of interesting
problems related to correlation type inequalities.
