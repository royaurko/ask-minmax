The aim of antenna array synthesis is to achieve a desired radiation pattern
with the minimum number of antenna elements. In this paper the antenna
synthesis problem is studied from a totally new perspective. One of the key
principles of compressive sensing is that the signal to be sensed should be
sparse or compressible. This coincides with the requirement of minimum number
of element in the antenna array synthesis problem. In this paper the antenna
element of the array can be efficiently reduced via compressive sensing, which
shows a great improvement to the existing antenna synthesis method. Moreover,
the desired radiation pattern can be achieved in a very computation time which
is even shorter than the existing method. Numerical examples are presented to
show the high efficiency of the proposed method.
