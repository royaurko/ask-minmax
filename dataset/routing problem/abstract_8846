The existence of two nontrivial smooth solutions to a semilinear Robin
problem with indefinite unbounded potential and asymmetric nonlinearity $f$ is
established. Both crossing and resonance are allowed. A third nonzero solution
exists provided $f$ is $C^1$. Proofs exploit variational methods, truncation
techniques, and Morse theory.
