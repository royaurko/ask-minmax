We say that an algebraic group $G$ over a field is anti-affine if every
regular function on $G$ is constant. We obtain a classification of these
groups, with applications to the structure of algebraic groups in positive
characteristics, and to the construction of many counterexamples to Hilbert's
fourteenth problem.
