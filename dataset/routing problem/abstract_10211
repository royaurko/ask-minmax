In this paper we address the problem of finding the most probable state of a
discrete Markov random field (MRF), also known as the MRF energy minimization
problem. The task is known to be NP-hard in general and its practical
importance motivates numerous approximate algorithms. We propose a submodular
relaxation approach (SMR) based on a Lagrangian relaxation of the initial
problem. Unlike the dual decomposition approach of Komodakis et al., 2011 SMR
does not decompose the graph structure of the initial problem but constructs a
submodular energy that is minimized within the Lagrangian relaxation. Our
approach is applicable to both pairwise and high-order MRFs and allows to take
into account global potentials of certain types. We study theoretical
properties of the proposed approach and evaluate it experimentally.
