In the early 1990's, an analysis was completed by several theorists of the
available mass/cross-section parameter space for unusual particle candidates to
solve the dark matter problem, e.g. strongly interacting massive particles
(SIMPs). This analysis found several unconstrained windows, such that for SIMP
masses and cross-sections within these windows, SIMPs could still be the
dominant dark matter in our Galactic halo. Since the early 1990's, some of
these windows have been narrowed or closed, and some of these windows have been
widened further by more careful analysis. We summarize the present state of the
SIMP parameter space, and point to the cosmological salience of SIMPs as dark
matter, given some of the present inadequacies of the WIMP solution to the dark
matter problem.
