An ad hoc network is an infrastructureless network in which nodes perform
terminal as well as routing functions. A routing protocol is the only
substitute to complete the communications in the absence of an access point. In
spite of that mobile nodes or so called routers uses some mechanism for
calculating the best route when it has multiple routes for the same
destination. On the basis of one or more metrics routes are ranked from best to
worst. But, in an ad hoc network many factors can affect this decision, such as
the delay, load, route lifetime etc. Thus measuring and finding routes on the
basis of crisp mathematical model for all these attributes is complicated. That
why, the fuzzy approach for best route determination is required for MANET
because some of the metrics are fuzzy or vague and the classical ranking of
routes and transitivity in the ranking does not hold. The proposed
Nontransitive Route Ranking subjective comparison of one route with others and
performs nontransitive ranking to rank routes from best to worst. The pairwise
comparisons of each route with others give more accurate and fair comparison.
The proposed ranking is easier than classical ranking in which metrics have
assigned some value and these values are combined to obtain the ranking.
Experimental result shows the efficiency of the proposed model. Keywords:
