Let G be a reductive algebraic group over a number field k. It is shown how
Emerton's methods may be applied to the problem of p-adically interpolating the
metaplectic forms on G, i.e. the automorphic forms on metaplectic covers of G,
as long as the metaplectic covers involved split at the infinite places of k.
