We consider a SUSY breaking scenario without the Polonyi problem. To solve
the problem, the enhanced couplings of the Polonyi field to an inflaton, gauge
kinetic functions and itself are assumed. As a result, a gaugino mediated SUSY
breaking occurs. In this scenario, the Higgs boson mass becomes consistent with
the recently observed value of the Higgs-like boson (i.e., m_h ~= 125 GeV) for
the gluino mass about 4TeV, which is, however, out of the reach of the LHC
experiment. We show that the trilinear coupling of the scalar top is
automatically enhanced by the presence of the extra matters. With such extra
matters, the Higgs mass as large as 125 GeV can be realized with the gluino
mass of 1-2 TeV which is within the reach of the LHC experiment. In our
scenario, the gravitino is the lightest SUSY particle and the candidate for
dark matter, and the Wino, Bino, and sleptons are in a range from 200 GeV to
700 GeV.
