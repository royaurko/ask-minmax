An asymptotic interation method for solving second-order homogeneous linear
differential equations of the form y'' = lambda(x) y' + s(x) y is introduced,
where lambda(x) \neq 0 and s(x) are C-infinity functions. Applications to
Schroedinger type problems, including some with highly singular potentials, are
presented.
