It is an open problem to determine the dimension of the space of homogeneous
polynomials of a fixed degree vanishing at finitely many points in the
projective plane to certain multiplicities. We present various aspects of this
problem and a version of a known algorithm (originally due to M. Nagata) to
compute this dimension for nine or less points. Our methods are completely
elementary and only involve the representation theory of SL_2.
