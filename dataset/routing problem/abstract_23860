A class of Laplace transforms is examined to show that particular cases of
this class are associated with production-destruction and reaction-diffusion
problems in physics, study of differences of independently distributed random
variables and the concept of Laplacianness in statistics, alpha-Laplace and
Mittag-Leffler stochastic processes, the concepts of infinite divisibility and
geometric infinite divisibility problems in probability theory and certain
fractional integrals and fractional derivatives. A number of applications are
pointed out with special reference to solutions of fractional reaction and
reaction-diffusion equations and their generalizations.
