We introduce a model for directed percolation with a long-range temporal
diffusion, while the spatial diffusion is kept short ranged. In an
interpretation of directed percolation as an epidemic process, this
non-Markovian modification can be understood as incubation times, which are
distributed accordingly to a Levy distribution. We argue that the best approach
to find the effective action for this problem is through a generalization of
the Cardy-Sugar method, adding the non-Markovian features into the geometrical
properties of the lattice. We formulate a field theory for this problem and
renormalize it up to one loop in a perturbative expansion. We solve the various
technical difficulties that the integrations possess by means of an asymptotic
analysis of the divergences. We show the absence of field renormalization at
one-loop order, and we argue that this would be the case to all orders in
perturbation theory. Consequently, in addition to the characteristic scaling
relations of directed percolation, we find a scaling relation valid for the
critical exponents of this theory. In this universality class, the critical
exponents vary continuously with the Levy parameter.
