In parallel computing, a problem is divided into a set of smaller tasks that
are distributed across multiple processing elements. Balancing the load of the
processing elements is key to achieving good performance and scalability. If
the computational costs of the individual tasks vary over time in an
unpredictable way, dynamic load balancing aims at migrating them between
processing elements so as to maintain load balance. During dynamic load
balancing, the tasks amount to indivisible work packets with a real-valued
cost. For this case of indivisible, real- valued loads, we analyze the
balancing circuit model, a local dynamic load-balancing scheme that does not
require global communication. We extend previous analyses to the present case
and provide a probabilistic bound for the achievable load balance. Based on an
analogy with the offline balls-into-bins problem, we further propose a novel
algorithm for dynamic balancing of indivisible, real-valued loads. We benchmark
the proposed algorithm in numerical experiments and compare it with the
classical greedy algorithm, both in terms of solution quality and communication
cost. We find that the increased communication cost of the proposed algorithm
is compensated by a higher solution quality, leading on average to about an
order of magnitude gain in overall performance.
