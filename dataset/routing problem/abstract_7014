This is an inaugural study of the Dirichlet problem associated with a regular
non-definite Sturm-Liouville equation in the case of two turning points. We
give a priori lower bounds on the Richardson numbers associated with this
problem thereby complementing pioneering results by Atkinson and Jabon (1984)
in the one turning point case
