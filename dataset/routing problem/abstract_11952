We consider a model involving a 4-brane in a 6D bulk which carries sigma
model fields. An axion field on the 4-brane cancels the pressure along one
direction leading to an effective codimension-2 3-brane. For a range of
parameters of the theory, we get a transverse space which is non-compact,
providing a possible solution to the cosmological constant problem. A setup
with two branes in a compact space is also treated. In this case, a mild
fine-tuning between the radii of the two 4-branes is necessary. Finally, we
explore the 4-brane problem in the Gauss-Codazzi formulation and we discuss
general aspects of gravity in the presence of additional brane sources.
