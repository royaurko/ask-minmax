A spectral mapping theorem is proved that resolves a key problem in applying
invariant manifold theorems to nonlinear Schr\" odinger type equations. The
theorem is applied to the operator that arises as the linearization of the
equation around a standing wave solution. We cast the problem in the context of
space-dependent nonlinearities that arise in optical waveguide problems. The
result is, however, more generally applicable including to equations in higher
dimensions and even systems. The consequence is that stable, unstable, and
center manifolds exist in the neighborhood of a (stable or unstable) standing
wave, such as a waveguide mode, under simple and commonly verifiable spectral
conditions.
