We discuss the hard-hexagon and hard-square problems, as well as the
corresponding problem on the honeycomb lattice. The case when the activity is
unity is of interest to combinatorialists, being the problem of counting binary
matrices with no two adjacent 1's. For this case we use the powerful corner
transfer matrix method to numerically evaluate the partition function per site,
density and some near-neighbour correlations to high accuracy. In particular
for the square lattice we obtain the partition function per site to 43 decimal
places.
