A well-known chessboard problem is that of placing eight queens on the
chessboard so that no two queens are able to attack each other. (Recall that a
queen can attack anything on the same row, column, or diagonal as itself.) This
problem is known to have been studied by Gauss, and can be generalized to an (n
\times n) board, where (n \geq 4). We consider this problem in $d$-dimensional
chess spaces, where (d \geq 3), and obtain the result that in higher
dimensions, $n$ queens do not always suffice (in any arrangement) to attack all
board positions. Our methods allow us to obtain the first lower bound on the
number of queens that are necessary to attack all positions in a
$d$-dimensional chess space of size $n$, and further to show that for any $k$,
there are higher-dimensional chess spaces in which not all positions can be
attacked by (n^k) queens.
