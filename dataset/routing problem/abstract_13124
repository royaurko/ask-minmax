In this work, after given the definition of soft sets and their basic
operations we define two person soft games which can apply to problems contain
vagueness and uncertainty. We then give four solution methods of the games
which are soft saddle points, soft lover and soft upper values, soft dominated
strategies and soft Nash equilibrium. We also give an example from the real
world which shows that the methods can be successfully applied to a financial
problem. Finally, we extended the two person soft games to n-person soft games.
