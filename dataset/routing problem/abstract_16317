A numerical approach to the problem of wave scattering by many small
particles is developed under the assumptions k<<1, d>>a, where a is the size of
the particles and d is the distance between the neighboring particles. On the
wavelength one may have many small particles. An impedance boundary conditions
are assumed on the boundaries of small particles. The results of numerical
simulation show good agreement with the theory. They open a way to numerical
simulation of the method for creating materials with a desired refraction
coefficient.
