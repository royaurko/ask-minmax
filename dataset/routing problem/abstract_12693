We consider the Euler system of compressible and entropic gaz dynamics in a
bounded open domain with wall boundary condition. We prove the existence and
the stability of families of solutions which correspond to a ground state plus
a large entropy boundary layer. The ground state is a solution of the Euler
system which satisfies some explicit additional conditions on the boundary.
These conditions are used in a reduction of the system. We construct BKW
expansions at all order. The profile problems are linear thanks to a
transparency property. We prove the stability of these expansions by proving
epsilon-conormal estimates for a characteristic boundary value problem.
