We construct automorphisms of $\C^n$ which map certain discrete sequences
one onto another with prescribed finite jet at each point, thus solving a
general Mittag-Leffler interpolation problem for automorphisms. Under certain
circumstances, this can be done while also approximating a given automorphism
on a compact set.
