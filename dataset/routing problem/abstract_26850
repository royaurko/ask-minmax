We consider a nonlinear elliptic Dirichlet equation driven by a nonlinear
nonhomogeneous differential operator involving a Carath\'{e}odory reaction
which is $(p-1)$-superlinear but does not satisfy the Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz
condition. First we prove a three-solutions-theorem extending an earlier
classical result of Wang (Ann. Inst. H. Poincar\'e Anal. Non Lin\'eaire 8
(1991), no. 1, 43--57). Subsequently, by imposing additional conditions on the
reaction $f(x,\cdot)$, we produce two more nontrivial constant sign solutions
and a nodal solution for a total of five nontrivial solutions. In the special
case of $(p,2)$-equations we prove the existence of a second nodal solution for
a total of six nontrivial solutions given with complete sign information.
Finally, we study a nonlinear eigenvalue problem and we show that the problem
has at least two nontrivial positive solutions for all parameters $\lambda>0$
sufficiently small where one solution vanishes in the Sobolev norm as $\lambda
\to 0^+$ and the other one blows up (again in the Sobolev norm) as $\lambda \to
0^+$.
