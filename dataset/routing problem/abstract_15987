The Scaled Boundary Finite Element Method is a novel semi-analytical method
jointly developed by Chongmin Song and John P Wolf to solve problems in
elastodynamics and allied problems in civil engineering. This novel method has
been recently reformulated for the following categories of problems in
electromagnetics: (1) Determination of Eigen values of metallic cavity
structures, 2) Full wave analysis of Shielded micro-strip transmission line
structures, and Very Large Scale Integrated Circuit (VLSI) interconnects, and
3) Full wave analysis of periodic structures. In this paper, a novel Scaled
Boundary Finite Element formulation is developed for the numerical simulation
of the time harmonic electromagnetic radiation in free space from metallic
structures of arbitrary shape. The development of the novel formulation
necessitates the generalization of the familiar Atkinson-Wilcox radiation
series expansion so as to be applicable for arbitrary boundary circumscribing
the source of radiation.
