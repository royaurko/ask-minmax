In this paper, we study the program-point reachability problem of concurrent
pushdown systems that communicate via unbounded and unordered message buffers.
Our goal is to relax the common restriction that messages can only be retrieved
by a pushdown process when its stack is empty. We use the notion of partially
commutative context-free grammars to describe a new class of asynchronously
communicating pushdown systems with a mild shape constraint on the stacks for
which the program-point coverability problem remains decidable. Stacks that fit
the shape constraint may reach arbitrary heights; further a process may execute
any communication action (be it process creation, message send or retrieval)
whether or not its stack is empty. This class extends previous computational
models studied in the context of asynchronous programs, and enables the safety
verification of a large class of message passing programs.
