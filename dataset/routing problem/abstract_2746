Web content delivery is one of the most important services on the Internet.
Access to websites is typically secured via TLS. However, this security model
does not account for prefix hijacking on the network layer, which may lead to
traffic blackholing or transparent interception. Thus, to achieve comprehensive
security and service availability, additional protective mechanisms are
necessary such as the RPKI, a recently deployed Resource Public Key
Infrastructure to prevent hijacking of traffic by networks. This paper argues
two positions. First, that modern web hosting practices make route protection
challenging due to the propensity to spread servers across many different
networks, often with unpredictable client redirection strategies; and, second,
that we need a better understanding why protection mechanisms are not deployed.
To initiate this, we empirically explore the relationship between web hosting
infrastructure and RPKI deployment. Perversely, we find that less popular
websites are more likely to be secured than the prominent sites. Worryingly, we
find many large-scale CDNs do not support RPKI, thus making their customers
vulnerable. This leads us to explore business reasons why operators are
hesitant to deploy RPKI, which may help to guide future research on improving
Internet security.
