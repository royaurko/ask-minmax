We consider the number of configurations of a surface in two dimensions that
has a prescribed length and encloses a prescribed perimeter with respect to a
baseline. An approximate analytical treatment in a semi--continuum compares
favourably with results from an exact algorithm for the discrete lattice. This
work is relevant for finding the entropy associated with macroscopic
configurations of such systems as domain growth problems,
evaporation--deposition problems, membrane physics, or polymer physics.
