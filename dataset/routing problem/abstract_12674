We survey the relationships of rank one self-adjoint and unitary
perturbations as well as finite rank unitary perturbations with various
branches of analysis and mathematical physics. We include the case of non-inner
characteristic operator functions. For rank one perturbations and non-inner
characteristic functions, we prove a representation formula for the adjoint of
the Clark operator. Throughout we mention many open problems at varying levels
of difficulty.
