Though World Wide Web is the single largest source of information, it is
ill-equipped to serve the people with vision related problems. With the
prolific increase in the interest to make the web accessible to all sections of
the society, solving this accessibility problem becomes mandatory. This paper
presents a technique for making web pages accessible for people with low vision
issues. A model for making web pages accessible, WILI (Web Interface for people
with Low-vision Issues) has been proposed. The approach followed in this work
is to automatically replace the existing display style of a web page with a new
skin following the guidelines given by Clear Print Booklet provided by Royal
National Institute of Blind. "Single Click Solution" is one of the primary
advantages provided by WILI. A prototype using the WILI model is implemented
and various experiments are conducted. The results of experiments conducted on
WILI indicate 82% effective conversion rate.
