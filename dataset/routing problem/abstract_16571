This paper investigates the task solvability of mobile robot systems subject
to Byzantine faults. We first consider the gathering problem, which requires
all robots to meet in finite time at a non-predefined location. It is known
that the solvability of Byzantine gathering strongly depends on a number of
system attributes, such as synchrony, the number of Byzantine robots,
scheduling strategy, obliviousness, orientation of local coordinate systems and
so on. However, the complete characterization of the attributes making
Byzantine gathering solvable still remains open.
  In this paper, we show strong impossibility results of Byzantine gathering.
Namely, we prove that Byzantine gathering is impossible even if we assume one
Byzantine fault, an atomic execution system, the n-bounded centralized
scheduler, non-oblivious robots, instantaneous movements and a common
orientation of local coordinate systems (where n denote the number of correct
robots). Those hypotheses are much weaker than used in previous work, inducing
a much stronger impossibility result.
  At the core of our impossibility result is a reduction from the distributed
consensus problem in asynchronous shared-memory systems. In more details, we
newly construct a generic reduction scheme based on the distributed
BG-simulation. Interestingly, because of its versatility, we can easily extend
our impossibility result for general pattern formation problems.
