Infrared features of gluon propagator, ghost propagator, QCD running coupling
and the Kugo-Ojima parameter in lattice Landau gauge QCD are presented. The
framework of PMS analysis suggests that there appear infrared, intermediate and
ultraviolet regions specified by $\Lambda_{\bar{MS}}$, $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$.
The propagators and the running coupling of $q>1GeV$ are fitted by the
$\widetilde{MOM}$ scheme using the factorization scale as the scale parameter.
The running coupling data of $q<14GeV$ are fitted by the contour improved
perturbation method. The Gribov copy problem is studied in SU(2), $\beta= 2.2$
samples by comparing the data gauge fixed by the parallel tempering method and
the data gauge fixed by the straightforward gauge fixing. The Gribov noise
effect turned out to be about 2%.
