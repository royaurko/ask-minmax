We study the problem of cooling a mechanical oscillator using the
photothermal (bolometric) force. Contrary to previous attempts to model this
system, we take into account the noise effects due to the granular nature of
photon absorption. This allows us to tackle the cooling problem down to the
noise dominated regime and to find reasonable estimates for the lowest
achievable phonon occupation in the cantilever.
