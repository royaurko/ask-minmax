Speech recognition based on the syllable segment is discussed in this paper.
The principal search methods in space of states for the speech recognition
problem by segment-syllabic parameters trajectory synthesis are investigated.
Recognition as comparison the parameters trajectories in chosen speech units on
the sections of the segmented speech is realized. Some experimental results are
given and discussed.
