In this paper, we consider the Harry-Dym equation on the line with decaying
initial value. The Fokas unified method is used to construct the solution of
the Harry-Dym equation via a $2 \times 2$ matrix Riemann Hilbert problem in the
complex plane. Further, one-cups soltion solution is expressed in terms of
solutions of the Riemann Hilbert problem.
