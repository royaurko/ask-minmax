We describe the procedure, nuances, issues, and choices involved in creating
times-of-arrival (TOAs), residuals and error bars from a set of radio pulsar
timing data. We discuss the issue of mis-matched templates, the problem that
wide- bandwidth backends introduce, possible solutions to that problem, and
correcting for offsets introduced by various observing systems.
