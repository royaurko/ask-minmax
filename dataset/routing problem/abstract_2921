In this paper, we consider the problem of choosing a set of multi-party
contracts, where each coalition of agents has a non-empty finite set of
contracts to choose from. We call such problems, contract choice problems. We
provide conditions under which a contract choice problem has a non-empty set of
"stable" outcomes. There are two types of stability concepts we study in this
paper: cooperative stability and non-cooperative stability. The cooperative
stability concept that we invoke here is the core. The non-cooperative
stability concept that we study here is individual stability. The final result
of this paper states that every contract choice problem has a non-empty weak
bargaining set.
