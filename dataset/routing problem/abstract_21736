In this paper we are concerned with a new class of BVP' s consisting of
eigendependent boundary conditions and two supplementary transmission
conditions at one interior point. By modifying some techniques of classical
Sturm-Liouville theory and suggesting own approaches we find asymptotic
formulas for the eigenvalues and eigenfunction.
