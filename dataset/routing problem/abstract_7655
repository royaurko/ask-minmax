We investigate whether uncoded schemes are optimal for Gaussian sources on
multiuser Gaussian channels. Particularly, we consider two problems: the first
is to send correlated Gaussian sources on a Gaussian broadcast channel where
each receiver is interested in reconstructing only one source component (or one
specific linear function of the sources) under the mean squared error
distortion measure; the second is to send vector Gaussian sources on a Gaussian
multiple-access channel, where each transmitter observes a noisy combination of
the source, and the receiver wishes to reconstruct the individual source
components (or individual linear functions) under the mean squared error
distortion measure. It is shown that when the channel parameters match certain
general conditions, the induced distortion tuples are on the boundary of the
achievable distortion region, and thus optimal. Instead of following the
conventional approach of attempting to characterize the achievable distortion
region, we ask the question whether and how a match can be effectively
determined. This decision problem formulation helps to circumvent the difficult
optimization problem often embedded in region characterization problems, and
also leads us to focus on the critical conditions in the outer bounds that make
the inequalities become equalities, which effectively decouples the overall
problem into several simpler sub-problems.
