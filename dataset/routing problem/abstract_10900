We have investigated the bound states of an electron and positron in
superstrong magnetic fields typical for neutron stars. The complete
relativistic problem of positronium in a strong magnetic field has not been
succesfully solved up to now. In particular, we have studied the positronium
when it moves relativistically across the magnetic field. A number of problems
which deal with the pulsar magnetosphere, as well as the evolution of
protoneutron stars, could be considered as a field for application.
