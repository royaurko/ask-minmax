The purpose of this article is to give an overview of the construction of
moduli spaces of curves from the viewpoint of the log minimal model program for
M_g by providing an update of recent developments and discussing future
problems. This survey is distinguished from the recent articles of
Fedorchuk-Smyth and Morrison in its focus on low degree Hilbert stability of
curves.
