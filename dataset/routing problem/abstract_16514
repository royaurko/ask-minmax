We develop a Bayesian framework for tackling the supervised clustering
problem, the generic problem encountered in tasks such as reference matching,
coreference resolution, identity uncertainty and record linkage. Our clustering
model is based on the Dirichlet process prior, which enables us to define
distributions over the countably infinite sets that naturally arise in this
problem. We add supervision to our model by positing the existence of a set of
unobserved random variables (we call these "reference types") that are generic
across all clusters. Inference in our framework, which requires integrating
over infinitely many parameters, is solved using Markov chain Monte Carlo
techniques. We present algorithms for both conjugate and non-conjugate priors.
We present a simple--but general--parameterization of our model based on a
Gaussian assumption. We evaluate this model on one artificial task and three
real-world tasks, comparing it against both unsupervised and state-of-the-art
supervised algorithms. Our results show that our model is able to outperform
other models across a variety of tasks and performance metrics.
