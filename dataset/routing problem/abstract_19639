Using equivalencies between different models we reduce the model of two
spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains crossed at one point to the model of free fermions.
The spin-spin correlation function is calculated by summing the perturbation
series in the interchain coupling. The result reveals a power law decay with a
nonuniversal exponent.
