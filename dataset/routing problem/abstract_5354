The rational covariance extension problem (RCEP) is an important problem in
systems and control occurring in such diverse fields as control, estimation,
system identification, and signal and image processing, leading to many
fundamental theoretical questions. In fact, this inverse problem is a key
component in many signal processing techniques and plays a fundamental role in
prediction, analysis, and modeling of signals. It is well-known that the RCEP
can be reformulated as a (truncated) trigonometric moment problem subject to a
rationality condition. In this paper we consider the more general
multidimensional trigonometric moment problem with a similar rationality
constraint. This generalization creates many interesting new questions and also
provides new insights into the original one-dimensional problem. A key concept
in this approach is the complete smooth parametrization of all solutions,
allowing solutions to be tuned to satisfy additional design specifications
without violating the complexity constraints. As an illustration of the
potential of this approach we apply our results to image compression. This is
just a first step in this direction, and we expect that more elaborate tuning
strategies will enhance this compression procedure in the future.
