We develop an elliptic theory based in $L^2$ of boundary value problems for
general wedge differential operators of first order under only mild assumptions
on the boundary spectrum. In particular, we do not require the indicial roots
to be constant along the base of the boundary fibration.
  Our theory includes as a special case the classical theory of elliptic
boundary value problems for first order operators with and without the
Shapiro-Lopatinskii condition, and can be thought of as a natural extension of
that theory to the geometrically and analytically relevant class of wedge
operators. Wedge operators arise in the global analysis on manifolds with
incomplete edge singularities. Our theory settles, in the first order case, the
long-standing open problem to develop a robust elliptic theory of boundary
value problems for such operators.
