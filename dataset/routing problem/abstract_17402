This article discusses the well-posedness and error analysis of the coupling
of finite and boundary elements for transmission or contact problems in
nonlinear elasticity. It concerns W^{1,p}-monotone Hencky materials with an
unbounded stress-strain relation, as they arise in the modelling of ice sheets,
non-Newtonian fluids or porous media. For 1<p<2 the bilinear form of the
boundary element method fails to be continuous in natural function spaces
associated to the nonlinear operator. We propose a functional analytic
framework for the numerical analysis and obtain a priori and a posteriori error
estimates for Galerkin approximations to the resulting boundary/domain
variational inequality. The a posteriori estimate complements recent estimates
obtained for mixed finite element formulations of friction problems in linear
elasticity.
