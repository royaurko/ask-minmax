We show that the finite satisfiability problem for the guarded two-variable
fragment with counting quantifiers is in EXPTIME. The method employed also
yields a simple proof of a result recently obtained by Y. Kazakov, that the
satisfiability problem for the guarded two-variable fragment with counting
quantifiers is in EXPTIME.
