We first discuss an approach to the fermion mass problem, according to which
the whole of flavour mixing for quarks is determined by the mechanism
responsible for generating the physical masses of the up and down quarks: the
Lightest Flavour Mass Generation model. Then we consider fermion masses in the
Anti-grand Unification Theory and, in particular, the neutrino mass and mixing
problem.
