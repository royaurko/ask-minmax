Due to the sign problem, it is exponentially difficult to study QCD on the
lattice at finite chemical potential. We propose a method --an overlap
improving multi-parameter reweighting technique-- to alleviate this problem. We
apply this method and give the phase diagram of four-flavor QCD obtained on
lattices 4^4 and 4\cdot6^3. Our results are based on {\cal{O}}(10^3-10^4)
configurations.
