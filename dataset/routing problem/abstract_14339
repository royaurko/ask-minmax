Formulating a Schubert problem as the solutions to a system of equations in
either Pl\"ucker space or in the local coordinates of a Schubert cell usually
involves more equations than variables. Using reduction to the diagonal, we
previously gave a primal-dual formulation for Schubert problems that involved
the same number of variables as equations (a square formulation). Here, we give
a different square formulation by lifting incidence conditions which typically
involves fewer equations and variables. Our motivation is certification of
numerical computation using Smale's \alpha-theory.
