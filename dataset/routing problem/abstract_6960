In the present paper the linearized problem of plasma oscillations in slab
(particularly, thin films) in external longitudinal alternating electric field
is solved analytically. Specular boundary conditions of electron reflection
from the plasma boundary are considered. Coefficients of continuous and
discrete spectra of the problem are found, and electron distribution function
on the plasma boundary and electric field are expressed in explicit form.
Absorption of energy of electric field in slab is calculated.
