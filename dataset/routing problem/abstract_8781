This is an expository paper on the asymptotic results concerning path
behaviour of the anisotropic random walk on the two-dimensional square lattice
Z^2. In recent years Mikl\'os and the contributors of the present paper investigated
the properties of this random walk concerning strong approximations, local
times and range. We give a survey of these results together with some further
problems.
