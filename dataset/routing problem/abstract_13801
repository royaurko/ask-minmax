Diffusion in nonhomogeneous media is described by a dynamical process driven
by a general Levy noise and subordinated to a random time; the subordinator
depends on the position. This problem is approximated by a multiplicative
process subordinated to a random time: it separately takes into account effects
related to the medium structure and the memory. Density distributions and
moments are derived from the solutions of the corresponding Langevin equation
and compared with the numerical calculations for the exact problem. Both
subdiffusion and enhanced diffusion are predicted. Distribution of the process
satisfies the fractional Fokker-Planck equation.
