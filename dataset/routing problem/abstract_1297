(NaxKy)FezSe2 crystals are prepared by Na, Fe, and Se as starting materials
in NaCl/KCl flux at low temperatures~720 {\deg}C. It is found that K is more
preferred than Na to enter in between FeSe layers and forms the phase.
Thus-obtained crystals contain more superconducting phase in volume fraction
and exhibit new features in transport property. Our results provide a promising
new synthetic route for preparing quality crystals of iron selenide
superconductors.
