We propose new confinement structures similar to heterostructures and
superlattices. The new heteostructures can be obtained by applying strain to a
single material in a periodic or aperiodic way. The conversion of an indirect
gap into an optical active direct or quasi-direct gap problem has also been
investigated together with the role of zone folding in this phenomenon.
