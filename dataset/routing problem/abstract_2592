Motivated by recent spectroscopic observations suggesting that atmospheres of
some extrasolar giant-planets are carbon-rich, i.e. carbon/oxygen ratio (C/O)
$\ge$ 1, we find that the whole set of compositional data for Jupiter is
consistent with the hypothesis that it be a carbon-rich giant planet. We show
that the formation of Jupiter in the cold outer part of an oxygen-depleted disk
(C/O $\sim$1) reproduces the measured Jovian elemental abundances at least as
well as the hitherto canonical model of Jupiter formed in a disk of solar
composition (C/O = 0.54). The resulting O abundance in Jupiter's envelope is
then moderately enriched by a factor of $\sim$2 $\times$ solar (instead of
$\sim$7 $\times$ solar) and is found to be consistent with values predicted by
thermochemical models of the atmosphere. That Jupiter formed in a disk with C/O
$\sim$1 implies that water ice was heterogeneously distributed over several AU
beyond the snow line in the primordial nebula and that the fraction of water
contained in icy planetesimals was a strong function of their formation
location and time. The Jovian oxygen abundance to be measured by NASA's Juno
mission en route to Jupiter will provide a direct and strict test of our
predictions.
