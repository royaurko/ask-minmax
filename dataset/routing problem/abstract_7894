In 1910 E. Cartan constructed the canonical frame and found the most
symmetric case for maximally nonholonomic rank 2 distributions on a
5-dimensional manifold. We solve the analogous problems for rank 2
distributions on an n-dimensional manifold for arbitrary n greater than 5. Our
method is a kind of symplectification of the problem and it is completely
different from the Cartan method of equivalence.
