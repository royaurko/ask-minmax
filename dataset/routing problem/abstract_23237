We reconsider the well-known and long-debated problem of the calculation of
the eigenvalues of the Herbst Hamiltonian 2\sqrt{p^2 +m^2} - \kappa/r. We give
a formulation of the problem that allows, for the first time, a perturbative
evaluation of the eigenvalues for any n and l, and in principle up to any order
in \kappa via standard Kato perturbation theory. We present the evaluation of
the energy of the n=1 and n=2 states up to \kappa^6, confirming the result
previously obtained by Le Yaouanc et al. with a completely different technique.
Moreover we give the n=2, l=1 level, which is new. Discussion of the results
and comparison with previous findings are given at the end.
