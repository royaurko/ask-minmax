The process of proton emission from nuclei is studied by utilizing the
two-potential approach of Gurvitz and Kalbermann in the context of the full
many-body problem. A time-dependent approach is used for calculating the decay
width. Starting from an initial many-body quasi-stationary state, we employ the
Feshbach projection operator approach and reduce the formalism to an effective
one-body problem. We show that the decay width can be expressed in terms of a
one-body matrix element multiplied by a normalization factor. We demonstrate
that the traditional interpretation of this normalization as the square root of
a spectroscopic factor is only valid for one particular choice of projection
operator. This causes no problem for the calculation of the decay width in a
consistent microscopic approach, but it leads to ambiguities in the
interpretation of experimental results. In particular, spectroscopic factors
extracted from a comparison of the measured decay width with a calculated
single-particle width may be affected.
