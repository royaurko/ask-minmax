We describe a binding schema markup language (BSML) for describing data
interchange between scientific codes. Such a facility is an important
constituent of scientific problem solving environments (PSEs). BSML is designed
to integrate with a PSE or application composition system that views model
specification and execution as a problem of managing semistructured data. The
data interchange problem is addressed by three techniques for processing
semistructured data: validation, binding, and conversion. We present BSML and
describe its application to a PSE for wireless communications system design.
