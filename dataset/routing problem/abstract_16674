We determine the exact threshold of satisfiability for random instances of a
particular NP-complete constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). This is the first
random CSP model for which we have determined a precise linear satisfiability
threshold, and for which random instances with density near that threshold
appear to be computationally difficult. More formally, it is the first random
CSP model for which the satisfiability threshold is known and which shares the
following characteristics with random k-SAT for k >= 3. The problem is
NP-complete, the satisfiability threshold occurs when there is a linear number
of clauses, and a uniformly random instance with a linear number of clauses
asymptotically almost surely has exponential resolution complexity.
