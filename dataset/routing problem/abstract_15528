We describe a highly flexible framework to solve 3D radiation transfer
problems in scattering dominated environments based on a long characteristics
piece-wise parabolic formal solution and an operator splitting method. We find
that the linear systems are efficiently solved with iterative solvers such as
Gauss-Seidel and Jordan techniques. We use a sphere-in-a-box test model to
compare the 3D results to 1D solutions in order to assess the accuracy of the
method. We have implemented the method for static media, however, it can be
used to solve problems in the Eulerian-frame for media with low velocity
fields.
