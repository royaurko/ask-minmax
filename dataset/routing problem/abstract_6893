We study the problem of forecasting volatility for the multifractal random
walk model. In order to avoid the ill posed problem of estimating the
correlation length T of the model, we introduce a limiting object defined in a
quotient space; formally, this object is an infinite range logvolatility. For
this object and the non limiting object, we obtain precise prediction formulas
and we apply them to the problem of forecasting volatility and pricing options
with the MRW model in the absence of a reliable estimate of the average
volatility and T.
