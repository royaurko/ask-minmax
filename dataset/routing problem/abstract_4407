We consider the associated linear problem for a q-analogue of the fifth
Painleve equation (qPV). We identify a lattice of connection preserving
deformations in the space of the connection data for the linear problem with
the lattice of translational Backlund transformations for qPV, hence, show all
translational Backlund transformations possess a Lax pair. We shall show that
the big q-Laguerre polynomials, and a suitable generalization, solve a special
case of the linear problem, hence, find solutions to qPV in terms of
determinants of Hankel matrices with entries consisting of rational or
hypergeometric functions.
