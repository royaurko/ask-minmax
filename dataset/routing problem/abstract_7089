In this paper, we analyze the subspace migration that occurs in limited-view
inverse scattering problems. Based on the structure of singular vectors
associated with the nonzero singular values of the multi-static response
matrix, we establish a relationship between the subspace migration imaging
function and Bessel functions of integer order of the first kind. The revealed
structure and numerical examples demonstrate why subspace migration is
applicable for the imaging of small scatterers in limited-view inverse
scattering problems.
