This paper goes back to a famous problem of Mahler in metrical Diophantine
approximation. The problem has been settled by Sprindzuk and subsequently
improved by Alan Baker and Vasili Bernik. In particular, Bernik's result
establishes a convergence Khintchine type theorem for Diophantine approximation
by polynomials, that is it allows arbitrary monotonic error of approximation.
In the present paper the monotonicity assumption is completely removed.
