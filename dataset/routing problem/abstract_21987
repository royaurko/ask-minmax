An initial-boundary value problem for the 2D Zakharov-Kuznetsov-Burgers
equation posed on a channel-type strip was considered. The existence and
uniqueness results for regular and weak solutions in weighted spaces as well as
exponential decay of small solutions without restrictions on the width of a
strip were proven both for regular solutions in an elevated norm and for weak
solutions in the $L^2$-norm.
