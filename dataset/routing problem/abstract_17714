A wide variety of fundamental data analyses in machine learning, such as
linear and logistic regression, require minimizing a convex function defined by
the data. Since the data may contain sensitive information about individuals,
and these analyses can leak that sensitive information, it is important to be
able to solve convex minimization in a privacy-preserving way.
  A series of recent results show how to accurately solve a single convex
minimization problem in a differentially private manner. However, the same data
is often analyzed repeatedly, and little is known about solving multiple convex
minimization problems with differential privacy. For simpler data analyses,
such as linear queries, there are remarkable differentially private algorithms
such as the private multiplicative weights mechanism (Hardt and Rothblum, FOCS
2010) that accurately answer exponentially many distinct queries. In this work,
we extend these results to the case of convex minimization and show how to give
accurate and differentially private solutions to *exponentially many* convex
minimization problems on a sensitive dataset.
