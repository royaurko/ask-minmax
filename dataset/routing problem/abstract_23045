The initial value problem for the Vlasov-Poisson system is by now well
understood in the case of an isolated system where, by definition, the
distribution function of the particles as well as the gravitational potential
vanish at spatial infinity. Here we start with homogeneous solutions, which
have a spatially constant, non-zero mass density and which describe the mass
distribution in a Newtonian model of the universe. These homogeneous states can
be constructed explicitly, and we consider deviations from such homogeneous
states, which then satisfy a modified version of the Vlasov-Poisson system. We
prove global existence and uniqueness of classical solutions to the
corresponding initial value problem for initial data which represent spatially
periodic deviations from homogeneous states.
