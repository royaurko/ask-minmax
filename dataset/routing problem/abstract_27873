The perfect matching problem has a randomized NC algorithm, using the
celebrated Isolation Lemma of Mulmuley, Vazirani and Vazirani. The Isolation
Lemma states that giving a random weight assignment to the edges of a graph,
ensures that it has a unique minimum weight perfect matching, with a good
probability. We derandomize this lemma for $K_{3,3}$-free and $K_5$-free
bipartite graphs, i.e. we give a deterministic log-space construction of such a
weight assignment for these graphs. Such a construction was known previously
for planar bipartite graphs. Our result implies that the perfect matching
problem for $K_{3,3}$-free and $K_5$-free bipartite graphs is in SPL.
  It also gives an alternate proof for an already known result -- reachability
for $K_{3,3}$-free and $K_5$-free graphs is in UL.
