The problem of finding the elastic strains arising due to the converse
flexoelectric effect is solved for a case of uniformly polarized ball of
isotropic dielectric material. The strains occurs due to the fact that, as
shown in a previous paper, in presence of flexoelectricity elastic boundary
condition has non-classical form.
