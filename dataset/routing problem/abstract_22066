In this paper we consider the initial value problem for a family of shallow
water equations on the line $\R$ with various asymptotic conditions at
infinity. In particular we construct solutions with prescribed asymptotic
expansion as $x\to\pm\infty$ and prove their invariance with respect to the
solution map.
