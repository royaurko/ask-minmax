It is shown that the Rayleigh's dissipation function can be successfully
applied in the solution of mechanical problems involving friction non-linear in
the velocities. Through the study of surfaces at contact we arrive at a simple
integral expression which gives directly the Rayleigh dissipation function in
terms of generalized coordinates. In this way the solutions of Lagrangian
problems with friction are reduced to often elementary calculations of the
kinetic energy, the potential energy and the Rayleigh dissipation function.
Some examples of pedagogical interest are given.
