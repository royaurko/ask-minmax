We suggest that the Standard Model can be viewed as the magnetic dual of a
gauge theory featuring only fermionic matter content. We show this by first
introducing a Pati-Salam like extension of the Standard Model and then relating
it to a possible dual electric theory featuring only fermionic matter. The
absence of scalars in the electric theory indicates that the associated
magnetic theory is free from quadratic divergences. Our novel solution to the
Standard Model hierarchy problem leads also to a new insight on the mystery of
the observed number of fundamental fermion generations by naturally explaining
why it has to be at least three.
