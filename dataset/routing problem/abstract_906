The most simple and seemingly straightforward application of the photon
blockade effect, in which the transport of one photon prevents the transport of
others, would be to separate two incoming indistinguishable photons to
different output ports. We show that time-energy uncertainty relations
inherently prevent this ideal situation when the blockade is implemented by a
two-level system. The fundamental nature of this limit is revealed in the fact
that photon blockade in the strong coupling regime of cavity QED, resulting
from the nonlinearity of the Jaynes-Cummings energy level structure, exhibits
efficiency and temporal behavior identical to those of photon blockade in the
bad cavity regime, where the underlying nonlinearity is that of the atom
itself. We demonstrate that this limit can be exceeded, yet not avoided, by
exploiting time-energy entanglement between the incident photons. Finally, we
show how this limit can be circumvented completely by using a three-level atom
coupled to a single-sided cavity, enabling an ideal and robust photon routing
mechanism.
