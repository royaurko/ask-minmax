The single particle equations describing motion of carriers in external
potential in 2D Dirac-like and Kane intrinsic semiconductors are obtained
within second quantization method. The terms renormalizing external potential
in these equations, referred to as spin-orbit (SO) terms, are compared with
their classical counterpart. The well-known expression for SO obtained in
relativistic Dirac theory arises in considered approach in the second order in
$\gamma k / E_g$ ($\gamma$ - characteristic velocity, $E_g$ - energy gap)
parameter if electron-hole pair production terms are neglected. It is shown
that in Kane problem the modifying terms are of standard SO functional
Dirac-like form only for electrons in the case of ``positive'' energy gap and
for light holes in semiconductors with ``negative'' energy gap. The general
expression for renormalizing terms has in all cases non-local character. The
arising of correction terms to single particle potentials which do not depend
on band parameters is demonstrated for 2D gapless Dirac problem (graphene) and
for Kane model. The origin of such ``topological'' terms is attributed to the
presence of degenerate bands in considered problems.
