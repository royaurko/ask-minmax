We study a family of continued fraction expansion of reals from the unit
interval. The Perron-Frobenius operator of the transformation which generates
this expansion under the invariant measure of this transformation is given.
Using the ergodic behavior of homogeneous random system with complete
connections associated with this expansion we solve a variant of Gauss-Kuzmin
problem for this continued fraction expansion.
