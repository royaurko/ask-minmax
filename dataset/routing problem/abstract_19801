We perform dynamical QCD simulations with $n_f=2$ overlap fermions by hybrid
Monte-Carlo method on $6^4$ to $8^3\times 16$ lattices. We study the problem of
topological sector changing. A new method is proposed which works without
topological sector changes. We use this new method to determine the topological
susceptibility at various quark masses.
