Cluster based routing protocols forWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been
widely used for better performance in terms of energy efficiency. Efficient use
of energy is challenging task of designing these protocols. Energy holes are
created due to quickly drain the energy of a few nodes due to nonuniform node
distribution in the network. Normally, energy holes make the data routing
failure when nodes transmit data back to the sink. We propose
Energy-efficientHOle Removing Mechanism (E-HORM) technique to remove energy
holes. In this technique, we use sleep and awake mechanism for sensor nodes to
save energy. This approach finds the maximum distance nodes to calculate the
maximum energy for data transmission. We consider it as a threshold energy Eth.
Every node first checks its energy level for data transmission. If the energy
level of node is less than Eth, it cannot transmit data.
