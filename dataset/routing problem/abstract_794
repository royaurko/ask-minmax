In the today's Internet and TCP/IP-networks, the queueing of packets is
commonly implemented using the protocol FIFO (First In First Out).
Unfortunately, FIFO performs poorly in the Adversarial Queueing Theory. Other
queueing strategies are researched in this model and better results are
performed by alternative queueing strategies, e.g. LIS (Longest In System).
This article introduces a new queueing protocol called interval-strategy that
is concerned with the reduction from dynamic to static routing. We discuss the
maximum system time for a packet and estimate with up-to-date results how this
can be achieved. We figure out the maximum amount of time where a packet can
spend in the network (i.e. worst case system time), and argue that the
universal instability of the presented interval-strategy can be reached through
these results. When a large group of queueing strategies is used for queueing,
we prove that the interval-strategy will be universally unstable. Finally, we
calculate the maximum time of the static routing to reach an universal stable
and polynomial - in detail linear - bounded interval-strategy. Afterwards we
close - in order to check this upper bound - with up-to-date results about the
delivery times in static routing.
