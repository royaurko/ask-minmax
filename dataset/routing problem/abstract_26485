Group communication can benefit from Internet Protocol (IP) multicast
protocol to achieve efficient exchange of messages. However, IP multicast does
not provide any mechanisms for authentication. In literature, many solutions to
solve this problem were presented. It has been shown that Wong and Lam protocol
is the only protocol that can resist both packet loss and pollution attacks. In
contrast, it has high computation and communication overheads. In the present
paper, an efficient design for the implementation of Wong and Lam multicast
authentication protocol is proposed. In order to solve the computation overhead
problem, we use two-levels of parallelism. To reduce the communication
overhead, we use Universal Message Authentication Codes (UMAC) instead of hash
functions. The design is analyzed for both NTRU and elliptic curve cryptography
signature algorithms. The analysis shows that the proposed design decreases
significantly the execution time of Wong-Lam protocol which makes it suitable
for real-time applications.
