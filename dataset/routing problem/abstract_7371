An introduction to the universal algebra approach to Higman-Thompson groups,
including Thompson's group $V$, is given, following a series of lectures by
Graham Higman in 1973. The algorithm for the conjugacy problem, as outlined in
the lectures, is shown to be incomplete, and a revised and complete version of
the algorithm is written out explicitly. An algorithm for the power conjugacy
problem in these groups is constructed based on the conjugacy algorithm. Python
implementations of these algorithms can be found at [D15].
