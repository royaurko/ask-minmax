When $p$ and $p+2$ are primes, such as $3,5; 5,7; 11,13; 17,19; ...$. We call
them pairs of prime twins. In this paper we use sieve method (Liu sieve) to
construct the weak solution (i.e. formal solution) of prime twins. Then we use
auxiliary special 4 sieve problem and its biological model to prove that weak
equals classical, i.e. the weak solution is a classical one, hence the numbers
of prime twins are infinite.
