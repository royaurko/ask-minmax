This survey note describes a brief systemic view to approaches for evaluation
of hierarchical composite (modular) systems. The list of considered issues
involves the following: (i) basic assessment scales (quantitative scale,
ordinal scale, multicriteria description, two kinds of poset-like scales), (ii)
basic types of scale transformations problems, (iii) basic types of scale
integration methods. Evaluation of the modular systems is considered as
assessment of system components (and their compatibility) and integration of
the obtained local estimates into the total system estimate(s). This process is
based on the above-mentioned problems (i.e., scale transformation and
integration). Illustrations of the assessment problems and evaluation
approaches are presented (including numerical examples).
