We present a unified approach to the problems of reconstruction of
large-scale structure distribution in the universe and determination of the
underlying power spectrum. These have often been treated as two separate
problems and different analysis techniques have been developed for both. We
show that there exists a simple relation between the optimal solutions to the
two problems, allowing to solve for both within the same formalism. This allows
one to apply computational techniques developed for one method to the other,
which often leads to a significant reduction in the computational time. It also
provides a self consistent treatment of linear reconstruction by optimally
computing the power spectrum from the data itself.
