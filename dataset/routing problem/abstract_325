This paper is concerned with simultaneous route-and-departure choice dynamic
user equilibrium with elastic travel demand (E-DUE), in which the trip matrix
is determined endogenously. We present and prove an infinite-dimensional
variational inequality (VI) formulation for the continuous-time E-DUE problem.
An existence result for this VI is established by applying the fixed-point
existence theorem (Browder, 1968) in an extended Hilbert space. Regarding
computation of the E-DUE problem we present three algorithms based on the VI
and differential variational inequality (DVI) formalism: a projection method
(fixed-point method), a self-adaptive projection method, and a proximal point
method. Rigorous convergence results are provided for these methods, which rely
on increasingly relaxed notion of generalized monotonicity: mixed
strongly-weakly monotonicity for the fixed-point method; pseudo monotonicity
for the self-adaptive projection method, and quasi monotonicity for the
proximal point method.
