The problem of the scattering of a charge by the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux line
is reconsidered in terms of finite width beams. It is shown that despite the
left-right symmetry in the AB scattering cross-section, the charge is scattered
asymmetrically. The asymmetry (i.e. magnetic force) originates from almost
forward scattering within the angular size of the incident wave. In the
paraxial approximation, the real space solution to the scattering problem of a
beam is found as well as the scattering S-matrix. The Boltzmann kinetics and
the Landau quantization in a random AB array are considered.
