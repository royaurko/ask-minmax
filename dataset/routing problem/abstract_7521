We review the problem of electron-electron interactions in graphene. Starting
from the screening of long range interactions in these systems, we discuss the
existence of an emerging Dirac liquid of Lorentz invariant quasi-particles in
the weak coupling regime, and strongly correlated electronic states in the
strong coupling regime. We also analyze the analogy and connections between the
many-body problem and the Coulomb impurity problem. The problem of the magnetic
instability and Kondo effect of impurities and/or adatoms in graphene is also
discussed in analogy with classical models of many-body effects in ordinary
metals. We show that Lorentz invariance plays a fundamental role and leads to
effects that span the whole spectrum, from the ultraviolet to the infrared. The
effect of an emerging Lorentz invariance is also discussed in the context of
finite size and edge effects as well as mesoscopic physics. We also briefly
discuss the effects of strong magnetic fields in single layers and review some
of the main aspects of the many-body problem in graphene bilayers. In addition
to reviewing the fully understood aspects of the many-body problem in graphene,
we show that a plethora of interesting issues remain open, both theoretically
and experimentally, and that the field of graphene research is still exciting
and vibrant.
