We study the nonhomogeneous boundary value problem for the Navier--Stokes
equations of steady motion of a viscous incompressible fluid in a
three--dimensional exterior domain with multiply connected boundary. We prove
that this problem has a solution for axially symmetric domains and data
(without any smallness restrictions on the fluxes).
