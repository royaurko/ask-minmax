The problem of offline to online script conversion is a challenging and an
ill-posed problem. The interest in offline to online conversion exists because
there are a plethora of robust algorithms in online script literature which can
not be used on offline scripts. In this paper, we propose a method, based on
heuristics, to extract online script information from offline bitmap image. We
show the performance of the proposed method on a real sample signature offline
image, whose online information is known.
