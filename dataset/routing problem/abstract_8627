In this paper we study the complexity of strategic argumentation for dialogue
games. A dialogue game is a 2-player game where the parties play arguments. We
show how to model dialogue games in a skeptical, non-monotonic formalism, and
we show that the problem of deciding what move (set of rules) to play at each
turn is an NP-complete problem.
