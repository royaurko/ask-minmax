The separability problem for languages from a class $\mathcal{C}$ by
languages of a class $\mathcal{S}$ asks whether, for two given word languages
$I$ and $E$ from $\mathcal{C}$, there exists a language $S$ from $\mathcal{S}$
which includes $I$ and excludes $E$, that is, $I \subseteq S$ and $S \cap E =
\emptyset$. It is known that separability for context-free languages by any
class containing all definite languages (such as regular languages) is
undecidable. We show that separability of context-free languages by piecewise
languages is decidable. This may be remarkable in the light that it is
undecidable whether a context-free language is piecewise testable. We
generalize this decidability result by showing that, for every class of
languages that is robust under some rather weak operations and has decidable
emptiness and diagonal problems, separability with respect to piecewise
testable languages is decidable. An example of such a class is the class of
languages defined by labeled vector addition systems.
