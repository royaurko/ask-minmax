In the present paper, we develop a novel Bayesian approach to the problem of
estimating neural currents in the brain from a fixed distribution of magnetic
field (called \emph{topography}), measured by magnetoencephalography.
Differently from recent studies that describe inversion techniques, such as
spatio-temporal regularization/filtering, in which neural dynamics always plays
a role, we face here a purely static inverse problem. Neural currents are
modelled as an unknown number of current dipoles, whose state space is
described in terms of a variable--dimension model. Within the resulting
Bayesian framework, we set up a sequential Monte Carlo sampler to explore the
posterior distribution. An adaptation technique is employed in order to
effectively balance the computational cost and the quality of the sample
approximation. Then, both the number and the parameters of the unknown current
dipoles are simultaneously estimated. The performance of the method is assessed
by means of synthetic data, generated by source configurations containing up to
four dipoles. Eventually, we describe the results obtained by analyzing data
from a real experiment, involving somatosensory evoked fields, and compare them
to those provided by three other methods.
