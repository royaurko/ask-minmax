A semi-spectral Chebyshev method for solving numerically singular integral
equations is presented and applied in the quarkonium bound-state problem in
momentum space. The integrals containing both, logarithmic and Cauchy singular
kernels, can be evaluated without subtractions by dedicated automatic
quadratures.
 By introducing a Chebyshev mesh and using the Nystrom algorithm the singular
integral equation is converted into an algebraic eigenvalue problem that can be
solved by standard methods.
 The proposed scheme is very simple to use, is easy in programming and highly
accurate.
