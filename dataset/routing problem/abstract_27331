We present a whole series of novel methods to alleviate the sign problem of
the Fermionic Shadow Wave Function in the context of Variational Monte Carlo.
The effectiveness of our new techniques is demonstrated on the example of
liquid 3He. We found that although the variance is substantially reduced, the
gain in efficiency is restricted by the increased computational cost. Yet, this
development not only extends the scope of the Fermionic Shadow Wave Function,
but also facilitates highly accurate Quantum Monte Carlo simulations previously
thought not feasible.
