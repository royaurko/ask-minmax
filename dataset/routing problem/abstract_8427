We consider the mean-variance hedging problem under partial information in
the case where the flow of observable events does not contain the full
information on the underlying asset price process. We introduce a martingale
equation of a new type and characterize the optimal strategy in terms of the
solution of this equation. We give relations between this equation and backward
stochastic differential equations for the value process of the problem.
