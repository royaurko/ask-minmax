The generator problem was posed by Kadison in 1967, and it remains open until
today. We provide a solution for the class of C*-algebras absorbing the
Jiang-Su algebra Z tensorially. More precisely, we show that every unital,
separable, Z-stable C*-algebras A is singly generated, which means that there
exists an element x in A that is not contained in any proper sub-C*-algebra of
A.
  To give applications of our result, we observe that Z can be embedded into
the reduced group C*-algebra of a discrete group that contains a non-cyclic,
free subgroup. It follows that certain tensor products with reduced group
C*-algebras are singly generated. In particular, the tensor product of two
reduced free group C*-algebras is singly generated.
