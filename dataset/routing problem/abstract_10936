We discuss combining knowledge-based (or rule-based) and statistical
part-of-speech taggers. We use two mature taggers, ENGCG and Xerox Tagger, to
independently tag the same text and combine the results to produce a fully
disambiguated text. In a 27000 word test sample taken from a previously unseen
corpus we achieve 98.5% accuracy. This paper presents the data in detail. We
describe the problems we encountered in the course of combining the two taggers
and discuss the problem of evaluating taggers.
