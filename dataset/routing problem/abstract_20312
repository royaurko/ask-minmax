This is a survey article with focus on the following problem. Given $f:X \to
X$ a meromorphic endomorphism of some compact K\"ahler manifold $X$, construct
and study - under natural numerical conditions - a canonical invariant
probability measure with remarkable ergodic properties (mixing, hyperbolicity,
maximal entropy, etc).
