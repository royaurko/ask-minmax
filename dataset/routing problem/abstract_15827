The Nash problem on arc families is affirmatively answered for a toric
variety by Ishii and Kollar's paper which also shows the negative answer for
general case. The Nash problem is one of questions about the relation between
arc families and valuations. In this paper, the relation is described clearly
for a toric variety. The arc space of a toric variety admits an action of the
group scheme determined by the torus. Each orbit on the arc space corresponds
to a lattice point in the cone and therefore corresponds to a toric valuation.
The dominant relation among the orbits is described in terms of the lattice
points. As a corollary we obtain the answer to the embedded version of the Nash
problem for an invariant ideal on a toric variety.
