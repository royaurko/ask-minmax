In string theory, stabilization of moduli fields and their cosmological
implications have been discussed by many contributors. In this paper we do not
consider conventional modulus, nor relative distance between two branes. We
focus our attention to a relative position of three intersecting branes.
Surprisingly, there had been no phenomonological argument on the stabilization
of such moduli. We will show that the area of the corresponding triangle is not
a free parameter, but an effective potential is generated from conventional
loop corrections in the low energy effective theory. Of course, the
stabilization does not induce any serious problem, because one is allowed to
modify other parameters of the model to adjust the Yukawa couplings. Then the
stabilization puts a constraint that is a different nature from the ones that
have been discussed before. We also discuss cosmological problems and show a
simple idea that can solve the problem.
