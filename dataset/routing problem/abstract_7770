We investigate whether the Affleck-Dine mechanism can produce sufficient
baryon number of the universe in the gauge-mediated SUSY breaking models, while
evading the cosmological moduli problem by late-time entropy production. We
find that the Q-ball formation makes the scenario difficult, irrespective of
the detail mechanism of the entropy production.
