We study nonlinear Neumann type boundary value problems related to ergodic
phenomenas. The particularity of these problems is that the ergodic constant
appears in the (possibly nonlinear) Neumann boundary conditions. We provide,
for bounded domains, several results on the existence, uniqueness and
properties of this ergodic constant.
