In this note further clue decisive observations on cobweb admissible
sequences are shared with the audience. In particular an announced proof of the
Theorem 1 (by Dziemia\'nczuk) from [1] announced in India -Kolkata- December
2007 is delivered here. Namely here and there we claim that any cobweb
admissible sequence F is at the point product of primary cobweb admissible
sequences taking values one and/or certain power of an appropriate primary
number p.
  Here also an algorithm to produce the family of all cobweb-admissible
sequences i.e. the Problem 1 from [1] i.e. one of several problems posed in
source papers [2,3] is solved using the idea and methods implicitly present
already in [4]
