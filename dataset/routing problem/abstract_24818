Given an elliptic curve $E$ and a finite Abelian group $G$, we consider the
problem of counting the number of primes $p$ for which the group of points
modulo $p$ is isomorphic to $G$. Under a certain conjecture concerning the
distribution of primes in short intervals, we obtain an asymptotic formula for
this problem on average over a family of elliptic curves.
