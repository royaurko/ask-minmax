In this paper, the theory of coherence frame is developed. Two kinds of
coherence frame are classified. Under coherence frame, the entanglement is
conserved in the entanglement swapping process, without entanglement sudden
death and birth. The einselection method for the preferred basis problem in the
entangle process is shown as incomplete.
