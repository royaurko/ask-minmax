We discuss the problem of mass, noting that meson masses decrease with
increasing scale as the dynamically generated condensate of "soft glue" is
melted (Brown/Rho scaling). We then extend the Bielefeld LGS color singlet
interaction computed for heavy quarks in a model-dependent way by including the
Ampere law velocity-velocity interaction. Parameterizing the resulting
interaction in terms of effective strength of the potential and including
screening, we find that the masses of pi, sigma, rho and A1 excitations, 32
degrees of freedom in all, go to zero (in the chiral limit) as T goes to Tc
essentially independently of the input quark (thermal) masses in the range of
1-2 GeV, calculated also in Bielefeld. We discuss other LGS which show q-bar q
bound states, which we interpret as our chirally restored mesons, for T > Tc.
