We give a formulation of the single particle occupation probabilities for a
system of identical particles obeying fractional exclusion statistics of
Haldane. We first derive a set of constraints using an exactly solvable model
which describes an ideal exclusion statistics system and deduce the general
counting rules for occupancy of states obeyed by these particles. We show that
the problem of negative probabilities may be avoided with these new counting
rules.
