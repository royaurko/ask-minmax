In many real-world situations, different and often opposite opinions,
innovations, or products are competing with one another for their social
influence in a networked society. In this paper, we study competitive influence
propagation in social networks under the competitive linear threshold (CLT)
model, an extension to the classic linear threshold model. Under the CLT model,
we focus on the problem that one entity tries to block the influence
propagation of its competing entity as much as possible by strategically
selecting a number of seed nodes that could initiate its own influence
propagation. We call this problem the influence blocking maximization (IBM)
problem. We prove that the objective function of IBM in the CLT model is
submodular, and thus a greedy algorithm could achieve 1-1/e approximation
ratio. However, the greedy algorithm requires Monte-Carlo simulations of
competitive influence propagation, which makes the algorithm not efficient. We
design an efficient algorithm CLDAG, which utilizes the properties of the CLT
model, to address this issue. We conduct extensive simulations of CLDAG, the
greedy algorithm, and other baseline algorithms on real-world and synthetic
datasets. Our results show that CLDAG is able to provide best accuracy in par
with the greedy algorithm and often better than other algorithms, while it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the greedy algorithm.
