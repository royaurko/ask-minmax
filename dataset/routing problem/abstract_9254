The avalanche quantity of the information developed by mankind has led to
concept of automation of knowledge extraction - Data Mining ([1]). This
direction is connected with a wide spectrum of problems - from recognition of
the fuzzy set to creation of search machines. Important component of Data
Mining is processing of the text information. Such problems lean on concept of
classification and clustering ([2]). Classification consists in definition of
an accessory of some element (text) to one of in advance created classes.
Clustering means splitting a set of elements (texts) on clusters which quantity
are defined by localization of elements of the given set in vicinities of these
some natural centers of these clusters. Realization of a problem of
classification initially should lean on the given postulates, basic of which -
the aprioristic information on primary set of texts and a measure of affinity
of elements and classes.
