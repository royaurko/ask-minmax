We present a detailed modeling and characterization of our scalable microwave
nanoprobe, which is a micro-fabricated cantilever-based scanning microwave
probe with separated excitation and sensing electrodes. Using finite-element
analysis, the tip-sample interaction is modeled as small impedance changes
between the tip electrode and the ground at our working frequencies near 1GHz.
The equivalent lumped elements of the cantilever can be determined by
transmission line simulation of the matching network, which routes the
cantilever signals to 50 Ohm feed lines. In the microwave electronics, the
background common-mode signal is cancelled before the amplifier stage so that
high sensitivity (below 1 atto-Farad capacitance changes) is obtained.
Experimental characterization of the microwave probes was performed on
ion-implanted Si wafers and patterned semiconductor samples. Pure electrical or
topographical signals can be realized using different reflection modes of the
probe.
