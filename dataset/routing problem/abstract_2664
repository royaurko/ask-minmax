We argue that the multiple shells of circumstellar material (CSM) and the
supernovae (SN) ejecta interaction with the CSM starting 59 days after the
explosion of the Type Ia SN (SN Ia) PTF 11kx, are best described by a violent
prompt merger. In this prompt merger scenario the common envelope (CE) phase is
terminated by a merger of a WD companion with the hot core of a massive
asymptotic giant (AGB) star. In most cases the WD is disrupted and accreted
onto the more massive core. However, in the rare cases where the merger takes
place when the WD is denser than the core, the core will be disrupted and
accreted onto the cooler WD. In such cases the explosion might occur with no
appreciable delay, i.e., months to years after the termination of the CE phase.
This, we propose, might be the evolutionary route that could lead to the
explosion of PTF 11kx. This scenario can account for the very massive CSM
within ~1000 AU of the exploding PTF 11kx star, for the presence of hydrogen,
and for the presence of shells in the CSM.
