Resistance functions for two spherical particles with the Navier slip
boundary condition in general linear flows, including rigid translation, rigid
rotation, and strain, at low Reynolds number are derived by the method of
reflections as well as twin multipole expansions. In the solutions, particle
radii and slip lengths can be chosen independently. In the course of
calculations, single-sphere problem with the slip boundary condition is solved
by Lamb's general solution and the expression of multipole expansions, and
Fax\'{e}n's laws of force, torque, and stresslet for slip particle are also
derived. The solutions of two-body problem are confirmed to recover the
existing results in the no-slip limit and for the case of equal scaled slip
lengths.
