We consider an evolution equation with the Caputo-Dzhrbashyan fractional
derivative of order $\alpha \in (1,2)$ with respect to the time variable, and
the second order uniformly elliptic operator with variable coefficients acting
in spatial variables. This equation describes the propagation of stress pulses
in a viscoelastic medium. Its properties are intermediate between those of
parabolic and hyperbolic equations. In this paper, we construct and investigate
a fundamental solution of the Cauchy problem, prove existence and uniqueness
theorems for such equations.
