Considering the kinematics of the moving frame associated with a constant
mean curvature surface immersed in S^3 we derive a linear problem with the
spectral parameter corresponding to elliptic sinh-Gordon equation. The spectral
parameter is related to the radius R of the sphere S^3. The application of the
Sym formula to this linear problem yields constant mean curvature surfaces in
E^3. Independently, we show that the Sym formula itself can be derived by an
appropriate limiting process R -> infinity.
