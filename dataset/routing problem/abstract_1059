The formula for probability density functions (PDFs) has been extended to
include PDF for energy dissipation rates in addition to other PDFs such as for
velocity fluctuations, velocity derivatives, fluid particle accelerations,
energy transfer rates, etc, and it is shown that the formula actually explains
various PDFs extracted from direct numerical simulations and experiments
performed in a wind tunnel. It is also shown that the formula with appropriate
zooming increment corresponding to experimental situation gives a new route to
obtain the scaling exponents of velocity structure function, including
intermittency exponent, out of PDFs of velocity fluctuations.
