The so-called supersymmetric flavour problem does not exist in isolation to
the Standard Model flavour problem. We show that a realistic flavour symmetry
can simultaneously solve both problems without ad hoc modifications of the SUSY
model. Furthermore, departures from the SM expectations in these models can be
used to discriminate among different possibilities. In particular we present
the expected values for the electron EDM in a flavour model solving the
supersymmetric flavour and CP problems.
