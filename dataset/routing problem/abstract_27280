We address here the problem of describing both the total and the elastic
proton-proton cross-section, through the four outstanding features of hadron
scattering: (i) the optical point; (ii) the forward peak, (iii) the dip and
(iv) the subsequent descent at larger momentum transfers. These issues are
discussed through an eikonal model for the elastic amplitude where the matter
distribution in impact parameter space is given by resummed soft gluons down
into the infrared (IR) region. The asymptotic growth of the total cross-section
is obtained in a mini-jet model and the taming (saturation) at high energies is
related to confinement realized here through an IR singular strong coupling
constant alpha_s(Q^2). We present an ansatz that links the IR singularity of
alpha_s(Q^2) to that of asymptotic freedom (AF) (at lowest order). Through this
model, we illustrate the problems that arise in a generic one-channel eikonal
model employed for a description of the measured differential elastic
cross-section at LHC7.
