The structure of the 1/Nc expansion for the baryon distribution amplitude in
QCD is tested using quark models. Earlier conjectures about this structure
based on the evolution equation and on the soft-pion theorem are confirmed by
the model analysis. The problem of the calculation of the baryon wave function
at large Nc is reduced to the analysis of equations of motion for an effective
classical dynamical system.
