In the framework of social choice correspondences, we propose three different
qualifications of the reversal symmetry principle proving that, for each of
them, Minimax social choice correspondence fulfils it if and only if the number
of voters and the number of alternatives satisfy suitable arithmetical
relations. We discuss the same problem for Borda and Copeland social choice
correspondences.
