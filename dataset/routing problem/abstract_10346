We present a high order parameter-robust numerical method for a system of
(M>=2) coupled singularly perturbed parabolic reaction-diffusion problems. A
small perturbation parameter {\epsilon} is multiplied with the second order
spatial derivatives in all the equations. The parabolic boundary layer appears
in the solution of the problem when the perturbation parameter {\epsilon} tends
to zero. To obtain a high order approximation to the solution of this problem,
we propose a numerical method that employs the Crank-Nicolson method on an
uniform mesh in time direction, together with a hybrid finite difference scheme
on a generalized Shishkin mesh in spatial direction. We prove that the
resulting method is parameter-robust or \epsilon-uniform of second order in
time and almost fourth order in spatial variable, if the discretization
parameters satisfy a non-restrictive relation. Numerical experiments are
presented to validate the theoretical results and also indicate that the
relation between the discretization parameters is not necessary in practice.
