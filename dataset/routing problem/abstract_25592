A set of multivariate polynomials, over a field of zero or large
characteristic, can be tested for algebraic independence by the well-known
Jacobian criterion. For fields of other characteristic p>0, there is no
analogous characterization known. In this paper we give the first such
criterion. Essentially, it boils down to a non-degeneracy condition on a lift
of the Jacobian polynomial over (an unramified extension of) the ring of p-adic
integers.
  Our proof builds on the de Rham-Witt complex, which was invented by Illusie
(1979) for crystalline cohomology computations, and we deduce a natural
generalization of the Jacobian. This new avatar we call the Witt-Jacobian. In
essence, we show how to faithfully differentiate polynomials over F_p (i.e.
somehow avoid dx^p/dx=0) and thus capture algebraic independence.
  We apply the new criterion to put the problem of testing algebraic
independence in the complexity class NP^#P (previously best was PSPACE). Also,
we give a modest application to the problem of identity testing in algebraic
complexity theory.
