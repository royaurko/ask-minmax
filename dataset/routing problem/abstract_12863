In the contest of supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model, we
consider a spectrum in which the lightest Higgs boson has mass between 200 and
300 GeV and the first two generations of squarks have masses above 20 TeV,
considering the Higgs boson mass and the Supersymmetric Flavour Problem as
related naturalness problems. After the analysis of some models in which the
previous spectrum can be naturally realised, we consider the phenomenological
consequences for the LHC and for Dark Matter.
