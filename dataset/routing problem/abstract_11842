We analyse charge inversion in colloidal systems at zero temperature using
stability concepts, and connect this to the classical Thomson problem of
arranging electrons on sphere. We show that for a finite microion charge, the
globally stable, lowest energy state of the complex formed by the colloid and
the oppositely charged microions is always overcharged. This effect disappears
in the continuous limit. Additionally, a layer of at least twice as many
microions as required for charge neutrality is always locally stable. In an
applied external electric field the stability of the microion cloud is reduced.
Finally, this approach is applied to a system of two colloids at low but finite
temperature.
