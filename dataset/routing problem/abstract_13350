We define a weight function in a bi-material strip containing a semi-infinite
crack and an imperfect interface and analyse a problem of anti-plane shear. We
then present an asymptotic algorithm which uses the weight function to evaluate
the coefficients in asymptotics of solutions to problems of wave propagation in
a thin bi-material strip containing a periodic array of cracks situated at the
interface between two materials.
