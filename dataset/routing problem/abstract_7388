Uncertain parameters of state-space models have always been a considerable
problem. Consider Kalman filter (CKF) and desensitized Kalman filter (DKF) are
two methods to solve this problem. Based on the sensitivity matrix respected to
the uncertain parameter vector, a special DKF with an analytical gain is given
and a new form of the CKF is derived. The mathematical equivalence between the
special DKF and the CKF is demonstrated when the sensitivity-weighting matrix
is set to the covariance of the uncertain parameter and the problem how to
select and obtain the sensitivity-weighting matrix in the DKF is solved.
