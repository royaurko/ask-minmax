Phantom depth, phantom nonzerodivisors, and phantom exact sequences are
analogues of the non-"phantom" notions which have been useful in tackling the
(very difficult) localization problem in tight closure theory. In the present
paper, these notions are developed further and partially reworked. For
instance, although no analogue of a long exact sequence arises from a short
stably phantom exact sequence of complexes, we provide a method for recovering
the kind of information obtainable from such a long sequence. Also, we give
alternate characterizations of the notion of phantom depth, including one based
on Koszul homology which we use to show that with very mild conditions on a
finitely generated module $M$, any two maximal phantom $M$-regular sequences in
an ideal $I$ have the same length. In order to do so, we prove a "Nakayama
lemma for tight closure" which is of independent interest. We strengthen the
connection of phantom depth with minheight, we explore several analogues of
"associated prime" in tight closure theory, and we discuss a connection with
the problem of when tight closure commutes with localization.
