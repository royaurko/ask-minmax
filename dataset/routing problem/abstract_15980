The contributor proposed in his previous papers in 2001 that the problem of the
cosmological constant could be resolved and its calculated value agrees
excellently with the observations by assuming that the space-time itself, as
the phase of Higgs condensate, is discrete in nature. Further to such idea, a
different approach involving the concept of vacuum entropy that is constrained
by the modified Holographic Principle is being used in the calculation of the
cosmological constant value at three different phase transition times in the
early universe. It is interesting and quite unexpected that it arrives at the
same conclusion as the previous approach. It therefore reveals that something
fundamental is present in the theory. The problem on the preservation of
Lorentz invariance in discrete space-time is also discussed.
