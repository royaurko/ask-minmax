We study the problem of finding unitary submatrices of the discrete Fourier
transform matrix. This problem is related to a diverse set of questions on
idempotents on Z_N, tiling Z_N, difference graphs and maximal cliques. Each of
these is related to the problem of interpolating a discrete bandlimited signal
using an orthogonal basis.
