A distinguishing characteristic of wireless sensor networks is the
opportunity to exploit characteristics of the application at lower layers. This
paper reports on the results of a simulation comparison of proposed data
dissemination protocols using the J-Sim simulator for the WSN protocols:
Forwarding Diffusion Data Dissemination(FDDDP), Decentralized Data
Dissemination(DDDP), Credit Broadcast Data Dissemination (CBDDP), Energy Aware
& Geographical Data Dissemination (EAGDDP) .Our performance provides useful
insights for the network designer such as which protocols (and design choices)
scale control traffic well, improve data delivery or reduce overall energy
consumption,improves routing overhead and maximizes the bandwidth utilization.
The static pre configuration of the cell size in DDDP, is one of the reasons
why DDDP exhibits larger routing overhead than FDDDP by 74.2% on average.
Although CBDDP produces approximately 94.6% smaller overhead than DDDP and
90.7% smaller than FDDDP, because of statically configured amount credit CBDDP
delivers on average 7.5 times more of the redundant data packets than DDDP and
FDDDP.EAGDDP improves the delivery by 80% on average and makes a balance of
energy consumption .We suggest that making these protocols truly self-learning
can significantly improve their performance.
