We reconsider the theory of scattering for some long range Hartree equations
with potential |x|^-gamma with 1/2 < gamma < 1. More precisely we study the
local Cauchy problem with infinite initial time, which is the main step in the
construction of the modified wave operators. We solve that problem in the whole
subcritical range without loss of regularity between the asymptotic state and
the solution, thereby recovering a result of Nakanishi. Our method starts from
a different parametrization of the solutions, already used in our previous
papers. This reduces the proofs to energy estimates and avoids delicate phase
estimates.
