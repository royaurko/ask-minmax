We address the concept of direct multiphoton multiple ionization in atoms
exposed to intense, short wavelength radiation and explore the conditions under
which such processes dominate over the sequential. Their contribution is shown
to be quite robust, even under intensity fluctuations and interaction volume
integration, and reasonable agreement with experimental data is also found.
