We examine the sensitivity of several solutions of the strong-CP problem to
violations of global symmetries by Planck scale physics. We find that the
Peccei-Quinn solution is extremely sensitive to U(1)_PQ violating operators of
dimension less than 10. We construct models in which the PQ symmetry is
protected by gauge symmetries to the requisite level.
