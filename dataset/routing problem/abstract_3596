A free boundary problem arising from materials science is studied in
one-dimensional case. The problem studied here is an obstacle problem for the
non-convex energy consisting of a bending energy, tension and an adhesion
energy. If the bending energy, which is a higher order term, is deleted then
"edge" singularities of the solutions (surfaces) may occur at the free boundary
as Alt-Caffarelli type variational problems. The main result of this paper is
to give a singular limit of the energy utilizing the notion of
$\Gamma$-convergence, when the bending energy can be regarded as a
perturbation. This singular limit energy only depends on the state of surfaces
at the free boundary as seen in singular perturbations for phase transition
models.
