In this report, we investigate the multi-valued Byzantine consensus problem.
We introduce two algorithms: the first one achieves traditional validity
requirement for consensus, and the second one achieves a stronger "q-validity"
requirement. Both algorithms are more efficient than the ones introduces in our
recent PODC 2011 paper titled "Error-Free Multi-Valued Consensus with Byzantine
Failures".
