The adjoint method, recently introduced by Evans, is used to study obstacle
problems, weakly coupled systems, cell problems for weakly coupled systems of
Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and weakly coupled systems of obstacle type. In
particular, new results about the speed of convergence of common approximation
procedures are derived.
