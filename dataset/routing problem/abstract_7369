Douglas-Rachford splitting and the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) can be used to solve convex optimization problems that
consist of a sum of two functions. Convergence rate estimates for these
algorithms have received much attention lately. In particular, linear
convergence rates have been shown by several contributors under various assumptions.
One such set of assumptions is strong convexity and smoothness of one of the
functions in the minimization problem. The contributors recently provided a linear
convergence rate bound for such problems. In this paper, we show that this rate
bound is tight for many algorithm parameter choices.
