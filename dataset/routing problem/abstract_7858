Let $X$ and $Y$ be two independent identically distributed random variables
with density $p(x)$ and $Z=\alpha X+\beta Y$ for some constants $\alpha>0$ and
$\beta>0$. We consider the problem of estimating $p(x)$ by means of the samples
from the distribution of $Z$. Non-parametric estimator based on the sync kernel
is constructed and asymptotic behaviour of the corresponding mean integrated
square error is investigated.
