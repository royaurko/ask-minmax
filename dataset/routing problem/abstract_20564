This theoretical work defines the measure of autocorrelation of evolvability
in the context of neutral fitness landscape. This measure has been studied on
the classical MAX-SAT problem. This work highlight a new characteristic of
neutral fitness landscapes which allows to design new adapted metaheuristic.
