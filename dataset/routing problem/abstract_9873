We are concerned with the linearized, isotropic and homogeneous elastic
scattering problem by many small rigid obstacles of arbitrary, Lipschitz
regular, shapes in 3D case. We prove that there exists two constant $a_0$ and
$c_0$, depending only on the Lipschitz character of the obstacles, such that
under the conditions $a\leq a_0$ and $\sqrt{M-1}\frac{a}{d} \leq c_0$ on the
number $M$ of the obstacles, their maximum diameter $a$ and the minimum
distance between them $d$, the corresponding Foldy-Lax approximation of the
farfields is valid. In addition, we provide the error of this approximation
explicitly in terms of the three parameters $M, a$ and $d$. These
approximations can be used, in particular, in the identification problems (i.e.
inverse problems) and in the design problems (i.e. effective medium theory).
