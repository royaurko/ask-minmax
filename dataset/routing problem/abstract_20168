We prove that for the Navier Stokes equation with dissipation
$(-\Delta)^{\alpha}$, where $1<\alpha<{5/4}$, and smooth initial data, the
Hausdorff dimension of the singular set at time of first blow up is at most
$5-4\alpha$. This unifies two directions from which one might approach the Clay
prize problem.
