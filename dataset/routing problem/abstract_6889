We show that no minimal vertex triangulation of a closed, connected,
orientable 2-manifold of genus 6 admits a polyhedral embedding in R^3. We also
provide examples of minimal vertex triangulations of closed, connected,
orientable 2-manifolds of genus 5 that do not admit any polyhedral embeddings.
We construct a new infinite family of non-realizable triangulations of
surfaces. These results were achieved by transforming the problem of finding
suitable oriented matroids into a satisfiability problem. This method can be
applied to other geometric realizability problems, e.g. for face lattices of
polytopes.
