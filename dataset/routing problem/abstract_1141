The iron-oxypnictide compounds, recently reported as a new class of
superconductors when appropriately doped, exhibit large Seebeck coefficients,
of the order of -100 microV/K, while keeping good electrical conductivity.
Their power factor shows a peak at low temperatures, suggesting possible
applications of these materials in thermoelectric cooling modules in the liquid
nitrogen temperature range.
