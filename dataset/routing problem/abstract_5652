The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology enables satellites to
efficiently acquire high quality images of the Earth surface. This generates
significant communication traffic from the satellite to the ground stations,
and, thus, image downlinking often becomes the bottleneck in the efficiency of
the whole system. In this paper we address the downlink scheduling problem for
Canada's Earth observing SAR satellite, RADARSAT-2. Being an applied problem,
downlink scheduling is characterised with a number of constraints that make it
difficult not only to optimise the schedule but even to produce a feasible
solution. We propose a fast schedule generation procedure that abstracts the
problem specific constraints and provides a simple interface to optimisation
algorithms. By comparing empirically several standard meta-heuristics applied
to the problem, we select the most suitable one and show that it is clearly
superior to the approach currently in use.
