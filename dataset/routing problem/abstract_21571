We present a field theory solution to the eta problem. By making the inflaton
field the phase of a baryon of SU(N_c) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory we show
that all operators that usually spoil the flatness of the inflationary
potential are absent. Our solution naturally generalizes to non-supersymmetric
theories.
