We solve the long standing problem of finding an off-shell supersymmetric
formulation for a general N = (2, 2) nonlinear two dimensional sigma model.
Geometrically the problem is equivalent to proving the existence of special
coordinates; these correspond to particular superfields that allow for a
superspace description. We construct and explain the geometric significance of
the generalized Kahler potential for any generalized Kahler manifold; this
potential is the superspace Lagrangian.
