Conjunctive database queries have been extended with a mechanism for object
creation to capture important applications such as data exchange, data
integration, and ontology-based data access. Object creation generates new
object identifiers in the result, that do not belong to the set of constants in
the source database. The new object identifiers can be also seen as Skolem
terms. Hence, object-creating conjunctive queries can also be regarded as
restricted second-order tuple-generating dependencies (SO tgds), considered in
the data exchange literature.
  In this paper, we focus on the class of single-function object-creating
conjunctive queries, or sifo CQs for short. We give a new characterization for
oid-equivalence of sifo CQs that is simpler than the one given by Hull and
Yoshikawa and places the problem in the complexity class NP. Our
characterization is based on Cohen's equivalence notions for conjunctive
queries with multiplicities. We also solve the logical entailment problem for
sifo CQs, showing that also this problem belongs to NP. Results by Pichler et
al. have shown that logical equivalence for more general classes of SO tgds is
either undecidable or decidable with as yet unknown complexity upper bounds.
