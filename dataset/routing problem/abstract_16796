In this note, we provide complexity characterizations of model checking
multi-pushdown systems. Multi-pushdown systems model recursive concurrent
programs in which any sequential process has a finite control. We consider
three standard notions for boundedness: context boundedness, phase boundedness
and stack ordering. The logical formalism is a linear-time temporal logic
extending well-known logic CaRet but dedicated to multi-pushdown systems in
which abstract operators (related to calls and returns) such as those for
next-time and until are parameterized by stacks. We show that the problem is
EXPTIME-complete for context-bounded runs and unary encoding of the number of
context switches; we also prove that the problem is 2EXPTIME-complete for
phase-bounded runs and unary encoding of the number of phase switches. In both
cases, the value k is given as an input (whence it is not a constant of the
model-checking problem), which makes a substantial difference in the
complexity. In certain cases, our results improve previous complexity results.
