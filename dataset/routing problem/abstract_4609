I treat the worldtube constraints which arise in the null-timelike
initial-boundary value problem for the Bondi-Sachs formulation of Einstein's
equations. Boundary data on a worldtube and initial data on an outgoing null
hypersurface determine the exterior spacetime by integration along the outgoing
null geodsics. The worldtube constraints are a set of conservation laws which
impose conditions on the integration constants. I show how these constraints
lead to a well-posed initial value problem governing the extrinsic curvature of
the worldtube, whose components are related to the integration constants.
Possible applications to gravitational waveform extraction and to the
well-posedness of the null-timelike initial-boundary value problem are
discussed.
