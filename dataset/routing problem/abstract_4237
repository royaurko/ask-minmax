In this paper we deal with a Kirchhoff type problem driven by a fractional
nonlocal integrodifferential operator $-\mathcal L_K$ and involving a critical
nonlinearity. For this problem we prove the existence of infinitely many
solutions, through a suitable truncation argument and exploiting the genus
theory introduced by Krasnoselskii.
