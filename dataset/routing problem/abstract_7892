We find a relation between the vanishing of a globally defined residue
current on $\P^n$ and solution of the membership problem with control of the
polynomial degrees. Several classical results appear as special cases, such as
Max N\"other's theorem, and we also obtain a generalization of that theorem.
There are also connections to effective versions of the Nullstellensatz. We
also provide explicit integral representations of the solutions.
