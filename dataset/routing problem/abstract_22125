We study the problem of non-relativity for a complex Euclidean space and a
bounded symmetric domain equipped with their canonical metrics. In particular,
we answer a question raised by Di Scala.
  This paper is dedicated to the memory of Salah Baouendi, a great teacher and
a close friend to many of us.
