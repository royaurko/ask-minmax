In monolayer graphene, substitutional doping during growth can be used to
alter its electronic properties. We used scanning tunneling microscopy (STM),
Raman spectroscopy, x-ray spectroscopy, and first principles calculations to
characterize individual nitrogen dopants in monolayer graphene grown on a
copper substrate. Individual nitrogen atoms were incorporated as graphitic
dopants, and a fraction of the extra electron on each nitrogen atom was
delocalized into the graphene lattice. The electronic structure of
nitrogen-doped graphene was strongly modified only within a few lattice
spacings of the site of the nitrogen dopant. These findings show that chemical
doping is a promising route to achieving high-quality graphene films with a
large carrier concentration.
