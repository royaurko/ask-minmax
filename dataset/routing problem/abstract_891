Energy consumption and delay incurred in packet delivery are the two
important metrics for measuring the performance of geographic routing protocols
for Wireless Adhoc and Sensor Networks (WASN). A protocol capable of ensuring
both lesser energy consumption and experiencing lesser delay in packet delivery
is thus suitable for networks which are delay sensitive and energy hungry at
the same time. Thus a smart packet forwarding technique addressing both the
issues is thus the one looked for by any geographic routing protocol. In the
present paper we have proposed a Fermat point based forwarding technique which
reduces the delay experienced during packet delivery as well as the energy
consumed for transmission and reception of data packets.
