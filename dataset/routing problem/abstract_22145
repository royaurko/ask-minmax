In this paper we address the problem of studying those K\"ahler manifolds
whose first two coefficients of the associated TYZ expansion vanish and we
prove that for a locally Hermitian symmetric space this happens only in the
flat case. We also prove that there exist nonflat locally Hermitian symmetric
spaces where all the odd coefficients vanish.
