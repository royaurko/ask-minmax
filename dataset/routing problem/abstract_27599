In their seminal work on the Stable Marriage Problem, Gale and Shapley
describe an algorithm which finds a stable matching in $O(n^2)$ communication
rounds. Their algorithm has a natural interpretation as a distributed algorithm
where each player is represented by a single processor. In this distributed
model, Floreen, Kaski, Polishchuk, and Suomela recently showed that for bounded
preference lists, terminating the Gale-Shapley algorithm after a constant
number of rounds results in an almost stable matching. In this paper, we
describe a new deterministic distributed algorithm which finds an almost stable
matching in $O(\log^5 n)$ communication rounds for arbitrary preferences. We
also present a faster randomized variant which requires $O(\log^2 n)$ rounds.
This run-time can be improved to $O(1)$ rounds for "almost regular" (and in
particular complete) preferences. To our knowledge, these are the first
sub-polynomial round distributed algorithms for any variant of the stable
marriage problem with unbounded preferences.
