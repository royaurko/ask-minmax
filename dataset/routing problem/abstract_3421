NP complete problem is one of the most challenging issues. The question of
whether all problems in NP are also in P is generally considered one of the
most important open questions in mathematics and theoretical computer science
as it has far-reaching consequences to other problems in mathematics, computer
science, biology, philosophy and cryptography. There are intensive research on
proving `NP not equal to P' and `NP equals to P'. However, none of the `proved'
results is commonly accepted by the research community up to now. In this
paper, instead of proving either one, we aim to provide new perspective:
transforming two typical NP complete problems to exactly solvable P problems in
polynomial time. This approach helps to solve originally NP complete problems
with practical applications. It may shine light on solving other NP complete
problems in similar way.
