The fully connected K-user interference channel is studied in a multipath
environment with bandwidth W. We show that when each link consists of D
physical paths, the total spectral efficiency can grow {\it linearly} with K.
This result holds not merely in the limit of large transmit power P, but for
any fixed P, and is therefore a stronger characterization than degrees of
freedom. It is achieved via a form of interference alignment in the time
domain. A caveat of this result is that W must grow with K, a phenomenon we
refer to as {\it bandwidth scaling}. Our insight comes from examining channels
with single path links (D=1), which we refer to as line-of-sight (LOS) links.
For such channels we build a time-indexed interference graph and associate the
communication problem with finding its maximal independent set. This graph has
a stationarity property that we exploit to solve the problem efficiently via
dynamic programming. Additionally, the interference graph enables us to
demonstrate the necessity of bandwidth scaling for any scheme operating over
LOS interference channels. Bandwidth scaling is then shown to also be a
necessary ingredient for interference alignment in the K-user interference
channel.
