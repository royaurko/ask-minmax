In the present paper, we discuss solvability questions of a non-local problem
with integral form transmitting conditions for diffusion-wave equation with the
Caputo fractional derivative in a domain bounded by smooth curves. The
uniqueness of the solution of the formulated problem we prove using energy
integral method with some modifications. The existence of solution will be
proved by equivalent reduction of the studied problem into a system of second
kind Fredholm integral equations.
