We consider a class of singularly perturbed elliptic problems with
nonautonomous asymptotically linear nonlinearities. The dependence on the
spatial coordinates comes from the presence of a potential and of a function
representing a saturation effect. We investigate the existence of nontrivial
nonnegative solutions concentrating around local minima of both the potential
and of the saturation function. Necessary conditions to locate the possible
concentration points are also given.
