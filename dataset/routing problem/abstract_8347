Stationary differential systems with polynomial right sides are considered.
Necessary and sufficient conditions are formulated when a given domain is a
domain of asymptotic stability and the origin of coordinates is either focus or
center. The problem of construction of a stabilizing control in the form of
polynomial is studied.
