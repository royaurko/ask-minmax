We explain in detail the correspondence between algebraic connections over
CP^{1}, logarithmic at X = { x_{1},...,x_{n} } \subset CP^{1}, and flat bundles
over CP^{1}-X with integer weighted filtrations near each x_{j}. Included is a
gauge fixing theorem for logarithmic connections. (Thus far, one could work
over any Riemann surface.) We prove a bound on the splitting type of a
semi-stable logarithmic connection over CP^{1}. Using this we extend and
simplify some results on the Riemann-Hilbert-Problem, which asks for a
logarithmic connection on a holomorphically trivial bundle over CP^{1},
extending a given flat bundle over CP^{1}-X. The work is self contained and
elementary, using only basic knowledge of Gauge Theory and the
Birkhoff-Grothendieck-Theorem.
