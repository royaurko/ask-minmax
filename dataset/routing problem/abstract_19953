We summarize recent progress in the resummation of perturbative evolution at
small x. We show that the problem of incorporating BFKL small x logs in GLAP
evolution is now completely solved, and that the main effect of small x
resummation is to reduce the growth of the gluon at small x in the HERA and LHC
regions.
