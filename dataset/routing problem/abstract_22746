We review some recent results on the relations between sandpiles and a class
of absorbing state phase transitions. We use the concept of fixed energy
sandpiles (FES), in which external driving and dissipation are absent.
 FES are shown to exhibit an absorbing state transition with critical
properties coinciding with those of the corresponding sandpile model. We
propose a set of Langevin equations capturing the relevant features of this
transition. These equations characterize the universality class of systems with
an infinite number of absorbing states and a static conserved field coupled to
the order parameter. Different models in this class are identified, and strong
evidence is presented showing that the Manna sandpile, as well as some other
stochastic sandpiles, belong in this universality class. Finally some open
problems and questions are discussed.
