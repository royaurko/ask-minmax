Consider the problem "Give the equation of the conceptional rotations in
${\mathbb R}^3$ without using the parameter expressing individual rotations",
just as the conceptional motion of constant velocity along straight lines
(Galiley motions) is expressed by an elementary differential equation. In this
we try to give an answer to the topic related with the above issue.
