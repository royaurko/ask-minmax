Particle-hole symmetry breaking perturbation in two-channel pseudospin Kondo
problem is studied by the numerical renormalization-group method. It is shown
that the repulsion between conduction electrons at the impurity site and the
single particle potential are the relevant perturbations against the
conventional non-Fermi liquid fixed point. Although the repulsion (potential)
with realistic strength prevents the overscreening of pseudospin, it induces in
turn a {\it real spin}, which is also overscreened again. Thus the {\it real
spin} susceptibility becomes anomalous contrary to the conventional two-channel
Kondo problem.
