High-quality education helps in finding a job - but student skills
heterogeneity and student reluctance to move towards a professional attitude
are important barriers to employability. We re-engineered some of the technical
courses of a Masters in software development using a Problem-Based Learning
(PBL) approach. Although initial results are encouraging, the cost of using PBL
must be taken into account. Two aspects are particularly expensive: (i) set-up
of the software development practicum, a mid-sized information system and its
environment; (ii) screenwriting of problem-based learning scenarios, including
procurement of input artefacts.
