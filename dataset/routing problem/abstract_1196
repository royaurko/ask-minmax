We present the refinement of the crystal structure of charge-ordered LuFe2O4,
based on single-crystal x-ray diffraction data. The arrangement of the
different Fe-valence states, determined with bond-valence-sum analysis,
corresponds to a stacking of charged Fe bilayers, in contrast to the polar
bilayers previously suggested. This arrangement is supported by an analysis of
x-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectra, which also evidences a strong
charge-spin coupling. The non-polar bilayers are inconsistent with charge order
based ferroelectricity.
