We study motion planning algorithms for collision free control of multiple
objects in the presence of moving obstacles. We compute the topological
complexity of algorithms solving this problem. We apply topological tools and
use information about cohomology algebras of configuration spaces. The results
of the paper may potentially be used in systems of automatic traffic control.
