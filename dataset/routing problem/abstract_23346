We outline inconsistencies in presently used models for high energy nuclear
scattering, which make their application quite unreliable. Many "successes" are
essentially based on an artificial freedom of parameters, which does not exist
when the models are constructed properly.
  The problem is the fact that any multiple scattering theory requires an
appropriate treatment of the energy sharing between the individual
interactions, which is technically very difficult to implement. Lacking a
satisfying solution to this problem, it has been simply ignored.
  We introduce a fully self-consistent formulation of the multiple-scattering
scheme. Inclusion of soft and hard components - very crucial at high energies -
appears in a "natural way", providing a smooth transition from soft to hard
physics.
  We can show that the effect of appropriately considering energy conservation
has a big influence on the results, and MUST therefore be included in any
serious calculation.
