We study the scattering of a particle from a bound pair in an effective field
theory using a distorted-wave renormalisation group method to find the
power-counting for the three-body force terms. We find that three-body terms
appear at lower orders than naively expected. They start with a marginal term
that varies as a logarithm rather than a power of the energy scales in the
problem. The marginal term has important implications for the three-body
problem in nuclear physics.
