Self-adjoint Dirac systems and subclasses of canonical systems, which
generalize Dirac systems are studied. Explicit and global solutions of direct
and inverse problems are obtained. A local Borg-Marchenko-type theorem,
integral representation of the Weyl function, and results on interpolation of
Weyl functions are also derived.
