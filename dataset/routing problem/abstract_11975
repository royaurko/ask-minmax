An analytical-numerical analysis of the singular self-adjoint spectral
problem for a system of three linear ordinary second-order differential
equations defined on the entire real exis is presented. This problem comes to
existence in the nonlinear field theory. The dependence of the differential
equations on the spectral parameter is nonlinear, which results in a quadratic
operator Hermitian pencil.
