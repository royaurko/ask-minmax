VB-groupoids can be thought of as vector bundle objects in the category of
Lie groupoids. Just as Lie algebroids are the infinitesimal counterparts of Lie
groupoids, VB-algebroids correspond to the infinitesimal version of
VB-groupoids. In this work we address the problem of the existence of a
VB-groupoid admitting a given VB-algebroid as its infinitesimal data. Our main
result is an explicit characterization of the obstructions appearing in this
integrability problem as the vanishing of the spherical periods of certain
cohomology classes. Along the way, we illustrate our result in concrete
examples. Finally, as a corollary, we obtain computable obstructions for a
$2$-term representation up to homotopy of Lie algebroid to arise as the
infinitesimal counterpart of a smooth such representation of a Lie groupoid.
