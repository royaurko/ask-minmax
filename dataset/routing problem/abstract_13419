A qualitative comparison of total variation like penalties (total variation,
Huber variant of total variation, total generalized variation, ...) is made in
the context of global seismic tomography. Both penalized and constrained
formulations of seismic recovery problems are treated. A number of simple
iterative recovery algorithms applicable to these problems are described. The
convergence speed of these algorithms is compared numerically in this setting.
For the constrained formulation a new algorithm is proposed and its convergence
is proven.
