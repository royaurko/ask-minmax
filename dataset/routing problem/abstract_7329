By using methods of classical analysis and special functions an old and
attractive Salem's problem ( posed in {\it Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.} {\bf 53}
(3) (1943), p. 439 ) whether Fourier-Stieltjes coefficients of the Minkowski
question mark function vanish at infinity is solved affirmatively. Moreover, we
generalize the Salem problem, proving that the Fourier-Stieltjes coefficients
of any power $m\in \mathbb{N}$ of the Minkowski question mark function vanish
at infinity as well.
