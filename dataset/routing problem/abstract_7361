The abstract Cauchy problem for the distributed order fractional evolution
equation in the Caputo and in the Riemann-Liouville sense is studied for
operators generating a strongly continuous one-parameter semigroup on a Banach
space. Continuous as well as discrete distribution of fractional
time-derivatives of order less than one are considered. The problem is
reformulated as an abstract Volterra integral equation. It is proven that its
kernel satisfy certain complete monotonicity properties. Based on these
properties, the well-posedness of the problem is established and a series
expansion of the solution is obtained. In case of ordered Banach space this
representation implies positivity of the solution operator. In addition, a
subordination formula is obtained.
