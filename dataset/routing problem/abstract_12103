We consider the Cauchy problem for the wave equation on a non-globally
hyperbolic manifold of the special form (Minkowski plane with a handle)
containing closed timelike curves (time machines). We prove that the classical
solution of the Cauchy problem exists and is unique if and only if the initial
data satisfy to some set of additional conditions.
