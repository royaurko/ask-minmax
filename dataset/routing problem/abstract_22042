We establish almost sure invariance principles, a strong form of
approximation by Brownian motion, for non-stationary time-series arising as
observations on dynamical systems. Our examples include observations on
sequential expanding maps, perturbed dynamical systems, non-stationary
sequences of functions on hyperbolic systems as well as applications to the
shrinking target problem in expanding systems.
