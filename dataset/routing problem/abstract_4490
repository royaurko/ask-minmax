Let $V$, $\tilde V$ be hypersurface germs in $\CC^m$, each having a
quasi-homogeneous isolated singularity at the origin. We show that the
biholomorphic equivalence problem for $V$, $\tilde V$ reduces to the linear
equivalence problem for certain polynomials $P$, $\tilde P$ arising from the
moduli algebras of $V$, $\tilde V$. The polynomials $P$, $\tilde P$ are
completely determined by their quadratic and cubic terms, hence the
biholomorphic equivalence problem for $V$, $\tilde V$ in fact reduces to the
linear equivalence problem for pairs of quadratic and cubic forms.
