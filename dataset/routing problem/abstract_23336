A new possibility for solving the strong CP-problem is suggested,which
assumes that apart of the ordinary world of observable particles described by
standard model, there exits a mirror sector of particles and two sectors share
the same Peccei-Quinn symmetry realized {\it a l\`a} Weinberg-Wilczek model.
The mirror gauge group is completely analogous to that of the standard model
for ordinary particles but having somewhat larger electroweak scale,which in
turn implies the infrared scale $\Lambda'$ of the mirror strong interactions
has to be larger than the ordinary QCD scale $\Lambda$. In this way, the axion
mass and interaction constants are actually determined by mirror sector scales
$v'$ and $\Lambda'$, while the $\theta$ terms are simultaneously cancelled in
both sectors due to mirror symmetry. The experimental and astrophysical limits
on such an axion is discussed. An interesting parameter window is found where
$f_a \sim {\rm few}\times 10^4$ GeV whereas the axion mass is $\sim 1$ MeV.
