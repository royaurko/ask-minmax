We propose a mechanism displaying confinement, as defined by the behavior of
the propagators, for 4 dimensional, N = 1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in
superfield formalism. In this work we intend to verify the possibility of
extending the known Gribov problem of quantization of Yang-Mills theories and
the implementation of a local action with auxiliary superfields like
Gribov-Zwanziger approach to this problem.
