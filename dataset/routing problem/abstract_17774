Uniform one-dimensional fragment UF1^= is a formalism obtained from
first-order logic by limiting quantification to applications of blocks of
existential (universal) quantifiers such that at most one variable remains free
in the quantified formula. The fragment is closed under Boolean operations, but
additional restrictions (called uniformity conditions) apply to combinations of
atomic formulas with two or more variables. The fragment can be seen as a
canonical generalization of two-variable logic, defined in order to be able to
deal with relations of arbitrary arities. The fragment was introduced recently,
and it was shown that the satisfiability problem of the equality-free fragment
of UF1^= is decidable. In this article we establish that the satisfiability and
finite satisfiability problems of UF1^= are NEXPTIME-complete. We also show
that the corresponding problems for the extension of UF1^= with counting
quantifiers are undecidable. In addition to decidability questions, we compare
the expressivities of UF1^= and two-variable logic with counting quantifiers
FOC^2. We show that while the logics are incomparable in general, UF1^= is
strictly contained in FOC^2 when attention is restricted to vocabularies with
the arity bound two.
