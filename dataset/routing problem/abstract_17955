This paper addresses self-localization of stationary sensor networks based on
inter-neighbor bearings and anchor nodes whose locations are known. In our
work, we formulate the bearing-only network localization problem as a linear
least-squares problem and consider measurement models with and without errors.
We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the localizability of a
network with both algebraic and rigidity theoretic interpretations. The
proposed conditions fully describe the relationship between the localizability
and the bearing rigidity properties of a network. We also analyze the
sensitivity of the localization problem to constant measurement errors. Upper
bounds for the localization error and the bearing errors that a network can
tolerate are presented. Finally, we propose distributed protocols to globally
localize bearing-only networks. All the results presented in the paper are
applicable to networks in arbitrary dimensions. This work is validated with
numerical simulations.
