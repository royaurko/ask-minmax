A fundamental problem of forced magnetic reconnection has been solved taking
into account the plasmoid instability of thin reconnecting current sheets. In
this problem, the reconnection is driven by a small amplitude boundary
perturbation in a tearing-stable slab plasma equilibrium. It is shown that the
evolution of the magnetic reconnection process depends on the external source
perturbation and the microscopic plasma parameters. Small perturbations lead to
a slow nonlinear Rutherford evolution, whereas larger perturbations can lead to
either a stable Sweet-Parker-like phase or a plasmoid phase. An expression for
the threshold perturbation amplitude required to trigger the plasmoid phase is
derived, as well as an analytical expression for the reconnection rate in the
plasmoid-dominated regime. Visco-resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations
complement the analytical calculations. The plasmoid formation plays a crucial
role in allowing fast reconnection in a magnetohydrodynamical plasma, and the
presented results suggest that it may occur and have profound consequences even
if the plasma is tearing-stable.
