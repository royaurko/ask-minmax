Scaled Boolean algebras are a category of mathematical objects that arose
from attempts to understand why the conventional rules of probability should
hold when probabilities are construed, not as frequencies or proportions or the
like, but rather as degrees of belief in uncertain propositions. This paper
separates the study of these objects from that not-entirely-mathematical
problem that motivated them. That motivating problem is explicated in the first
section, and the application of scaled Boolean algebras to it is explained in
the last section. The intermediate sections deal only with the mathematics. It
is hoped that this isolation of the mathematics from the motivating problem
makes the mathematics clearer.
