We consider the weak solutions to the Euler-Fourier system describing the
motion of a compressible heat conducting gas. Employing the method of convex
integration, we show that the problem admits infinitely many global-in-time
weak solutions for any choice of smooth initial data. We also show that for any
initial distribution of the density and temperature, there exists an initial
velocity such that the associated initial-value problem possesses infinitely
many solutions that conserve the total energy.
