We address renormalisation group evolution issues that arise in the Anomaly
Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking scenario when the tachyonic slepton problem is
resolved by Fayet-Iliopoulos term contributions. We present typical sparticle
spectra both for the original formulation of this idea and an alternative using
Fayet-Iliopoulos terms for a U(1) compatible with a straightforward GUT
embedding.
