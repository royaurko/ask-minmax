This paper is a second in a series devoted to the study of a two-oscillator
system in linear relative motion (the first one published as a letter in
Europhys. Lett. 91, 60003 (2010)). The main idea behind considering this kind
of system is to use it as a simple model for Casimir friction. In the present
paper we extend our previous theory so as to obtain the change in the
oscillator energy to second order in the perturbation, even though we employ
first order perturbation theory only. The results agree with, and confirm, our
earlier results obtained via different routes. The friction force is finite at
finite temperatures, whereas in the case of two oscillators moving with
constant relative velocity the force becomes zero at zero temperature, due to
slowly varying coupling.
