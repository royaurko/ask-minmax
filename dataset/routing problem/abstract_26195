We consider the problem of enumerating permutations in the symmetric group on
$n$ elements which avoid a given set of consecutive pattern $S$, and in
particular computing asymptotics as $n$ tends to infinity. We develop a general
method which solves this enumeration problem using the spectral theory of
integral operators on $L^{2}([0,1]^{m})$, where the patterns in $S$ has length
$m+1$. Kre\u{\i}n and Rutman's generalization of the Perron--Frobenius theory
of non-negative matrices plays a central role. Our methods give detailed
asymptotic expansions and allow for explicit computation of leading terms in
many cases. As a corollary to our results, we settle a conjecture of Warlimont
on asymptotics for the number of permutations avoiding a consecutive pattern.
