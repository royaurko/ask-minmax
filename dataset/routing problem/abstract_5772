The problem of quasistatic and rate-independent evolution of
elastic-plastic-brittle delamination at small strains is considered.
Delamination processes for linear elastic bodies glued by an adhesive to each
other or to a rigid outer surface are studied. The energy amounts dissipated in
fracture Mode I (opening) and Mode II (shear) at an interface may be different.
A concept of internal parameters is used here on the delaminating interfaces,
involving a couple of scalar damage variable and a plastic tangential slip with
kinematic-type hardening. The so-called energetic solution concept is employed.
An inelastic process at an interface is devised in such a way that the
dissipated energy depends only on the rates of internal parameters and
therefore the model is associative. A fully implicit time discretization is
combined with a spatial discretization of elastic bodies by the BEM to solve
the delamination problem. The BEM is used in the solution of the respective
boundary value problems, for each subdomain separately, to compute the
corresponding total potential energy. Sample problems are analysed by a
collocation BEM code to illustrate the capabilities of the numerical procedure
developed.
