The coincidence problems and other dynamical features of dark energy are
studied in cosmological models with variable cosmological parameters and in
models with the composite dark energy. It is found that many of the problems
usually considered to be cosmological coincidences can be explained or
significantly alleviated in the aforementioned models.
