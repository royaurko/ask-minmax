Following a recent paper by N. Mandache (Inverse Problems 17 (2001), pp.
1435-1444), we establish a general procedure for determining the instability
character of inverse problems. We apply this procedure to many elliptic inverse
problems concerning the determination of defects of various types by different
kinds of boundary measurements and we show that these problems are
exponentially ill-posed.
