The problem of parameterization is often central to the effective deployment
of nature-inspired algorithms. However, finding the optimal set of parameter
values for a combination of problem instance and solution method is highly
challenging, and few concrete guidelines exist on how and when such tuning may
be performed. Previous work tends to either focus on a specific algorithm or
use benchmark problems, and both of these restrictions limit the applicability
of any findings. Here, we examine a number of different algorithms, and study
them in a "problem agnostic" fashion (i.e., one that is not tied to specific
instances) by considering their performance on fitness landscapes with varying
characteristics. Using this approach, we make a number of observations on which
algorithms may (or may not) benefit from tuning, and in which specific
circumstances.
