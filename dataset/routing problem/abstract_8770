Two maximization problems of R\'enyi entropy rate are investigated: the
maximization over all stochastic processes whose marginals satisfy a linear
constraint, and the Burg-like maximization over all stochastic processes whose
autocovariance function begins with some given values. The solutions are
related to the solutions to the analogous maximization problems of Shannon
entropy rate.
