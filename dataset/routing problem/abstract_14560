A procedure to recover explicitly self-adjoint matrix Dirac systems on
semi-axis (with both discrete and continuous components of spectrum) from
rational Weyl functions is considered. Its stability is proved. GBDT version of
Baecklund-Darboux transformation and various important results on Riccati
equations are used for this purpose.
