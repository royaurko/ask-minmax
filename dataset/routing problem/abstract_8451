We present in this paper a result about existence and convexity of solutions
to a free boundary problem of Bernoulli type, with non constant gradient
boundary constraint depending on the outer unit normal. In particular we prove
that, in the convex case, the existence of a subsolution guarantees the
existence of a classical solution, which is proved to be convex.
