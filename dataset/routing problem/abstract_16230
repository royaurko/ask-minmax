In this thesis, conducted in the field of few--body nuclear physics,I studied
low energy inelastic reactions of electro--weak probes on light nuclei. Such
interactions hold experimental and theoretical attention in recent years
because of the role they play in various fields of physics, stretching from
checking the standard model limits; through nuclear structure and dynamics
research; up to microscopic interaction in astrophysical phenomena, such as
supernova explosion and the nucleosynthesis of the elements. The reactions
considered in this work are: (i) Neutrino interaction with A=3 and $^4$He
nuclei, in energies typical to core-collapse supernova. For $^4$He both the
neutral and charged current reactions were calculated, whereas only neutral
current reactions are calculated for A=3 nuclei. (ii) Photoabsorption on
$^4$He. This long standing problem has been the attraction of theoretical and
experimental efforts in the last three decades. The calculations make use of
two novel methods. the Lorentz Integral Transform (LIT) method, which is used
to transform the scattering problem to a bound state like problem. The
resulting equations are solved using the Effective Interaction in the
Hyperspherical Harmonics (EIHH) method.
