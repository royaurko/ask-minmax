Gruenhage asked if it was possible to cover the real line by less than
continuum many translates of a compact nullset. Under the Continuum Hypothesis
the answer is obviously negative. Elekes and Stepr\=ans gave an affirmative
answer by showing that if $C_{EK}$ is the well known compact nullset considered
first by Erd\H os and Kakutani then $\RR$ can be covered by $\cof(\iN)$ many
translates of $C_{EK}$. As this set has no analogue in more general groups, it
was posed as an open question whether such a result holds for uncountable
locally compact Polish groups. In this paper we give an affirmative answer in
the abelian case.
  More precisely, we show that if $G$ is a nondiscrete locally compact abelian
group in which every open subgroup is of index at most $\cof(\iN)$ then there
exists a compact set $C$ of Haar measure zero such that $G$ can be covered by
$\cof(\iN)$ many translates of $C$. This result, which is optimal in a sense,
covers the cases of uncountable compact abelian groups and of nondiscrete
separable locally compact abelian groups.
  We use Pontryagin's duality theory to reduce the problem to three special
cases; the circle group, countable products of finite discrete abelian groups,
and the groups of $p$-adic integers, and then we solve the problem on these
three groups separately.
  In addition, using representation theory, we reduce the nonabelian case to
the classes of Lie groups and profinite groups, and we also settle the problem
for Lie groups. We remark that M.~Ab\'ert recently gave an affirmative answer
for profinite groups.
