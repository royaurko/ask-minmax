We study the asymptotic behavior, in a ``semi-classical limit'', of the first
eigenvalues (i.e. the groundstate energies) of a class of Schr\"{o}dinger
operators with magnetic fields and the relationship of this behavior with
compactness in the $\bar\partial$-Neumann problem on Hartogs domains in $\C^2$
