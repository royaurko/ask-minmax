We study the problem of sequential prediction of categorical data and discuss
a generalisation of Blackwell's algorithm on 0-1 data. The arguments are based
on Blackwell's approachability results given in Blackwell, D. (1956): An Analog
of the Minimax Theorem for Vector Payoffs, Pacific Journal of Mathematics, 6,
1-8.
