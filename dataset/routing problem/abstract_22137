We investigate potential spaces associated with Jacobi expansions. We prove
structural and Sobolev-type embedding theorems for these spaces. We also
establish their characterizations in terms of suitably defined fractional
square functions. Finally, we present sample applications of the Jacobi
potential spaces connected with a PDE problem.
