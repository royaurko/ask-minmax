This paper proposes to extend the discrete Verhulst power equilibrium
approach, previously suggested in [1], to the power-rate optimal allocation
problem. Multirate users associated to different types of traffic are
aggregated to distinct user' classes, with the assurance of minimum rate
allocation per user and QoS. Herein, Verhulst power allocation algorithm was
adapted to the single-input-single-output DS/CDMA jointly power-rate control
problem. The analysis was carried out taking into account the convergence time,
quality of solution, in terms of the normalized squared error (NSE), when
compared with the analytical solution based on interference matrix inverse, and
computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the validity of the
proposed resource allocation methodology.
