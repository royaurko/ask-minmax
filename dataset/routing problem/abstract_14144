We consider the restricted n + 1-body problem of Newtonian mechanics. For
periodic, planar configurations of n bodies which is symmetric under rotation
by a fixed angle, the z-axis is invariant. We consider the effect of placing a
massless particle on the z-axis. The study of the motion of this particle can
then be modelled as a time-dependent Hamiltonian System. We give a geometric
construction of a surface in the three-dimensional phase space separating
orbits for which the massless particle escapes to infinity from those for which
it does not. The construction is demonstrated numerically in a few examples
