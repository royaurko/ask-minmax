This paper studies the distributed control and estimation of multi-agent
systems based on bearing information. In particular, we consider two problems:
(i) the distributed control of bearing-constrained formations using relative
position measurements and (ii) the distributed localization of sensor networks
using bearing measurements. Both of the two problems are considered in
arbitrary dimensional spaces. The analyses of the two problems rely on the
recently developed bearing rigidity theory. We show that the two problems have
the same mathematical formulation and can be solved by identical protocols. The
proposed controller and estimator can globally solve the two problems without
ambiguity. The results are supported with illustrative simulations.
