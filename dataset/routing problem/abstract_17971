A $M/M/N+M$ queuing network is considered with $d$ independent customer
classes and $d$ server pools in Halfin-Whitt regime. Class $i$ customers have
priority for service in pool $i$ for $i=1, ..., d$, and may access other pool
if the pool has an idle server. We formulate an ergodic control problem where
the running cost is given by a non-negative convex function with polynomial
growth. We show that the limiting controlled diffusion is governed by a control
set that depends on the state. We provide a complete analysis for the limiting
ergodic control problem and establish asymptotic convergence of the value
functions for the queuing model.
