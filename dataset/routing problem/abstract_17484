We consider the first problem that appears in any application of
synchronizing automata, namely, the problem of deciding whether or not a given
$n$-state $k$-letter automaton is synchronizing. First we generalize results
from \cite{RandSynch},\cite{On2Problems} for the case of strongly connected
partial automata. Specifically, for $k>1$ we show that an automaton is
synchronizing with probability $1-O(\frac{1}{n^{0.5k}})$ and present an
algorithm with linear in $n$ expected time, while the best known algorithm is
quadratic on each instance. This results are interesting due to their
applications in synchronization of finite state information sources.
  After that we consider the synchronization of reachable partial automata that
has application for splicing systems in computational biology. For this case we
prove that the problem of testing a given automaton for synchronization is
NP-complete.
