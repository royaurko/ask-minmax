We consider the classic Set Cover problem in the data stream model. For $n$
elements and $m$ sets we give a $O(1/\delta)$-pass algorithm with a strongly
sub-linear $\tilde{O}(mn^{\delta})$ space and logarithmic approximation factor.
This yields a significant improvement over the earlier algorithm of [DIMV14]
which used exponentially larger number of passes. We complement this result by
showing that the tradeoff between the number of passes and space exhibited by
our algorithm is in fact tight, at least when the approximation factor is equal
to $1$. Specifically, we show that any algorithm that computes set cover
exactly using $({1 \over 2\delta}-1)$ passes must use $\tilde{\Omega}(m
n^{\delta})$ space.
  Finally, we show that any randomized one-pass algorithm that distinguishes
between covers of size 2 and 3 must use a linear (i.e., $\Omega(mn)$) amount of
space. The only previous randomized lower bound for Set Cover, due to
[Nisan02], provided only a sub-linear lower bound of $\Omega(m)$. This
indicates that using multiple passes might be necessary in order to achieve
sub-linear space bounds for this problem while guaranteeing small approximation
factors.
