We investigate the distribution of the time spent by a random walker to the
right of a boundary moving with constant velocity v. For the continuous-time
problem (Brownian motion), we provide a simple alternative proof of Newman's
recent result [J.Phys.A 34, L89 (2001)] using a method due to Kac. We then
discuss the same problem for the case of a random walk in discrete time with an
arbitrary distribution of steps, taking advantage of the general set of results
due to Sparre Andersen. For the binomial random walk we analyse the corrections
to the continuum limit on the example of the mean occupation time. The case of
Cauchy-distributed steps is also studied.
