We prove that the problem of reconstructing a permutation
$\pi_1,\dotsc,\pi_n$ of the integers $[1\dotso n]$ given the absolute
differences $|\pi_{i+1}-\pi_i|$, $i = 1,\dotsc,n-1$ is NP-complete. As an
intermediate step we first prove the NP-completeness of the decision version of
a new puzzle game that we call Crazy Frog Puzzle. The permutation
reconstruction from differences is one of the simplest combinatorial problems
that have been proved to be computationally intractable.
