Secure routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks have been developed
recently, yet, it has been unclear what are the properties they achieve, as a
formal analysis of these protocols is mostly lacking. In this paper, we are
concerned with this problem, how to specify and how to prove the correctness of
a secure routing protocol. We provide a definition of what a protocol is
expected to achieve independently of its functionality, as well as
communication and adversary models. This way, we enable formal reasoning on the
correctness of secure routing protocols. We demonstrate this by analyzing two
protocols from the literature.
