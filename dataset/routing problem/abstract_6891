We consider an inverse spectral problem with the third-order differential
equation and the non-separated boundary conditions. Two theorems on the
uniqueness of the solution of this problem are proved, and a method for
establishing the unknown conditions is obtained, using 19 eigenvalues. The
method of approximate calculation of unknown boundary conditions is explained,
with the help of an example.
