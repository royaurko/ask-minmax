Given an undirected graph with edge costs and edge demands, the Capacitated
Arc Routing problem (CARP) asks for minimum-cost routes for equal-capacity
vehicles so as to satisfy all demands. Constant-factor polynomial-time
approximation algorithms were proposed for CARP with triangle inequality, while
CARP was claimed to be NP-hard to approximate within any constant factor in
general. Correcting this claim, we show that any factor {\alpha} approximation
for CARP with triangle inequality yields a factor {\alpha} approximation for
the general CARP.
