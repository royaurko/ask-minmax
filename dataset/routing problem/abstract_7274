In 1959, R.V. Kadison and I.M. Singer asked whether each pure state of the
algebra of bounded diagonal operators on $\ell^2$, admits a unique state
extension to $B(\ell^2)$. The positive answer was given in June 2013 by A.
Marcus, D. Spielman and N. Srivastava, who took advantage of a series of
translations of the original question, due to C. Akemann, J. Anderson, N.
Weaver,... Ultimately, the problem boils down to an estimate of the largest
zero of the expected characteristic polynomial of the sum of independent random
variables taking values in rank 1 positive matrices in the algebra of n-by-n
matrices.
