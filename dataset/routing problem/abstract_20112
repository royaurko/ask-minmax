The questions when two Morse function on closed manifolds are conjugated is
investigated. Using the handle decompositions of manifolds the condition of
conjugation is formulated. For each Morse function on 3-manifold the ordered
generalized Heegaard diagram is built. The criteria of Morse function
conjugation are given in the terms of equivalence of such diagrams.
