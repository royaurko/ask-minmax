Decaying vacuum cosmological models evolving smoothly between two extreme
(very early and late time) de Sitter phases are capable to solve naturally
several cosmic problems, among them: (i) the singularity, (ii) the horizon,
(iii) the graceful-exit from inflation. Here we discuss a solution the
coincidence problem based on a large class of running vacuum cosmologies
evolving from de Sitter to de Sitter recently proposed. It is argued that even
the cosmological constant problem can be solved provided that the
characteristic scales of the limiting de Sitter manifolds are predicted from
first principles.
