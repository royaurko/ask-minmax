We consider a class of self-interacting random walks in deterministic or
random environments, known as excited random walks or cookie walks, on the
d-dimensional integer lattice. The main purpose of this paper is two-fold: to
give a survey of known results and some of the methods and to present several
new results. The latter include functional limit theorems for transient
one-dimensional excited random walks in bounded i.i.d. cookie environments as
well as some zero-one laws. Several open problems are stated.
