The quark-lepton mass problem and the ideas of mass protection are reviewed.
The hierarchy problem and suggestions for its resolution, including Little
Higgs models, are discussed. The Multiple Point Principle is introduced and
used within the Standard Model to predict the top quark and Higgs particle
masses. Mass matrix ans\"{a}tze are considered; in particular we discuss the
lightest family mass generation model, in which all the quark mixing angles are
successfully expressed in terms of simple expressions involving quark mass
ratios. It is argued that an underlying chiral flavour symmetry is responsible
for the hierarchical texture of the fermion mass matrices. The phenomenology of
neutrino mass matrices is briefly discussed.
