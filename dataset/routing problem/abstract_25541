Consider the two related problems of sensor selection and sensor fusion. In
the first, given a set of sensors, one wishes to identify a subset of the
sensors, which while small in size, captures the essence of the data gathered
by the sensors. In the second, one wishes to construct a fused sensor, which
utilizes the data from the sensors (possibly after discarding dependent ones)
in order to create a single sensor which is more reliable than each of the
individual ones. In this work, we rigorously define the dependence among
sensors in terms of joint empirical measures and incremental parsing. We show
that these measures adhere to a polymatroid structure, which in turn
facilitates the application of efficient algorithms for sensor selection. We
suggest both a random and a greedy algorithm for sensor selection. Given an
independent set, we then turn to the fusion problem, and suggest a novel
variant of the exponential weighting algorithm. In the suggested algorithm, one
competes against an augmented set of sensors, which allows it to converge to
the best fused sensor in a family of sensors, without having any prior data on
the sensors' performance.
