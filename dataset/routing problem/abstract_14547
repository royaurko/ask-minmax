We study the multi-interval boundary-value Sturm-Liouville problems with
distributional potentials. For the corresponding symmetric operators boundary
triplets are found and the constructive descriptions of all self-adjoint,
maximal dissipative and maximal accumulative extensions and generalized
resolvents in terms of homogeneous boundary conditions are given. It is shown
that all real maximal dissipative and maximal accumulative extensions are
self-adjoint and all such extensions are described.
