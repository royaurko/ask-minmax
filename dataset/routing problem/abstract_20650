We prove that every fragmentable linearly ordered compact space is almost
totally disconnected. This combined with a result of Arvanitakis yields that
every linearly ordered quasi Radon-Nikodym compact space is Radon-Nikodym,
providing a new partial answer to the problem of continuous images of
Radon-Nikodym compacta.
