Initial-boundary value problem for linearized equations of motion of viscous
barotropic fluid in a bounded domain is considered. Existence, uniqueness and
estimates of weak solutions to this problem are derived. Convergence of the
solutions towards the incompressible limit when compressibility tends to zero
is studied.
