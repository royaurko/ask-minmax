Efficient distributed spectrum sharing mechanism is crucial for improving the
spectrum utilization. The spatial aspect of spectrum sharing, however, is less
understood than many other aspects. In this paper, we generalize a recently
proposed spatial congestion game framework to design efficient distributed
spectrum access mechanisms with spatial reuse. We first propose a spatial
channel selection game to model the distributed channel selection problem with
fixed user locations. We show that the game is a potential game, and develop a
distributed learning mechanism that converges to a Nash equilibrium only based
on users' local observations. We then formulate the joint channel and location
selection problem as a spatial channel selection and mobility game, and show
that it is also a potential game. We next propose a distributed strategic
mobility algorithm, jointly with the distributed learning mechanism, that can
converge to a Nash equilibrium.
