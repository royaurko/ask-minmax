Using the methodology of (rigorous) {\it experimental mathematics}, we give a
simple and motivated solution to Zudilin's question concerning a $q$-analog of
a problem posed by Asmus Schmidt about a certain binomial coefficients sum. Our
method is based on two simple identities that can be automatically proved using
the Zeilberger and $q$-Zeilberger algorithms. We further illustrate our method
by proving two further binomial coefficients sums.
