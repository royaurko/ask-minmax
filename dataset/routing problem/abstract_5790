In a fractional Cauchy problem, the first time derivative is replaced by a
Caputo fractional derivative of order less than one. If the original Cauchy
problem governs a Markov process, a non-Markovian time change yields a
stochastic solution to the fractional Cauchy problem, using the first passage
time of a stable subordinator. This paper proves that a spectrally negative
stable process reflected at its infimum has the same one dimensional
distributions as the inverse stable subordinator. Therefore, this Markov
process can also be used as a time change, to produce stochastic solutions to
fractional Cauchy problems. The proof uses an extension of the D. Andr\'e
reflection principle. The forward equation of the reflected stable process is
established, including the appropriate fractional boundary condition, and its
transition densities are explicitly computed.
