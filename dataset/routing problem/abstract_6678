A moment problem is presented for a class of signed measures which are termed
pseudo-positive. Our main result says that for every pseudo-positive definite
functional (subject to some reasonable restrictions) there exists a
representing pseudo-positive measure. The second main result is a
characterization of determinacy in the class of equivalent pseudo-positive
representation measures. Finally the corresponding truncated moment problem is
discussed.
