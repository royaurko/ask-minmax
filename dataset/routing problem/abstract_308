It is well-known that wide-area networks face today several performance and
reliability problems. In this work, we propose to solve these problems by
connecting two or more local-area networks together via a Redundant Array of
Internet Links (or RAIL) and by proactively replicating each packet over these
links. In that sense, RAIL is for networks what RAID (Redundant Array of
Inexpensive Disks) was for disks. In this paper, we describe the RAIL approach,
present our prototype (called the RAILedge), and evaluate its performance.
First, we demonstrate that using multiple Internet links significantly improves
the end-to-end performance in terms of network-level as well as
application-level metrics for Voice-over-IP and TCP. Second, we show that a
delay padding mechanism is needed to complement RAIL when there is significant
delay disparity between the paths. Third, we show that two paths provide most
of the benefit, if carefully managed. Finally, we discuss a RAIL-network
architecture, where RAILedges make use of path redundancy, route control and
application-specific mechanisms, to improve WAN performance.
