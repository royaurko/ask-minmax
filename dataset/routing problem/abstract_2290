A scaling relation for the disjoining pressure of strongly confined polymer
fluids is proposed for the first time, which yields directly the scaling
exponent, nu, of the radius of gyration for polymers. To test the proposed
scaling relation we performed extensive particle based, coarse grained computer
simulations of polymers confined under theta solvent conditions and found that
the value of nu agrees with the expected value for strictly two dimensional
chains, nu = 4/7, which points towards the essential correctness of our scaling
relation. New approaches are suggested for experimental tests of this scaling
law. This work opens up the way to look for other scaling exponents that may
reveal new physical regimes and it constitutes an efficient route to determine
nu because the scaling exponent can be obtained with chains of a single
polymerization degree by simply reducing the distance between the confining
plates.
