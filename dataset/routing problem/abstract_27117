In this work, we propose phase precoding for the compute-and-forward (CoF)
protocol. We derive the phase precoded computation rate and show that it is
greater than the original computation rate of CoF protocol without precoder. To
maximize the phase precoded computation rate, we need to 'jointly' find the
optimum phase precoding matrix and the corresponding network equation
coefficients. This is a mixed integer programming problem where the optimum
precoders should be obtained at the transmitters and the network equation
coefficients have to be computed at the relays. To solve this problem, we
introduce phase precoded CoF with partial feedback. It is a quantized precoding
system where the relay jointly computes both a quasi-optimal precoder from a
finite codebook and the corresponding network equations. The index of the
obtained phase precoder within the codebook will then be fedback to the
transmitters. A "deep hole phase precoder" is presented as an example of such a
scheme. We further simulate our scheme with a lattice code carved out of the
Gosset lattice and show that significant coding gains can be obtained in terms
of equation error performance.
