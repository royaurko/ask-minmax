Code cloning negatively affects industrial software and threatens
intellectual property. This paper presents a novel approach to detecting cloned
software by using a bijective matching technique. The proposed approach focuses
on increasing the range of similarity measures and thus enhancing the precision
of the detection. This is achieved by extending a well-known stable-marriage
problem (SMP) and demonstrating how matches between code fragments of different
files can be expressed. A prototype of the proposed approach is provided using
a proper scenario, which shows a noticeable improvement in several features of
clone detection such as scalability and accuracy.
