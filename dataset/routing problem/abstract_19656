Wattenhofer [WW04] derive a complicated distributed algorithm to compute a
weighted matching of an arbitrary weighted graph, that is at most a factor 5
away from the maximum weighted matching of that graph. We show that a variant
of the obvious sequential greedy algorithm [Pre99], that computes a weighted
matching at most a factor 2 away from the maximum, is easily distributed. This
yields the best known distributed approximation algorithm for this problem so
far.
