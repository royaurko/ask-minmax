The initial-boundary value problem for the generalized Korteweg-de Vries
equation on a half-line is studied by adapting the initial value techniques
developed by Kenig, Ponce and Vega and Bourgain to the initial-boundary
setting. The approach consists of replacing the initial-boundary problem by a
forced initial value problem. The forcing is selected to satisfy the boundary
condition by inverting a Riemann-Liouville fractional integral.
