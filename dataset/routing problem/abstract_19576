A perceptron is trained by a random bit sequence. In comparison to the
corresponding classification problem, the storage capacity decreases to
alpha_c=1.70\pm 0.02 due to correlations between input and output bits. The
numerical results are supported by a signal to noise analysis of Hebbian
weights.
