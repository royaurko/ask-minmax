We deal with the existing problem of filtered multiplicative bases of
finite-dimensional associative algebras. For an associative algebra A over a
field, we investigate when the property of having a filtered multiplicative
basis is hereditated by homomorphic images or by the associated graded algebra
of $A$. These results are then applied to some classes of group algebras and
restricted enveloping algebras.
