Given a directed graph $G$, a set of $k$ terminals and an integer $p$, the
\textsc{Directed Vertex Multiway Cut} problem asks if there is a set $S$ of at
most $p$ (nonterminal) vertices whose removal disconnects each terminal from
all other terminals. \textsc{Directed Edge Multiway Cut} is the analogous
problem where $S$ is a set of at most $p$ edges. These two problems indeed are
known to be equivalent. A natural generalization of the multiway cut is the
\emph{multicut} problem, in which we want to disconnect only a set of $k$ given
pairs instead of all pairs. Marx (Theor. Comp. Sci. 2006) showed that in
undirected graphs multiway cut is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) parameterized
by $p$. Marx and Razgon (STOC 2011) showed that undirected multicut is FPT and
directed multicut is W[1]-hard parameterized by $p$. We complete the picture
here by our main result which is that both \textsc{Directed Vertex Multiway
Cut} and \textsc{Directed Edge Multiway Cut} can be solved in time
$2^{2^{O(p)}}n^{O(1)}$, i.e., FPT parameterized by size $p$ of the cutset of
the solution. This answers an open question raised by Marx (Theor. Comp. Sci.
2006) and Marx and Razgon (STOC 2011). It follows from our result that
\textsc{Directed Multicut} is FPT for the case of $k=2$ terminal pairs, which
answers another open problem raised in Marx and Razgon (STOC 2011).
