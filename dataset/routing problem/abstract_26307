We construct a complete, bounded Legendrian immersion in C^3. As direct
applications of it, we show the first examples of a weakly complete bounded
flat front in hyperbolic 3-space, a weakly complete bounded flat front in de
Sitter 3-space, and a weakly complete bounded improper affine front in R^3.
