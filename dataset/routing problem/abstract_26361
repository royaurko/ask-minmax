We consider the following generalization of the classical pursuit-evasion
problem, which we call k-capture. A group of n pursuers (hyenas) wish to
capture an evader (lion) who is free to move in an m-dimensional Euclidean
space, the pursuers and the evader can move with the same maximum speed, and at
least k pursuers must simultaneously reach the evader's location to capture it.
If fewer than k pursuers reach the evader, then those pursuers get destroyed by
the evader. Under what conditions can the evader be k-captured? We study this
problem in the discrete time, continuous space model and prove that k-capture
is possible if and only there exists a time when the evader lies in the
interior of the pursuers' k-Hull. When the pursuit occurs inside a compact,
convex subset of the Euclidean space, we show through an easy constructive
strategy that k-capture is always possible.
