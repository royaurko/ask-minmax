We study the classical approximate string matching problem, that is, given
strings $P$ and $Q$ and an error threshold $k$, find all ending positions of
substrings of $Q$ whose edit distance to $P$ is at most $k$. Let $P$ and $Q$
have lengths $m$ and $n$, respectively. On a standard unit-cost word RAM with
word size $w \geq \log n$ we present an algorithm using time $$ O(nk \cdot
\min(\frac{\log^2 m}{\log n},\frac{\log^2 m\log w}{w}) + n) $$ When $P$ is
short, namely, $m = 2^{o(\sqrt{\log n})}$ or $m = 2^{o(\sqrt{w/\log w})}$ this
improves the previously best known time bounds for the problem. The result is
achieved using a novel implementation of the Landau-Vishkin algorithm based on
tabulation and word-level parallelism.
