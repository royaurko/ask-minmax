We study the transmission problem in bounded domains with dissipative
boundary conditions. Under some natural assumptions, we prove uniform bounds of
the corresponding resolvents on the real axis at high frequency, and as a
consequence, we obtain free of eigenvalues regions. As an application, we get
exponential decay of the energy of the solutions of the correpsonding mixed
boundary value problems.
