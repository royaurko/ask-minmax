Supersymmetry solves the gauge hierarchy problem of the Standard Model if the
masses of supersymmetric partners of the SM particles are close to the weak
scale. In this thesis, we argue that the supersymmetric Standard Model, while
avoiding the fine tuning in electroweak symmetry breaking, requires
unnaturalness/fine tuning in some (other) sector of the theory. For example,
Baryon and Lepton number violating operators are allowed which lead to proton
decay and flavor changing neutral currents. We study some of the constraints
from the latter in this thesis. We have to impose an R-parity for the theory to
be both natural and viable. In the absence of flavor symmetries, the
supersymmetry breaking masses for the squarks and sleptons lead to too large
flavor changing neutral currents. We show that two of the solutions to this
problem, gauge mediation of supersymmetry breaking and making the scalars of
the first two generations heavier than a few TeV, reintroduce fine tuning in
electroweak symmetry breaking. We also construct a model of low energy gauge
mediation with a non-minimal messenger sector which improves the fine tuning
and also generates required Higgs mass terms. We show that this model can be
derived from a Grand Unified Theory despite the non-minimal spectrum.
