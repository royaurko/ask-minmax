We study the global structure of the set of radial solutions of a nonlinear
Dirichlet problem involving the p-Laplacian with p>2, in the unit ball of
$R^N$, $N \ges 1$. We show that all non-trivial radial solutions lie on smooth
curves of respectively positive and negative solutions and bifurcating from the
line of trivial solutions. This involves a local bifurcation result of
Crandall-Rabinowitz type, and global continuation arguments relying on
monotonicity properties of the equation. An important part of the analysis is
dedicated to the delicate issue of differentiability of the inverse
p-Laplacian.
  We thus obtain a complete description of the global continua of
positive/negative solutions bifurcating from the first eigenvalue of a
weighted, radial, p-Laplacian problem, by using purely analytical arguments,
whereas previous related results were proved by topological arguments or a
mixture of analytical and topological arguments. Our approach requires stronger
hypotheses but yields much stronger results, bifurcation occuring along smooth
curves of solutions, and not only connected sets.
