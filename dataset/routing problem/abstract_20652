We address the problem of relative frequencies of singlet and triplet
recombinations in a multiparticle system, which consists of spin-correlated
radical ion pairs. The nonlocal swapping of spin correlations due to
cross-recombinations is taken into account. It is shown that this swapping does
not contribute to singlet and triplet recombination frequencies in the absence
of spin evolution in the correlated pairs.
