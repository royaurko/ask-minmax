We find a grand unified SO(10) model which accommodates the bi-maximal
neutrino mixing for vacuum-oscillation solutions to the atmospheric and the
solar neutrino problems. This model maintains the original SO(10) mass relation
between neutrino and up-type quark masses, $m_{\nu_2} / m_{\nu_3} \sim
(m_{c}/m_{t})^2$.
