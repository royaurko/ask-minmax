Various astronomical observations point towards the evidence for dark energy.
One of the most mysterious problem is the coincidence problem: why dark energy
becomes dominant only recently. We present a scenario based on extended
quintessence models to explain the late-time domination of dark energy without
severe fine-tuning of initial conditions and model parameters.
