We comment on an analysis by Contopoulos et al. which demonstrates that the
governing six-dimensional Einstein equations for the mixmaster space-time
metric pass the ARS or reduced Painlev\'{e} test. We note that this is the case
irrespective of the value, $I$, of the generating Hamiltonian which is a
constant of motion. For $I < 0$ we find numerous closed orbits with two
unstable eigenvalues strongly indicating that there cannot exist two additional
first integrals apart from the Hamiltonian and thus that the system, at least
for this case, is very likely not integrable. In addition, we present numerical
evidence that the average Lyapunov exponent nevertheless vanishes. The model is
thus a very interesting example of a Hamiltonian dynamical system, which is
likely non-integrable yet passes the reduced Painlev\'{e} test.
