This paper presents a novel strategy for high-fidelity image restoration by
characterizing both local smoothness and nonlocal self-similarity of natural
images in a unified statistical manner. The main contributions are three-folds.
First, from the perspective of image statistics, a joint statistical modeling
(JSM) in an adaptive hybrid space-transform domain is established, which offers
a powerful mechanism of combining local smoothness and nonlocal self-similarity
simultaneously to ensure a more reliable and robust estimation. Second, a new
form of minimization functional for solving image inverse problem is formulated
using JSM under regularization-based framework. Finally, in order to make JSM
tractable and robust, a new Split-Bregman based algorithm is developed to
efficiently solve the above severely underdetermined inverse problem associated
with theoretical proof of convergence. Extensive experiments on image
inpainting, image deblurring and mixed Gaussian plus salt-and-pepper noise
removal applications verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
