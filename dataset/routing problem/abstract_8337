The aim of this paper is to establish strong convergence theorems for a
strongly relatively nonexpansive sequence in a smooth and uniformly convex
Banach space. Then we employ our results to approximate solutions of the zero
point problem for a maximal monotone operator and the fixed point problem for a
relatively nonexpansive mapping.
