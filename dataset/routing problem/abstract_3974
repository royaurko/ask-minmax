In the 1930's, Tarski introduced his plank problem at a time when the field
Discrete Geometry was about to born. It is quite remarkable that Tarski's
question and its variants continue to generate interest in the geometric and
analytic aspects of coverings by planks in the present time as well. The paper
is a survey type with a list of open research problems.
