The so-called ``G-dwarf problem'' emerged in the 1960's when it was noticed
that the observed metal distribution of nearby stars differs from what is
expected in simple models of the evolution of the Galaxy.
  We have determined metallicities for a sample of over 100 K dwarfs drawn from
the Hipparcos catalog, using R-I colours to estimate effective temperatures and
Geneva photometry to estimate [Fe/H]. We show there is a K-dwarf problem.
K-dwarfs have life-times older than the Galactic disc, so these are an ideal
star with which to investigate the disc's chemical evolution. Further
photometric observations of K dwarfs are under way.
