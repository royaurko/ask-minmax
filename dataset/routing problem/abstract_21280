In this contribution we briefly report on the progress and open problems in
parton distribution functions (PDFs), with emphasis on their implications for
LHC phenomenology. Then we study the impact of the recent ATLAS and CMS W
lepton asymmetry data on the NNPDF2.1 parton distributions. We show that these
data provide the first constrains on PDFs from LHC measurements.
