In this paper we present a spatially-adaptive method for image reconstruction
that is based on the concept of statistical multiresolution estimation as
introduced in [Frick K, Marnitz P, and Munk A. "Statistical multiresolution
Dantzig estimation in imaging: Fundamental concepts and algorithmic framework".
Electron. J. Stat., 6:231-268, 2012]. It constitutes a variational
regularization technique that uses an supremum-type distance measure as
data-fidelity combined with a convex cost functional. The resulting convex
optimization problem is approached by a combination of an inexact alternating
direction method of multipliers and Dykstra's projection algorithm. We describe
a novel method for balancing data-fit and regularity that is fully automatic
and allows for a sound statistical interpretation. The performance of our
estimation approach is studied for various problems in imaging. Among others,
this includes deconvolution problems that arise in Poisson nanoscale
fluorescence microscopy.
