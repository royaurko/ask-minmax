Categorical data clustering (CDC) and link clustering (LC) have been
considered as separate research and application areas. The main focus of this
paper is to investigate the commonalities between these two problems and the
uses of these commonalities for the creation of new clustering algorithms for
categorical data based on cross-fertilization between the two disjoint research
fields. More precisely, we formally transform the CDC problem into an LC
problem, and apply LC approach for clustering categorical data. Experimental
results on real datasets show that LC based clustering method is competitive
with existing CDC algorithms with respect to clustering accuracy.
