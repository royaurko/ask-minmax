Despite its successes---such as solving the supersymmetric flavor
problem---anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking is untenable because of its
prediction of tachyonic sleptons. An appealing solution to this problem was
proposed by Pomarol and Rattazzi where a threshold controlled by a light field
deflects the anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking trajectory, thus evading
tachyonic sleptons. In this paper we examine an alternate class of deflection
models where the non-supersymmetric threshold is accompanied by a heavy,
instead of light, singlet. The low energy form of this model is the so-called
extended anomaly mediation proposed by Nelson and Weiner, but with potential
for a much higher deflection threshold. The existence of this high deflection
threshold implies that the space of anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking
deflecting models is larger than previously thought.
