The supersymmetric flavour and CP problems can be avoided if the first two
generations of sfermions are heavier than a few TeV and approximately
degenerate in mass. However using flavour and CP-violating constraints on the
third sfermion generation, together with the decoupling of the first two
generations, can dramatically affect cosmological predictions such as the relic
abundance of stable particles. In particular, we show that if the lightest
supersymmetric particle is essentially bino-like then requiring that all
flavour changing neutral current and CP-violating processes are adequately
suppressed, imposes severe limits on the bino mass, where typically
m_bino>(200-300) GeV. This leads to difficulties for models implementing the
scenario of heavy sfermion masses.
