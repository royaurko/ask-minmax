Recent experiments have imposed controlled swelling patterns on thin polymer
films, which subsequently buckle into three-dimensional shapes. We develop a
solution to the design problem suggested by such systems, namely, if and how
one can generate particular three-dimensional shapes from thin elastic sheets
by mere imposition of a two-dimensional pattern of locally isotropic growth.
Not every shape is possible. Several types of obstruction can arise, some of
which depend on the sheet thickness. We provide some examples using the
axisymmetric form of the problem, which is analytically tractable.
