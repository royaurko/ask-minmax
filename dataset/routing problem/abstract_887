In this paper, we develop a trust based security protocol based on a cross
layer approach which attains confidentiality and authentication of packets in
both routing and link layers of MANETs. In the first phase of the protocol, we
design a trust based packet forwarding scheme for detecting and isolating the
malicious nodes using the routing layer information. It uses trust values to
favor packet forwarding by maintaining a trust counter for each node. A node is
punished or rewarded by decreasing or increasing the trust counter. If the
trust counter value falls below a trust threshold, the corresponding
intermediate node is marked as malicious. In the next phase of the protocol, we
provide link layer security using the CBCX mode of authentication and
encryption. By simulation results, we show that the proposed cross layer
security protocol achieves high packet delivery ratio while attaining low delay
and overhead.
