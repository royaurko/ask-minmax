In this note we summarize our results from earlier work with the Monster
Tower (A Monster Tower Approach to Goursat Multi-Flags). In particular, we give
an overview of the problem of classifying the orbits within a tower of
fibrations with fibers diffeomorphic to projective planes. Included in this
note is one new result that was not in our previous work.
