We present a constructive procedure to obtain the critical behavior of
Painleve' VI transcendents and solve the connection problem. This procedure
yields two and one parameter families of solutions, including trigonometric and
logarithmic behaviors, and three classes of solutions with Taylor expansion at
a critical point.
