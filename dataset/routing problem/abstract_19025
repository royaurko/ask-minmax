Many large-scale Web applications that require ranked top-k retrieval such as
Web search and online advertising are implemented using inverted indices. An
inverted index represents a sparse term-document matrix, where non-zero
elements indicate the strength of term-document association. In this work, we
present an approach for lossless compression of inverted indices. Our approach
maps terms in a document corpus to a new term space in order to reduce the
number of non-zero elements in the term-document matrix, resulting in a more
compact inverted index. We formulate the problem of selecting a new term space
that minimizes the resulting index size as a matrix factorization problem, and
prove that finding the optimal factorization is an NP-hard problem. We develop
a greedy algorithm for finding an approximate solution. A side effect of our
approach is increasing the number of terms in the index, which may negatively
affect query evaluation performance. To eliminate such effect, we develop a
methodology for modifying query evaluation algorithms by exploiting specific
properties of our compression approach. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that our approach achieves an index size reduction of 20%, while
maintaining the same query response times. Higher compression ratios up to 35%
are achievable, however at the cost of slightly longer query response times.
Furthermore, combining our approach with other lossless compression techniques,
namely variable-byte encoding, leads to index size reduction of up to 50%.
