We review what has been learned recently using N-body simulations about the
evolution of globular clusters. While simulations of star clusters have become
more realistic, and now include the evolution of single and binary stars, the
prospect of reaching large enough N is still a distant one. Nevertheless more
restricted kinds of simulations have recently brought valuable progress for
certain problems of current observational interest, including the origin and
structure of tidal tails of globular clusters. In addition, such simulations
have forced us to rethink some basic aspects of stellar dynamics, including, in
particular, the process of escape. Finally we turn to faster, approximate
methods for studying star cluster dynamics, where the role of N-body
simulations is one of calibration.
