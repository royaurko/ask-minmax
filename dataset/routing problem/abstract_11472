In this letter we show that the noncommutative spaces, and in particular
fuzzy spheres, are natural candidates which explicitly exhibit the holography,
by noting that the smallest physically accessible volume is much larger that
the expected Planckian size. Moreover, we show that fuzzy spheres provide us
with a new approach, ''an $N$-tropic'' approach, to the cosmological constant
problem, though in a Euclidean space-time.
