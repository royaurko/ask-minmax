The Stochastic Eulerian Tour Problem was introduced in 2008 as a stochastic
variant of the well-known Eulerian Tour Problem. In a follow-up paper the same
contributors investigated some heuristics for solving the Stochastic Eulerian Tour
Problem. After a thorough study of these two publications a few issues emerged.
In this short research commentary we would like to discuss these issues.
