We investigate the $\mathcal R$-boundedness of operator families belonging to
the Boutet de Monvel calculus. In particular, we show that weakly and strongly
parameter-dependent Green operators of nonpositive order are $\mathcal
R$-bounded. Such operators appear as resolvents of non-local
(pseudodifferential) boundary value problems. As a consequence, we obtain
maximal $L_p$-regularity for such boundary value problems. An example is given
by the reduced Stokes equation in waveguides.
