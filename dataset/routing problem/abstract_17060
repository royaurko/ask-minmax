We present a new numerical method of special relativistic resistive
magnetohydrodynamics with scalar resistivity that can treat a range of
phenomena, from nonrelativistic to relativistic (shock, contact discontinuity,
and Alfv\'en wave). The present scheme calculates the numerical flux of fluid
by using an approximate Riemann solver, and electromagnetic field by using the
method of characteristics. Since this scheme uses appropriate characteristic
velocities, it is capable of accurately solving problems that cannot be
approximated as ideal magnetohydrodynamics and whose characteristic velocity is
much lower than light velocity. The numerical results show that our scheme can
solve the above problems as well as nearly ideal MHD problems. Our new scheme
is particularly well suited to systems with initially weak magnetic field, and
mixed phenomena of relativistic and non-relativistic velocity; for example, MRI
in accretion disk, and super Alfv\'enic turbulence.
