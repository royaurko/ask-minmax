In this paper we study weighted Hardy-Sobolev spaces of vector valued
functions analytic on double-napped cones of the complex plane. We introduce
these spaces as a tool for complex scaling of linear ordinary differential
equations with dilation analytic unbounded operator coefficients. As examples
we consider boundary value problems in cylindrical domains and domains with
quasicylindrical ends.
