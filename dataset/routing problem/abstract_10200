Let $M$ be a positive homogeneously presented monoid ${\langle L \mid
R\,\rangle}_{mo}$. If $M$ satisfies the cancellation condition and carries
certain particular elements similar to the \emph{fundamental elements} in Artin
monoids, then the solvability of the conjugacy problem for $M$ implies that in
the corresponding group ${\langle L \mid R\,\rangle}$. In addition to these
conditions, if $M$ satisfies the LCM condition (i.e. any two elements $\alpha$
and $\beta$ in $M$ admit the left (resp.~right) least common multiple), then
the solution to the conjugacy problem for $M$ is known. We will give two kinds
of examples that do not satisfy only the LCM condition. For these examples, we
will give a solution to the conjugacy problem by improving the method given by
E. Brieskorn and K. Saito.
