In this paper, we study the dual representation for generalized multiple
stopping problems, hence the pricing problem of general multiple exercise
options. We derive a dual representation which allows for cashflows which are
subject to volume constraints modeled by integer valued adapted processes and
refraction periods modeled by stopping times. As such, this extends the works
by Schoenmakers (2010), Bender (2011a), Bender (2011b), Aleksandrov and Hambly
(2010), and Meinshausen and Hambly (2004) on multiple exercise options, which
either take into consideration a refraction period or volume constraints, but
not both simultaneously. We also allow more flexible cashflow structures than
the additive structure in the above references. For example some exponential
utility problems are covered by our setting. We supplement the theoretical
results with an explicit Monte Carlo algorithm for constructing confidence
intervals for the price of multiple exercise options and exemplify it by a
numerical study on the pricing of a swing option in an electricity market.
