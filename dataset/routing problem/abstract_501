6LoWPAN (IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4) standardized by IEEE 802.15.4 provides IP
communication capability for nodes in WSN. An adaptation layer is introduced
above the MAC layer to achieve header compression, fragmentation and reassembly
of IP packets. The location-based information is used to simplify the routing
policy. This paper proposes an efficient location-based routing protocol,
considering link quality and distance between nodes as the routing metric. The
proposed Enhanced Location-based routing protocol (ELBRP) was simulated in NS2
version 2.32 and performance were analysed in terms of packet delivery ratio,
throughput and average end-to-end delay. From the results obtained, it is found
that the proposed ELBRP outperforms existing LOAD protocol.
