Bulk superconductor samples of YBa2Cu3-xCoxO7-{\delta} with x = 0, 0.01,
0.03, 0.05 are synthesized by solid-state reaction route. Both x-ray
diffraction and electron microscopy have been employed to study the phase
identification, intergrowths, dislocations and the local structure of these
samples. Transition temperature of the samples has been determined by four
probe resistivity measurements. The x-ray diffraction patterns indicate that
the gross structure/ phase of YBa2Cu3-xCoxO7-{\delta} do not change with the
substitution of Co up to x=0.05. The zero resistance critical transition
temperature [Tc(R=0)] is found to decrease and critical current density (Jc)
increases with the increased concentration of cobalt in the compound. The Jc
enhancement for the cobalt doped samples may be resulting due to flux pinning
from some defects such as planar defects, stacking faults and micro defects
(twin, domains etc.) and the rapid suppression in Tc may be due to the cooper
pair breaking and the hole filling in the CuO2 planes.
