The question about maximal size of independent system of word equations is
one of the most striking problems in combinatorics on words. Recently, Aleksi
Saarela has introduced a new approach to the problem that is based on
linear-algebraic properties of polynomials encoding the equations and their
solutions. In this paper we develop further this approach and take into account
other algebraic properties of polynomials, namely their factorization. This, in
particular, allows to improve the bound for the number of independent equations
with maximal rank from quadratic to linear.
