We investigate the global solutions of the Dirac equation on the
Anti-de-Sitter Universe. Since this space is not globally hyperbolic, the
Cauchy problem is not, {\it a priori}, well-posed. Nevertheless we can prove
that there exists unitary dynamics, but its uniqueness crucially depends on the
ratio beween the mass $M$ of the field and the cosmological constant
$\Lambda>0$ : it appears a critical value, $\Lambda/12$, which plays a role
similar to the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound for the scalar fields. When
$M^2\geq \Lambda/12$ there exists a unique unitary dynamics. In opposite, for
the light fermions satisfying $M^2<\Lambda/12$, we construct several asymptotic
conditions at infinity, such that the problem becomes well-posed. In all the
cases, the spectrum of the hamiltonian is discrete. We also prove a result of
equipartition of the energy.
