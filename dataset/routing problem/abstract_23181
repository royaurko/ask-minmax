The new Belle phi_3/gamma measurement arXiv:hep-ex/0604054, based on Dalitz
analysis of D -> Kshort pi+ pi- in B+- -> D(*) K(*)+- decays, uses likelihood
ratio ordering to set confidence intervals in phi_3 and the r,delta parameters.
This is different to the choice made by BaBar in PRL 95, 121802 (2005) and
arXiv:hep-ex/0507101, and requires additional computation. This Note explains
Belle's choice using a related but simpler example: the averaging of two
numbers. We find that intervals calculated with likelihood ratio ordering
reproduce the analytic solution to this problem, whereas intervals calculated
by ordering according to the p.d.f. (so-called Neyman intervals) do not, and
show a pathology which is important in our case.
