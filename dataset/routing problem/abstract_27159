We present a dual weighted residual-based a posteriori error estimate for a
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) approximation of a linear second-order elliptic
problem on compact smooth connected and oriented surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
which are implicitly represented as level sets of a smooth function. We show
that the error in the energy norm may be split into a "residual part" and a
higher order "geometric part". Upper and lower bounds for the resulting a
posteriori error estimator are proven and we consider a number of challenging
test problems to demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of the estimator.
We also present a novel "geometric" driven refinement strategy for PDEs on
surfaces which considerably improves the performance of the method on complex
surfaces.
