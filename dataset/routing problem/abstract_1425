We calculate the tunneling splittings in a Mn$_{12}$ magnetic molecule taking
into account its internal many-spin structure. We discuss the precision and
reliability of these calculations and show that restricting the basis (limiting
the number of excitations taken into account) may lead to significant error
(orders of magnitude) in the resulting tunneling splittings for the lowest
energy levels, so that an intuitive picture of different decoupled energy
scales does not hold in this case. Possible routes for further development of
the many-spin model of Mn$_{12}$ are discussed.
