A discrete version of the WKB method is developed and applied to calculate
the tunnel splittings between classically degenerate states of spin
Hamiltonians. The results for particular model problems are in complete accord
with those previously found using instanton methods. The discrete WKB method is
more elementary and also yields wavefunctions.
