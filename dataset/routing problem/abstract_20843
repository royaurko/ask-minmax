We study the fibers of a projective morphism and some related algebraic
problems. We characterize the analytic spread of a homogeneous ideal through
properties of its syzygy matrix. Powers of linearly presented ideals need not
be linearly presented, but we identify a weaker linearity property that is
preserved under taking powers.
