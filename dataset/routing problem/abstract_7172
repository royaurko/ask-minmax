In [18], fundamental solutions for the generalized bi-axially symmetric
Helmholtz equation were constructed in $R_2^ + = \left\{ {\left( {x,y}
\right):x > 0,y > 0} \right\}.$ They contain Kummer's confluent hypergeometric
functions in three variables. In this paper, using one of the constructed
fundamental solutions, the Dirichlet problem is solved in the domain $\Omega
\subset R_2^ +.$ Using the method of Green's functions, solution of this
problem is found in an explicit form.
