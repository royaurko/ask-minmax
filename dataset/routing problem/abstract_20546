A criterion in terms of differential invariants for a metric on a surface to
be Liouville is established. Moreover, in this paper we completely solve in
invariant terms the local mobility problem of a 2D metric, considered by
Darboux: How many quadratic in momenta integrals does the geodesic flow of a
given metric possess? The method is also applied to recognition of other
polynomial integrals of geodesic flows.
