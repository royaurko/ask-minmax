The Algebraic Dichotomy Conjecture states that the Constraint Satisfaction
Problem over a fixed template is solvable in polynomial time if the algebra of
polymorphisms associated to the template lies in a Taylor variety, and is
NP-complete otherwise. This paper provides two new characterizations of
finitely generated Taylor varieties. The first characterization is using
absorbing subalgebras and the second one cyclic terms. These new conditions
allow us to reprove the conjecture of Bang-Jensen and Hell (proved by the
contributors) and the characterization of locally finite Taylor varieties using weak
near-unanimity terms (proved by McKenzie and Mar\'oti) in an elementary and
self-contained way.
