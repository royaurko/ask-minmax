Routing is the main part of wireless adhoc network conventionally there are
two approaches first one is Proactive and another one is Reactive. Both these
approaches have some substantial disadvantage and to overcome hybrid routing
protocols designed. ZRP (Zone Routing Protocol) is one of the hybrid routing
protocols, it takes advantage of proactive approach by providing reliability
within the scalable zone, and for beyond the scalable zone it looks for the
reactive approach. It (ZRP) uses the proactive and the reactive routing
according to the need of the application at that particular instance of time
depending upon the prevailing scenario. This work revolves around the
performance of ZRP against realistic parameters by varying various attributes
such as Zone Radius of ZRP in different node density. Results vary as we change
the node density on Qualnet 4.0 network simulator.
