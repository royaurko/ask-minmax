We present mathematical details of derivation of the critical exponents for
the free energy and magnetization in the vicinity of the Gaussian fixed point
of renormalization. We treat the problem in general terms and do not refer to
particular models of interaction energy. We discuss the case of arbitrary
dispersion of the fixed point.
