In the present paper we are concerned with the Novikov--Veselov equation at
negative energy, i.e. with the $ (2 + 1) $--dimensional analog of the KdV
equation integrable by the method of inverse scattering for the
two--dimensional Schr\"odinger equation at negative energy. We show that the
solution of the Cauchy problem for this equation with non--singular scattering
data behaves asymptotically as $ \frac{\const}{t^{3/4}} $ in the uniform norm
at large times $ t $. We also present some arguments which indicate that this
asymptotics is optimal.
