A formulation of Einstein equations is presented that could yield advantages
in the study of collisions of binary compact objects during regimes between
linear-nonlinear transitions. The key idea behind this formulation is a
separation of the dynamical variables into i) a fixed conformal 3-geometry, ii)
a conformal factor possessing nonlinear dynamics and iii) transverse-traceless
perturbations of the conformal 3-geometry.
