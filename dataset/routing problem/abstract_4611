Although much research has been devoted to extremal problems on
non-overlapping domains little is known about all solutions of this problems.
We generalized some of this problems on the case of more general systems of
points. It was solved using separating transformations and learning functions
in detail. Methods used in the paper allowed to get improve and more exact
estimations taking into account angular parameters, coefficients of
displacement and controlable functionals.
