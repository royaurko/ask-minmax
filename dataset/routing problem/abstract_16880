In the field of numerical approximation, specialists considering highly
complex problems have recently proposed various ways to simplify their
underlying problems. In this field, depending on the problem they were tackling
and the community that are at work, different approaches have been developed
with some success and have even gained some maturity, the applications can now
be applied to information analysis or for numerical simulation of PDE's. At
this point, a crossed analysis and effort for understanding the similarities
and the differences between these approaches that found their starting points
in different backgrounds is of interest. It is the purpose of this paper to
contribute to this effort by comparing some constructive reduced
representations of complex functions. We present here in full details the
Adaptive Cross Approximation (ACA) and the Empirical Interpolation Method (EIM)
together with other approaches that enter in the same category.
