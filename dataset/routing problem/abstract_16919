Due to the time scale problem, rare events are not accessible by straight
forward molecular dynamics. The presence of multiple reaction channels
complicates the problem even further. The feasibility of the standard free
energy based methods relies strongly on the success in finding a proper
reaction coordinate. This can be very difficult task in high-dimensional
complex systems and even more if several distinct reaction channels exist.
Moreover, even if a proper reaction coordinate can be found, ergodic sampling
will be a challenge. In this article, we discuss the recent advancements of
path sampling methods to tackle this problem. We argue why the path sampling
methods, via the transition interface sampling technique, is less sensitive to
the choice of reaction coordinate. Moreover, we review a new algorithm,
parallel path swapping, that can dramatically improve the ergodic sampling of
trajectories for the multiple reaction channel systems.
