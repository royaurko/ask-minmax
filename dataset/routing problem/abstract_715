MANET is a cooperative network in which nodes are responsible for forwarding
as well as routing. Noncooperation is still a big challenge that certainly
degrades the performance and reliability of a MANET. This paper presents a
novel methodology to overcome routing misbehavior in MANET using Retaliation
Model. In this model node misbehavior is watched and an equivalent misbehavior
is given in return. This model employs several parameters such as number of
packets forwarded, number of packets received for forwarding, packet forwarding
ratio etc. to calculate Grade and Bonus Points. The Grade is used to isolate
selfish nodes from the routing paths and the Bonus Points defines the number of
packets dropped by an honest node in retaliation over its misconducts. The
implementation is done in "GloMoSim" on top of the DSR protocol. We obtained up
to 40% packet delivery ratio with a cost of a minimum of 7.5% overhead compared
to DSR. To minimize total control traffic overhead we have included the FG
Model with our model and it reduces the overhead up to 75%. This model enforces
cooperation due to its stricter punishment strategy and justifies its name.
