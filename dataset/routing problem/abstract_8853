We describe Novikov's "higher signature conjecture," which dates back to the
late 1960's, as well as many alternative formulations and related problems. The
Novikov Conjecture is perhaps the most important unsolved problem in
high-dimensional manifold topology, but more importantly, variants and
analogues permeate many other areas of mathematics, from geometry to operator
algebras to representation theory
