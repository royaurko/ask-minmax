In this paper, we describe the result of our experiments on Algorithms for
the Food-Selection Problem, which is the fundamental problem first stated and
addressed in the seminal paper \cite{pigout}. Because the key aspect of any
experimental evaluation is the \textbf{reproducibility}, we detail deeply the
setup of all our experiments, thus leaving to the interested eater the
opportunity to reproduce all the results described in this paper. More
specifically, we describe all the answers we provided to the questions proposed
in \cite{pigout}: Where can I have dinner tonight? What is the typical Roman
cuisine that I should (not) miss? Where can I find the best coffee or gelato in
town?
