The initial boundary-value problem (IBVP) and the Cauchy problem for the
Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation and other related $2m$th-order semilinear
parabolic partial differential equations in one and N dimensions are
considered. Global existence and blow-up as well as uniform bounds are reviewed
by using: (i) classic tools of interpolation theory and Galerkin methods, (ii)
eigenfunction and nonlinear capacity methods, (iii) Henry's version of weighted
Gronwall's inequalities, and (vi) two types of scaling (blow-up) arguments. For
the IBVPs, existence of global solutions is proved for both Dirichlet and
"Navier" boundary conditions. For some related higher-order PDEs in N
dimensions uniform boundedness of global solutions of the Cauchy problem are
established. As another related application, the well-posed Burnett-type
equations, which are a higher-order extension of the classic Navier-Stokes
equations, are studied. As a simple illustration, a generalization of the
famous Leray-Prodi-Serrin-Ladyzhenskaya regularity results is obtained.
