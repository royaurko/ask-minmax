The problem of the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry in the crystals with
variable composition is discussed. The character of the variation of the
inhomogeneous superstructure depending on the substitutional atom concentration
has been considered. The genesis of the structure and magnetic ordering in the
perovskite type compounds is discussed.
