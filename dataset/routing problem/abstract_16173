Spectral decomposition of dynamical equations using curl-eigenfunctions has
been extensively used in fluid and plasma dynamics problems using their
orthogonality and completeness properties for both linear and non-linear cases.
Coefficients of such expansions are integrals over products of Bessel functions
in problems involving cylindrical geometry. In this paper, certain identities
involving products of two and three general solutions of Bessel's equation have
been derived. Some of these identities have been useful in the study of Turner
relaxation of annular magnetized plasma [S.K.H. Auluck, Phys. Plasmas, 16,
122504, 2009], where quadratic integral quantities such as helicity and total
energy were expressed as algebraic functions of the arbitrary constants of the
general solution of Bessel's equation, allowing their determination by a
minimization procedure. Identities involving products of three solutions enable
expanding a product of two solutions in a Fourier-Bessel series of single
Bessel functions facilitating transformation of partial differential equations
representing non-linear dynamics problems into time evolution equations by
eliminating spatial dependences. These identities are required in an ongoing
investigation of fluctuation-driven coherent effects in a nonlinear dynamical
system.
