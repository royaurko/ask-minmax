In this note we investigate the last passage percolation model in the
presence of macroscopic inhomogeneity. We analyze how this affects the scaling
limit of the passage time, leading to a variational problem that provides an
ODE for the deterministic limiting shape of the maximal path. We obtain a
sufficient analytical condition for uniqueness of the solution for the
variational problem. Consequences for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion
process are discussed.
