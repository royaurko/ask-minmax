Let $\alpha\in\mathbb{C}$ in the upper half-plane and let $I$ be an interval.
We construct an analogue of Selberg's majorant of the characteristic function
of $I$ that vanishes at the point $\alpha$. The construction is based on the
solution to an extremal problem with positivity and interpolation constraints.
