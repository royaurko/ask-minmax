Maintaining stable fluxes for multiple source elements is a challenging task
when the source materials have significantly different oxygen affinities in a
complex-oxide molecular-beam-epitaxy (MBE) environment. Considering that Sr is
one of the most easily oxidized and widely used element in various complex
oxides, we took Sr as a probe to investigate the flux stability problem in a
number of different conditions. Source oxidation was less for higher flux,
extended port geometry, and un-melted source shape. The extended port geometry
also eliminated the flux transient after opening a source shutter as observed
in the standard port. We also found that the source oxidation occurred more
easily on the crucible wall than on the surface of the source material. Atomic
oxygen, in spite of its stronger oxidation effectiveness, did not make any
difference in source oxidation as compared to molecular oxygen in this
geometry. Our results may provide a guide for solutions to the source oxidation
problem in oxide-MBE system.
