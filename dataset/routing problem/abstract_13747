Robin problem for the Laplacian in a bounded planar domain with a smooth
boundary and a large parameter in the boundary condition is considered. We
prove a two-sided three-term asymptotic estimate for the negative eigenvalues.
Furthermore, improving the upper bound we get a two term asymptotics in terms
of the coupling constant and the maximum of the boundary curvature.
