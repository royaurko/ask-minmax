In this paper we study unimodality problems for the independence polynomial
of a graph, including unimodality, log-concavity and reality of zeros. We
establish recurrence relations and give factorizations of independence
polynomials for certain classes of graphs. As applications we settle some
unimodality conjectures and problems.
