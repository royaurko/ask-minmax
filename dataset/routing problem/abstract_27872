We address the problem of social network de-anonymization when relationships
between people are described by scale-free graphs. In particular, we propose a
rigorous, asymptotic mathematical analysis of the network de-anonymization
problem while capturing the impact of power-law node degree distribution, which
is a fundamental and quite ubiquitous feature of many complex systems such as
social networks. By applying bootstrap percolation and a novel graph slicing
technique, we prove that large inhomogeneities in the node degree lead to a
dramatic reduction of the initial set of nodes that must be known a priori (the
seeds) in order to successfully identify all other users. We characterize the
size of this set when seeds are selected using different criteria, and we show
that their number can be as small as $n^{\epsilon}$, for any small
${\epsilon>0}$. Our results are validated through simulation experiments on a
real social network graph.
