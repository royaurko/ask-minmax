The presence of groups containing high leverage outliers makes linear
regression a difficult problem due to the masking effect. The available high
breakdown estimators based on Least Trimmed Squares often do not succeed in
detecting masked high leverage outliers in finite samples.
  An alternative to the LTS estimator, called Penalised Trimmed Squares (PTS)
estimator, was introduced by the contributors in \cite{ZiouAv:05,ZiAvPi:07} and it
appears to be less sensitive to the masking problem. This estimator is defined
by a Quadratic Mixed Integer Programming (QMIP) problem, where in the objective
function a penalty cost for each observation is included which serves as an
upper bound on the residual error for any feasible regression line. Since the
PTS does not require presetting the number of outliers to delete from the data
set, it has better efficiency with respect to other estimators. However, due to
the high computational complexity of the resulting QMIP problem, exact
solutions for moderately large regression problems is infeasible.
  In this paper we further establish the theoretical properties of the PTS
estimator, such as high breakdown and efficiency, and propose an approximate
algorithm called Fast-PTS to compute the PTS estimator for large data sets
efficiently. Extensive computational experiments on sets of benchmark instances
with varying degrees of outlier contamination, indicate that the proposed
algorithm performs well in identifying groups of high leverage outliers in
reasonable computational time.
