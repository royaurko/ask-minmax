We consider the following problem: find a fixed-order linear controller that
maximizes the closed-loop asymptotic decay rate for the classical
two-mass-spring system. This can be formulated as the problem of minimizing the
abscissa (maximum of the real parts of the roots) of a polynomial whose
coefficients depend linearly on the controller parameters. We show that the
only order for which there is a non-trivial solution is 2. In this case, we
derive a controller that we prove locally maximizes the asymptotic decay rate,
using recently developed techniques from nonsmooth analysis.
