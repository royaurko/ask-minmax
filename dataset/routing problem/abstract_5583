The particular symmetry of the random-phase-approximation (RPA) matrix has
been utilized in the past to reduce the RPA eigenvalue problem into a
symmetric-matrix problem of half the dimension. The condition of positive
definiteness of at least one of the matrices A+-B has been imposed (where A and
B are the submatrices of the RPA matrix) so that, e.g., its square root can be
found by Cholesky decomposition. In this work, alternative methods are pointed
out to reduce the RPA problem to a real (not symmetric, in general) problem of
half the dimension, with the condition of positive definiteness relaxed. One of
the methods relies on a generalized Cholesky decomposition, valid for
non-singular real symmetric matrices. The algorithm is described and a
corresponding routine in C is given.
