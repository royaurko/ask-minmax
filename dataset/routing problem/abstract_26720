For the $d$-dimensional incompressible Euler equation, the standard energy
method gives local wellposedness for initial velocity in Sobolev space
$H^s(\mathbb R^d)$, $s>s_c:=d/2+1$. The borderline case $s=s_c$ was a folklore
open problem. In this paper we consider the physical dimensions $d=2,3$ and
show that if we perturb any given smooth initial data in $H^{s_c}$ norm, then
the corresponding solution can have infinite $H^{s_c}$ norm instantaneously at
$t>0$. The constructed solutions are unique and even $C^{\infty}$-smooth in
some cases. To prove these results we introduce a new strategy: large
Lagrangian deformation induces critical norm inflation. As an application we
also settle several closely related open problems.
