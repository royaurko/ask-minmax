In this paper we consider the problem of determining when the cohomology of a
smooth projective variety over the rational numbers can be modeled by an
abelian variety. Our primary motivation is a problem posed by Barry Mazur at
the birthday conference for Joe Harris in 2011. We provide an answer to Mazur's
question in two situations. First, we show that the third cohomology group can
be modeled by the cohomology of an abelian variety over the rationals provided
the Chow group of points is supported on a curve. This provides an answer to
Mazur's question for all rationally connected threefolds, for instance. Second,
we show how a result of Beauville establishes that the middle cohomology of a
fibration in quadrics over the rational numbers can be modeled by an abelian
variety.
