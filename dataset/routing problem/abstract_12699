The aim of this work is to study the numerical solution of the nonlinear
Schrodinger problem using a combination between Witt basis and finite
difference approximations. We construct a discrete fundamental solution for the
non-stationary Schrodinger operator and we show the convergence of the
numerical scheme. Numerical examples are given at the end of the paper.
