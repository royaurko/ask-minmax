This paper first analyzes the resolution complexity of two random CSP models
(i.e. Model RB/RD) for which we can establish the existence of phase
transitions and identify the threshold points exactly. By encoding CSPs into
CNF formulas, it is proved that almost all instances of Model RB/RD have no
tree-like resolution proofs of less than exponential size. Thus, we not only
introduce new families of CNF formulas hard for resolution, which is a central
task of Proof-Complexity theory, but also propose models with both many hard
instances and exact phase transitions. Then, the implications of such models
are addressed. It is shown both theoretically and experimentally that an
application of Model RB/RD might be in the generation of hard satisfiable
instances, which is not only of practical importance but also related to some
open problems in cryptography such as generating one-way functions.
Subsequently, a further theoretical support for the generation method is shown
by establishing exponential lower bounds on the complexity of solving random
satisfiable and forced satisfiable instances of RB/RD near the threshold.
Finally, conclusions are presented, as well as a detailed comparison of Model
RB/RD with the Hamiltonian cycle problem and random 3-SAT, which, respectively,
exhibit three different kinds of phase transition behavior in NP-complete
problems.
