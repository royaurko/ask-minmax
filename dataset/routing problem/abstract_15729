This is the first of two articles devoted to a comprehensive exposition of
the generating-function method for computing fusion rules in affine Lie
algebras. The present paper is entirely devoted to the study of the
tensor-product (infinite-level) limit of fusions rules. We consider thus in
detail the problem of constructing tensor-product generating functions in
finite Lie algebras. From the beginning, the problem is recast in terms of the
concept of a model, which is an algebra whose Poincar\'e series is the
generating function under study. We start by reviewing Sharp's character
method. Simple examples are worked out in detail, illustrating thereby its
intrinsic limitations. An alternative approach is then presented; it is based
on the reformulation of the problem of calculating tensor products in terms of
the solution of a set of linear and homogeneous Diophantine equations whose
elementary solutions represent ``elementary couplings''. Grobner bases provide
a tool for generating the complete set of relations between elementary
couplings and, most importantly, as an algorithm for specifying a complete,
compatible set of ``forbidden couplings''. This machinery is then applied to
the construction of various tensor-product generating functions.
