Intermittently connected mobile networks (ICMNs) serve as an important
network model for many critical applications. This paper focuses on a
continuous ICMN model where the pair-wise meeting process between network nodes
follows a homogeneous and independent Poisson process. This ICMN model is known
to serve as good approximations to a class of important ICMNs with mobility
models like random waypoint and random direction, so it is widely adopted in
the performance study of ICMNs. This paper studies the throughput capacity and
delay-throughput tradeoff in the considered ICMNs with Poisson meeting process.
For the concerned ICMN, we first derive an exact expression of its throughput
capacity based on the pairwise meeting rate therein and analyze the expected
end-to-end packet delay under a routing algorithm that can achieve the
throughput capacity. We then explore the inherent tradeoff between delay and
throughput and establish a necessary condition for such tradeoff that holds
under any routing algorithm in the ICMN. To illustrate the applicability of the
theoretical results, case studies are further conducted for the random waypoint
and random direction mobility models. Finally, simulation and numerical results
are provided to verify the efficiency of our theoretical capacity/delay results
and to illustrate our findings.
