We develop the shape derivative analysis of solutions to the problem of
scattering of time-harmonic electromagnetic waves by a bounded penetrable
obstacle. Since boundary integral equations are a classical tool to solve
electromagnetic scattering problems, we study the shape differentiability
properties of the standard electromagnetic boundary integral operators. Using
Helmholtz decomposition, we can base their analysis on the study of scalar
integral operators in standard Sobolev spaces, but we then have to study the
G\^ateaux differentiability of surface differential operators. We prove that
the electromagnetic boundary integral operators are infinitely differentiable
without loss of regularity and that the solutions of the scattering problem are
infinitely shape differentiable away from the boundary of the obstacle, whereas
their derivatives lose regularity on the boundary. We also give a
characterization of the first shape derivative as a solution of a new
electromagnetic scattering problem.
