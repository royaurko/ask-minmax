In an earlier work, we have presented operations of belief change which only
affect the relevant part of a belief base. In this paper, we propose the
application of the same strategy to the problem of model-based diangosis. We
first isolate the subset of the system description which is relevant for a
given observation and then solve the diagnosis problem for this subset.
