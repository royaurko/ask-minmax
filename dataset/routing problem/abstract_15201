Enumerative algebraic geometry deals with problems of counting geometric
objects defined algebraically, An important class of enumerative problems is
that of counting curves: given a class of curves in some projective variety
defined by fixing some algebraic or geometric invariants (such as degree, genus
and types of singularities), the problem usually takes the form of "how many
curves of that class pass through a configuration of n points in general
position?"
  Tropical Geometry deals with certain piecewise-linear complexes, which arise
as degeneration of families of complex algebraic varieties, and can also be
described algebraically using "max-plus" algebra, (The tropical semi-field).
The problem we solve is that of counting rational curves with one cusp and
certain number of nodes on toric surfaces, passing through a configuration of
sufficient points in general position.
  We show that that this number equals the number of certain tropical curves
counted with multiplicities and we describe these curves and their
multiplicities.
  The main tools are tropicalization and patchworking. In tropicalization we
pass from an equisingular family of curves to a special limit fiber which can
be described in terms of tropical data and analytic data. We then classify
these possible limits, and use the patchworking theorem to reconstruct the
families that correspond to them.
