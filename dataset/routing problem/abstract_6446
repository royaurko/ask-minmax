We consider three-dimensional convection of an incompressible fluid saturated
in a parallelepiped with a porous medium. A mimetic finite-difference scheme
for the Darcy convection problem in the primitive variables is developed. It
consists of staggered nonuniform grids with five types of nodes, differencing
and averaging operators on a two-nodes stencil. The nonlinear terms are
approximated using special schemes. Two problems with different boundary
conditions are considered to study scenarios of instability of the state of
rest. Branching off of a continuous family of steady states was detected for
the problem with zero heat fluxes on two opposite lateral planes.
