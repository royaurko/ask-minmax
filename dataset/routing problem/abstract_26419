We consider Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta (R-K) schemes for hyperbolic
systems with stiff relaxation in the so-called diffusion limit. In such regime
the system relaxes towards a convection-diffusion equation. The first objective
of the paper is to show that traditional partitioned IMEX R-K schemes will
relax to an explicit scheme for the limit equation with no need of modification
of the original system. Of course the explicit scheme obtained in the limit
suffers from the classical parabolic stability restriction on the time step.
The main goal of the paper is to present an approach, based on IMEX R-K
schemes, that in the diffusion limit relaxes to an IMEX R-K scheme for the
convection-diffusion equation, in which the diffusion is treated implicitly.
This is achieved by an original reformulation of the problem, and subsequent
application of IMEX R-K schemes to it. An analysis on such schemes to the
reformulated problem shows that the schemes reduce to IMEX R-K schemes for the
limit equation, under the same conditions derived for hyperbolic relaxation.
Several numerical examples including neutron transport equations confirm the
theoretical analysis.
