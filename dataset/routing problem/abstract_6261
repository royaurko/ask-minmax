An indefinite generalization of Nudel'man's problem is used in a systematic
approach to interpolation theorems for generalized Schur and Nevanlinna
functions with interior and boundary data. Besides results on existence
criteria for Pick-Nevanlinna and Caratheodory-Fejer interpolation, the method
yealds new results on generalized interpolation in the sense of Sarason and
boundary interpolation, including properties of the finite Hilbert transform
relative to weights. The main theorem appeals to the Ball and Helton
almost-commutant lifting theorem to provide criteria for the existence of a
solution to Nudel'man's problem.
