We address the problem of fitting parametric curves on the Grassmann manifold
for the purpose of intrinsic parametric regression. As customary in the
literature, we start from the energy minimization formulation of linear
least-squares in Euclidean spaces and generalize this concept to general
nonflat Riemannian manifolds, following an optimal-control point of view. We
then specialize this idea to the Grassmann manifold and demonstrate that it
yields a simple, extensible and easy-to-implement solution to the parametric
regression problem. In fact, it allows us to extend the basic geodesic model to
(1) a time-warped variant and (2) cubic splines. We demonstrate the utility of
the proposed solution on different vision problems, such as shape regression as
a function of age, traffic-speed estimation and crowd-counting from
surveillance video clips. Most notably, these problems can be conveniently
solved within the same framework without any specifically-tailored steps along
the processing pipeline.
