The properties of the superconducting ferromagnets RuSr2(Gd/Eu)Cu2O8 and
RuSr2(Ln/Ce)2Cu2O10 are reviewed. The problem of coexistence and competition
between magnetic and superconducting states is discussed. A model of phase
separation into ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic structures is proposed.
