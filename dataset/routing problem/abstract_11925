We propose a unifying approach to the separability problem using covariance
matrices of locally measurable observables. From a practical point of view, our
approach leads to strong entanglement criteria that allow to detect the
entanglement of many bound entangled states in higher dimensions and which are
at the same time necessary and sufficient for two qubits. From a fundamental
perspective, our approach leads to insights into the relations between several
known entanglement criteria -- such as the computable cross norm and local
uncertainty criteria -- as well as their limitations.
