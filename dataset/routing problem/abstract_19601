It is argued that the Thouless number g(L) is not the only parameter relevant
in scale transformations, and that the second parameter connected with
off-diagonal disorder should be introduced. A two-parameter scaling theory is
suggested that explains a phenomenon of the upper critical dimension from the
viewpoint of scaling ideas.
