Linear systems of neutral type are considered using the infinite dimensional
approach. The main problems are asymptotic, non-exponential stability, exact
controllability and regular asymptotic stabilizability. The main tools are the
moment problem approach, the Riesz basis of invariant subspaces and the Riesz
basis of family of exponentials.
