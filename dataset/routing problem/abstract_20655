We review the fluctuation electromagnetic theory of attraction, friction and
heating of neutral nonmagnetic nanoparticles moving with constant velocity in
close vicinity to the solid surface. The theory is based on an exact solution
of the relativistic problem of the fluctuation electromagnetic interaction in
configuration sphere -plane in the dipole approximation.
