We report on the observation of a unique honeycomb charge ordering of the
cleaved IrTe$_2$ surface by high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
and spectroscopy (STS). IrTe$_2$ was recently established to exhibit intriguing
stripe charge orderings. Here, we show that the stripe charge order coexists
with a metastable honeycomb phase formed locally. The atomic and electronic
structures of the honeycomb phase are consistent with the stripe phase
indicating unambiguously its charge order nature. A simple model of the
honeycomb structure is suggested based on the overlap of three degenerate
stripe orders, which is analogous to the 3$q$ state description of a skyrmion.
We suggest that the honeycomb charge order can be a route to an exotic Dirac
electron system.
