We announce a tool for mapping derivations of the E theorem prover to Mizar
proofs. Our mapping complements earlier work that generates problems for
automated theorem provers from Mizar inference checking problems. We describe
the tool, explain the mapping, and show how we solved some of the difficulties
that arise in mapping proofs between different logical formalisms, even when
they are based on the same notion of logical consequence, as Mizar and E are
(namely, first-order classical logic with identity).
