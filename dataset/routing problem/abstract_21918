A fast implicit QR algorithm for eigenvalue computation of low rank
corrections of unitary matrices is adjusted to work with matrix pencils arising
from polynomial zerofinding problems . The modified QZ algorithm computes the
generalized eigenvalues of certain NxN rank structured matrix pencils using
O(N^2) ops and O(N) memory storage. Numerical experiments and comparisons
confirm the effectiveness and the stability of the proposed method.
