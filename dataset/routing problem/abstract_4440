We address the SUSY CP problem in the framework of Minimal Flavor Violation
(MFV), where the SUSY flavor problem finds a natural solution. By contrast, the
MFV principle does not solve the SUSY CP problem as it allows for the presence
of new {\it flavor blind} CP-violating phases. Then, we generalize the MFV
ansatz accounting for a natural solution of it. The phenomenological
implications of the generalized MFV ansatz are explored for MFV scenarios
defined both at the electroweak (EW) and at the GUT scales.
