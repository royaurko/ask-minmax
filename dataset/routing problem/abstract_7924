It is shown that Connes' character formula for unbounded, theta-summable
Fredholm modules represents the abstract Chern-character in K-homology. As an
application, the character of a particular Fredholm module over the reduced
group C*-algebra of a discrete group is calculated, which leads to a partial
solution of a problem posed by A.Connes.
