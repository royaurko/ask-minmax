We analyze the computational complexity of the problem of deciding whether,
for a given simple game, there exists the possibility of rearranging the
participants in a set of $j$ given losing coalitions into a set of $j$ winning
coalitions. We also look at the problem of turning winning coalitions into
losing coalitions. We analyze the problem when the simple game is represented
by a list of wining, losing, minimal winning or maximal loosing coalitions.
