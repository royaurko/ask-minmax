For the Schrodinger equation at fixed energy with a potential supported in a
bounded domain we give formulas and equations for finding scattering data from
the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map with nonzero background potential. For the case of
zero background potential these results were obtained in [R.G.Novikov,
