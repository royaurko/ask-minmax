Given a symmetric matrix $M\in \{0,1,*\}^{D\times D}$, an $M$-partition of a
graph $G$ is a function from $V(G)$ to $D$ such that no edge of $G$ is mapped
to a $0$ of $M$ and no non-edge to a $1$. We give a computer-assisted proof
that, when $|D|=4$, the problem of counting the $M$-partitions of an input
graph is either in FP or is #P-complete. Tractability is proved by reduction to
the related problem of counting list $M$-partitions; intractability is shown
using a gadget construction and interpolation. We use a computer program to
determine which of the two cases holds for all but a small number of matrices,
which we resolve manually to establish the dichotomy. We conjecture that the
dichotomy also holds for $|D|>4$. More specifically, we conjecture that, for
any symmetric matrix $M\in\{0,1,*\}^{D\times D}$, the complexity of counting
$M$-partitions is the same as the related problem of counting list
$M$-partitions.
