In this paper, we present Lyapunov-based robust and adaptive controllers for
the finite time stabilization of a perturbed chain of integrators with bounded
uncertainties. The proposed controllers can be designed for integrator chains
of any arbitrary length. The uncertainty bounds are known in the robust control
problem whereas they are unknown in the adaptive control problem. Both
controllers are developed from a class of finite time stabilization controllers
for pure integrator chains. Lyapunov-based design permits to calculate upper
bound on convergence time.
