We discuss renormalization of the non-relativistic three-body problem with
short-range forces. The problem becomes non-perturbative at momenta of the
order of the inverse of the two-body scattering length, and an infinite number
of graphs must be summed. This summation leads to a cutoff dependence that does
not appear in any order in perturbation theory. We argue that this cutoff
dependence can be absorbed in a single three-body counterterm and compute the
running of the three-body force with the cutoff.
