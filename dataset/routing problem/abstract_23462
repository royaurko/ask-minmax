In the process of investigating classical realizations of W_3 in terms of
free bosons, Romans unveiled a relation to finite-dimensional Jordan algebras
with a cubic norm. These algebras have been classified and consist of an
infinite series (yielding the ``generic'' realizations) and four sporadic
algebras associated to the real division algebras (which yield the ``magical''
realizations). The generic realizations were shown by Romans to quantize, who
left the problem of the quantization of the magical realizations open. In later
work, Mohammedi showed that the first two magical realizations did not survive
quantization. In this note we close the problem by showing that neither do the
other two magical realizations.
