In this paper, we evaluate, analyze, and compare the impact of mobility on
the behavior of three reactive protocols (AODV, DSR, DYMO) and three proactive
protocols (DSDV, FSR, OLSR) in multi-hop wireless networks. We take into
account throughput, end-to-end delay, and normalized routing load as
performance parameters. Based upon the extensive simulation results in NS-2, we
rank all of six protocols according to the performance parameters. Besides
providing the interesting facts regarding the response of each protocol on
varying mobilities and speeds, we also study the trade-offs, the routing
protocols have to make. Such as, to achieve throughput, a protocol has to pay
some cost in the form of increased end-to-end delay or routing overhead.
