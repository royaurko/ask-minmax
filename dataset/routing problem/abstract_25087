Various applications of car plate recognition systems have been developed
using various kinds of methods and techniques by researchers all over the
world. The applications developed were only suitable for specific country due
to its standard specification endorsed by the transport department of
particular countries. The Road Transport Department of Malaysia also has
endorsed a specification for car plates that includes the font and size of
characters that must be followed by car owners. However, there are cases where
this specification is not followed. Several applications have been developed in
Malaysia to overcome this problem. However, there is still problem in achieving
100% recognition accuracy. This paper is mainly focused on conducting an
experiment using chain codes technique to perform recognition for different
types of fonts used in Malaysian car plates.
