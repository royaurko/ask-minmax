This paper is a review of the popular Benjamini Hochberg Method and other
related useful methods of Multiple Hypothesis testing. This is written with the
purpose of serving a short but complete easy to understand review of the main
article with proper background. The paper titled 'Controlling the False
Discovery Rate-a practical and powerful Approach to multiple Testing' by
benjamini et. al.[1] proposes a new framework of controlling the False
Discovery Rate in a Multiple Hypothesis testing problem. It has been claimed
that the procedure proposed in the paper results in a substantial gain in power
more applicable in case of problems which call for False discovery rate (FDR)
control rather than Familywise Error Rate (FWER). The proposed method uses a
simple Bonferroni type procedure for FDR control.
