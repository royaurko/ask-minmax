The hot star wind momentum problem \eta = mdot*vinfty/(L/c) >> 1 is
revisited, and it is shown that the conventional belief, that it can be solved
by a combination of clumping of the wind and multiple scattering of photons, is
not self-consistent for optically thick clumps. Clumping does reduce the mass
loss rate mdot, and hence the momentum supply, required to generate a specified
radio emission measure \varepsilon, while multiple scattering increases the
delivery of momentum from a specified stellar luminosity L. However, in the
case of thick clumps, when combined the two effects act in opposition rather
than in unison since clumping reduces multiple scattering. Thus the ratio of
momentum deliverable to momentum required is maximal for a smooth wind and the
momentum problem remains for the thick clump case. In the case of thin clumps,
all of the benefit of clumping in reducing \eta lies in reducing \mdot for a
given \varepsilon so that extremely small filling factors f = 10e-4 are needed.
It is also shown that clumping affects the inference of \mdot from radio
\varepsilon not only by changing the emission measure per unit mass but also by
changing the radio optical depth unity radius R_{rad}, and hence the observed
wind volume, at radio wavelengths.
