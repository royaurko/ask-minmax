We study the regularity of the solutions to initial-boundary value problems
for N-systems of the p-Laplacian type, in $n\geq 3$ space variables, with
square-integrable external forces in the space-time cylinder. So, the
ellipticity coefficient remains unbounded. The singular case $\mu=0 $ is
covered.
