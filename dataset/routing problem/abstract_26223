In spherical galaxies, binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have
difficulty reaching sub-parsec separations due to depletion of stars on orbits
that intersect the massive binary - the final-parsec problem. Galaxies that
form via major mergers are substantially nonspherical, and it has been argued
that the centrophilic orbits in triaxial galaxies might provide stars to the
massive binary at a high enough rate to avoid stalling. Here we test that idea
by carrying out fully self-consistent merger simulations of galaxies containing
central SMBHs. We find hardening rates of the massive binaries that are indeed
much higher than in spherical models, and essentially independent of the number
of particles used in the simulations. Binary eccentricities remain high
throughout the simulations. Our results constitute a fully stellar-dynamical
solution to the final-parsec problem and imply a potentially high rate of
events for low-frequency gravitational wave detectors like LISA.
