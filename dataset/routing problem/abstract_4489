Linux package managers have to deal with dependencies and conflicts of
packages required to be installed by the user. As an NP-complete problem, this
is a hard task to solve. In this context, several approaches have been pursued.
Apt-pbo is a package manager based on the apt project that encodes the
dependency solving problem as a pseudo-Boolean optimization (PBO) problem. This
paper compares different PBO solvers and their effectiveness on solving the
dependency solving problem.
