The Fourier restriction norm method is used to show local wellposedness for
the Cauchy Problem for the generalized KdV-equation of order three with data in
the usual Sobolev space H^s, s > -1/6. For real valued data in L^2 global
wellposedness follows by the conservation of the L^2-norm. The main new tool is
a bilinear estimate for solutions of the Airy- equation.
