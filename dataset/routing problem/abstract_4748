In this note we present a survey concerning parabolic free boundary problems
involving a discontinuous hysteresis operator. Such problems describe
biological and chemical processes "with memory" in which various substances
interact according to hysteresis law.
  Our main objective is to discuss the structure of the free boundaries and the
properties of the so-called "strong solutions" belonging to the anisotropic
Sobolev class $W^{2,1}_q$ with sufficiently large $q$. Several open problems in
this direction are proposed as well.
