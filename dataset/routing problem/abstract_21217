We introduce two-sorted theories in the style of Cook and Nguyen for the
complexity classes ParityL and DET, whose complete problems include
determinants over GF(2) and Z, respectively. The definable functions in these
theories are the functions in the corresponding complexity classes; thus each
theory formalizes reasoning using concepts from its corresponding complexity
class.
