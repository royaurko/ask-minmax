Random and structured noise both affect seismic data, hiding the reflections
of interest (primaries) that carry meaningful geophysical interpretation. When
the structured noise is composed of multiple reflections, its adaptive
cancellation is obtained through time-varying filtering, compensating
inaccuracies in given approximate templates. The under-determined problem can
then be formulated as a convex optimization one, providing estimates of both
filters and primaries. Within this framework, the criterion to be minimized
mainly consists of two parts: a data fidelity term and hard constraints
modeling a priori information. This formulation may avoid, or at least
facilitate, some parameter determination tasks, usually difficult to perform in
inverse problems. Not only classical constraints, such as sparsity, are
considered here, but also constraints expressed through hyperplanes, onto which
the projection is easy to compute. The latter constraints lead to improved
performance by further constraining the space of geophysically sound solutions.
