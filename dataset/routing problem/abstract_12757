In this paper, we introduce new implicit and explicit iterative schemes which
converge strongly to a unique solution of variational inequality problems for
strongly accretive operators over a common fixed point set of finite family of
nonexpansive mappings in $q$-uniformly smooth real Banach spaces. As an
application, we introduce an iteration process which converges strongly to a
solution of the variational inequality which is a common fixed point of finite
family of strictly pseudocontractive mappings. Our theorems extend, generalize,
improve and unify the corresponding results of Xu \cite{27} and Yamada
\cite{Yamada} and that of a host of other contributors. Our corollaries and our
method of proof are of independent interest.
