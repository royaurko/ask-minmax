We describe a new numerical scheme for MHD which combines a higher order
Godunov method (PPM) with Constrained Transport. The results from a selection
of multidimensional test problems are presented. The complete test suite used
to validate the method, as well as implementations of the algorithm in both F90
and C, are available from the web. A fully three-dimensional version of the
algorithm has been developed, and is being applied to a variety of
astrophysical problems including the decay of supersonic MHD turbulence, the
nonlinear evolution of the MHD Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and the saturation
of the magnetorotational instability in the shearing box. Our new simulations
of the MRI represent the first time that a higher-order Godunov scheme has been
applied to this problem, providing a quantitative check on the accuracy of
previous results computed with ZEUS; the latter are found to be reliable.
