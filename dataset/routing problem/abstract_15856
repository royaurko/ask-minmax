The true prosoluble completion $P\Cal S (\Gamma)$ of a group $\Gamma$ is the
inverse limit of the projective system of soluble quotients of $\Gamma$. Our
purpose is to describe examples and to point out some natural open problems. We
discuss a question of Grothendieck for profinite completions and its analogue
for true prosoluble and true pronilpotent completions.
