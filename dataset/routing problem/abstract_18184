We consider the one-dimensional Cattaneo equation for transport of scalar
fields such as solute concentration and temperature in mass and heat transport
problems, respectively. Although the Cattaneo equation admits a stochastic
interpretation - at least in the one-dimensional case - negative concentration
values can occur in boundary-value problems on a finite interval. This
phenomenon stems from the probabilistic nature of this model: the stochastic
interpretation provides constraints on the admissible boundary conditions, as
can be deduced from the wave formulation here presented. Moreover, as here
shown, energetic inequalities and the dissipative nature of the equation
provide an alternative way to derive the same constraints on the boundary
conditions derived by enforcing positivity. The analysis reported is also
extended to transport problems in the presence of a biasing velocity field.
Several general conclusions are drawn from this analysis that could be extended
to the higher-dimensional case.
