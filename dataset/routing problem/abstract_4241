The syntactic semigroup problem is to decide whether a given finite semigroup
is syntactic or not. This work investigates the syntactic semigroup problem for
both the semigroup reducts of $A^+(B_n)$, the affine near-semiring over a
Brandt semigroup $B_n$. It is ascertained that both the semigroup reducts of
$A^+(B_n)$ are syntactic semigroups.
