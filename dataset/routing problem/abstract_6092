We introduce the classical stellar atmosphere problem and describe in detail
its numerical solution. The problem consists of the solution of the radiation
transfer equations under the constraints of hydrostatic, radiative and
statistical equilibrium (non-LTE). We outline the basic idea of the Accelerated
Lambda Iteration (ALI) technique and statistical methods which finally allow
the construction of non-LTE model atmospheres considering the influence of
millions of metal absorption lines. Some applications of the new models are
presented.
