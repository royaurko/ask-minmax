Effective requirements management plays an important role when it comes to
the support of product development teams in the automotive industry. A precise
positioning of new cars in the market is based on features and characteristics
described as requirements as well as on costs and profits. [Question/problem]
However, introducing or changing requirements does not only impact the product
and its parts, but may lead to overhead costs in the OEM due to increased
complexity. The raised overhead costs may well exceed expected gains or costs
from the changed requirements. [Principal ideas/results] By connecting
requirements with direct and overhead costs, decision making based on
requirements could become more valuable. [Contribution] This problem statement
results from a detailed examination of the effects of requirements management
practices on process complexity and vice versa as well as on how today's
requirements management tools assist in this respect. We present findings from
a joined research project of RWTH Aachen University and Volkswagen
