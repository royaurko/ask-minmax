We present a new algorithm for solving ideal relativistic hydrodynamics based
on Godunov method with an exact solution of Riemann problem for an arbitrary
equation of state. Standard numerical tests are executed, such as the sound
wave propagation and the shock tube problem. Low numerical viscosity and high
precision are attained with proper discretization.
