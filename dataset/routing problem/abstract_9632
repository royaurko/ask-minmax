The graph isomorphism problem is of practical importance, as well as being a
theoretical curiosity in computational complexity theory in that it is not
known whether it is $NP$-complete or $P$. However, for many graphs, the problem
is tractable, and related to the problem of finding the automorphism group of
the graph. Perhaps the most well known state-of-the art implementation for
finding the automorphism group is Nauty. However, Nauty is particularly
susceptible to poor performance on star configurations, where the spokes of the
star are isomorphic with each other. In this work, I present an algorithm that
explodes these star configurations, reducing the problem to a sequence of
simpler automorphism group calculations.
