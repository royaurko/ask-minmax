In this paper, we consider the problem of multiuser detection in non-Gaussian
channels. We propose a new penalty function for robust multiuser detection. The
proposed detector outperforms other suboptimal detectors in non-Gaussian
environment. Analytical and simulation result shows the performance of the
proposed detector compare to other detectors.
