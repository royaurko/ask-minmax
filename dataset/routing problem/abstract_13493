Most biometric systems deployed in real-world applications are unimodal.
Using unimodal biometric systems have to contend with a variety of problems
such as: Noise in sensed data; Intra-class variations; Inter-class
similarities; Non-universality; Spoof attacks. These problems have addressed by
using multibiometric systems, which expected to be more reliable due to the
presence of multiple, independent pieces of evidence.
