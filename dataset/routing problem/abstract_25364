The problem of preserving privacy when a multivariate source is required to
be revealed partially to multiple users is modeled as a Gray-Wyner source
coding problem with K correlated sources at the encoder and K decoders in which
the kth decoder, k = 1, 2, ...,K, losslessly reconstructs the kth source via a
common link and a private link. The privacy requirement of keeping each decoder
oblivious of all sources other than the one intended for it is introduced via
an equivocation constraint at each decoder such that the total equivocation
summed over all decoders is E. The set of achievable rates-equivocation tuples
is completely characterized. Using this characterization, two different
definitions of common information are presented and are shown to be equivalent.
