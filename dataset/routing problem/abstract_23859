The_additivity_number_ of a topological property (relative to a given space)
is the minimal number of subspaces with this property whose union does not have
the property. The most well-known case is where this number is greater than
Aleph_0, i.e. the property is sigma-additive. We give a rather complete survey
of the known results about the additivity numbers of a variety of topological
covering properties, including those appearing in the Scheepers diagram (which
contains, among others, the classical properties of Menger, Hurewicz,
Rothberger, and Gerlits-Nagy). Some of the results proved here were not
published beforehand, and many open problems are posed.
