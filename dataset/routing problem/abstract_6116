In the German government (BMBF) funded project Verbmobil, a semantic
formalism Language for Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures (LUD)
is used which describes several DRSs and allows for underspecification. Dealing
with Japanese poses challenging problems. In this paper, a treatment of
multiple discourse relation constructions on the sentential level is shown,
which are common in Japanese but cause a problem for the formalism,. The
problem is to distinguish discourse relations which take the widest scope
compared with other scope-taking elements on the one hand and to have them
underspecified among each other on the other hand. We also state a semantic
constraint on the resolution of multiple discourse relations which seems to
prevail over the syntactic c-command constraint.
