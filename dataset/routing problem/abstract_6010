In this paper, we consider the Ice-Wine problem: Two transmitters send their
messages over the Gaussian Multiple-Access Channel (MAC) and a receiver aims to
recover a linear combination of codewords. The best known achievable
rate-region for this problem is due to [1],[2] as
$R_{i}\leq\frac{1}{2}\log\left(\frac{1}{2}+{\rm SNR}\right)$ $(i=1,2)$. In this
paper, we design a novel scheme using lattice codes and show that the rate
region of this problem can be improved. The main difference between our
proposed scheme with known schemes in [1],[2] is that instead of recovering the
sum of codewords at the decoder, a non-integer linear combination of codewords
is recovered. Comparing the achievable rate-region with the outer bound,
$R_{i}\leq\frac{1}{2}\log\left(1+{\rm SNR}\right)\,\,(i=1,2)$, we observe that
the achievable rate for each user is partially tight. Finally, by applying our
proposed scheme to the Gaussian Two Way Relay Channel (GTWRC), we show that the
best rate region for this problem can be improved.
