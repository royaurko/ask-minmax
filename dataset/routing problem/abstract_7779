\hspace{.2in}We consider the Darboux type transformations for the spectral
problems of supersymmetric KdV systems. The supersymmetric analogies of Darboux
and Darboux-Levi transformations are established for the spectral problems of
Manin-Radul-Mathieu sKdV and Manin-Radul sKdV. Several B\"acklund
transformations are derived for the MRM sKdV and MR sKdV systems.
