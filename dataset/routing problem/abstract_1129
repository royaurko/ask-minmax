This paper extends the nonlinear ISS small-gain theorem to a large-scale time
delay system composed of three or more subsystems. En route to proving this
small-gain theorem for systems of differential equations with delays, a
small-gain theorem for operators is examined. The result developed for
operators allows applications to a wide class of systems, including state space
systems with delays.
