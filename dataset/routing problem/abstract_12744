Whether the satisfiability of any formula F of propositional calculus can be
determined in polynomial time is an open question. I propose a simple procedure
based on some real world mechanisms to tackle this problem. The main result is
the blueprint for a machine which is able to test any formula in conjunctive
normal form (CNF) for satisfiability in linear time. The device uses light and
some electrochemical properties to function. It adapts itself to the scope of
the problem without growing exponentially in mass with the size of the formula.
It requires infinite precision in its components instead.
