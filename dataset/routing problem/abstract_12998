Let $\A$ be an algebra and let $f(x_1,...,x_d)$ be a multilinear polynomial
in noncommuting indeterminates $x_i$. We consider the problem of describing
linear maps $\phi:\A\to \A$ that preserve zeros of $f$. Under certain technical
restrictions we solve the problem for general polynomials $f$ in the case where
$\A=M_n(F)$. We also consider quite general algebras $\A$, but only for
specific polynomials $f$.
