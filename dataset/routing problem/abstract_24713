The recent advances in knowledge base research and the growing importance of
effective knowledge management raised an important question of knowledge base
equivalence verification. This problem has not been stated earlier, at least in
a way that allows speaking about algorithms for verification of informational
equivalence, because the informal definition of knowledge bases makes formal
solution of this problem impossible. In this paper we provide an implementable
formal algorithm for knowledge base equivalence verification based on the
formal definition of knowledge base proposed by Plotkin B. and Plotkin T., and
study some important properties of automorphic equivalence of models. We also
describe the concept of equivalence and formulate the criterion for the
equivalence of knowledge bases defined over finite models. Further we define
multi-models and automorphic equivalence of models and multi-models, that is
generalization of automorphic equivalence of algebras.
