In this paper we provide an extended formulation for the class of constraint
satisfaction problems and prove that its size is polynomial for instances whose
constraint graph has bounded treewidth. This implies new upper bounds on
extension complexity of several important NP-hard problems on graphs of bounded
treewidth.
