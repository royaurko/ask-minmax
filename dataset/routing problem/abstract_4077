In the paper "Broersma and Hoede, {\it Path graphs}, J. Graph Theory {\bf 13}
(1989) 427-444", the contributors proposed a problem whether there is a triple of
mutually nonisomorphic connected graphs which have an isomorphic connected
$P_3$-graph. For a long time, this problem remains unanswered. In this paper,
we give it a negative answer that there is no such triple, and thus completely
solve this problem.
