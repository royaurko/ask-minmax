A polynomial transformation of the real plane $\Bbb R^2$ is a mapping $\Bbb
R^2\to\Bbb R^2$ given by two polynomials of two variables. Such a
transformation is called quadratic if the degrees of its polynomials are not
greater than two. In the present paper an exhaustive description of invertible
quadratic transformations of the real plane is given. Their application to the
perfect cuboid problem is discussed.
