In this paper, we present a distributed implementation of a network based
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, called EMO, by using Offspring. Network
based evolutionary algorithms have proven to be effective for multi-objective
problem solving. They feature a network of connections between individuals that
drives the evolution of the algorithm. Unfortunately, they require large
populations to be effective and a distributed implementation can leverage the
computation time. Most of the existing frameworks are limited to providing
solutions that are basic or specific to a given algorithm. Our Offspring
framework is a plug-in based software environment that allows rapid deployment
and execution of evolutionary algorithms on distributed computing environments
such as Enterprise Clouds. Its features and benefits are presented by
describing the distributed implementation of EMO.
