In this paper we investigate the one-dimensional Schrodinger operator L(q)
with complex-valued periodic potential q when q\inL_{1}[0,1] and q_{n}=0 for
n=0,-1,-2,..., where q_{n} are the Fourier coefficients of q with respect to
the system {e^{i2{\pi}nx}}. We prove that the Bloch eigenvalues are
(2{\pi}n+t)^{2} for n\inZ, t\inC and find explicit formulas for the Bloch
functions. Then we consider the inverse problem for this operator.
