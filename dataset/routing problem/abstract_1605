Using first-principles density functional theory we predict a ferroelectric
ground state -- driven by off-centering of the magnetic Mn$^{4+}$ ion -- in
perovskite-structure BaMnO$_3$.
  Our finding is surprising, since the competition between energy-lowering
covalent bond formation, and energy-raising
  Coulombic repulsions usually only favors off-centering on the perovskite
$B$-site for non-magnetic $d^0$ ions.
  We explain this tendency for ferroelectric off-centering by analyzing the
changes in electronic structure between the centrosymmetric and polar states,
and by calculating the Born effective charges; we find anomalously large values
for Mn and O consistent with our calculated polarization of 12.8 $\mu$C/cm$^2$.
Finally, we suggest possible routes by which the perovskite phase may be
stabilized over the usual hexagonal phase, to enable a practical realization of
a single-phase multiferroic.
