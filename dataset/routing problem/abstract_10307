We present a robust computational framework for advective-diffusive-reactive
systems that satisfies maximum principles, the non-negative constraint, and
element-wise species balance property. The proposed methodology is valid on
general computational grids, can handle heterogeneous anisotropic media, and
provides accurate numerical solutions even for very high P\'eclet numbers. The
significant contribution of this paper is to incorporate advection (which makes
the spatial part of the differential operator non-self-adjoint) into the
non-negative computational framework, and overcome numerical challenges
associated with advection. We employ low-order mixed finite element
formulations based on least-squares formalism, and enforce explicit constraints
on the discrete problem to meet the desired properties. The resulting
constrained discrete problem belongs to convex quadratic programming for which
a unique solution exists. Maximum principles and the non-negative constraint
give rise to bound constraints while element-wise species balance gives rise to
equality constraints. The resulting convex quadratic programming problems are
solved using an interior-point algorithm. Several numerical results pertaining
to advection-dominated problems are presented to illustrate the robustness,
convergence, and the overall performance of the proposed computational
framework.
