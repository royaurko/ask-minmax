We present a scheme for the dissipative preparation of an entangled steady
state of two superconducting qubits in a circuit QED setup. Combining resonator
photon loss, a dissipative process already present in the setup, with an
effective two-photon microwave drive, we engineer an effective decay mechanism
which prepares a maximally entangled state of the two qubits. This state is
then maintained as the steady state of the driven, dissipative evolution. The
performance of the dissipative state preparation protocol is studied
analytically and verified numerically. In view of the experimental
implementation of the presented scheme we investigate the effects of potential
experimental imperfections and show that our scheme is robust to small
deviations in the parameters. We find that high fidelities with the target
state can be achieved both with state-of-the-art 3D, as well as with the more
commonly used 2D transmons. The promising results of our study thus open a
route for the demonstration of an entangled steady state in circuit QED.
