Though competitive analysis has been a very useful performance measure for
the quality of online algorithms, it is recognized that it sometimes fails to
distinguish between algorithms of different quality in practice. A number of
alternative measures have been proposed, but, with a few exceptions, these have
generally been applied only to the online problem they were developed in
connection with. Recently, a systematic study of performance measures for
online algorithms was initiated [Boyar, Irani, Larsen: Eleventh International
Algorithms and Data Structures Symposium 2009], first focusing on a simple
server problem. We continue this work by studying a fundamentally different
online problem, online search, and the Reservation Price Policies in
particular. The purpose of this line of work is to learn more about the
applicability of various performance measures in different situations and the
properties that the different measures emphasize. We investigate the following
analysis techniques: Competitive, Relative Worst Order, Bijective, Average,
Relative Interval, Random Order, and Max/Max. In addition to drawing
conclusions on this work, we also investigate the measures' sensitivity to
integral vs. real-valued domains, and as a part of this work, generalize some
of the known performance measures. Finally, we have established the first
optimality proof for Relative Interval Analysis.
