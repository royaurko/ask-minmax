The contribution provides the backround of the model of Expansive
Nondecelerative Universe, rationalizes the introduction of Vaidya metrics
allowing thus to localize and quantify gravitational energy. A unifying
explanation of the fundamental physical interactions is accompanied by
demonstration of some consequences and predictions relating to cosmological
problems.
