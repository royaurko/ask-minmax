We survey the results in Nane (E. Nane, Higher order PDE's and iterated
processes, Trans. American Math. Soc. (to appear)) and Baeumer, Meerschaert,
and Nane (B. Baeumer, M.M. Meerschaert and E. Nane, Brownian subordinators and
fractional Cauchy problems: Submitted (2007)) which deal with PDE connection of
some iterated processes, and obtain a new probabilistic proof of the
equivalence of the higher order PDE's and fractional in time PDE's.
