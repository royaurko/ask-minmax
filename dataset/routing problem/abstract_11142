Motivated by secure wireless networking, we consider the problem of placing
fixed localizers that enable mobile communication devices to prove they belong
to a secure region that is defined by the interior of a polygon. Each localizer
views an infinite wedge of the plane, and a device can prove membership in the
secure region if it is inside the wedges for a set of localizers whose common
intersection contains no points outside the polygon. This model leads to a
broad class of new art gallery type problems, for which we provide upper and
lower bounds.
