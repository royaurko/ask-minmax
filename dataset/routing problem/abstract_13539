We study global bifurcation branches consisting of stationary solutions of
the Muskat problem. It is proved that the steady-state fingering patterns blow
up as the surface tension increases: we find a threshold value for the cell
height with the property that below this value the fingers will touch the
boundaries of the cell when the surface tension approaches a finite value from
below; otherwise, the maximal slope of the fingers tends to infinity.
