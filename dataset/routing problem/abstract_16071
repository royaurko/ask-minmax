We study the problem of simultaneous approximation to a fixed family of real
and p-adic numbers by roots of integer polynomials of restricted type. The
method that we use for this purpose was developed by H. Davenport and W.M.
Schmidt in their study of approximation to real numbers by algebraic integers.
This method based on Mahler's Duality requires to study the dual problem of
approximation to successive powers of these numbers by rational numbers with
the same denominators. Dirichlet's Box Principle provides estimates for such
approximations but one can do better. In this thesis we establish constraints
on how much better one can do when dealing with the numbers and their squares.
We also construct examples showing that at least in some instances these
constraints are optimal. Going back to the original problem, we obtain
estimates for simultaneous approximation to real and p-adic numbers by roots of
integer polynomials of degree 3 or 4 with fixed coefficients in degree at least
3. In the case of a single real number (and no p-adic numbers), we extend work
of D. Roy by showing that the square of the golden ratio is the optimal
exponent of approximation by algebraic numbers of degree 4 with bounded
denominator and trace.
