A metric-field approach to gravitation is presented. It is based on an idea
of dependency of space-time properties on measuring instruments. Some bimetric
equations that realize this idea are considered. They were tested by the binary
pulsar PSR1913+16. The spherically - symmetric solution of the equations has no
event horizon and no physical singularity in the center. The proper energy of a
point particle is finite. There can exist supermassive compact configurations
of degenerated Fermi-gas which can be identified with observed objects in
galactic centers. The problem of the Universe acceleration has a natural
explanation.
