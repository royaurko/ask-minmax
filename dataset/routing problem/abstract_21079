It is known that humans can easily read words where the letters have been
jumbled in a certain way. This paper examines this problem by associating a
distance measure with the jumbling process. Modifications to text were
generated according to the Damerau-Levenshtein distance and it was checked if
the users are able to read it. Graphical representations of the results are
provided.
