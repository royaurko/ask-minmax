This paper considers the multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
broadcast channel. We consider the case where the multiple transmit antennas
are used to deliver independent data streams to multiple users via vector
perturbation. We derive expressions for the sum rate in terms of the average
energy of the precoded vector, and use this to derive a high signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) closed-form upper bound, which we show to be tight via simulation.
We also propose a modification to vector perturbation where different rates can
be allocated to different users. We conclude that for vector perturbation
precoding most of the sum rate gains can be achieved by reducing the rate
allocation problem to the user selection problem. We then propose a
low-complexity user selection algorithm that attempts to maximize the high-SNR
sum rate upper bound. Simulations show that the algorithm outperforms other
user selection algorithms of similar complexity.
