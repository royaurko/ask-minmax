In this work, we study the single machine scheduling problem with uncertain
release times and processing times of jobs. We adopt a robust scheduling
approach, in which the measure of robustness to be minimized for a given
sequence of jobs is the worst-case objective function value from the set of all
possible realizations of release and processing times. The objective function
value is the total flow time of all jobs. We discuss some important properties
of robust schedules for zero and non-zero release times, and illustrate the
added complexity in robust scheduling given non-zero release times. We propose
heuristics based on variable neighborhood search and iterated local search to
solve the problem and generate robust schedules. The algorithms are tested and
their solution performance is compared with optimal solutions or lower bounds
through numerical experiments based on synthetic data.
