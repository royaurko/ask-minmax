We discuss a free boundary problem for two moving solid-liquid interfaces
that strongly interact via the diffusion field in the liquid layer between
them. This problem arises in the context of liquid film migration (LFM) during
the partial melting of solid alloys. In the LFM mechanism the system chooses a
more efficient kinetic path which is controlled by diffusion in the liquid
film, whereas the process with only one melting front would be controlled by
the very slow diffusion in the mother solid phase. The relatively weak
coherency strain energy is the effective driving force for LFM. As in the
classical dendritic growth problems, also in this case an exact family of
steady-state solutions with two parabolic fronts and an arbitrary velocity
exists if capillary effects are neglected. We develop a velocity selection
theory for this problem, including anisotropic surface tension effects. The
strong diffusion interaction and coherency strain effects in the solid near the
melting front lead to substantial changes compared to classical dendritic
growth.
