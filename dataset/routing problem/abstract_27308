The Fields of Experts (FoE) image prior model, a filter-based higher-order
Markov Random Fields (MRF) model, has been shown to be effective for many image
restoration problems. Motivated by the successes of FoE-based approaches, in
this letter, we propose a novel variational model for multiplicative noise
reduction based on the FoE image prior model. The resulted model corresponds to
a non-convex minimization problem, which can be solved by a recently published
non-convex optimization algorithm. Experimental results based on synthetic
speckle noise and real synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images suggest that the
performance of our proposed method is on par with the best published
despeckling algorithm. Besides, our proposed model comes along with an
additional advantage, that the inference is extremely efficient. {Our GPU based
implementation takes less than 1s to produce state-of-the-art despeckling
performance.}
