Background modeling is a critical component for various vision-based
applications. As the data of these practical problems get larger and larger,
most traditional methods tend to be unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a
Sparse Outliers Iterative Removal (SO-IR) algorithm for the large-scale stable
background modeling problems. The proposed algorithm consists of two key steps.
One is a sparse representation process, in which we refine the frame series and
select a few 'discriminative' frames. Another one is a cyclic iteration
process, including a tensor-wise PCA model and a pixel-wise outlier removal
strategy, which extracts the background from these selected 'discriminative'
frames quickly and exactly. Experimental results show that, the few
'discriminative' frames determine the performance of the background extraction.
Further, SO-IR can achieve high accuracy as well as high speed simultaneously
in dealing with the real video sequences. What's more, SO-IR shows its great
advantage in solving the large-scale tasks.
