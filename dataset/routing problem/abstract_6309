In the weakened 16th Hilbert's Problem one asks for a bound of the number of
limit cycles which appear after a polynomial perturbation of a planar
polynomial Hamiltonian vector field. It is known that this number is finite for
an individual vector field. In the multidimensional generalization of this
problem one considers polynomial perturbation of a polynomial vector field with
invariant plane supporting a Hamiltonian dynamics. We present an explicit
example of such perturbation with infinite number of limit cycles which
accumulate at some separatrix loop.
