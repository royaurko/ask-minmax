In the present work we establish an energy quantization (or energy identity)
result for solutions to scaling invariant variational problems in dimension 4
which includes biharmonic maps (extrinsic and intrinsic). To that aim we first
establish an angular energy quantization for solutions to critical linear 4th
order elliptic systems with antisymmetric potentials. The method is inspired by
the one introduced by the contributors previously in arXiv:1109.3599v1 for 2nd order
problems.
