Despite the abundance and importance of three-dimensional systems, relatively
little progress has been made on spatiotemporal nonlinear optical waves
compared to time-only or space-only systems. Here we study radiation emitted by
three-dimensionally evolving nonlinear optical waves in multimode fiber.
Spatiotemporal oscillations of solitons in the fiber generate multimode
dispersive wave sidebands over an ultrabroadband spectral range. This work
suggests routes to multipurpose sources of coherent electromagnetic waves, with
unprecedented wavelength coverage.
