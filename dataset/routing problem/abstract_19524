Problem of meteor orbit determination for a given parent body is discussed.
Some of the published methods for obtaining meteoroid's orbital elements at the
moment of intersecting Earth's orbit on the basis of geometrical variation of
parent body's orbital elements are discussed. The main result concerns the
following two facts: i) in real situations physical quantities for the change
of orbital elements of the parent body must be used, and, ii) the usage of
Southworth and Hawkins (1963) D-criterion yields results not corresponding to
observations.
