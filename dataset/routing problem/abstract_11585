Starting from a description of various generalized function algebras based on
sequence spaces, we develop the general framework for considering linear
problems with singular coefficients or non linear problems. Therefore, we prove
functorial properties of those algebras and show how weak equalities, in the
sense of various associations, can be described in this setting.
