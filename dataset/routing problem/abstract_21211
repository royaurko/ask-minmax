The averaging problem in cosmology is of considerable importance for the
correct interpretation of cosmological data. We review cosmological
observations and discuss some of the issues regarding averaging. We present a
precise definition of a cosmological model and a rigorous mathematical
definition of averaging, based entirely in terms of scalar invariants.
