We report on the experimental investigation of gluing bifurcations in the
analog electronic circuit which models a dynamical system of the third order:
Lorenz equations with an additional quadratic nonlinearity. Variation of one of
the resistances in the circuit changes the coefficient at this nonlinearity and
enables transition from the Lorenz route to chaos to a different scenario which
leads, through the sequence of homoclinic bifurcations, from periodic
oscillations of the voltage to the chaotic state. A single bifurcation "glues"
in the phase space two stable periodic orbits and creates a new one, with the
doubled length: a bifurcation sequence results in the birth of the chaotic
attractor.
