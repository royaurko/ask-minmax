We discuss the possibility of representing elements in polynomial ideals in
$\C^N$ with optimal degree bounds. Classical theorems due to Macaulay and Max
Noether say that such a representation is possible under certain conditions on
the variety of the associated homogeneous ideal. We present some variants of
these results, as well as generalizations to subvarieties of $\C^N$.
