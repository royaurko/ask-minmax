This paper presents the link availability probability. We evaluate and
compare the link availability probability for routing protocols; Ad hoc
On-demand Distance vector (AODV), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Fisheye
State Routing (FSR) for different number of connections and node density. A
novel contribution of this work is enhancement in existing parameters of
routing protocols; AODV, DSR and FSR as MOD-AODV, MOD-DSR and MOD-FSR. From the
results, we observe that MOD-DSR and DSR outperform MOD-AODV, AODV, MODOLSR and
OLSR in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Average End-to End Delay (AE2ED),
link availability probability at the cost of high value of Normalized Routing
Overhead (NRO).
