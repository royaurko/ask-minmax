The compact explicit expressions for formal exact operator solutions to
Cauchy problem for sufficiently general systems of nonlinear differential
equations (ODEs and PDEs) in the form of chronological operator exponents are
given. The variant of exact solutions in the form of ordinary (without
chronologization) operator exponents are proposed.
