We define two notions of discrete dimension based on the Minkowski and
Hausdorff dimensions in the continuous setting. After proving some basic
results illustrating these definitions, we apply this machinery to the study of
connections between the Erdos and Falconer distance problems in geometric
combinatorics and geometric measure theory, respectively.
