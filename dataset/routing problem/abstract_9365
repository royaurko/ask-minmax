The Nash problem asks about the existence of a correspondence between
families of arcs through singularities of complex varieties and certain types
of divisorial valuations. It has been positively settled in dimension 2 by
Fern\'andez de Bobadilla and Pe Pereira, and it was shown to have a negative
answer in all dimensions $\ge 4$ by Ishii and Koll\'ar. In this note we discuss
examples which show that the problem has a negative answer in dimension 3 as
well. These examples bring also to light the different nature of the problem
depending on whether it is formulated the algebraic setting or in the analytic
setting.
