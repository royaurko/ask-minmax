We reduced the problem of constructing bi-Hamiltonian structure in three
dimensions to the solution of a Riccati equation in moving coordinates of
Serret-Frenet frame. We then show that either the linearly independent
solutions of the corresponding second order equation or the normal vectors of
the moving frame imply two compatible Poisson structures.
