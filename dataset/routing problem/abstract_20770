This paper is a follow-up to our joint paper with I. Agol, P. Storm and K.
Whyte "Finiteness of arithmetic hyperbolic reflection groups". The main purpose
is to investigate the effective side of the method developed there and its
possible application to the problem of classification of arithmetic hyperbolic
reflection groups.
