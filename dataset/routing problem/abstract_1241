With a widespread growth in the potential applications of Wireless Sensor
Networks, the need for reliable security mechanisms for them has increased
manifold. This paper proposes a scheme, Privacy for Police Patrols (PPP), to
provide secure data aggregation that relies on multilevel routing. Privacy
factors have been identified and implemented. Aggregates are prepared and the
summary of information is gathered and stored in a repository. The above
defined approaches are integrated in police patrol applications and preliminary
results are obtained.
