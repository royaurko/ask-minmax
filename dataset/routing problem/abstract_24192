In the problem of motion of the Kowalevski top in a double force field the
4-dimensional invariant submanifold of the phase space was pointed out by
M.P.Kharlamov (Mekh. Tverd. Tela, 32, 2002). We show that the equations of
motion on this manifold can be separated by the appropriate change of
variables, the new variables s1, s2 being elliptic functions of time. The
natural phase variables (components of the angular velocity and the direction
vectors of the forces with respect to the movable basis) are expressed via s1,
s2 explicitly in elementary algebraic functions.
