(1-x)Li0.12Na0.88NbO3-xBaTiO3 (0 to x to 0.40) ferroelectric ceramics were
prepared using conventional ceramics route and their phase transitional
behavior is investigated by using dielectric spectroscopy. The
temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity epsilon'(T) shows a diffused
ferroelectric-paraelectric transition for all compositions. An acceptable and
competent characterizing parameter (D) of diffused phase transition (DPT),
defined by Uchino et al. [J Am Ceram Soc 2010;93:4011], was measured and
validated. Interestingly, a crossover from diffused ferroelectric phase
transition (FE-DPT) to relaxor ferroelectric (RFE) transition is found for the
composition x greater than equal to 0.225. The FE-DPT is characterized by a
frequency-independent temperature of dielectric maxima (Tm), while a RFE is
found to have frequency-dependent Tm satisfying Vogel-Fulcher relation. The
composition induced crossover is attributed to the dynamics of different PNR
size and relaxation times that varies with different BaTiO3 content (x) leading
to the appearance of a FE-DPT or RFE.
