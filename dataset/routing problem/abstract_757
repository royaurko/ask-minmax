Mobile Ad-Hoc network is a collection of mobile nodes in communication
without using infrastructure. As the real-time applications used in today's
wireless network grow, we need some schemes to provide more suitable service
for them. We know that most of actual schemes do not perform well on traffic
which is not strictly CBR. Therefore, in this paper we have studied the impact,
respectively, of mobility models and the density of nodes on the performances
(End-to-End Delay, Throughput and Packet Delivery ratio) of routing protocol
(Optimized Link State Routing) OLSR by using in the first a real-time VBR
(MPEG-4) and secondly the Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic. Finally we compare
the performance on both cases. Experimentally, we considered the three mobility
models as follows Random Waypoint, Random Direction and Mobgen Steady State.
The experimental results illustrate that the behavior of OLSR change according
to the model and the used traffics.
