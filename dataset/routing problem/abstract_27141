Reversible logic circuit is a necessary construction for achieving ultra low
power dissipation as well as for prominent post-CMOS computing technologies
such as Quantum computing. Consequently automatic synthesis of a Boolean
function using elementary reversible logic gates has received significant
research attention in recent times, creating the domain of reversible logic
synthesis. In this paper, we study the complexity of reversible logic
synthesis. The problem is separately studied for bounded-ancilla and
ancilla-free optimal synthesis approaches. The computational complexity for
both cases are linked to known/presumed hard problems. Finally, experiments are
performed with a shortest-path based reversible logic synthesis approach and a
(0-1) ILP-based formulation.
