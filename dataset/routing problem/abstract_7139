For $N$-body problems with homogeneous potentials we define a special class
of central configurations related with the reduction of homotheties in the
study of homogeneous weak KAM solutions. For potentials in $1/r^\alpha$ with
$\alpha\in (0,2)$ we prove the existence of homogeneous weak KAM solutions. We
show that such solutions are related to viscosity solutions of another
Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the sphere of normal configurations. As an
application we prove for the Newtonian three body problem that there are no
smooth homogeneous solutions to the critical Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
