In this paper we conduct a numerical study of the supersymmetric O(3)
non-linear sigma model. The lattice formulation we employ was derived in
\cite{sigma1} and corresponds to a discretization of a {\it twisted} form of
the continuum action. The twisting process exposes a {\it nilpotent}
supercharge $Q$ and allows the action to be rewritten in $Q$-exact form. These
properties may be maintained on the lattice. We show how to deform the theory
by the addition of potential terms which preserve the supersymmetry. A Wilson
mass operator may be introduced in this way with a minimal breaking of
supersymmetry. We additionally show how to rewrite the theory in the language
of K\"{a}hler-Dirac fields and explain why this avenue does not provide a good
route to discretization. Our numerical results provide strong evidence for a
restoration of full supersymmetry in the continuum limit {\it without} fine
tuning. We also observe a non-vanishing chiral condensate as expected from
continuum instanton calculations.
