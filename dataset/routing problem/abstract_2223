Multipeak negative differential resistance (NDR) molecular devices are
designed from first principles. The effect of NDR is associated with the
non-linear Stark shifts and the electron localization within the conductive
region and contacts. Deep I(V)-curve well is formed when the aromatic molecule,
containing intramolecular hydrogen bond, is connected to each lead by the
double-branch contacts. This effect occurs at the same voltage where a
single-junction case exhibits only a flat step in the current characteristics.
The multipeak oscillations arise from the mutual effect of the Stark shifts
located at the electron-rich contacts and parts of the molecule - this opens
the route for further tailoring the desired properties.
