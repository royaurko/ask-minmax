We use the extension of scaled particle theory (ESPT) presented in the
accompanying paper [Stillinger et al. J. Chem. Phys. xxx, xxx (2007)] to
calculate numerically pair correlation function of the hard sphere fluid over
the density range $0\leq \rho\sigma^3\leq 0.96$. Comparison with computer
simulation results reveals that the new theory is able to capture accurately
the fluid's structure across the entire density range examined. The pressure
predicted via the virial route is systematically lower than simulation results,
while that obtained using the compressibility route is lower than simulation
predictions for $\rho\sigma^3\leq 0.67$ and higher than simulation predictions
for $\rho\sigma^3\geq 0.67$. Numerical predictions are also presented for the
surface tension and Tolman length of the hard sphere fluid.
