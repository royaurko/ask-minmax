We prove lower bounds of order $n\log n$ for both the problem to multiply
polynomials of degree $n$, and to divide polynomials with remainder, in the
model of bounded coefficient arithmetic circuits over the complex numbers.
These lower bounds are optimal up to order of magnitude. The proof uses a
recent idea of R. Raz [Proc. 34th STOC 2002] proposed for matrix
multiplication. It reduces the linear problem to multiply a random circulant
matrix with a vector to the bilinear problem of cyclic convolution. We treat
the arising linear problem by extending J. Morgenstern's bound [J. ACM 20, pp.
305-306, 1973] in a unitarily invariant way. This establishes a new lower bound
on the bounded coefficient complexity of linear forms in terms of the singular
values of the corresponding matrix. In addition, we extend these lower bounds
for linear and bilinear maps to a model of circuits that allows a restricted
number of unbounded scalar multiplications.
