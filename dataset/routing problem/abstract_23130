In the field equations of Einstein-Cartan theory with cosmological constant a
static spherically symmetric perfect fluid with spin density satisfying the
Weyssenhoff restriction is considered. This serves as a rough model of space
filled with (fermionic) dark matter. From this the Einstein static universe
with constant torsion is constructed, generalising the Einstein Cosmos to
Einstein-Cartan theory.
  The interplay between torsion and the cosmological constant is discussed. A
possible way out of the cosmological constant's sign problem is suggested.
