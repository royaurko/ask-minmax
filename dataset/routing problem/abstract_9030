We consider matrix-model representations of the meander problem which
describes, in particular, combinatorics for foldings of closed polymer chains.
We introduce a supersymmetric matrix model for describing the principal meander
numbers. This model is of the type proposed by Marinari and Parisi for
discretizing a superstring in D=1 while the supersymmetry is realized in D=0 as
a rotational symmetry between bosonic and fermionic matrices. Using
non-commutative sources, we reformulate the meander problem in a Boltzmannian
Fock space whose annihilation and creation operators obey the Cuntz algebra. We
discuss also the relation between the matrix models describing the meander
problem and the Kazakov-Migdal model on a D-dimensional lattice.
