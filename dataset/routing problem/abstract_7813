We compute the relative zeta-function metric on the determinant line bundle
for a family of elliptic boundary value problems of Dirac-type. To do this we
prove a general formula relating the zeta-determinant to a Fredholm determinant
over the boundary for a class of higher-order elliptic boundary value problems.
