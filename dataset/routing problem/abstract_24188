We study the $\bar{\partial}_b$-Neumann problem for domains $\Omega$
contained in a strictly pseudoconvex manifold M^{2n+1} whose boundaries are
noncharacteristic and have defining functions depending solely on the real and
imaginary parts of a single CR function w. When the Kohn Laplacian is a priori
known to have closed range in L^2, we prove sharp regularity and estimates for
solutions. We establish a condition on the boundary which is sufficient for the
Kohn Laplacian to be Fredholm on $L^2_{(0,q)}(\Omega)$ and show that this
condition always holds when M is embedded as a hypersurface in C^{n+1}. We
present examples where the inhomogeneous $\bar{\partial}_b$ equation can always
be solved smoothly up to the boundary on (p,q)-forms with 0<q<n-1.
