Necessary and sufficient conditions are investigated for the existence of
local bases in which the components of derivations of tensor algebras over
differentiable manifold vanish in a neighborhood or only at a single point. The
problem when these bases are holonomic or anholonomic is considered. Attention
is paid to the case of linear connections. Relations of these problems with the
equivalence principle are pointed out.
