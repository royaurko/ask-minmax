We study the problem of synchronization of automata with random inputs. We
present a series of automata such that the expected number of steps until
synchronization is exponential in the number of states. At the same time, we
show that the expected number of letters to synchronize any pair of the famous
Cerny automata is at most cubic in the number of states.
