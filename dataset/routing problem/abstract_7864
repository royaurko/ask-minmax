If pricing kernels are assumed non-negative then the inverse problem of
finding the pricing kernel is well-posed. The constrained least squares method
provides a consistent estimate of the pricing kernel. When the data are
limited, a new method is suggested: relaxed maximization of the relative
entropy. This estimator is also consistent. Keywords: $\epsilon$-entropy,
non-parametric estimation, pricing kernel, inverse problems.
