Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETS) is a collection of wireless nodes without any
infrastructure support. The nodes in MANET can act as either router or source
and the control of the network is distributed among nodes. The nodes in MANETS
are highly mobile and it maintains dynamic interconnection between those mobile
nodes. MANTEs have been considered as isolated stand-alone network. This can
turn the dream of networking "at any time and at any where" into reality. The
main purpose of this paper is to study the issues in route discovery process in
AODV protocol for MANET. Flooding of route request message imposes major
concern in route establishment. This paper suggests a new approach to reduce
the routing overhead during the route discovery phase. By considering the
previous behaviour of the network, the new protocol reduces the unwanted
searches during route establishment process
