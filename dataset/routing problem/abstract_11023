A time-dependent global fiber-bundle model of fracture with continuous damage
was recently formulated in terms of an autonomous differential system and
numerically solved by applying a discrete probabilistic method. In this paper
we provide a method to obtain the exact numerical solution for this problem. It
is based on the introduction of successive integrating parameters which permits
a robust inversion of the numerical integrations appearing in the problem.
