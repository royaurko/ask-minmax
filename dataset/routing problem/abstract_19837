The lepton number violating interactions generated by the light Majorana
neutrinos can erase the primordial baryon asymmetry of the universe during the
electroweak phase transition. The Majorana masses of the left-handed neutrinos
are constrained to avoid this problem. These constraints do not depend on the
$(B-L)$ symmetry breaking mechanism.
