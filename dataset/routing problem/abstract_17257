A system reconfiguration problem is considered for three-phase power
distribution networks featuring distributed generation. In lieu of binary line
selection variables, the notion of group sparsity is advocated to re-formulate
the nonconvex distribution system reconfiguration (DSR) problem into a convex
one. Using the duality theory, it is shown that the line selection task boils
down to a shrinkage and thresholding operation on the line currents. Further,
numerical tests illustrate the ability of the proposed scheme to identify
meshed, weakly-meshed, or even radial configurations by adjusting a
sparsity-tuning parameter in the DSR cost. Constraints on the voltages are
investigated, and incorporated in the novel DSR problem to effect voltage
regulation.
