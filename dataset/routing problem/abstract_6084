In this paper, we introduce a unified framework of Tensor Higher-Degree
Eigenvalue Complementarity Problem (THDEiCP), which goes beyond the framework
of the typical Quadratic Eigenvalue Complementarity Problem (QEiCP) for
matrices. First, we study some topological properties of higher-degree cone
eigenvalues of tensors. Based upon the symmetry assumptions on the underlying
tensors, we then reformulate THDEiCP as a weakly coupled homogeneous polynomial
optimization problem, which might be greatly helpful for designing
implementable algorithms to solve the problem under consideration numerically.
As more general theoretical results, we present the results concerning
existence of solutions of THDEiCP without symmetry conditions. Finally, we
propose an easily implementable algorithm to solve THDEiCP, and report some
computational results.
