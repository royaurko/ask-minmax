We consider difference operators in $L^2$ on $\R$ of the form $$ L
f(s)=p(s)f(s+i)+q(s) f(s)+r(s) f(s-i) ,$$ where $i$ is the imaginary unit. The
domain of definiteness are functions holomorphic in a strip with some
conditions of decreasing at infinity. Problems of such type with discrete
spectra are well known (Meixner--Pollaszek, continuous Hahn, continuous dual
Hahn, and Wilson hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials).
  We write explicit spectral decompositions for several operators $L$ with
continuous spectra. We also discuss analogs of 'boundary conditions' for such
operators.
