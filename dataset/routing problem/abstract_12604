In this paper we study homogenization for a class of monotone systems of
first-order time-dependent periodic Hamilton-Jacobi equations. We characterize
the Hamiltonians of the limit problem by appropriate cell problems. Hence we
show the uniform convergence of the solution of the oscillating systems to the
bounded uniformly continuous solution of the homogenized system.
