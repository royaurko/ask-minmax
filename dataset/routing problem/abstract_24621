This paper is devoted to strictly hyperbolic systems and equations with
non-smooth coefficients. Below a certain level of smoothness, distributional
solutions may fail to exist. We construct generalised solutions in the
Colombeau algebra of generalised functions. Extending earlier results on
symmetric hyperbolic systems, we introduce generalised strict hyperbolicity,
construct symmetrisers, prove an appropriate G\r{a}rding inequality and
establish existence, uniqueness and regularity of generalised solutions. Under
additional regularity assumptions on the coefficients, when a classical
solution of the Cauchy problem (or of a transmission problem in the piecewise
regular case) exists, the generalised solution is shown to be associated with
the classical solution (or the piecewise classical solution satisfying the
appropriate transmission conditions).
