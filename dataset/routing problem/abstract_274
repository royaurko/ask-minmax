We analyze a classification of two main families of controllers that are of
interest when the feedback loop is subject to switching propagation delays due
to routing via a wireless multi-hop communication network. We show that we can
cast this problem as a subclass of classical switching systems, which is a
non-trivial generalization of classical LTI systems with timevarying delays. We
consider both cases where delay-dependent and delay independent controllers are
used, and show that both can be modeled as switching systems with unconstrained
switchings. We provide NP-hardness results for the stability verification
problem, and propose a general methodology for approximate stability analysis
with arbitrary precision. We finally give evidence that non-trivial design
problems arise for which new algorithmic methods are needed.
