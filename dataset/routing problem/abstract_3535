We describe a new Maple package for treating boundary problems for linear
ordinary differential equations, allowing two-/multipoint as well as Stieltjes
boundary conditions. For expressing differential operators, boundary
conditions, and Green's operators, we employ the algebra of
integro-differential operators. The operations implemented for regular boundary
problems include computing Green's operators as well as composing and factoring
boundary problems. Our symbolic approach to singular boundary problems is new;
it provides algorithms for computing compatibility conditions and generalized
Green's operators.
