Although the CSP (constraint satisfaction problem) is NP-complete, even in
the case when all constraints are binary, certain classes of instances are
tractable. We study classes of instances defined by excluding subproblems. This
approach has recently led to the discovery of novel tractable classes. The
complete characterisation of all tractable classes defined by forbidding
patterns (where a pattern is simply a compact representation of a set of
subproblems) is a challenging problem. We demonstrate a dichotomy in the case
of forbidden patterns consisting of either one or two constraints. This has
allowed us to discover new tractable classes including, for example, a novel
generalisation of 2SAT.
