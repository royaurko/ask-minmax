Extending our method for investigating Real cobordism (which was recently
used by Hill, Hopkins and Ravenel in their solution of the Kervaire invariant 1
problem), we investigate the $RO(G)$-graded homotopy groups of a (non-complete)
$\Z/2\times \Z/2$-equivariant spectrum called topological Hermitian cobordism.
The methods of this paper may be useful in computing the homotopy groups of
other $G$-equivariant spectra where $G\neq \Z/2$.
