I present a brief overview of observational, modeling and theoretical issues
related to ageing calculations based on spectral steepening. These include
problems such as inhomogeneous magnetic fields, diffusion of relativistic
particles, confusion from multiple particle populations and particle
acceleration. Although some of the effects are only of order unity, others call
into question the entire ageing paradigm. I refer to and show some data
illustrating these problems and make a few recommendations about how we should
proceed given these uncertainties.
