Infinite-dimensional linear conic formulations are described for nonlinear
optimal control problems. The primal linear problem consists of finding
occupation measures supported on optimal relaxed controlled trajectories,
whereas the dual linear problem consists of finding the largest lower bound on
the value function of the optimal control problem. Various approximation
results relating the original optimal control problem and its linear conic
formulations are developed. As illustrated by a couple of simple examples,
these results are relevant in the context of finite-dimensional semidefinite
programming relaxations used to approximate numerically the solutions of the
infinite-dimensional linear conic problems.
