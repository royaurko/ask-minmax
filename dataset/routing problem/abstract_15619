Two long-standing problems with the post-Newtonian approximation for isolated
slowly-moving systems in general relativity are: (i) the appearance at high
post-Newtonian orders of divergent Poisson integrals, casting a doubt on the
soundness of the post-Newtonian series; (ii) the domain of validity of the
approximation which is limited to the near-zone of the source, and prevents
one, a priori, from incorporating the condition of no-incoming radiation, to be
imposed at past null infinity. In this article, we resolve the problem (i) by
iterating the post-Newtonian hierarchy of equations by means of a new
(Poisson-type) integral operator that is free of divergencies, and the problem
(ii) by matching the post-Newtonian near-zone field to the exterior field of
the source, known from previous work as a multipolar-post-Minkowskian expansion
satisfying the relevant boundary conditions at infinity. As a result, we obtain
an algorithm for iterating the post-Newtonian series up to any order, and we
determine the terms, present in the post-Newtonian field, that are associated
with the gravitational-radiation reaction onto an isolated slowly-moving matter
system.
