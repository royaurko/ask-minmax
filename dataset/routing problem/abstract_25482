Recently we discussed new aspects of degenerate brane configurations, which
can appear in the context of heterotic strings, perturbative type II, or
M/F-theory. Here we continue our study of degenerate brane configurations,
focussing on two applications. First we show how the notion of gluing can be
viewed as a tool to engineer flavour structures in F-theory and type IIb, such
as models with bulk matter and with Yukawa textures arising from the
holomorphic zero mechanism. We find that there is in principle enough structure
to solve some of the major flavour problems without generating exotics. In
particular, we show how this addresses the mu-problem, doublet/triplet
splitting and proton decay. Secondly, we describe the Fourier-Mukai transform
of heterotic monad constructions, which occur in the large volume limit of
heterotic linear sigma model vacua. Degenerate structures again often appear.
One may use this to explore strong coupling phenomena using heterotic/F-theory
duality.
