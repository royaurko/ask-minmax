In this paper we review some recent results concerning inverse problems for
thin elastic plates. The plate is assumed to be made by non-homogeneous
linearly elastic material belonging to a general class of anisotropy. A first
group of results concerns uniqueness and stability for the determination of
unknown boundaries, including the cases of cavities and rigid inclusions. In
the second group of results, we consider upper and lower estimates of the area
of unknown inclusions given in terms of the work exerted by a couple field
applied at the boundary of the plate. In particular, we extend previous size
estimates for elastic inclusions to the case of cavities and rigid inclusions.
  Key words: inverse problems, elastic plates, uniqueness, stability estimates,
size estimates, three sphere inequality, unique continuation.
