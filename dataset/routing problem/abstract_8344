We show that the energy density of critical points of a class of conformally
invariant variational problems with small energy on the unit 2-disk B_1 lies in
the local Hardy space h^1(B_1). As a corollary we obtain a new proof of the
energy convexity and uniqueness result for weakly harmonic maps with small
energy on B_1.
