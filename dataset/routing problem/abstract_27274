We study the ascending motion of a disk rolling on an incline when its center
of mass lies outside the disk axis. The problem is suitable as laboratory
project for a first course in mechanics at the undergraduate level and goes
beyond typical textbook problems about bi-dimensional rigid body motions. We
develop a theoretical model for the disk motion based on mechanical energy
conservation and compare its predictions with experimental data obtained by
digital video recording. Using readily available resources, a very satisfactory
agreement is obtained between the model and the experimental observations.
These results complement previous ones that have been reported in the
literature for similar systems.
