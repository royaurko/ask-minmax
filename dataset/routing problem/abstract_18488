We study the SUSY flavor problem in the MSSM, we are namely interested in
estimating the size of the SUSY flavor problem and its dependence on the MSSM
parameters. For that, we made a numerical analysis randomly generating the
entries of the sfermion mass matrices and then determinated which percentage of
the points are consistent with current bounds on the flavor violating
transitions on lepton flavor violating (LFV) decays $l_i \to l_j \gamma$. We
applied two methods, mass-insertion approximation method (MIAM) and full
diagonalization method (FDM). Furthermore, we determined which fermion masses
could be radiatively generated (through gaugino-sfermion loops) in a natural
way, using those random sfermion matrices. In general, the electron mass
generation can be done with 30% of points for large $\tan\beta$, in both
schemes the muon mass can be generated by 40% of points only when the most
precise sfermion splitting (from the FDM) is taken into account.
