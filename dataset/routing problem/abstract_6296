Motivated by Bourque and Pevzner's simulation study of the parsimony method
for studying genome rearrangement, Berestycki and Durrett used techniques from
random graph theory to prove that the minimum parsimony distance after
iterating the random transposition shuffle undergoes a transition from Poisson
to normal behavior. This paper establishes an analogous result for minimum
parsimony distance after iterates of riffle shuffles or iterates of riffle
shuffles and cuts. The analysis is elegant and uses different tools: Stein's
method and generating functions. A useful technique which emerges is that of
making a problem more tractable by adding extra symmetry, then using Stein's
method to exploit the symmetry in the modified problem, and from this deducing
information about the original problem.
