Recent deep inelastic scattering and Drell-Yan experiments have revealed a
surprisingly large asymmetry between the up and down sea quark distributions in
the nucleon. The current status of the flavor asymmetry of the nucleon sea is
reviewed. Implications of various theoretical models and possible future
measurements are also discussed.
