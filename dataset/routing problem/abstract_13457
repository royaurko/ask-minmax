We discuss a gauge fixing of gravity coupled to a scalar field in spherical
symmetry such that the Hamiltonian is an integral over space of a local
density. In a previous paper we had presented it using Ashtekar's new
variables. Here we study it in metric variables. We specify completely the
initial-boundary value problem for ingoing Gaussian pulses.
