We study some convergence issues for a recent approach to the problem of
transparent boundary conditions for the Helmholtz equation in unbounded
domains. The approach is based on the minimization on an integral functional
which arises from an integral formulation of the radiation condition at
infinity. In this Letter, we implement a Fourier-Chebyschev collocation method
and show that this approach reduce the computational cost significantly. As a
consequence, we give numerical evidence of some convergence estimates available
in literature and we study the robustness of the algorithm at low and mid-high
frequencies.
