In this paper different optimization of Ad-hoc routing algorithm is surveyed
and a new method using training based optimization algorithm for reducing the
complexity of routing algorithms is suggested. A binary matrix is assigned to
each node in the network and gets updated after each data transfer using the
protocols. The use of optimization algorithm in routing algorithm can reduce
the complexity of routing to the least amount possible.
