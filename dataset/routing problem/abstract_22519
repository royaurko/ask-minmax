Measuring the three-point correlators of the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) anisotropies could help to get a handle on the level of non-Gaussianity
present in the observational datasets and therefore would strongly constrain
models of the early Universe. However, typically, the expected non-Gaussian
signal is very small. Therefore, one has to face the problem of extracting it
from the noise, in particular from the `cosmic variance' noise. For this
purpose, one has to construct the best unbiased estimators for the three-point
correlators that are needed for concrete detections of non-Gaussian features.
In this article, we study this problem for both the CMB third moment and the
CMB angular bispectrum. We emphasize that the knowledge of the best estimator
for the former does not permit one to infer the best estimator for the latter
and vice versa. We present the corresponding best unbiased estimators in both
cases and compute their corresponding cosmic variances.
