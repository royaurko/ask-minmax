We study three estimators for the interval censoring case 2 problem, a
histogram-type estimator, proposed in Birg\'e (1999), the maximum likelihood
estimator (MLE) and the smoothed MLE, using a smoothing kernel. Our focus is on
the asymptotic distribution of the estimators at a fixed point. The estimators
are compared in a simulation study.
