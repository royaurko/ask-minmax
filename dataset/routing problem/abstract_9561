This is a survey or exposition of a particular collection of results and open
problems involving snarks --- simple "cubic" (3-valent) graphs for which, for
nontrivial reasons, the edges cannot be 3-colored. The results and problems
here are rooted in a series of papers by Laszlo Kaszonyi that were published in
the early 1970s. The problems posed in this survey paper can be tackled without
too much specialized mathematical preparation, and in particular seem well
suited for interested undergraduate mathematics students to pursue as
independent research projects. This survey paper is intended to facilitate
research on these problems.
