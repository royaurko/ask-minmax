The considered problem is uniform convergence of sequences of hypergeometric
series. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for uniformly dominated
convergence of infinite sums of proper bivariate hypergeometric terms. These
conditions can be checked algorithmically. Hence the results can be applied in
Zeilberger type algorithms for nonterminating hypergeometric series.
