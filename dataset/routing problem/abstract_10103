Efficient solution of the single source shortest path (SSSP) problem on road
networks is an important requirement for numerous real-world applications. This
paper introduces an algorithm for the SSSP problem using compression method.
Owning to precomputing and storing all-pairs shortest path (APSP), the process
of solving SSSP problem is a simple lookup of a little data from precomputed
APSP and decompression. APSP without compression needs at least 1TB memory for
a road network with one million vertices. Our algorithm can compress such an
APSP into several GB, and ensure a good performance of decompression. In our
experiment on a dataset about Northwest USA (with 1.2 millions vertices), our
method can achieve about three orders of magnitude faster than Dijkstra
algorithm based on binary heap.
