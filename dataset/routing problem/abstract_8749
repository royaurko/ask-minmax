The problem of optical character recognition, OCR, has been widely discussed
in the literature. Having a hand-written text, the program aims at recognizing
the text. Even though there are several approaches to this issue, it is still
an open problem. In this paper we would like to propose an approach that uses
K-nearest neighbors algorithm, and has the accuracy of more than 90%. The
training and run time is also very short.
