We consider the problem of interpolating functions partially defined over a
distributive lattice, by means of lattice polynomial functions. Goodstein's
theorem solves a particular instance of this interpolation problem on a
distributive lattice L with least and greatest elements 0 and 1, resp.: Given
an n-ary partial function f over L, defined on all 0-1 tuples, f can be
extended to a lattice polynomial function p over L if and only if f is
monotone; in this case, the interpolating polynomial p is unique. We extend
Goodstein's theorem to a wider class of n-ary partial functions f over a
distributive lattice L, not necessarily bounded, where the domain of f is a
cuboid of the form D={a1,b1}x...x{an,bn} with ai<bi, and determine the class of
such partial functions which can be interpolated by lattice polynomial
functions. In this wider setting, interpolating polynomials are not necessarily
unique; we provide explicit descriptions of all possible lattice polynomial
functions which interpolate these partial functions, when such an interpolation
is available.
