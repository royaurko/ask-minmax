This paper is devoted to the Cauchy problem for the stochastic generalized
Benjamin-Ono equation. By using the Bourgain spaces and Fourier restriction
method and the assumption that $u_{0}$ is $\mathcal{F}_{0}$-measurable, we
prove that the Cauchy problem for the stochastic generalized Benjamin-Ono
equation is locally well-posed for the initial data $u_{0}(x,w)\in L^{2}
(\Omega; H^{s}(\R))$ with $s\geq\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\alpha}{4}$, where $0< \alpha
\leq 1.$ In particular, when $u_{0}\in L^{2}(\Omega;
H^{\frac{\alpha+1}{2}}(\R))\cap L^{\frac{2(2+3\alpha)}{\alpha}}(\Omega;
L^{2}(\R))$, we prove that there exists a unique global solution $u\in
L^{2}(\Omega; H^{\frac{\alpha+1}{2}}(\R))$ with $0< \alpha \leq 1.$
