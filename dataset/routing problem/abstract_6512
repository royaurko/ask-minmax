In this paper we merge recent developments on exact algorithms for finding an
ordering of vertices of a given graph that minimizes bandwidth (the BANDWIDTH
problem) and for finding an embedding of a given graph into a line that
minimizes distortion (the DISTORTION problem). For both problems we develop
algorithms that work in O(9.363^n) time and polynomial space. For BANDWIDTH,
this improves O^*(10^n) algorithm by Feige and Kilian from 2000, for DISTORTION
this is the first polynomial space exact algorithm that works in O(c^n) time we
are aware of. As a byproduct, we enhance the O(5^{n+o(n)})-time and
O^*(2^n)-space algorithm for DISTORTION by Fomin et al. to an algorithm working
in O(4.383^n) time and space.
