Photo-induced forces can be used to manipulate and cool the mechanical motion
of oscillators. When the oscillator is used as a force sensor, such as in
atomic force microscopy, active feedback is an enticing route to enhancing
measurement performance. Here, we show broadband multimode cooling of $-23$ dB
down to a temperature of $8 \pm 1$~K in the stationary regime. Through the use
of periodic quiescence feedback cooling, we show improved signal-to-noise
ratios for the measurement of transient signals. We compare the performance of
real feedback to numerical post-processing of data and show that both methods
produce similar improvements to the signal-to-noise ratio of force
measurements. We achieved a room temperature force measurement sensitivity of
$< 2\times10^{-16}$ N with integration time of less than $0.1$ ms. The high
precision and fast force microscopy results presented will potentially benefit
applications in biosensing, molecular metrology, subsurface imaging and
accelerometry.
