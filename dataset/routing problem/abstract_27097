In the present article, we consider a thermoelastic plate of
Reissner-Mindlin-Timoshenko type with the hyperbolic heat conduction arising
from Cattaneo's law. In the absense of any additional mechanical dissipations,
the system is often not even strongly stable unless restricted to the
rotationally symmetric case, etc. We present a well-posedness result for the
linear problem under general mixed boundary conditions for the elastic and
thermal parts. For the case of a clamped, thermally isolated plate, we show an
exponential energy decay rate under a full damping for all elastic variables.
Restricting the problem to the rotationally symmetric case, we further prove
that a single frictional damping merely for the bending compoment is sufficient
for exponential stability. To this end, we construct a Lyapunov functional
incorporating the Bogovski\u{i} operator for irrotational vector fields which
we discuss in the appendix.
