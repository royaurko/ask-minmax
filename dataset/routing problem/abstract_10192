There are n people, each of whom is either a knight or a spy. It is known
that at least k knights are present, where n/2 < k < n. Knights always tell the
truth. We consider both spies who always lie and spies who answer as they see
fit. This paper determines the number of questions required to find a spy or
prove that everyone in the room is a knight. We also determine the minimum
number of questions needed to find at least one person's identity, or a
nominated person's identity, or to find a spy (under the assumption that a spy
is present). For spies who always lie, we prove that these searching problems,
and the problem of finding a knight, can be solved by a simultaneous optimal
strategy. We also give some computational results on the problem of finding all
identities when spies always lie, and end by stating some open problems.
