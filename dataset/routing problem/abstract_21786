Aspects of of plane wave electromagnetic scattering by a radially
inhomogeneous sphere is discussed. The vector problem is reduced to two scalar
radial `Schr\"odinger-like' equations, and a connection with time-independent
potential scattering theory is exploited to draw several conclusions about
specific refractive index profiles.
