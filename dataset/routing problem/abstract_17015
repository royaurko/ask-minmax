This paper investigates the problem of secure lossy source coding in the
presence of an eavesdropper with arbitrary correlated side informations at the
legitimate decoder (referred to as Bob) and the eavesdropper (referred to as
Eve). This scenario consists of an encoder that wishes to compress a source to
satisfy the desired requirements on: (i) the distortion level at Bob and (ii)
the equivocation rate at Eve. It is assumed that the decoders have access to
correlated sources as side information. For instance, this problem can be seen
as a generalization of the well-known Wyner-Ziv problem taking into account the
security requirements. A complete characterization of the
rate-distortion-equivocation region for the case of arbitrary correlated side
informations at the decoders is derived. Several special cases of interest and
an application example to secure lossy source coding of binary sources in the
presence of binary and ternary side informations are also considered. It is
shown that the statistical differences between the side information at the
decoders and the presence of non-zero distortion at the legitimate decoder can
be useful in terms of secrecy. Applications of these results arise in a variety
of distributed sensor network scenarios.
