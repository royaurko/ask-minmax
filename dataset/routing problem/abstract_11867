Gravitational field of many common objects are small but in the detectable
sub microGal (Gal=g, free fall acceleration) range. Here we show that in a
modern analog of the Archimedes problem, it is possible to estimate the
interior density distribution of an object, by applying gauss law to the
exterior gravity field data. With the development of wide band width Eotovs or
nano range accelerometers it may also be possible to reconstruct and image the
interior matter distribution.
