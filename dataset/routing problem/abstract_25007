In this paper, we generalize a recent result of A. Eremenko and A. Gabrielov
on irreducibility of the spectral discriminant for the Schr\"odinger equation
with quartic potentials. We consider the eigenvalue problem with a
complex-valued polynomial potential of arbitrary degree d and show that the
spectral determinant of this problem is connected and irreducible. In other
words, every eigenvalue can be reached from any other by analytic continuation.
  We also prove connectedness of the parameter spaces of the potentials that
admit eigenfunctions satisfying k>2 boundary conditions, except for the case d
is even and k=d/2. In the latter case, connected components of the parameter
space are distinguished by the number of zeros of the eigenfunctions.
