A new method based on the Monte-Carlo calculation on the lattice is proposed
to study the Casimir effect in the compact lattice U(1) theory with Wilson
action. We have studied the standard Casimir problem with two parallel plane
surfaces (mirrors) and oblique boundary conditions on those as a test of our
method. Physically, this boundary conditions may appear in the problem of
modelling of the thin material films interaction and are generated by
additional Chern-Simons boundary term. This approach for the boundary condition
generation is very suitable for the lattice formulation of the Casimir problem
due to gauge invariance. This method can be simply generalized on the case of
more complicated geometries and other gauge groups.
