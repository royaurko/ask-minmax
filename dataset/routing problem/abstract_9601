The direct or algorithmic approach for the Jacobian problem, consisting of
the direct construction of the inverse polynomials, using the principle and
derived Jacobi conditions discussed in section 2.4 is proposed. The approach is
extendable to higher dimensions by identically proceeding on similar lines. As
per the result of Bass, Connell, and Right [3] it is enough to show the
conjecture to be true for cubic polynomials of special type in n variables. The
method of proof for two and three variables cases is discussed first and it is
shown that the extension for the several variables case is straightforward.
Thus, we show that the problem can be solved completely using the important
reduction of the problem to a homogeneous-cubic degree obtained in [3]. The
other objective of the paper is to point out the merits of the direct or
algorithmic approach for the Jacobian problem, subsequently leading to main
objective of settling it in the end using the result in [3].
