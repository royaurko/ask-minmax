In this article, we propose an algorithm, NESTA-LASSO, for the LASSO problem,
i.e., an underdetermined linear least-squares problem with a 1-norm constraint
on the solution. We prove under the assumption of the restricted isometry
property (RIP) and a sparsity condition on the solution, that NESTA-LASSO is
guaranteed to be almost always locally linearly convergent. As in the case of
the algorithm NESTA proposed by Becker, Bobin, and Candes, we rely on
Nesterov's accelerated proximal gradient method, which takes O(e^{-1/2})
iterations to come within e > 0 of the optimal value. We introduce a
modification to Nesterov's method that regularly updates the prox-center in a
provably optimal manner, and the aforementioned linear convergence is in part
due to this modification.
  In the second part of this article, we attempt to solve the basis pursuit
denoising BPDN problem (i.e., approximating the minimum 1-norm solution to an
underdetermined least squares problem) by using NESTA-LASSO in conjunction with
the Pareto root-finding method employed by van den Berg and Friedlander in
their SPGL1 solver. The resulting algorithm is called PARNES. We provide
numerical evidence to show that it is comparable to currently available
solvers.
