Some approach to the solution of boundary value problems for finding
functions, which are analytical in a wedge, is proposed. If the ratio of the
angle at the wedge vertex to a number \pi is rational, then the boundary value
problem is reduced to the finite system of ordinary differential equations.
Such approach, applied the problem of inertial motion of a liquid wedge, made
it possible to sum series with small denominators arising in the problem and
find four exact examples of self-similar flows with a free boundary.
