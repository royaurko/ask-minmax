Suppose $R\rightarrow S$ is a faithfully flat ring map. The theory of twisted
forms lets one compute, given an $R$-module $M$, how many isomorphism classes
of $R$-modules $M^{\prime}$ satisfy $S\otimes_R M\cong S\otimes_R M^{\prime}$.
This is really a uniqueness problem. But this theory does not help one to solve
the corresponding existence problem: given an $S$-module $N$, does there exists
{\em some} $R$-module $M$ such that $S\otimes_R M\cong N$? In this paper we
work out (as a special case of a general theorem about existence of coalgebra
structures over a comonad) a criterion for the existence of such an $R$-module
$M$, under some reasonable hypotheses on the map $R\rightarrow S$.
