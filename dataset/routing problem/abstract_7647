In this article we address the well-known cosmic coincidence problem in the
framework of the f(G) gravity. In order to achieve this, an interaction between
dark energy and dark matter is considered. A set-up is designed and a
constraint equation is obtained which generates the f(G) models that do not
suffer from the coincidence problem. Due to the absence of a universally
accepted interaction term introduced by a fundamental theory, the study is
conducted over three different forms of logically chosen interaction terms. To
illustrate the set-up three widely known models of f(G) gravity are taken into
consideration and the problem is studied under the designed set-up. The study
reveals that the popular f(G) gravity models does not approve of a satisfactory
solution of the long standing coincidence problem, thus proving to be a major
setback for them as successful models of universe. Finally, two
non-conventional models of f(G) gravity have been proposed and studied in the
framework of the designed set-up. It is seen that a complete solution of the
coincidence problem is achieved for these models. The study also reveals that
the b-interaction term is much more preferable compared to the other
interactions, due to its greater compliance with the recent observational data.
