An expression for the spin-orbit interaction coupling between different
levels, which was shown to be aberrant more than thirty years ago persists in
the literature without clear indication of what is used. It leads to
expressions quite simpler than they should be. After an attempt to warn the
community of the nuclear physicists on this strange situation
(nucl-th/0312038), the contributors of the publication in which the "aberrant"
interaction is described and used, try to justify their work (nucl-th/0401055),
by a very strange "symmetrization" of something already symmetric. They claim
also that their method allows to solve some problem related to the Pauli
principle and give some references, among which a book which reports the
solution of such problem almost forty years ago, with a very small effect. An
examination of their own results shows that their optimism is not completely
justified. Nevertheless, any user of ECIS, sensitive to their arguments, is
requested to ask their opinion to these five cocontributors before publishing.
