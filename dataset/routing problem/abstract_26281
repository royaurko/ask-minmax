RFID has been regarded as a time and money-saving solution for a wide variety
of applications, such as manufacturing, supply chain management, and inventory
control, etc. However, there are some security problems on RFID in the product
managements. The most concerned issues are the tracking and the location
privacy. Numerous scholars tried to solve these problems, but their proposals
do not include the after-sales service. In this paper, we propose a purchase
and after-sales service RFID scheme for shopping mall. The location privacy,
confidentiality, data integrity, and some security protection are hold in this
propose mechanism.
