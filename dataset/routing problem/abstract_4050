In this article we consider the initial value problem for the
Chern-Simons-Schrodinger model in two space dimensions. This is a covariant NLS
type problem which is L^2 critical. For this equation we introduce a so-called
heat gauge, and prove that, with respect to this gauge, the problem is locally
well-posed for initial data which is small in H^s, s > 0.
