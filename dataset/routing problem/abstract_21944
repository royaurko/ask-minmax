We show that 1-D rarefaction wave solutions are unique in the class of
bounded entropy solutions to the multidimensional compressible Euler system.
Such a result may be viewed as a counterpart of the recent examples of
non-uniqueness of the shock wave solutions to the Riemann problem, where
infinitely many solutions are constructed by the method of convex integration.
