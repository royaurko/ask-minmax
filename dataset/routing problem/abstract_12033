We consider the following prescribed scalar curvature problem on $ S^N$
(*)$$\left\{\begin{array}{l} - \Delta_{S^N} u + \frac{N(N-2)}{2} u = \tilde{K}
u^{\frac{N+2}{N-2}} {on} S^N, u >0 \end{array}\right. $$ where $ \tilde{K}$ is
positive and rotationally symmetric.
  We show that if $\tilde{K}$ has a local maximum point between the poles then
equation (*) has {\bf infinitely many non-radial positive} solutions, whose
energy can be made arbitrarily large.
