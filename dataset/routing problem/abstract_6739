We consider the inverse problem of the broken ray transform (sometimes also
referred to as the V-line transform). Explicit image reconstruction formulas
are derived and tested numerically. The obtained formulas are generalizations
of the filtered backprojection formula of the conventional Radon transform. The
advantages of the broken ray transform include the possibility to reconstruct
the absorption and the scattering coefficients of the medium simultaneously and
the possibility to utilize scattered radiation which, in the case of the
conventional X-ray tomography, is typically discarded.
