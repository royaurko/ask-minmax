We study three sub-problems of the N-body problem that have two degrees of
freedom, namely the n-pyramidal problem, the planar double-polygon problem, and
the spatial double-polygon problem. We prove the existence of several families
of symmetric periodic orbits, including ``Schubart-like" orbits and brake
orbits, by using topological shooting arguments.
