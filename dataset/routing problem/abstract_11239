We study the possible connection between centre vortices and P-vortices in
SU(2) gauge theory. After briefly recalling some essential properties of centre
vortices we point out that there is no known a priori connection between the
gauge dependent P-vortices and the gauge invariant centre vortices. We then
show by Monte Carlo simulations that the `centre projected physics' strongly
depends on the gauge copy from which the maximal centre gauge fixing is
started. This reveals the presence of Gribov problems, and casts some doubts on
the physical meaning of P-vortices, and should be further investigated.
