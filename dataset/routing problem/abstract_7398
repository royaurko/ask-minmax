We investigate the computational complexity of the satisfiability problem of
modal inclusion logic. We distinguish two variants of the problem: one for
strict and another one for lax semantics. The complexity of the lax version
turns out to be complete for EXPTIME, whereas with strict semantics, the
problem becomes NEXPTIME-complete.
