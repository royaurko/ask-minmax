We reinvestigate the dynamical behavior of a first order scalar nonlinear
delay differential equation with piecewise linearity and identify several
interesting features in the nature of bifurcations and chaos associated with it
as a function of the delay time and external forcing parameters. In particular,
we point out that the fixed point solution exhibits a stability island in the
two parameter space of time delay and strength of nonlinearity. Significant
role played by transients in attaining steady state solutions is pointed out.
Various routes to chaos and existence of hyperchaos even for low values of time
delay which is evidenced by multiple positive Lyapunov exponents are brought
out. The study is extended to the case of two coupled systems, one with delay
and the other one without delay.
