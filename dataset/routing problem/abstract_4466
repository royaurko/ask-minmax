Using techniques developed in [Lasserre02], we show that some minimum
cardinality problems subject to linear inequalities can be represented as
finite sequences of semidefinite programs. In particular, we provide a
semidefinite representation of the minimum rank problem on positive
semidefinite matrices. We also use this technique to cast the problem of
finding convex lower bounds on the objective as a semidefinite program.
