We propose two uniform solutions to an open question: the Firing Squad
Synchronization Problem (FSSP), for hyperdag and symmetric neural P systems,
with anonymous cells. Our solutions take e_c+5 and 6e_c+7 steps, respectively,
where e_c is the eccentricity of the commander cell of the dag or digraph
underlying these P systems. The first and fast solution is based on a novel
proposal, which dynamically extends P systems with mobile channels. The second
solution is substantially longer, but is solely based on classical rules and
static channels. In contrast to the previous solutions, which work for
tree-based P systems, our solutions synchronize to any subset of the underlying
digraph; and do not require membrane polarizations or conditional rules, but
require states, as typically used in hyperdag and neural P systems.
