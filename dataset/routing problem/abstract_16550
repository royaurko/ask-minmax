Context. The "mass discrepancy" in massive O stars represents a long-standing
problem in stellar astrophysics with far-reaching implications for the chemical
and dynamical feedback in galaxies. Aims. Our goal is to investigate this mass
discrepancy by comparing state-of-the-art model masses with model-independent
masses determined from eclipsing binaries. Methods. Using stellar evolution
models and a recent calibration of stellar parameters for O-star spectral
sub-classes, we present a convenient way to convert observed solar metallicity
O star spectral types into model masses, which we subsequently compare to our
dynamical mass compilation. We also derive similar conversions for LMC and SMC
metallcities. Results. We obtain good agreement between model and dynamical
masses, suggesting the long-standing problem of a systematic mass discrepancy
problem might have been solved. We also provide error ranges for the model
masses, as well as minimal and maximal age estimates for when the model stars
are in a given spectral type box.
