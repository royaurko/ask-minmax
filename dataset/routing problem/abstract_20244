In this overview report we generalize Erhard Heinz' curvature estimate for
minimal graphs in R^3 to graphs in R^n of prescribed mean curvature. Secondly,
we analyse these problems in the frame of the outer differential geometry which
leads us to the notions of normal torsion and normal curvature for immersions
in R^4.
