The Color-Octet Model has been used successfully to analyze many problems in
heavy quarkonium production. We examine some of the conceptual and practical
problems of the soft gluon emission process in the Color-Octet Model. We use a
potential model to describe the initial and final states in the soft gluon
emission process, as the emission occurs at a late stage after the production
of the heavy quark pair. It is found in this model that the soft gluon M1
transition, 1S0(8)->3S1(1), dominates over the E1 transition, 3PJ(8)->3S1(1),
for J/psi and psi' production. Such a dominance may help resolve the questions
of isotropic polarization and color-octet matrix element universality in the
Color-Octet Model.
