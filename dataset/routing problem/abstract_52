We consider the P2P orienteering problem on general metrics and present a
(2+{\epsilon}) approximation algorithm. In the stochastic P2P orienteering
problem we are given a metric and each node has a fixed reward and random size.
The goal is to devise a strategy for visiting the nodes so as to maximize the
expected value of the reward without violating the budget constraints. We
present an approximation algorithm for the non-adaptive variant of the P2P
Stochastic orienteering. As an implication of the approximation to the
stochastic P2P orienteering problem, we define a stochastic vehicle routing
problem with time-windows and present a constant factor approximation solution.
