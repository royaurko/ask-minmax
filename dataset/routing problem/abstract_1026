Routes to enhance superconducting instability are explored for doped Mott
insulators. With the help of insights for criticalities of metal-insulator
transitions, geometrical design of lattice structure is proposed to control the
instability. A guideline is to explicitly make flat band dispersions near the
Fermi level without suppressing two-particle channels. In a one-dimensional
model, numerical studies show that our prescription with finite-ranged hoppings
realizes large enhancement of spin-gap and pairing dominant regions. We also
propose several multi-band systems, where the pairing is driven by intersite
Coulomb repulsion.
