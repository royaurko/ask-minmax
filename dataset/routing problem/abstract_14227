The following two inversion methods for Radon-like transforms are widely used
in integral geometry and related harmonic analysis. The first method invokes
mean value operators in accordance with the classical Funk-Radon-Helgason
scheme. The second one employs integrals of the potential type and polynomials
of the Beltrami-Laplace operator. Applicability of these methods to the
horospherical transform in the hyperbolic space was an open problem. In the
present paper we solve this problem for $L^p$ functions in the maximal range of
the parameter $p$ and for compactly supported smooth functions, respectively.
The main tools are harmonic analysis in the hyperbolic space and associated
fractional integrals.
