In \cite{ds_hfs}, a geometric procedure for constructing a Nevanlinna-Pick
problem on $\D^n$ with a specified set of uniqueness was established. In this
sequel we conjecture a necessary and a sufficient condition for a
Nevanlinna-Pick problem on $\DT$ to have a unique solution. We use the results
of \cite{ds_hfs} and Bezout's theorem to establish three special cases of this
conjecture.
