For the singular saddle-point problems with nonsymmetric positive definite
$(1,1)$ block, we present a general constraint preconditioning (GCP) iteration
method based on a singular constraint preconditioner. Using the properties of
the Moore-Penrose inverse, the convergence properties of the GCP iteration
method are studied. In particular, for each of the two different choices of the
$(1,1)$ block of the singular constraint preconditioner, a detailed convergence
condition is derived by analyzing the spectrum of the iteration matrix.
Numerical experiments are used to illustrate the theoretical results and
examine the effectiveness of the GCP iteration method. Moreover, the
preconditioning effects of the singular constraint preconditioner for restarted
generalized minimum residual (GMRES) and quasi-minimal residual (QMR) methods
are also tested.
