We prove existence and uniqueness of travelling waves for a
reaction-diffusion system coupling a classical reaction-diffusion equation in a
strip with a diffusion equation on a line. To do this we use a continuation
method which leads to further insight into the system. In particular, the
transition occurs through a singular perturbation which seems new in this
context, connecting the system with a Wentzell type boundary value problem.
