Alice strings are cosmic strings that turn matter into antimatter. Although
they arise naturally in many GUT's, it has long been believed that because of
the monopole problem they can have no cosmological effects. We show this
conclusion to be false; by using the Langacker-Pi mechanism, monopoles can in
fact be annihilated while Alice strings are left intact. This opens up the
possibility that they can after all contribute to cosmology, and we mention
some particularly important examples.
