We present CLTLB(D), an extension of PLTLB (PLTL with both past and future
operators) augmented with atomic formulae built over a constraint system D.
Even for decidable constraint systems, satisfiability and Model Checking
problem of such logic can be undecidable. We introduce suitable restrictions
and assumptions that are shown to make the satisfiability problem for the
extended logic decidable. Moreover for a large class of constraint systems we
propose an encoding that realize an effective decision procedure for the
Bounded Reachability problem.
