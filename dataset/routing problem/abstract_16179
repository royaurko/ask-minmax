Based on a new approximation method, namely pseudospectral method, a solution
for the three order nonlinear ordinary differential laminar boundary layer
Falkner-Skan equation has been obtained on the semi-infinite domain. The
proposed approach is equipped by the orthogonal Hermite functions that have
perfect properties to achieve this goal. This method solves the problem on the
semi-infinite domain without truncating it to a finite domain and transforming
domain of the problem to a finite domain. In addition, this method reduces
solution of the problem to solution of a system of algebraic equations. We also
present the comparison of this work with numerical results and show that the
present method is applicable.
