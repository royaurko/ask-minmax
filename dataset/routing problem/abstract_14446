We propose a novel approach that jointly removes reflection or translucent
layer from a scene and estimates scene depth. The input data are captured via
light field imaging. The problem is couched as minimizing the rank of the
transmitted scene layer via Robust Principle Component Analysis (RPCA). We also
impose regularization based on piecewise smoothness, gradient sparsity, and
layer independence to simultaneously recover 3D geometry of the transmitted
layer. Experimental results on synthetic and real data show that our technique
is robust and reliable, and can handle a broad range of layer separation
problems.
