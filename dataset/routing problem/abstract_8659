The purpose is to study the Cauchy problem for non-linear in time and space
pseudo-differential equations. These include the fractional in time versions of
HJB equations governing the controlled scaled CTRW. As a preliminary step which
is of independent interest we analyse the corresponding linear equation proving
its well-posedness and smoothing properties.
