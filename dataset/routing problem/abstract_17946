We consider several models of nonlinear wave equations subject to very strong
damping and quasi-periodic external forcing. This is a singular perturbation,
since the damping is not the highest order term. We study the existence of
response solutions (i.e., quasi-periodic solutions with the same frequency as
the forcing). Under very general non-resonance conditions on the frequency, we
show the existence of asymptotic expansions of the response solution; moreover,
we prove that the response solution indeed exists and depends analytically on
$\varepsilon$ (where $\varepsilon$ is the inverse of the coefficient
multiplying the damping) for $\varepsilon$ in a complex domain, which in some
cases includes disks tangent to the imaginary axis at the origin. In other
models, we prove analyticity in cones of aperture $\pi/2$ and we conjecture it
is optimal. These results have consequences for the asymptotic expansions of
the response solutions considered in the literature. The proof of our results
relies on reformulating the problem as a fixed point problem, constructing an
approximate solution and studying the properties of iterations that converge to
the solutions of the fixed point problem.
