We show in a systematic and clear way how factorization methods can be used
to construct the generators for hidden and dynamical symmetries. This is shown
by studying the 2D problems of hydrogen atom, the isotropic harmonic oscillator
and the radial potential $A\rho^{2\zeta-2}-B\rho^{\zeta-2}$. We show that in
these cases the non-compact (compact) algebra corresponds to so(2,1) (su(2)).
