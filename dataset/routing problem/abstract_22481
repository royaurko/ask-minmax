We examine the possibility of the inclusion of objects having lifetimes lower
than the disk age in the database of recent determinations of the G dwarf
metallicity distribution for the solar neighbourhood. As a preliminary step,
stars with lifetimes potentially lower than the disk age are identified by
means of a relation between (b-y), or mass, and [Fe/H], from evolutionary
models of stars at the zero-age main sequence. We apply these results to the G
dwarf samples of Rocha-Pinto and Maciel (1996) and Wyse and Gilmore (1995). We
show that the majority of G dwarfs in these samples can be regarded as
long-lived objects for chemical evolution purposes, provided the disk age is
greater than 12 Gyr. We also find that the G dwarf problem is not an effect of
the metallicity dependence of the stellar lifetimes.
