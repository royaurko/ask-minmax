The Perona-Malik equation is an ill-posed forward-backward parabolic equation
with major application in image processing. In this paper we study the
Perona-Malik type equation and show that, in all dimensions, there exist
infinitely many radial weak solutions to the homogeneous Neumann boundary
problem for any smooth nonconstant radially symmetric initial data. Our
approach is to reformulate the $n$-dimensional equation into a one-dimensional
equation, to convert the one-dimensional problem into a differential inclusion
problem, and to apply a Baire's category method to generate infinitely many
solutions.
