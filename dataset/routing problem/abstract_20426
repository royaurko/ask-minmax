In this work we compare two blackbody interpretations, those of G. Kirchhoff
and M. Planck. We separate the problem of interpreting the blackbody spectrum
from that of determining the mechanical equivalent of radiation. Then we
propose that, if we set aside characterization of the blackbody,
electromagnetism suffices to analyze spectral distribution and leads to
interpreting it as determined by the receiver band-pass.
