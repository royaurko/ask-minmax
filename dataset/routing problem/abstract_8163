Since the answer to the complex Busemann-Petty problem is negative in most
dimensions, it is natural to ask what conditions on the (n-1)-dimensional
volumes of the central sections of complex convex bodies with complex
hyperplanes allow to compare the n-dimensional volumes. In this article we give
necessary conditions on the section function in order to obtain an affirmative
answer in all dimensions.
