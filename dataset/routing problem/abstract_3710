The product homomorphism problem (PHP) takes as input a finite collection of
relational structures A1, ..., An and another relational structure B, all over
the same schema, and asks whether there is a homomorphism from the direct
product A1 x ... x An to B. This problem is clearly solvable in
non-deterministic exponential time. It follows from results in [1] that the
problem is NExpTime-complete. The proof, based on a reduction from an
exponential tiling problem, uses structures of bounded domain size but with
relations of unbounded arity. In this note, we provide a self-contained proof
of NExpTime-hardness of PHP, and we show that it holds already for directed
graphs, as well as for structures of bounded arity with a bounded domain size
(but without a bound on the number of relations). We also present an
application to the CQ-definability problem (also known as the PP-definability
problem).
