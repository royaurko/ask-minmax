We consider daily rainfall observations at 32 stations in the province of
North Holland (the Netherlands) during 30 years. Let $T$ be the total rainfall
in this area on one day. An important question is: what is the amount of
rainfall $T$ that is exceeded once in 100 years? This is clearly a problem
belonging to extreme value theory. Also, it is a genuinely spatial problem.
Recently, a theory of extremes of continuous stochastic processes has been
developed. Using the ideas of that theory and much computer power
(simulations), we have been able to come up with a reasonable answer to the
question above.
