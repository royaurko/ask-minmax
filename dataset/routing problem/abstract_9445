Recently, planning based on answer set programming has been proposed as an
approach towards realizing declarative planning systems. In this paper, we
present the language Kc, which extends the declarative planning language K by
action costs. Kc provides the notion of admissible and optimal plans, which are
plans whose overall action costs are within a given limit resp. minimum over
all plans (i.e., cheapest plans). As we demonstrate, this novel language allows
for expressing some nontrivial planning tasks in a declarative way.
Furthermore, it can be utilized for representing planning problems under other
optimality criteria, such as computing ``shortest'' plans (with the least
number of steps), and refinement combinations of cheapest and fastest plans. We
study complexity aspects of the language Kc and provide a transformation to
logic programs, such that planning problems are solved via answer set
programming. Furthermore, we report experimental results on selected problems.
Our experience is encouraging that answer set planning may be a valuable
approach to expressive planning systems in which intricate planning problems
can be naturally specified and solved.
