Using a recently developed approach for solving the three dimensional Dirac
equation with spherical symmetry, we obtain the two-point Green's function of
the relativistic Dirac-Morse problem. This is accomplished by setting up the
relativistic problem in such a way that makes comparison with the
nonrelativistic problem highly transparent and results in a mapping of the
latter into the former. The relativistic bound states energy spectrum is easily
obtained by locating the energy poles of the Green's function components in a
simple and straightforward manner.
