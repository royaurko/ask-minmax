We consider a spinorial Yamabe-type problem on open manifolds of bounded
geometry. The aim is to study the existence of solutions to the associated
Euler-Lagrange-equation. We show that under suitable assumptions such a
solution exists. As an application, we prove that existence of a solution
implies the conformal Hijazi inequality for the underlying spin manifold.
