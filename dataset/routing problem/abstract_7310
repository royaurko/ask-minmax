The trajectories of the $\mathrm{O}(1)$-Kepler problem at level $n\ge 2$ are
completely determined. It is found in particular that a non-colliding
trajectory is an ellipse, a parabola or a branch of hyperbola according as the
total energy is negative, zero or positive. Moreover, it is shown that the
group $\mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbb R)/\mathrm{O}(1)$ acts transitively on both the
set of oriented elliptic trajectories and the set of oriented parabolic
trajectories. The method employed here is similar to the one used by
Levi-Civita in the study of planar Kepler problem in 1920.
