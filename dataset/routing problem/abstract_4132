Motivated by some problems in genome assembling, we investigate properties of
spacings from absolutely continuous distributions. Several results on the
asymptotic behavior of the maximal uniform and non-uniform $k$-spacings are
presented. Applications of these results to the coverage problem for the
prediction stage in genome assembling are also provided.
