We report on the superconducting performance of the ex-situ SiC doped MgB2
monofilamentary tapes. Polycrystalline powders of MgB2 doped with 5 and 10 wt%
SiC were synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction route and
characterized for their superconducting performance. It is found that
superconducting parameters i.e. upper critical field (Hc2), irreversibility
field (Hirr) and critical current density (Jc) are all improved significantly
with SiC addition. Also it was found that relatively lower synthesis
temperature (700 C) resulted in further improved superconducting parameters. As
synthesized powders are used for ex-situ powder-in-tube (PIT) monofilamentary
tapes and superconducting parameters are determined. Albeit the superconducting
transition temperature (Tc) is decreased slightly (2K) for SiC doped tapes, the
superconducting performance in terms of critical current density (Jc), being
determined from both magnetization and transport measurements, is improved
significantly. In particular the SiC doped and 700 {\deg}C synthesized MgB2
tapes exhibited the transport Jc of nearly 10^4 A/cm2 under applied fields of
as high as 7 Tesla. Further it is found that the Jc anisotropy decreases
significantly for SiC doped tapes. Disorder due to substitution of C at B site
being created from broken SiC and the presence of nano SiC respectively in SiC
added ex-situ MgB2 tapes are responsible for decreased anisotropy and improved
Jc(H) performance.
