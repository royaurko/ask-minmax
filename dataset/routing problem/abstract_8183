In this expository article we first give an overview on multiplier ideal
sheaves and geometric problems in K\"ahlerian and Sasakian geometries. Then we
review our recent results on the relationship between the support of the
subschemes cut out by multiplier ideal sheaves and the invariant whose
non-vanishing obstructs the existence of K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on Fano
manifolds.
