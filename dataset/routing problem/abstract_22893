The tandem mass spectrometry fragments a large number of molecules of the
same peptide sequence into charged prefix and suffix subsequences, and then
measures mass/charge ratios of these ions. The de novo peptide sequencing
problem is to reconstruct the peptide sequence from a given tandem mass
spectral data of k ions. By implicitly transforming the spectral data into an
NC-spectrum graph G=(V,E) where |V|=2k+2, we can solve this problem in
O(|V|+|E|) time and O(|V|) space using dynamic programming. Our approach can be
further used to discover a modified amino acid in O(|V||E|) time and to analyze
data with other types of noise in O(|V||E|) time. Our algorithms have been
implemented and tested on actual experimental data.
