The overview of the Exact Pairing technique based on the quasispin symmetry
is presented. Extensions of this method are discussed in relation to mean
field, quadrupole collectivity, electromagnetic transitions, and many-body
level density. Realistic calculations compared with experimental data are used
to support the methods as well as to emphasize the manifestations of pairing
correlations in nuclear many-body systems.
