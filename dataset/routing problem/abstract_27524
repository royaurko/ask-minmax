This paper derives a finite-strain plate theory consistent with the principle
of stationary three-dimensional (3-D) potential energy under general loadings
with a third-order error. Staring from the 3-D nonlinear elasticity (with both
geometrical and material nonlinearity) and by a series expansion, we deduce a
vector plate equation with three unknowns, which exhibits the local
force-balance structure. The success relies on using the 3-D field equations
and bottom traction condition to derive exact recursion relations for the
coefficients. Associated weak formulations are considered, leading to a 2-D
virtual work principle. An alternative approach based on a 2-D truncated energy
is also provided, which is less consistent than the first plate theory but has
the advantage of the existence of a 2-D energy function. As an example, we
consider the pure bending problem of a hyperelastic block. The comparison
between the analytical plate solution and available exact one shows that the
plate theory gives second-order correct results. Comparing with existing plate
theories, it appears that the present one has a number of advantages, including
the consistency, order of correctness, generality of the loadings,
applicability to finite-strain problems and no involvement of unphysical
quantities.
