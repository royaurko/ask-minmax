The problem on the asymptotics for the solution of multidimensional nonlinear
Boussinesq equation with respect to a small parameter $\ve$ is considered. The
asymptotic expansion of the solution of this problem with respect to $\ve\to0$
for long times $t\sim {\cal O}(\ve^{-2})$ is constructed and justified. The
leading terms of the asymptotic solution are defined from the multidimensional
nonlinear Schrodinger equation and from the linear homogeneous wave equation.
