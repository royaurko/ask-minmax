{We show that the free energy of the three-state
 $\tau_2(t_q)$ model can be expressed as products of Jacobi elliptic functions,
the arguments being those of an hyperelliptic parametrization of the associated
chiral Potts model. This is the first application of such a parametrization to
the $N$-state chiral
 Potts free energy problem for $N > 2$.
