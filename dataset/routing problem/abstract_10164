We consider approximating a measure by a parameterized curve subject to
length penalization. That is for a given finite positive compactly supported
measure $\mu$, for $p \geq 1$ and $\lambda>0$ we consider the functional \[
E(\gamma) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} d(x, \Gamma_\gamma)^p d\mu(x) + \lambda
\,\textrm{Length}(\gamma) \] where $\gamma:I \to \mathbb{R}^d$, $I$ is an
interval in $\mathbb{R}$, $\Gamma_\gamma = \gamma(I)$, and $d(x,
\Gamma_\gamma)$ is the distance of $x$ to $\Gamma_\gamma$.
  The problem is closely related to the average-distance problem, where the
admissible class are the connected sets of finite Hausdorff measure $\mathcal
H^1$, and to (regularized) principal curves studied in statistics. We obtain
regularity of minimizers in the form of estimates on the total curvature of the
minimizers. We prove that for measures $\mu$ supported in two dimensions the
minimizing curve is injective if $p \geq 2$ or if $\mu$ has bounded density.
This establishes that the minimization over parameterized curves is equivalent
to minimizing over embedded curves and thus confirms that the problem has a
geometric interpretation.
