We consider the eigenvalue problem for the {\it fractional $p-$Laplacian} in
an open bounded, possibly disconnected set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, under
homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. After discussing some regularity
issues for eigenfuctions, we show that the second eigenvalue
$\lambda_2(\Omega)$ is well-defined, and we characterize it by means of several
equivalent variational formulations. In particular, we extend the mountain pass
characterization of Cuesta, De Figueiredo and Gossez to the nonlocal and
nonlinear setting. Finally, we consider the minimization problem \[ \inf
\{\lambda_2(\Omega)\,:\,|\Omega|=c\}. \] We prove that, differently from the
local case, an optimal shape does not exist, even among disconnected sets. A
minimizing sequence is given by the union of two disjoint balls of volume $c/2$
whose mutual distance tends to infinity.
