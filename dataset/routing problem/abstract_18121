One of the major challenges of contemporarymathematics is numerical solving
of various problems for functional differential equations (FDE), in particular
Cauchy problem for delayed and neutral differential equations. Recently large
variety of methods to handle this task appeared. However, many recent papers
contain ambiguities or mistakes in either posing Cauchy problem for FDEs or in
method of solving it. To rectify this situation, we propose a correct and
efficient semi-analytical approach for FDEs based on Taylor method in this
paper. The idea is to combine the method of steps and differential
transformation method (DTM). In the latter, formulas for proportional arguments
and nonlinear terms are used. Validity and efficiency of the presented
algorithm is demonstrated by examples on wide classes of FDEs with multiple
constant, time-dependent and/or proportional delays including FDE of neutral
type.
