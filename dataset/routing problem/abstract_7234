We study the eigenvalue problem for the Dirichlet Laplacian in bounded simply
connected plane domains $\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}$ using conformal
transformations of the original problem to the weighted eigenvalue problem for
the Dirichlet Laplacian in the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$. This allows us to
estimate the variation of the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian upon
domain perturbation via energy type integrals for a large class of "conformal
regular" domains which includes all quasidiscs, i.e. images of the unit disc
under quasiconformal homeomorphisms of the plane onto itself. Boundaries of
such domains can have any Hausdorff dimension between one and two.
