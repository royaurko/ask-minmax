Chemo-dynamical models have been introduced in the late eighties and are a
generally accepted tool for understanding galaxy evolution. They have been
successfully applied to one-dimensional problems, e.g. the evolution of
non-rotating galaxies, and two-dimensional problems, e.g. the evolution of disk
galaxies. Recently, also three-dimensional chemo-dynamical models have become
available. In these models the dynamics of different components, i.e. dark
matter, stars and a multi-phase interstellar medium, are treated in a
self-consistent way and several processes allow for an exchange of matter,
energy and momentum between the components or different gas phases. Some
results of chemo-dynamical models and their comparison with observations of
chemical abundances or star formation histories will be reviewed.
