In this paper, we study the decomposition of Nehari manifold for the
Br\'ezis-Nirenberg problem with nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions.
By using this result, the Lusternik-Schnirelman category and the minimax
principle, we establish a multiple result (four solutions) for the
Br\'ezis{Nirenberg problem with nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions.
