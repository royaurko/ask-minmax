We prepared Li0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 ferrite through chemical reaction in highly
acidic solution and subsequent sintering of chemical routed powder at
temperatures > 800 0C. Surface morphology showed plastoferrite character for
sintering temperature > 1000 0C. Mechanical softening of metal-oxygen bonds at
higher measurement temperatures stimulated delocalization of charge carriers,
which were strongly localized in A and B sites of the spinel structure at lower
temperatures. The charge delocalization process has activated semiconductor to
metallic transition in ac conductivity curves, obeyed by Jonscher power law and
Drude equation, respectively. Metallic state is also confirmed by the frequency
dependence of dielectric constant curves.
