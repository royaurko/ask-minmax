We introduce the graph parameter boolean-width, related to the number of
different unions of neighborhoods across a cut of a graph. Boolean-width is
similar to rank-width, which is related to the number of $GF[2]$-sums (1+1=0)
of neighborhoods instead of the boolean-sums (1+1=1) used for boolean-width. We
give algorithms for a large class of NP-hard vertex subset and vertex
partitioning problems that are FPT when parameterized by either boolean-width,
rank-width or clique-width, with runtime single exponential in either parameter
if given the pertinent optimal decomposition. To compare boolean-width versus
rank-width or clique-width, we first show that for any graph, the square root
of its boolean-width is never more than its rank-width. Next, we exhibit a
class of graphs, the Hsu-grids, for which we can solve NP-hard problems in
polynomial time, if we use the right parameter. An $n \times \frac{n}{10}$
Hsu-grid on ${1/10}n^2$ vertices has boolean-width $\Theta(\log n)$ and
rank-width $\Theta(n)$. Moreover, any optimal rank-decomposition of such a
graph will have boolean-width $\Theta(n)$, i.e. exponential in the optimal
boolean-width. A main open problem is to approximate the boolean-width better
than what is given by the algorithm for rank-width [Hlin\v{e}n\'y and Oum,
