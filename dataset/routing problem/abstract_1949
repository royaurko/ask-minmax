A large area plastic scintillator detector array(~ 1 m x1m) has been set up
for fast neutron spectroscopy at the BARC-TIFR Pelletron laboratory, Mumbai.
The energy, time and position response has been measured for electrons using
radioactive sources and for mono-energetic neutrons using the
7Li(p,n1)7Be*(0.429 MeV) reaction at proton energies between 6.3 and 19 MeV. A
Monte Carlo simulation of the energy dependent efficiency of the array for
neutron detection is in agreement with the 7Li(p,n1) measurements. The array
has been used to measure the neutron spectrum, in the energy range of 4-12 MeV,
in the reaction 12C+ 93Nb at E(12C)= 40 MeV. This is in reasonable agreement
with a statistical model calculation.
