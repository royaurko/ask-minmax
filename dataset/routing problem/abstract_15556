We study localization and delocalization in a class of non-hermitean
Hamiltonians inspired by the problem of vortex pinning in superconductors. In
various simplified models we are able to obtain analytic descriptions, in
particular of the non-perturbative emergence of a forked structure (the
appearance of "wings") in the density of states. We calculate how the
localization length diverges at the localization-delocalization transition. We
map some versions of this problem onto a random walker problem in two
dimensions. For a certain model, we find an intricate structure in its density
of states.
