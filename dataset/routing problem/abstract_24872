Classifying all Hopf algebras of a given finite dimension over the complex
numbers is a challenging problem which remains open even for many small
dimensions, not least because few general approaches to the problem are known.
  Some useful techniques include counting the dimensions of spaces related to
the coradical filtration, studying sub- and quotient Hopf algebras, especially
those sub-Hopf algebras generated by a simple subcoalgebra, working with the
antipode, and studying Hopf algebras in Yetter-Drinfeld categories to help to
classify Radford biproducts. In this paper, we add to the classification tools
in our previous work [arXiv:1108.6037v1] and apply our results to Hopf algebras
of dimension rpq and 8p where p,q,r are distinct primes.
  At the end of this paper we summarize in a table the status of the
classification for dimensions up to 100 to date.
