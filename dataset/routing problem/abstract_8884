We consider the 3-body problem of celestial mechanics in Euclidean, elliptic,
and hyperbolic spaces, and study how the Lagrangian (equilateral) relative
equilibria bifurcate when the Gaussian curvature varies. We thus prove the
existence of new classes of orbits. In particular, we find some families of
isosceles triangles, which occur in elliptic space.
