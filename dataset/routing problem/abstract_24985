We construct an extension $E(A,G)$ of a given group $G$ by infinite
non-Archimedean words over an discretely ordered abelian group like $Z^n$. This
yields an effective and uniform method to study various groups that "behave
like $G$". We show that the Word Problem for f.g. subgroups in the extension is
decidable if and only if and only if the Cyclic Membership Problem in $G$ is
decidable.
  The present paper embeds the partial monoid of infinite words as defined by
Myasnikov, Remeslennikov, and Serbin (Contemp. Math., Amer. Math. Soc.,
378:37-77, 2005) into $E(A,G)$. Moreover, we define the extension group
$E(A,G)$ for arbitrary groups $G$ and not only for free groups as done in
previous work. We show some structural results about the group (existence and
type of torsion elements, generation by elements of order 2) and we show that
some interesting HNN extensions of $G$ embed naturally in the larger group
$E(A,G)$.
