We report on the thickness dependence of the superconducting characteristics
including critical current Ic, critical current density Jc, transition
temperature Tc, irreversibility field Hirr, bulk pinning force plot Fp(H), and
the normal state resistivity curve measured after successive ion milling of ~ 1
um thick high Ic YBa2Cu3O7-x films made by an ex situ metal-organic deposition
process on Ni-W rolling-assisted biaxially textured substrates (RABiTS).
Contrary to many recent data, mostly on in situ pulsed laser deposition (PLD)
films, which show strong depression of Jc with increasing film thickness t, our
films exhibit only a weak dependence of Jc on t. The two better textured
samples had full cross-section average Jc,avg(77K,0T) ~ 4 MA/cm2 near the
buffer layer interface and ~3 MA/cm2 at full thickness, despite significant
current blocking due to ~30% porosity in the film. Taking account of the
thickness dependence of the porosity, we estimate that the local,
vortex-pinning current density is essentially independent of thickness, while
accounting for the additional current-blocking effects of grain boundaries
leads to local, vortex-pinning Jc values well above 5 MA/cm2. Such high local
Jc values are produced by strong three-dimensional vortex pinning which
subdivides vortex lines into weakly coupled segments much shorter than the film
thickness.
