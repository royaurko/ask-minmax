We study the generalised Bunce-Deddens algebras and their Toeplitz extensions
constructed by Kribs and Solel from a directed graph and a sequence $\omega$ of
positive integers. We describe both of these $C^*$-algebras in terms of novel
universal properties, and prove uniqueness theorems for them; if $\omega$
determines an infinite supernatural number, then no aperiodicity hypothesis is
needed in our uniqueness theorem for the generalised Bunce-Deddens algebra. We
calculate the KMS states for the gauge action in the Toeplitz algebra when the
underlying graph is finite. We deduce that the generalised Bunce-Deddens
algebra is simple if and only if it supports exactly one KMS state, and this is
equivalent to the terms in the sequence $\omega$ all being coprime with the
period of the underlying graph.
