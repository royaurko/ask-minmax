The Dubins interval problem aims to find the shortest path of bounded
curvature between two targets such that the departure angle from the first
target and the arrival angle at the second target are constrained to two
respective intervals. We propose a new and a simple algorithm to this problem
based on the minimum principle of Pontryagin.
