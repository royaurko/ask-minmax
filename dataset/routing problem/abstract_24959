We present an improved method to calculate defect formation energies that
overcomes the band-gap problem of Kohn-Sham density-functional theory (DFT) and
reduces the self-interaction error of the local-density approximation (LDA) to
DFT. We demonstrate for the silicon self-interstitial that combining LDA with
quasiparticle energy calculations in the G0W0 approach increases the defect
formation energy of the neutral charge state by ~1.1 eV, which is in good
agreement with diffusion Monte Carlo calculations (E. R. Batista et al. Phys.
Rev. B 74, 121102(R) (2006), W.-K. Leung et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 2351
(1999)). Moreover, the G0W0-corrected charge transition levels agree well with
recent measurements.
