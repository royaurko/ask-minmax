We present a simple solution to the little hierarchy problem in the MSSM: a
vector-like fourth generation. With O(1) Yukawa couplings for the new quarks,
the Higgs mass can naturally be above 114 GeV. Unlike a chiral fourth
generation, a vector-like generation can solve the little hierarchy problem
while remaining consistent with precision electroweak and direct production
constraints, and maintaining the success of the grand unified framework. The
new quarks are predicted to lie between ~ 300 - 600 GeV and will thus be
discovered or ruled out at the LHC. This scenario suggests exploration of
several novel collider signatures.
