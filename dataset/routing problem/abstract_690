Density-functional theory based global geometry optimization is used to
scrutinize the possibility of endohedral doping of hydrogenated Si fullerenes
as a route to Si nanostructures with high magnetic moments. In contrast to
previous suggestions, our unbiased sampling finds the smallest Si16H16
endohedral cage generally too small to encapsulate 3d metal dopant atoms. For
the next larger fullerene-like cage though, we identify perfectly symmetric
MSi20H20 (M = Co, Ti, V, Cr) cage structures as ground states. These structures
conserve the high spin moment of the dopant atom and therewith underscore the
potential of this Si nanoform for novel cluster-based materials with unique
magnetic properties.
