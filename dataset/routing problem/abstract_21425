Let two concentric circles $k$ and $K$ be given on the plane with radii $r$
and $R$, $r<R$. Assume that the disc bounded by $k$ is covered by angular
domains whose vertices are within $K$. Then the sum of the angles of these
angular domains is greater than or equal to the view angle of $k$ from an
arbitrary point of $K$.
