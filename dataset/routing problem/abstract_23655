We investigate numerically a models of the static spherically symmetric
boson-fermion stars in scalar-tensor theory of gravity with massive dilaton
field. The proper mathematical model of such stars is interpreted as a
nonlinear two-parametric eigenvalue problem with unknown internal boundary. We
employ the Continuous Analogue of Newton Method (CANM) which leads on each
iteration to two separate linear boundary value problems with different
dimensions inside and outside the star, respectively. Along with them a
nonlinear algebraic system for the spectral parameters - radius of the star
$R_{s}$ and quantity $\Omega $ is solved also.
  In this way we obtain the behaviour of the basic geometric quantities and
functions describing dilaton field and matter fields which build the star.
