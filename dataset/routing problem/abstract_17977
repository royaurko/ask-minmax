We address the max-min fairness design problem for a MU-MISO system with
partial Channel State Information (CSI) at the Base Station (BS), consisting of
an imperfect channel estimate and statistical knowledge of the estimation
error, and perfect CSI at the receivers. The objective is to maximize the
minimum Average Rate (AR) among users subject to a transmit power constraint.
An unconventional transmission scheme is adopted where the Base Station (BS)
transmits a common message in addition to the conventional private messages. In
situations where the CSIT is not accurate enough to perform interference
nulling, individual rates are assisted by allocating parts of the common
message to different users according to their needs. The AR problem is
transformed into an augmented Average Weighted Mean Square Error (AWMSE)
problem, solved using Alternating Optimization (AO). The benefits of
incorporating the common message are demonstrated through simulations.
