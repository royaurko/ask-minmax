If black hole complementarity is the correct idea to resolve the information
loss problem, it should apply to general black holes. We suggest two models:
Frolov, Markov, and Mukhanov's regular black hole and a charged black hole.
These models can work as counterexamples to black hole complementarity. It has
been mentioned that a large number of massless fields is an important condition
to justify these models. The invalidity of this principle may imply that the
holographic principle must be re-interpreted; the information loss problem, as
well, should be re-considered.
