We compute exactly the asymptotic distribution of scaled height in a
(1+1)--dimensional anisotropic ballistic deposition model by mapping it to the
Ulam problem of finding the longest nondecreasing subsequence in a random
sequence of integers. Using the known results for the Ulam problem, we show
that the scaled height in our model has the Tracy-Widom distribution appearing
in the theory of random matrices near the edges of the spectrum. Our result
supports the hypothesis that various growth models in $(1+1)$ dimensions that
belong to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class perhaps all share the same
universal Tracy-Widom distribution for the suitably scaled height variables.
