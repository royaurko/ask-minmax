The structure of the reconstruction algorithm OPED permits a natural way to
generate additional data, while still preserving the essential feature of the
algorithm. This provides a method for image reconstruction for limited angel
problems. In stead of completing the set of data, the set of discrete sine
transforms of the data is completed. This is achieved by solving systems of
linear equations that have, upon choosing appropriate parameters, positive
definite coefficient matrices. Numerical examples are presented.
