The aim of this paper is to give an existence result for a class of
one-dimensional, non-convex, non-coercive problems in the Calculus of
Variations. The main tools for the proof are an existence theorem in the convex
case and the closure of the convex hull of the epigraph of functions strictly
convex at infinity.
