An inverse boundary value problem for the Helmholtz equation in a bounded
domain is considered. The problem is to extract information about an unknown
obstacle embedded in the domain with unknown impedance boundary condition (the
Robin condition) from the associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. The main result
is a characterization of the unknown obstacle via the sequences that are
constructed by the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, under smallness conditions on the
wave number and the upper bound of the impedance. Moreover two alternative
simple proofs of a previous result of Cheng-Liu-Nakamura which are based on
only some energy estimates, an analysis of the blowup of the energy of
so-called reflected solutions and an application of the enclosure method to the
problem are also given.
