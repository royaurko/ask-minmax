Over the last nine years of cosmic microwave background observations, the
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ($WMAP$) results were consistent with a
$\Lambda$CDM cosmological model in which the age of the Universe is one Hubble
time, and the time-averaged value of the deceleration parameter is consistent
with zero. This curious observation has been put forward as a new coincidence
problem for the $\Lambda$CDM concordance cosmology, which is in fact a
`greater' coincidence than the near equality of the density parameters of
matter and the cosmological constant. At the moment of writing these conference
proceedings, the Planck Collaboration has released its first cosmological data,
which revealed a small shift in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters when
compared to $WMAP$. We show that under the assumption of a spatially flat
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology, Planck's results remove this coincidence problem for
$\Lambda$CDM at greater than 99\% confidence level.
