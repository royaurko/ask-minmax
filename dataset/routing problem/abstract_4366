The problem of inferring the outcome of a simultaneous measurement of two
non-commuting observables is addressed. We show that for certain pairs with
dense spectra, precise inferences of the measurement outcomes are possible in
pre-and post-selected ensembles, and if the selections involve entangled states
with some other system. We show that the problem is related to the problem of
assigning weak values to a continuous family of operators, and give explicit
examples where this problem is solvable. Some foundational implications are
briefly discussed.
