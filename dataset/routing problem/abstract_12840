We consider a nonlinear heat equation with a gradient term. We construct a
blow-up solution for this equation with a prescribed blow-up profile. For that,
we translate the question in selfsimilar variables and reduce the problem to a
finite dimensional one. We then solve the finite dimensional problem using
index theory. The interpretation of the finite dimensional parameters allows us
to derive the stability of the constructed solution with respect to initial
data.
