In 2002 C. Berg, Y. Chen, and M. Ismail found a nice relation between the
determinancy of the Hamburger moment problem and asymptotic behavior of the
smallest eigenvalues of the corresponding Hankel matrices. We investigate
whether an analog of this statement holds for the Nevanlinna--Pick
interpolation problem.
