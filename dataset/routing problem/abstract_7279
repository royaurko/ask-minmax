We consider the Steklov eigenvalues of the Laplace operator as limiting
Neumann eigenvalues in a problem of boundary mass concentration. We discuss the
asymptotic behavior of the Neumann eigenvalues in a ball and we deduce that the
Steklov eigenvalues minimize the Neumann eigenvalues. Moreover, we study the
dependence of the eigenvalues of the Steklov problem upon perturbation of the
mass density and show that the Steklov eigenvalues violates a maximum principle
in spectral optimization problems.
