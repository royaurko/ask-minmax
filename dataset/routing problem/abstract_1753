P2P systems have grown dramatically in recent years. The most popular type of
P2P systems are file sharing networks, which are used to share various types of
content over the Internet. Due to the increase in popularity of P2P systems,
the network performance of these systems has become a very important issue in
the design and realization of these networks. Hence, the performance of the P2P
has been improved. This paper will suggest the following methods for the
improvement of the P2P systems: Method-1: Improve the P2P routing by using a
sandwich technique. Method-2: Improve the search performance by introducing a
new search based on the super peer. Method-3: Improving the search by
introducing a ranking algorithm based on the knowledge database. The system
demonstrates that the methods introduced here have the improved efficiency
compared to the previous methodologies. So, the results show that the
performance of the P2P systems have been improved by using the above methods,
hence the traffic can be reduced.
