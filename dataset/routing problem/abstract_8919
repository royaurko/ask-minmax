The problem of the one-exciton absorption spectrum is considered for the
lattice of two-level interacting atoms whose initial energy splitting depends
on the coordinate. It is shown that for some types of interatomic interaction,
this problem can be reduced to a differential equation of Schrodinger type,
which, in some cases, can be solved in closed form. By way of example, problems
on the one dimensional chain having an initial splitting jump and on the
spherical cluster are solved. In both cases analitical solutions are obtained,
which considerably reduce the time required for calculations of one-dimensional
systems and permit the calculation of three-dimensional spherical clusters,
whereas the numerical calculation becomes impossible for the clusters with a
radius larger than ten lattice constants. The spectra calculated for small
systems completely coincide with the spectra obtained by means of numerical
diagonalization. The proposed method may appear to be convinient for solving
problems related to Frenkel excitons in systems having no translation symmetry
(disordered systems).
