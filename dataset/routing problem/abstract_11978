New nanotechnology based devices are replacing CMOS devices to overcome CMOS
technology's scaling limitations. However, many such devices exhibit
non-monotonic I-V characteristics and uncertain properties which lead to the
negative differential resistance (NDR) problem and the chaotic performance.
This paper proposes a new circuit simulation approach that can effectively
simulate nanotechnology devices with uncertain input sources and negative
differential resistance (NDR) problem. The experimental results show a 20-30
times speedup comparing with existing simulators.
