Given a planar point set and an integer $k$, we wish to color the points with
$k$ colors so that any axis-aligned strip containing enough points contains all
colors. The goal is to bound the necessary size of such a strip, as a function
of $k$. We show that if the strip size is at least $2k{-}1$, such a coloring
can always be found. We prove that the size of the strip is also bounded in any
fixed number of dimensions. In contrast to the planar case, we show that
deciding whether a 3D point set can be 2-colored so that any strip containing
at least three points contains both colors is NP-complete.
  We also consider the problem of coloring a given set of axis-aligned strips,
so that any sufficiently covered point in the plane is covered by $k$ colors.
We show that in $d$ dimensions the required coverage is at most $d(k{-}1)+1$.
  Lower bounds are given for the two problems. This complements recent
impossibility results on decomposition of strip coverings with arbitrary
orientations. Finally, we study a variant where strips are replaced by wedges.
