We study a moving boundary problem modeling an injected fluid into another
viscous fluid. The viscous fluid is withdrawn at infinity and governed by
Darcy's law. We present solutions to the free boundary problem in terms of
time-derivative of a generalized Newtonian potentials of the characteristic
function of the bubble. This enables us to show that the bubble occupies the
entire space as the time tends to infinity if and only if the internal
generalized Newtonian potential of the initial bubble is a quadratic
polynomial.
