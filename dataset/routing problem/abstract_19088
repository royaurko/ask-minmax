We consider low connectivity variants of the Survivable Network with Minimum
Number of Steiner Points (SN-MSP) problem: given a finite set $R$ of terminals
in a metric space (M,d), a subset $B \subseteq R$ of "unstable" terminals, and
connectivity requirements {r_{uv}: u,v \in R}, find a minimum size set $S
\subseteq M$ of additional points such that the unit-disc graph of $R \cup S$
contains $r_{uv}$ pairwise internally edge-disjoint and $(B \cup S)$-disjoint
$uv$-paths for all $u,v \in R$. The case when $r_{uv}=1$ for all $u,v \in R$ is
the {\sf Steiner Tree with Minimum Number of Steiner Points} (ST-MSP) problem,
and the case $r_{uv} \in \{0,1\}$ is the {\sf Steiner Forest with Minimum
Number of Steiner Points} (SF-MSP) problem. Let $\Delta$ be the maximum number
of points in a unit ball such that the distance between any two of them is
larger than 1. It is known that $\Delta=5$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ The previous known
approximation ratio for {\sf ST-MSP} was $\lfloor (\Delta+1)/2
\rfloor+1+\epsilon$ in an arbitrary normed space \cite{NY}, and $2.5+\epsilon$
in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^2$ \cite{cheng2008relay}. Our approximation
ratio for ST-MSP is $1+\ln(\Delta-1)+\epsilon$ in an arbitrary normed space,
which in $\mathbb{R}^2$ reduces to $1+\ln 4+\epsilon < 2.3863 +\epsilon$. For
SN-MSP with $r_{uv} \in \{0,1,2\}$, we give a simple $\Delta$-approximation
algorithm. In particular, for SF-MSP, this improves the previous ratio
$2\Delta$.
