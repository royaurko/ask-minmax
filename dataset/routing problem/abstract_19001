We discovered a class of self-similar solutions in nonlinear models
describing the formation of morphogen gradients, the concentration fields of
molecules acting as spatial regulators of cell differention in developing
tissues. These models account for diffusion and self-induced degration of
locally produced chemical signals. When production starts, the signal
concentration is equal to zero throughout the system. We found that in the
limit of infinitely large signal production strength the solution of this
problem is given by the product of the steady state concentration profile and a
function of the diffusion similarity variable. We derived a nonlinear boundary
value problem satisfied by this function and used a variational approach to
prove that this problem has a unique solution in a natural setting. Using the
asymptotic behavior of the solutions established by the analysis, we
constructed these solutions numerically by the shooting method. Finally, we
demonstrated that the obtained solutions may be easily approximated by simple
analytical expressions, thus providing an accurate global characterization of
the dynamics in an important class of non-linear models of morphogen gradient
formation. Our results illustrate the power of analytical approaches to
studying nonlinear models of biophysical processes.
