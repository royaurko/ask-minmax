A symmetric tensor, which has a symmetric nonnegative decomposition, is
called a completely positive tensor. We consider the completely positive tensor
decomposition problem. A semidefinite algorithm is presented for checking
whether a symmetric tensor is completely positive. If it is not completely
positive, a certificate for it can be obtained; if it is completely positive, a
nonnegative decomposition can be obtained.
