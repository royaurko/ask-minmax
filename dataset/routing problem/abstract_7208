In this paper, we consider a problem for the first order Dirac differential
equations system with spectral parameter dependent in boundary condition. The
asymptotic behaviors of eigenvalues, eigenfunctions and normalizing numbers of
this system are investigated. The expansion formula with respect to
eigenfunctions is obtained and Parseval equality is given. The main theorem on
necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvabilty of inverse problem is
proved and the algorithm of reconstruction of potential from spectral data (the
sets of eigenvalues and normalizing numbers) is given.
