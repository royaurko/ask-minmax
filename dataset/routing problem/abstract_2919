We consider heuristic algorithm for solving graph isomorphism problem. The
algorithm based on a successive splitting of the eigenvalues of the matrices
which are modifications (to positive defined) of graphs' adjacency matrices.
Modification of the algorithm allows to find a solution for Frobenius problem.
Formulation of the Frobenius problem is following one. Given a pair of two
matrices with the same number of rows and columns. We must find out whether one
of the matrix can be acquired from another by permutation of it's rows and
strings or not. For example, solution of Frobenius problem can give to us
efficient way for decrypting of double permutation cyphers problem for high
dimension matrices.
