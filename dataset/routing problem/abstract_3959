Waring problem for homogeneus forms asks for additive decomposition of a form
$f$ into powers of linear forms. A classical problem is to determine when such
a decomposition is unique. In this note I refine the work in
arXiv:math/0406288v1 and answer this question under a divisibility assumption.
To do this I translate the algebraic statement into a geometric one concerning
the base loci of linear systems of $P^n$ with assigned singularities.
