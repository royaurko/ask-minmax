In the present work, we study the classical behavior of an electric dipole in
presence of an external uniform magnetic field. We derive equations and
constants of motion from the Lagrangian formulation. We obtain an infinitely
periodic effective potential that describes a rotational motion. The problem is
not directly separable in relative and center of mass variables; even though,
we are able to write the energy of the system as a function of an only term,
the relative variable. We define another constant of motion, which couples the
relative with the center of mass variables. We describe conditions for bound
states of the dipole. In addition, we discuss the problem in the approximation
of small oscillations. Finally, we explore the existence of a possible family
of trapped states in a region of the space where there are no classical turning
points.
