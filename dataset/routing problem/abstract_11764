We consider the generalized St\"ormer Problem that includes the
electromagnetic and gravitational forces on a charged dust grain near a planet.
For dust grains a typical charge to mass ratio is such that neither force can
be neglected. Including the gravitational force gives rise to stable circular
orbits that encircle that plane entirely above/below the equatorial plane. The
effects of the different forces are discussed in detail. A modified 3rd
Kepler's law is found and analyzed for dust grains.
