Recurrence plots and recurrence quantification analysis have become popular
in the last two decades. Recurrence based methods have on the one hand a deep
foundation in the theory of dynamical systems and are on the other hand
powerful tools for the investigation of a variety of problems. The increasing
interest encompasses the growing risk of misuse and uncritical application of
these methods. Therefore, we point out potential problems and pitfalls related
to different aspects of the application of recurrence plots and recurrence
quantification analysis.
