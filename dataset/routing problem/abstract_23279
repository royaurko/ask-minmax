The see-saw mechanism for neutrino masses based on the Grand Unification
leads to the mass of the heaviest neutrino ($\approx \nu_{\tau}$) in the range
$(2 - 3)\cdot 10^{-3}$ eV and hence to a solution of the solar neutrino problem
through the $\nu_e-\nu_\t$ conversion. We suggest the existence of a light
singlet fermion $S$ which mixes predominantly with muon neutrino through the
mixing mass $m_{\mu s} \sim O(1)$ eV. The introduction of such a singlet allows
one (i) to solve the atmospheric neutrino problem via the $\nu_{\mu}
\leftrightarrow S$ oscillations, (ii) to explain the LSND result and (iii) to
get two component hot dark matter in the Universe. The phenomenology of this
scenario is considered and the origin of the singlet as well as of the scale
$m_{\m s}$ is discussed.
