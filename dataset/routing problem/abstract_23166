The principal goal of the \emph{LISA Science Analysis Workshop} is to
encourage the development and maturation of science analysis technology in
preparation for LISA science operations. Exactly because LISA is a pathfinder
for a new scientific discipline -- gravitational wave astronomy -- LISA data
processing and science analysis methodologies are in their infancy and require
considerable maturation if they are to be ready to take advantage of LISA data.
Here we offer some thoughts, in anticipation of the LISA Science Analysis
Workshop, on analysis research problems that demonstrate the capabilities of
different proposed analysis methodologies and, simultaneously, help to push
those techniques toward greater maturity. Particular emphasis is placed on
formulating questions that can be turned into well-posed problems involving
tests run on specific data sets, which can be shared among different groups to
enable the comparison of techniques on a well-defined platform.
