This paper addresses the problem of locating base stations in a certain area
which is highly populated by mobile stations; each mobile station is assumed to
select the closest base station. Base stations are modeled by players who
choose their best location for maximizing their uplink throughput. The approach
of this paper is to make some simplifying assumptions in order to get
interpretable analytical results and insights to the problem under study.
Specifically, a relatively complete Nash equilibrium (NE) analysis is conducted
(existence, uniqueness, determination, and efficiency). Then, assuming that the
base station location can be adjusted dynamically, the best-response dynamics
and reinforcement learning algorithm are applied, discussed, and illustrated
through numerical results.
