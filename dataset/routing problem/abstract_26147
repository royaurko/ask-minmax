Solutions to Traveling salesman problem have been obtained with several
algorithms. However, few of them has discussed about the statistical
distribution of lengths for the quasi-optimal path obtained. For a random set
of cities such a distribution follows a rank 2 daisy model but our analysis on
actual distribution of cities does not show the characteristic quadratic growth
of the daisy model. The role played by the initial city distribution is
explored in this work. The importance of understanding such a behavior in the
context of electoral processes is discussed.
