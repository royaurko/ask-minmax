The reversible circuit synthesis problem can be reduced to permutation group.
This allows Schreier-Sims Algorithm for the strong generating set-finding
problem to be used to find tight bounds on the synthesis of 3-bit reversible
circuits using the NFT library. The tight bounds include the maximum and
minimum length of 3-bit reversible circuits, the maximum and minimum cost of
3-bit reversible circuits. The analysis shows better results than that found in
the literature for the lower bound of the cost. The analysis also shows that
there are 1960 universal reversible sub-libraries from the main NFT library.
