We consider the stability in the inverse problem consisting in the
determination of an electric potential $q$, appearing in a Dirichlet
initial-boundary value problem for the wave equation $\partial_t^2u-\Delta
u+q(x)u=0$ in an unbounded wave guide $\Omega=\omega\times\mathbb R$ with
$\omega$ a bounded smooth domain of $\mathbb R^2$, from boundary observations.
The observation is given by the Dirichlet to Neumann map associated to a wave
equation. We prove a H\"older stability estimate in the determination of $q$
from the Dirichlet to Neumann map. Moreover, provided that the gap between two
electric potentials rich its maximum in a fixed bounded subset of
$\bar{\Omega}$, we extend this result to the same inverse problem with
measurements on a bounded subset of the lateral boundary
$(0,T)\times\partial\Omega$.
