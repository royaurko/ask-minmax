In a recent paper, Kuperberg described the first subexponential time
algorithm for solving the dihedral hidden subgroup problem. The space
requirement of his algorithm is super-polynomial. We describe a modified
algorithm whose running time is still subexponential and whose space
requirement is only polynomial.
