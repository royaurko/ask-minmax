The problem of resolving spherical harmonic components from numerical data
defined on a rectangular grid has many applications, particularly for the
problem of gravitational radiation extraction. A novel method due to Misner
improves on traditional techniques by avoiding the need to cover the sphere
with a coordinate system appropriate to the grid geometry. This paper will
discuss Misner's method and suggest how it can be improved by exploiting local
regression techniques.
