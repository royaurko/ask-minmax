The problem of non-solvable contractions of Lie algebras is analyzed. By
means of a stability theorem, the problem is shown to be deeply related to the
embeddings among semisimple Lie algebras and the resulting branching rules for
representations. With this procedure, we determine all deformations of
indecomposable Lie algebras having a nontrivial Levi decomposition onto
semisimple Lie algebras of dimension $n\leq 8$, and obtain the non-solvable
contractions of the latter class of algebras.
