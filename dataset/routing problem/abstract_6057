We study the fundamental problem of scheduling bidirectional traffic along a
path composed of multiple segments. The main feature of the problem is that
jobs traveling in the same direction can be scheduled in quick succession on a
segment, while jobs in opposing directions cannot cross a segment at the same
time. We show that this tradeoff makes the problem significantly harder than
the related flow shop problem, by proving that it is NP-hard even for identical
jobs. We complement this result with a PTAS for a single segment and
non-identical jobs. If we allow some pairs of jobs traveling in different
directions to cross a segment concurrently, the problem becomes APX-hard even
on a single segment and with identical jobs. We give polynomial algorithms for
the setting with restricted compatibilities between jobs on a single and any
constant number of segments, respectively.
