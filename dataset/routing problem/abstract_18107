With the advance of fluorescence imaging technologies, recently cell
biologists are able to record the movement of protein vesicles within a living
cell. Automatic tracking of the movements of these vesicles become key for
qualitative analysis of dynamics of theses vesicles. In this thesis, we
formulate such tracking problem as video object tracking problem, and design a
dynamic programming method for tracking single object. Our experiments on
simulation data show that the method can identify a track with high accuracy
which is robust to the choose of tracking parameters and presence of high level
noise. We then extend this method to the tracking multiple objects using the
track elimination strategy. In multiple object tracking, the above approach
often fails to correctly identify a track when two tracks cross. We solve this
problem by incorporating the Kalman filter into the dynamic programming
framework. Our experiments on simulated data show that the tracking accuracy is
significantly improved.
