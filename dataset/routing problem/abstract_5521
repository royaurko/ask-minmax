Charles Babbage's vision of computing has largely been realized. We are on
the verge of realizing Vannevar Bush's Memex. But, we are some distance from
passing the Turing Test. These three visions and their associated problems have
provided long-range research goals for many of us. For example, the scalability
problem has motivated me for several decades. This talk defines a set of
fundamental research problems that broaden the Babbage, Bush, and Turing
visions. They extend Babbage's computational goal to include highly-secure,
highly-available, self-programming, self-managing, and self-replicating
systems. They extend Bush's Memex vision to include a system that automatically
organizes, indexes, digests, evaluates, and summarizes information (as well as
a human might). Another group of problems extends Turing's vision of
intelligent machines to include prosthetic vision, speech, hearing, and other
senses. Each problem is simply stated and each is orthogonal from the others,
though they share some common core technologies
