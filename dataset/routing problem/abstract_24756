We consider wave equations in domains with time-dependent boundaries (moving
obstacles) contained in a fixed cylinder for all time. We give sufficient
conditions for the determination of the moving boundary from the Cauchy data on
part of the boundary of the cylinder. We also study the related problem of
accessibility of the moving boundary by time-like curves from the boundary of
the cylinder.
