Suppose that the matrix equation $AXB=C$ with unknown matrix $X$ is given,
where $A$, $B$, and $C$\ are known matrices of suitable sizes. The matrix
nearness problem is considered over the general and least squares solutions of
the matrix equation $AXB=C$ when the equation is consistent and inconsistent,
respectively. The implicit form of the best approximate solutions of the
problems over the set of symmetric and the set of skew-symmetric matrices are
established as well. Moreover, some numerical examples are given for the
problems considered.
