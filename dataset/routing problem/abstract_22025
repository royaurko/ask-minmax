In this paper we consider an interior stabilization problem for the wave
equation with dynamic boundary delay. We prove some stability results under the
choice of damping operator. The proof of the main result is based on a
frequency domain method and combines a contradiction argument with the
multiplier technique to carry out a special analysis for the resolvent.
