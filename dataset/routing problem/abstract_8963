Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) are effective tools in classification problems,
and in recent years the even more powerful Dynamic Growing Neural Networks, a
variant of SOMs, have been developed. Automatic Classification (also called
clustering) is an important and difficult problem in many Astrophysical
experiments, for instance, Gamma Ray Burst classification, or gamma-hadron
separation. After a brief introduction to classification problem, we discuss
Self-Organising Maps in section 2. Section 3 discusses with various models of
growing neural networks and finally in section 4 we discuss the research
perspectives in growing neural networks for efficient classification in
astrophysical problems.
