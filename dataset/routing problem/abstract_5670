We study the non-overlapping indexing problem: Given a text T, preprocess it
so that you can answer queries of the form: given a pattern P, report the
maximal set of non-overlapping occurrences of P in T. A generalization of this
problem is the range non-overlapping indexing where in addition we are given
two indexes i,j to report the maximal set of non-overlapping occurrences
between these two indexes. We suggest new solutions for these problems. For the
non-overlapping problem our solution uses O(n) space with query time of O(m +
occ_{NO}). For the range non-overlapping problem we propose a solution with
O(n\log^\epsilon n) space for some 0<\epsilon<1 and O(m + \log\log n +
occ_{ij,NO}) query time.
