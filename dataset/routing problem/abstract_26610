We study suspensions of solid particles in a viscous incompressible fluid in
the presence of highly oscillatory velocity-dependent surface forces. The flow
at a small Reynolds number is modeled by the Stokes equations coupled with the
motion of rigid particles arranged in a periodic array. The objective is to
perform homogenization for the given suspension and obtain an equivalent
description of a homogeneous (effective) medium, the macroscopic effect of the
interfacial forces and the effective viscosity are determined using the
analysis on a periodicity cell. In particular, the solutions $\bm{u}^\e_\omega$
to a family of problems corresponding to the size of microstructure $\e$ and
describing suspensions of rigid particles with random surface forces imposed on
the interface, converge $H^1$-- weakly as $\e \to 0$ a.s. to a solution of the
so-called homogenized problem with constant coefficients. It is also shown that
there is a corrector to a homogenized solution that yields a strong $H^1$--
convergence. The main technical construct is built upon the $\Gamma$--
convergence theory.
