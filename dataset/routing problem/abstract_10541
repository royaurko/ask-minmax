The class of problems complete for NP via first-order reductions is known to
be characterized by existential second-order sentences of a fixed form. All
such sentences are built around the so-called generalized IS-form of the
sentence that defines Independent-Set. This result can also be understood as
that every sentence that defines a NP-complete problem P can be decomposed in
two disjuncts such that the first one characterizes a fragment of P as hard as
Independent-Set and the second the rest of P. That is, a decomposition that
divides every such sentence into a quotient and residue modulo Independent-Set.
  In this paper, we show that this result can be generalized over a wide
collection of complexity classes, including the so-called nice classes.
Moreover, we show that such decomposition can be done for any complete problem
with respect to the given class, and that two such decompositions are
non-equivalent in general. Interestingly, our results are based on simple and
well-known properties of first-order reductions.ow that this result can be
