Streamers often constitute the first stage of dielectric breakdown in strong
electric fields: a nonlinear ionization wave transforms a non-ionized medium
into a weakly ionized nonequilibrium plasma. New understanding of this old
phenomenon can be gained through modern concepts of (interfacial) pattern
formation. As a first step towards an effective interface description, we
determine the front width, solve the selection problem for planar fronts and
calculate their properties. Our results are in good agreement with many
features of recent three-dimensional numerical simulations.
