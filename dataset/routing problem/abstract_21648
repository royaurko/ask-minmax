The problem of estimation of analytic density function using L_p minimax risk
is considered. A kernel-type estimator of an unknown density function is
proposed and the upper bound on its limiting local minimax risk is established.
Our result is consistent with a conjecture of Guerre and Tsybakov (1998) and
augments previous work in this area.
