We address the classical stellar-atmosphere problem and describe our method
of numerical solution in detail. The problem consists of the solution of the
radiation transfer equation under the constraints of hydrostatic, radiative and
statistical equilibrium (non-LTE). We employ the Accelerated Lambda Iteration
(ALI) technique, and use statistical methods to construct non-LTE
metal-line-blanketed model-atmospheres.
