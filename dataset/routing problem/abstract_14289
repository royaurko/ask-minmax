Construction on the measurement matrix $A$ is a central problem in compressed
sensing. Although using random matrices is proven optimal and successful in
both theory and applications. A deterministic construction on the measurement
matrix is still very important and interesting. In fact, it is still an open
problem proposed by T. Tao. In this paper, we shall provide a new deterministic
construction method and prove it is optimal with regard to the mutual
incoherence.
