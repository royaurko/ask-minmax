In this paper, we propose a support driven reweighted $\ell_1$ minimization
algorithm (SDRL1) that solves a sequence of weighted $\ell_1$ problems and
relies on the support estimate accuracy. Our SDRL1 algorithm is related to the
IRL1 algorithm proposed by Cand{\`e}s, Wakin, and Boyd. We demonstrate that it
is sufficient to find support estimates with \emph{good} accuracy and apply
constant weights instead of using the inverse coefficient magnitudes to achieve
gains similar to those of IRL1. We then prove that given a support estimate
with sufficient accuracy, if the signal decays according to a specific rate,
the solution to the weighted $\ell_1$ minimization problem results in a support
estimate with higher accuracy than the initial estimate. We also show that
under certain conditions, it is possible to achieve higher estimate accuracy
when the intersection of support estimates is considered. We demonstrate the
performance of SDRL1 through numerical simulations and compare it with that of
IRL1 and standard $\ell_1$ minimization.
