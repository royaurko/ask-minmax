We present constraints on core-collapse supernova progenitors through
observations of their environments within host galaxies. This is achieved
through 2 routes. Firstly, we investigate the spatial correlation of supernovae
with host galaxy star formation using pixel statistics. We find that the main
supernova types form a sequence of increasing association to star formation.
The most logical interpretation is that this implies an increasing progenitor
mass sequence going from the supernova type Ia arising from the lowest mass,
through the type II, type Ib, and the supernova type Ic arising from the
highest mass progenitors. We find the surprising result that the supernova type
IIn show a lower association to star formation than type IIPs, implying lower
mass progenitors. Secondly, we use host HII region spectroscopy to investigate
differences in environment metallicity between different core-collapse types.
We find that supernovae of types Ibc arise in slightly higher metallicity
environments than type II events. However, this difference is not significant,
implying that progenitor metallicity does not play a dominant role in deciding
supernova type.
