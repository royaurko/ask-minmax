In this work we study the stochastic recursive control problem, in which the
aggregator (or called generator) of the backward stochastic differential
equation describing the running cost is continuous but not necessarily
Lipschitz with respect to the first unknown variable and the control, and
monotonic with respect to the first unknown variable. The dynamic programming
principle and the connection between the value function and the viscosity
solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation are established in
this setting by the generalized comparison theorem of backward stochastic
differential equations and the stability of viscosity solutions. Finally we
take the control problem of continuous-time Epstein-Zin utility with
non-Lipschitz aggregator as an example to demonstrate the application of our
study.
