This paper reports experiences with iterated traffic microsimulations in the
context of a Dallas study. ``Iterated microsimulations'' here means that the
information generated by a microsimulation is fed back into the route planner
so that the simulated individuals can adjust their routes to circumvent
congestion. This paper gives an overview over what has been done in the Dallas
context to better understand the relaxation process, and how to judge the
robustness of the results.
