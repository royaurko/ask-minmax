We introduce a new notation called Balanced Tanner Units for regular
bipartite graphs. Several enumeration problems for labeled and unlabeled
Balanced Tanner Units have been introduced. A general algorithm for enumerating
all non-isomorphic (m,2) Balanced Tanner Units has been described and a
mathematical proof has been provided for its completeness. An abstraction of m
Symmetric Permutation Tree in order to visualize a labeled (m,r) BTU and
enumerate its automorphism group has been introduced. An algorithm to generate
the partition associated with two compatible permutations has been introduced.
The relationship between Automorphism Group and permutation enumeration problem
has been used to derive formulae for the number of compatible permutations
corresponding to a specified partition. A family of labeled (m,r) BTUs has been
introduced and an upper bound on the number of non-isomorphic graphs in this
family has been derived and we raise open questions for girth maximum (m,r)
BTU.
