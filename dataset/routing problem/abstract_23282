This paper is written for "Gribov Memorial Volume", Heavy Ion Physics, Acta
Physica Hungarica. This is a report on my 25 years activity in understanding of
the Pomeron structure. Since I was involved in the Pomeron business moreless
from the beginning, I hope, that this report shows the development of the main
ideas in their historical perspective from the first enthusiastic attempts to
find a simple solution to understanding of the complexity and difficulty of the
problem. In other words, this is a story about a young guy who wanted to
understand everything in high energy interaction, who did his best but who is
still in the beginning, but who has not lost his temper and considers the
Pomeron structure as the beautiful and difficult problem, which deserves his
time and efforts to be solved.
