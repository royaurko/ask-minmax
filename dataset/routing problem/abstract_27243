We consider a variation of Ramsey numbers introduced by Erd\H{o}s and Pach
(1983), where instead of seeking complete or independent sets we only seek a
$t$-homogeneous set, a vertex subset that induces a subgraph of minimum degree
at least $t$ or the complement of such a graph.
  For any $\nu > 0$ and positive integer $k$, we show that any graph $G$ or its
complement contains as an induced subgraph some graph $H$ on $\ell \ge k$
vertices with minimum degree at least $\frac12(\ell-1) + \nu$ provided that $G$
has at least $k^{\Omega(\nu^2)}$ vertices. We also show this to be best
possible in a sense. This may be viewed as correction to a result claimed in
Erd\H{o}s and Pach (1983).
  For the above result, we permit $H$ to have order at least $k$. In the harder
problem where we insist that $H$ have exactly $k$ vertices, we do not obtain
sharp results, although we show a way to translate results of one form of the
problem to the other.
