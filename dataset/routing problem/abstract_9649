We consider a classical problem of linear stability of convective rolls in a
plane layer with stress-free horizontal boundaries near the onset of
convection. The problem has been studied by a number of contributors, who have shown
that rolls of wave number $k$ are unstable with respect to perturbations of
different types, if some inequalities relating $k$ and the Rayleigh number $R$
are satisfied. The perturbations involve a large-scale mode. Certain asymptotic
dependencies between wave numbers of the mode and overcriticality are always
assumed in the available proofs of instability. We analyse the stability
analytically following the approach of Podvigina (2008) without making a priori
assumptions concerning asymptotic relations between small parameters
characterising the problem. Instability of rolls to short-scale modes is also
considered. Therefore, our analytical results on stability to space-periodic
perturbations are exhaustive; they allow to identify the areas in the $(k,R)$
plane, where convective rolls are stable near the onset. The analytical results
are compared with numerical solutions to the eigenvalue problem determining
stability of rolls.
