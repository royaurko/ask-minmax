The problem of derivation of the equations of motion from the field equations
is considered. Einstein's field equations have a specific analytical form: They
are linear in the second order derivatives and quadratic in the first order
derivatives of the field variables. We utilize this particular form and propose
a novel algorithm for thederivation of the equations of motion from the field
equations. It is based on the condition of the balance between the singular
terms of the field equation. We apply the algorithm to a nonlinear Lorentz
invariant scalar field model. We show that it results in the Newton law of
attraction between the singularities of the field moved on approximately
geodesic curves. The algorithm is applicable to the $N$-body problem of the
Lorentz invariant field equations.
