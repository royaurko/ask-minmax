Two possible explanations for the type SNe Ia supernovae observations are a
nonlinear, underdense void embedded in a matter-dominated Einstein-de Sitter
spacetime or dark energy in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Both of these alternatives
are faced with Copernican fine-tuning problems. A case is made for the void
scenario that avoids introducing undetected dark energy.
