We present a multiscale approach to the modeling of polymer dynamics in the
presence of a fluid solvent. The approach combines Langevin Molecular Dynamics
(MD) techniques with a mesoscopic Lattice-Boltzmann (LB) method for the solvent
dynamics. A unique feature of the present approach is that hydrodynamic
interactions between the solute macromolecule and the aqueous solvent are
handled explicitly, and yet in a computationally tractable way due to the dual
particle-field nature of the LB solver. The suitability of the present LB-MD
multiscale approach is demonstrated for the problem of polymer fast
translocation through a nanopore. We also provide an interpretation of our
results in the context of DNA translocation through a nanopore, a problem that
has attracted much theoretical and experimental attention recently.
