We consider the equation $u_t=u_{xx}+b(x)u(1-u),$ $x\in\mathbb R,$ where
$b(x)$ is a nonnegative measure on $\mathbb R$ that is periodic in $x.$ In the
case where $b(x)$ is a smooth periodic function, it is known that there exists
a travelling wave with speed $c$ for any $c\geq c^*(b),$ where $c^*(b)$ is a
certain positive number depending on $b.$ Such a travelling wave is often
called a \lq\lq pulsating travelling wave" or a \lq\lq periodic travelling
wave", and $c^*(b)$ is called the \lq\lq minimal speed". In this paper, we
first extend this theory by showing the existence of the minimal speed $c^*(b)$
for any nonnegative measure $b$ with period $L.$ Next we study the question of
maximizing $c^*(b)$ under the constraint $\int_{[0,L)}b(x)dx=\alpha L,$ where
$\alpha$ is an arbitrarily given constant. This question is closely related to
the problem studied by mathematical ecologists in late 1980's but its answer
has not been known. We answer this question by proving that the maximum is
attained by periodically arrayed Dirac's delta functions $\alpha
L\sum_{k\in\mathbb Z}\delta(x+kL).$
