The project of the informational system creation on the problem of evolution
of radio galaxies is described. This system, being developed at present, will
allow a user to operate with simulated curves of spectral energy distributions
(SED) and to estimate ages and redshifts by photometrical data. Authors use
SEDs of several models (GISSEL'96 (Bruzual, Charlot, 1996), PEGASE (Fioc,
Rocca-Volmerange, 1996) and Poggianti(1996)) for different types of galaxies.
Planned modes of access, formats of output result and additional functions are
described.
