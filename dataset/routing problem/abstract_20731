The method of screening and renormalization is used to include the Coulomb
interaction between the charged particles in the momentum-space description of
three- and four-body nuclear reactions. The necessity for the renormalization
of the scattering amplitudes and the reliability of the method is demonstrated.
The Coulomb effect on observables is discussed.
