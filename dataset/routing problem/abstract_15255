We introduce a first order method for solving very large cone programs to
modest accuracy. The method uses an operator splitting method, the alternating
directions method of multipliers, to solve the homogeneous self-dual embedding,
an equivalent feasibility problem involving finding a nonzero point in the
intersection of a subspace and a cone. This approach has several favorable
properties. Compared to interior-point methods, first-order methods scale to
very large problems, at the cost of lower accuracy. Compared to other
first-order methods for cone programs, our approach finds both primal and dual
solutions when available and certificates of infeasibility or unboundedness
otherwise, it does not rely on any explicit algorithm parameters, and the
per-iteration cost of the method is the same as applying the splitting method
to the primal or dual alone. We discuss efficient implementation of the method
in detail, including direct and indirect methods for computing projection onto
the subspace, scaling the original problem data, and stopping criteria. We
provide a reference implementation called SCS, which can solve large problems
to modest accuracy quickly and is parallelizable across multiple processors. We
conclude with numerical examples illustrating the efficacy of the technique; in
particular, we demonstrate speedups of several orders of magnitude over
state-of-the-art interior-point solvers.
