The Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP) is an extension of the
well-known Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where the node set is partitioned
into clusters, and the objective is to find the shortest cycle visiting each
cluster exactly once. In this paper, we present a new hybrid Ant Colony System
(ACS) algorithm for the symmetric GTSP. The proposed algorithm is a
modification of a simple ACS for the TSP improved by an efficient GTSP-specific
local search procedure. Our extensive computational experiments show that the
use of the local search procedure dramatically improves the performance of the
ACS algorithm, making it one of the most successful GTSP metaheuristics to
date.
