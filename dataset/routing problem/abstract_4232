This is an updated survey on the inverse spectral problem written for the
Notices of the ICCM. It rapidly reviews some of the material in the previous
survey of the same title (arXiv:math/0402356) and then discusses some
relatively new results (rigidity results for the ellipse, phase shifts in
scattering theory). The last section poses a number of open problems involving
"inverse results for oscillatory integrals".
