Consider a rectangular matrix describing some type of communication or
transportation between a set of origins and a set of destinations, or a
classification of objects by two attributes. The problem is to infer the
entries of the matrix from limited information in the form of constraints,
generally the sums of the elements over various subsets of the matrix, such as
rows, columns, etc, or from bounds on these sums, down to individual elements.
Such problems are routinely addressed by applying the maximum entropy method to
compute the matrix numerically, but in this paper we derive analytical,
closed-form solutions. For the most complicated cases we consider the solution
depends on the root of a non-linear equation, for which we provide an
analytical approximation in the form of a power series. Some of our solutions
extend to 3-dimensional matrices. Besides being valid for matrices of arbitrary
size, the analytical solutions exhibit many of the appealing properties of
maximum entropy, such as precise use of the available data, intuitive behavior
with respect to changes in the constraints, and logical consistency.
