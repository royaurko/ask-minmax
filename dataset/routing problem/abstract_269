The input to the unrooted traveling repairman problem is an undirected metric
graph and a subset of nodes, each of which has a time window of unit length.
Given that a repairman can start at any location, the goal is to plan a route
that visits as many nodes as possible during their respective time windows. A
polynomial-time bicriteria approximation algorithm is presented for this
problem, gaining an increased fraction of repairman visits for increased
speedup of repairman motion. For speedup $s$, we find a $6\gamma/(s +
1)$-approximation for $s$ in the range $1 \leq s \leq 2$ and a
$4\gamma/s$-approximation for $s$ in the range $2 \leq s \leq 4$, where $\gamma
= 1$ on tree-shaped networks and $\gamma = 2 + \epsilon$ on general metric
graphs.
