We propose a method for solving constrained fixed point problems involving
compositions of Lipschitz pseudo contractive and firmly nonexpansive operators
in Hilbert spaces. Each iteration of the method uses separate evaluations of
these operators and an outer approximation given by the projection onto a
closed half-space containing the constraint set. Its convergence is established
and applications to monotone inclusion splitting and constrained equilibrium
problems are demonstrated.
