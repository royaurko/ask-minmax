We propose a solution to the cosmological monopole problem: Primordial black
holes, produced in the early universe, can accrete magnetic monopoles before
the relics dominate the energy density of the universe. These small black holes
quickly evaporate and thereby convert most of the monopole energy density into
radiation. We estimate the range of parameters for which this solution is
possible: under very conservative assumptions we find that the black hole mass
must be less than 10^9 gm.
