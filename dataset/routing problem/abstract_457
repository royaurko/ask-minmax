In Wireless Multi-hop Networks (WMhNs), routing protocols with energy
efficient and delay reduction techniques are needed to fulfill users demands.
In this paper, we present Linear Programming models (LP_models) to assess and
enhance reactive routing protocols. To practically examine constraints of
respective LP_models over reactive protocols, we select AODV, DSR and DYMO. It
is deduced from analytical simulations of LP_models in MATLAB that quick route
repair reduces routing latency and optimizations of retransmission attempts
results efficient energy utilization. To provide quick repair, we enhance AODV
and DSR. To practically examine the efficiency of enhanced protocols in
different scenarios of WMhNs, we conduct simulations using NS- 2. From
simulation results, enhanced DSR and AODV achieve efficient output by
optimizing routing latencies and routing load in terms of retransmission
attempts.
