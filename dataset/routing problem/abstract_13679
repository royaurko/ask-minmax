We study a problem describing the motion of an incompressible, nonisothermal
and non-Newtonian uid, taking into account the heat convection term. The
novelty here is that uid viscosity depends on the temperature, the velocity of
the uid, and also of the deformation tensor, but not explicitly. The boundary
conditions take into account the slip phenomenon on a part of the boundary of
the domain. By using the notion of pseudo-monotone operators and xed point
Theorem we prove an existence result of its weak solution.
