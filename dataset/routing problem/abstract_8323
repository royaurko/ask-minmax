In this note, we point out two major errors in the paper "Minimizing total
tardiness on parallel machines with preemptions" by Kravchenko and Werner
[2010]. More precisely, they proved that both problems P|pmtn|sum(Tj) and P|rj,
pj = p, pmtn|sum(Tj) are NP-Hard. We give a counter-example to their proofs,
letting the complexity of these two problems open.
