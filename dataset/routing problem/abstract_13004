In this paper we develop a fuzzy model for the description of the process of
Analogical Reasoning by representing its main steps as fuzzy subsets of a set
of linguistic labels characterizing the individuals' performance in each step
and we use the Shannon- Wiener diversity index as a measure of the individuals'
abilities in analogical problem solving. This model is compared with a
stochastic model presented in contributor's earlier papers by introducing a finite
Markov chain on the steps of the process of Analogical Reasoning. A classroom
experiment is also presented to illustrate the use of our results in practice.
