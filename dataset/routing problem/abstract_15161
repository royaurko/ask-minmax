A fundamental question in systems biology is the construction and training to
data of mathematical models. Logic formalisms have become very popular to model
signaling networks because their simplicity allows us to model large systems
encompassing hundreds of proteins. An approach to train (Boolean) logic models
to high-throughput phospho-proteomics data was recently introduced and solved
using optimization heuristics based on stochastic methods. Here we demonstrate
how this problem can be solved using Answer Set Programming (ASP), a
declarative problem solving paradigm, in which a problem is encoded as a
logical program such that its answer sets represent solutions to the problem.
ASP has significant improvements over heuristic methods in terms of efficiency
and scalability, it guarantees global optimality of solutions as well as
provides a complete set of solutions. We illustrate the application of ASP with
in silico cases based on realistic networks and data.
