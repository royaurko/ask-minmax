The study of neutrinos is fundamental to connect astrophysics and elementary
particle physics. In this last decade solar neutrino experiments and KamLAND
confirmed the LMA solution and further clarified the mass and oscillation
pattern. Borexino attacked also the study of the low energy neutrino spectrum.
However, important points still need clarification, like the apparent anomaly
in the vacuum to matter transition region. Besides, a more detailed study of
the low energy components of the pp cycle, combined with a measurement of CNO
fluxes, is compulsory, also to discriminate between the low and the high Z
versions of the Solar Standard Models and solve the metallicity problem. We
discuss the main recent advancements and the possibilities of studying these
open problems with Borexino, SNO+ and the future experiments, like the next
generation of scintillators.
