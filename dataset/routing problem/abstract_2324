We report a novel spatiotemporal state, namely the chimera-like incongruous
coexistence of {\it synchronized oscillation} and {\it stable steady state}
(CSOD) in a realistic ecological network of nonlocally coupled oscillators.
Unlike the {\it chimera} and {\it chimera death} state, in the CSOD state
identical oscillators are self-organized into two coexisting spatially
separated domains: In one domain neighboring oscillators show synchronized
oscillation and in another domain the neighboring oscillators randomly populate
either a synchronized oscillating state or a stable steady state (we call it a
death state). We show that the interplay of nonlocality and coupling strength
results in two routes to the CSOD state: One is from a coexisting mixed state
of amplitude chimera and death, and another one is from a globally synchronized
state. We further explore the importance of this study in ecology that gives a
new insight into the relationship between spatial synchrony and global
extinction of species.
