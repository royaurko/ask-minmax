The aim of this paper is to provide an original method of constructing very
effective near-cloaking structures for the conductivity problem. These new
structures are such that their first Generalized Polarization Tensors vanish.
We show that this in particular significantly enhances the cloaking effect. We
then present some numerical examples of Generalized Polarization Tensors
vanishing structures.
