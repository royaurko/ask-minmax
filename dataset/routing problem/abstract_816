The reconnection process in the dynamics of cubic nontwist maps, introduced
in [3], is studied. The present paper extends the work presented in [8]. As in
that work, in order to describe the route to reconnection of the involved
Poincar\'{e}--Birkhoff chains or dimerised chains we investigate an approximate
interpolating Hamiltonian of the map under study revealing again that the
scenario of reconnection of cubic nontwist maps is different from that
occurring in the dynamics of quadratic nontwist maps.
