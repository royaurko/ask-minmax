In many cases the correct theoretical description of flexoelectricity
requires the consideration of the finite size of a body and is reduced to the
solution of boundary problems for partial differential equations. Generally
speaking, in this case one should solve jointly the equations of polarization
equilibrium and equations of elastic equilibrium. However, due to the fact that
typically flexoelectric moduli are very small, usually one can consider the
solution of polarization equilibrium equations at a given elastic strain
(direct flexoelectric effect) or the solution of elastic equilibrium equations
at given polarization (converse flexoelectric effect). Derivation of the
polarization equilibrium equations and boundary conditions for them can be made
in the quite usual way. Solution of these equations usually is not too
difficult problem. On the contrary description of converse flexoelectric effect
is more complicated problem. Inter alia effective solution of corresponded
boundary problems requires the development of special mathematical methods. The
subject of this paper is a detailed discussion of the relevant theory focuses
on the converse flexoelectric effect. It is also considered some particular
examples illustrating the application of the general theory.
