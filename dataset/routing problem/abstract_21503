In this paper we establish the existence of extremal functions for weighted
functionals with critical exponential growth in R^2, which arise from
Henon-type equations. The proof is based on the notion of spherical
symmetrization with respect to a measure, which allows us to reduce the problem
to a one dimensional functional as in the proof due to Carleson and Chang for
the unweighted case.
