We propose a new method for low-rank approximation of Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverses (MPPs) of large-scale matrices using tensor networks. The
computed pseudoinverses can be useful for solving or preconditioning
large-scale overdetermined or underdetermined systems of linear equations. The
computation is performed efficiently and stably based on the modified
alternating least squares (MALS) scheme using low-rank tensor train (TT)
decomposition. The large-scale optimization problem is reduced to sequential
smaller-scale problems for which any standard and stable algorithms can be
applied. Regularization technique is further introduced in order to alleviate
ill-posedness and obtain low-rank solutions. Numerical simulation results
illustrate that the pseudoinverses of a wide class of nonsquare or nonsymmetric
matrices admit good approximate low-rank TT approximations. It is demonstrated
that the computational cost of the proposed method is only logarithmic in the
matrix size given that the TT-ranks of a data matrix and its approximate
pseudoinverse are bounded. It is illustrated that a strongly nonsymmetric
convection-diffusion problem can be efficiently solved by using the
preconditioners computed by the proposed method.
