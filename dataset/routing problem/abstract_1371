The smart grid nurtures many innovative ideas and applications, and it
revolutionizes the power system. Unfortunately, many of these new ideas cannot
be easily integrated into the existing power system due to power reliability
and security reasons. We can build an energy transmission system upon the
traffic network and utilize electric vehicles (EVs) as energy carriers to
transport energy over a large geographical region. We construct a generalized
architecture called the vehicular energy network (VEN) and develop a
mathematically tractable framework for VEN. Dynamic wireless (dis)charging
allows electric energy, as an energy packet, to be added and subtracted from EV
batteries seamlessly. With proper routing, we can transport energy from the
sources to destinations through EVs along appropriate vehicular routes based on
the information via the vehicular ad-hoc network. This paper gives a thorough
preliminary study of VEN with characteristics listed and possible drawbacks
discussed. We illustrate its significance by setting up a VEN with real traffic
data in the United Kingdom. Our implementation shows that a substantial amount
of renewable energy can be transported from some remote wind farms to London
under some reasonable settings. VEN can complement the power network and
enhance the overall power transmission rate. With packet switching-like design,
many further developments can be built upon VEN by incorporating ideas and
results from the data networking domain.
