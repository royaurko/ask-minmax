This paper studies the problem of decentralized measurement feedback
stabilization of nonlinear interconnected systems. As a natural extension of
the recent development on control vector Lyapunov functions, the notion of
output control vector Lyapunov function (OCVLF) is introduced for investigating
decentralized measurement feedback stabilization problems. Sufficient
conditions on (local) stabilizability are discussed which are based on the
proposed notion of OCVLF. It is shown that a decentralized controller for a
nonlinear interconnected system can be constructed using these conditions under
an additional vector dissipation-like condition. To illustrate the proposed
method, two examples are given.
