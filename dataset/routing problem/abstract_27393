The efficiency of tag identification in an RFID system can be low down due to
the tag collision problems. the tag collision problem occurs when a reader try
to read multiple tags in an interrogation zone. as a result the reader does not
identify the tag correctly. that causes a loss of information or data
interference. to solve such kind of issues a series of aloha based algorithm
and binary search algorithm have beed proposed. the most simple popular and
good giving performance algorithm are aloha based anti-collision algorithms. in
this paper we present a new variation in accelerated slotted aloha afsa. our
proposed algorithm by using the bitmaps and avoids wastages in bit times due to
idleness and collided slots reduce the tag reading time. the simulation result
shows that afsa can significantly reduce the average tag reading time with
respect to the base protocols and achieve high tag reading rates under both
static and mobile setting.
