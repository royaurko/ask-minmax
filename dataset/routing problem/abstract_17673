We derive the long-time asymptotics for the Toda shock problem using the
nonlinear steepest descent analysis for oscillatory Riemann--Hilbert
factorization problems. We show that the half plane of space/time variables
splits into five main regions: The two regions far outside where the solution
is close to free backgrounds. The middle region, where the solution can be
asymptotically described by a two band solution, and two regions separating
them, where the solution is asymptotically given by a slowly modulated two band
solution. In particular, the form of this solution in the separating regions
verifies a conjecture from Venakides, Deift, and Oba from 1991.
