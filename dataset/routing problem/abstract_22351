This article study the class of distributions obtained by subordinating
L\'evy processes and L\'evy bases. To do this we derive properties of a
suitable mapping obtained via L\'evy mixing. We show that our results can be
used to solve the so-called recovery problem for general L\'evy bases as well
as for moving average processes which are driven by subordinated L\'evy
processes.
