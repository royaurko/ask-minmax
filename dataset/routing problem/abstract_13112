We review the problem of time-critical action and discuss a reformulation
that shifts knowledge acquisition from the assessment of complex temporal
probabilistic dependencies to the direct assessment of time-dependent utilities
over key outcomes of interest. We dwell on a class of decision problems
characterized by the centrality of diagnosing and reacting in a timely manner
to pathological processes. We motivate key ideas in the context of trauma-care
triage and transportation decisions.
