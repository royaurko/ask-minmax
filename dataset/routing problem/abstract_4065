The Discretizable Molecular Distance Geometry Problem (DMDGP) consists in a
subclass of the Molecular Distance Geometry Problem for which an embedding in
${\mathbb{R}^3}$ can be found using a Branch & Prune (BP) algorithm in a
discrete search space. We propose a Clifford Algebra model of the DMDGP with an
accompanying version of the BP algorithm.
