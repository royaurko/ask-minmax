Two-dimensional nine neighbor hood rectangular Cellular Automata rules can be
modeled using many different techniques like Rule matrices, State Transition
Diagrams, Boolean functions, Algebraic Normal Form etc. In this paper, a new
model is introduced using color graphs to model all the 512 linear rules. The
graph theoretic properties therefore studied in this paper simplifies the
analysis of all linear rules in comparison with other ways of its study.
