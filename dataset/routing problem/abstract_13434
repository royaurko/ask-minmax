We study the Cauchy problem for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a nonlocal
interaction potential of Hartree type in three space dimensions. If the
potential is even and positive definite or a positive function and its Fourier
transform decays sufficiently rapidly the problem is shown to be globally
well-posed for large rough data which not necessarily have finite energy and
also in a situation where the energy functional is not positive definite. The
proof uses a suitable modification of the I-method.
