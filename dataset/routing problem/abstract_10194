We propose the supervised hierarchical Dirichlet process (sHDP), a
nonparametric generative model for the joint distribution of a group of
observations and a response variable directly associated with that whole group.
We compare the sHDP with another leading method for regression on grouped data,
the supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA) model. We evaluate our method
on two real-world classification problems and two real-world regression
problems. Bayesian nonparametric regression models based on the Dirichlet
process, such as the Dirichlet process-generalised linear models (DP-GLM) have
previously been explored; these models allow flexibility in modelling nonlinear
relationships. However, until now, Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP)
mixtures have not seen significant use in supervised problems with grouped data
since a straightforward application of the HDP on the grouped data results in
learnt clusters that are not predictive of the responses. The sHDP solves this
problem by allowing for clusters to be learnt jointly from the group structure
and from the label assigned to each group.
