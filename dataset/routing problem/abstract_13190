We review the understanding of the random constraint satisfaction problems,
focusing on the q-coloring of large random graphs, that has been achieved using
the cavity method of the physicists. We also discuss the properties of the
phase diagram in temperature, the connections with the glass transition
phenomenology in physics, and the related algorithmic issues.
