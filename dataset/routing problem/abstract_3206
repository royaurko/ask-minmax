There are recent cryptographic protocols that are based on Multiple
Simultaneous Conjugacy Problems in braid groups. We improve an algorithm, due
to Sang Jin Lee and Eonkyung Lee, to solve these problems, by applying a method
developed by the contributor and Nuno Franco, originally intended to solve the
Conjugacy Search Problem in braid groups.
