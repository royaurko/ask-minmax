Vehicular safety applications intended for VANETs. It can be separated by
inter-vehicle communication. It is needed for a vehicle can travel safety with
high velocity and must interconnect quickly dependably. In this work, examined
the impact of the IDM-IM and IDM-LC mobility model on AODV, AOMDV, DSDV and
OLSR routing protocol using Nakagami propagation model and IEEE 802.11p MAC
protocol in a particular urban scenario of Dhaka city. The periodic broadcast
(PBC) agent is employed to transmit messages between vehicles in case of
emergency or collision avoidance for vehicular safety communication. The
simulation results recommend numerous concerns such as lower packet drop rate,
delay, jitter, route cost and mean-hop is necessary to be measured before
developing a robust safety application of VANET.
