We demonstrate a non-inflationary solution to the cosmological horizon
problem in scenarios in which our observable universe is confined to three
spatial dimensions (a three-brane) embedded in a higher dimensional space. A
signal traveling along an extra-dimensional null geodesic may leave our
three-brane, travel into the extra dimensions, and subsequently return to a
different place on our three-brane in a shorter time than the time a signal
confined to our three-brane would take. Hence, these geodesics may connect
distant points which would otherwise be ``outside'' the four dimensional
horizon (points not in causal contact with one another).
