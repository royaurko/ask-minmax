In this paper we review the two main approaches to the problem of Malmquist
bias which have been adopted in the cosmology literature, and show how these
two formulations of the problem represent fundamentally different views of the
nature of probability. We discuss the assumptions upon which both approaches
are based and indicate some of their limitations. In particular we identify a
basic flaw in the definition of homogeneous and inhomogeneous Malmquist
corrections as they have frequently been applied in the literature, and
indicate how this flaw may be corrected. (Figures available on request).
