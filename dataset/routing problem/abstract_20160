An explicit polynomial in the linking numbers $l_{ij}$ and Milnor's triple
linking numbers $\mu(rst)$ on six component links is shown to be a well-defined
finite type link-homotopy invariant. This solves a problem raised by B. Mellor
and D. Thurston. An extension of our construction also produces a finite type
link invariant which detects the invertibility for some links.
