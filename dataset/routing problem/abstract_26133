An open problem arising in the statistical description of turbulence is
related to the \textit{theoretical prediction based on first principles} of the
so-called multi-point velocity probability density functions (PDFs)
characterizing a Navier-Stokes fluid. In this paper it will be shown that -
based on a suitable axiomatic approach - a solution to this problem can
actually be achieved based on the so-called inverse kinetic theory (IKT),
recently developed for incompressible fluids. More precisely, we intend to
show, based on the requirement that \textit{the Boltzmann-Shannon entropy for
the s-point velocity PDF ($f_s$) is independent of the order $s$ and is also
maximal at all times}, that all multi-point PDFs are \textit{necessarily
factorized in terms of the corresponding 1-point velocity PDF} ($f_1$). As a
consequence the multi-point PDFs usually considered for the phenomenological
description of turbulence can be theoretically predicted \textit{based on the
knowledge of $% f_1$ achieved by means of IKT.
