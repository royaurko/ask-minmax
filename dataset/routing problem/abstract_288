Understanding how packets are routed in Internet is significantly important
to Internet measurement and modeling. The conventional solution for route
simulation is based on the assumption of unweighted shortest path. However, it
has been found and widely accepted that a packet in Internet is usually not
transmitted along the unweighted shortest path between its source and
destination. To better simulate the routing behavior of a packet, we thoroughly
explore the real-world Internet routes and present a novel local information
based simulation model, with a tuning parameter, which assigns weights to links
based on local information and then simulates the Internet route with weighted
shortest path. Comparisons with baseline approaches show its capability in well
replicating the route length distribution and other structural properties of
the Internet topology. Meanwhile, the optimal parameter of this model locates
in the range of (0, 2), which implies that a packet inside the Internet
inclines to move to nodes with small degrees. This behavior actually reflects
the design philosophy of Internet routing, balancing between network efficiency
and traffic congestion.
