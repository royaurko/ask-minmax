We study boundary value problems for semilinear elliptic equations of the
form $-\Delta u+g\circ u=\mu$ in a smooth bounded domain $\Omega\subset R^N$.
Let $\{\mu_n\}$ and $\{\tau_n\}$ be sequences of measure in $\Omega$ and
$\partial \Omega$ respectively. Assume that there exists a solution $u_n$ of
the equation with $\mu=\mu_n$ subject to boundary data $\tau_n$. Further assume
that the sequences of measures converge in a weak sense to $\mu$ and $\tau$
respectively and $\{u_n\}$ converges to $u$ in $L^1(\Omega)$. In general $u$ is
not a solution of the boundary value problem with data $(\mu,\tau)$. However
there exist measures $(\mu^*,\tau^*)$ such that $u$ satisfies the equation with
$\mu$ replaced by $\mu^*$ and with $u=\tau^*$ on the boundary. The pair
$(\mu^*,\tau^*)$ is called the reduced limit of the sequence
$\{(\mu_n,\tau_n)\}$. We investigate the relation between the weak limit and
the reduced limit and the dependence of the latter on the sequence.
