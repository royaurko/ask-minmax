The bulk polycrystalline sample FeSe1/2Te1/2 is synthesized by solid state
reaction route in an evacuated sealed quartz tube at 750 oC. The presence of
superconductivity is confirmed through magnetization/thermoelectric/resistivity
studies. It is found that the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is
around 12 K. Heat capacity (Cp) of superconducting FeSe1-xTex exhibited a hump
near Tc, instead of well defined Lambda transition. X-ray Photo electron
spectroscopy (XPS) studies revealed well defined positions for divalent Fe, Se
and Te but with sufficient hybridization of Fe (2p) and Se/Te (3d) core levels.
In particular divalent Fe is shifted to higher BE (binding energy) and Se and
Te to lower. The situation is similar to that as observed earlier for famous Cu
based HTSc (High Tc superconductors), where Cu (3d) orbital hybridizes with O
(2p). We also found the satellite peak of Fe at 712.00 eV, which is attributed
to charge carrier localization induced by Fe at 2c site.
