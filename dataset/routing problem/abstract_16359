The paper is dedicated to the close analogy between these two theories - some
problems lying at the very root of Spectral Geometry are viewed in the context
of Semiclassics, and vise versa. The treatment starts from a very basic level
and gradually goes into the deep, ending up with some rather up to date
results. There are many examples concerning effective actions in QCD and String
Theory, functional determinants, first integrals from asymptotic expansions,
path quantization etc. The major theorems are only given brief explanations and
simple constructive proofs, but some rather practical formulae are obtained in
return. There is a small exercise at the end - obtaining explicit expressions
for the spectral variations of the Robin problem for a planar domain. The final
result is purely in the spirit of the familiar Sationary Perturbation Theory.
The idea for investigating this particular problem (in the context of an old
exact inverse result obtained by Guillemin and Melrose), very much motivating
most of the work, belongs to my scientific advisor Dr. Petko Nikolov.
