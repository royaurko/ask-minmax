In this article, we study the order of a positive pluriharmonic current and
we compare it with either the order of the concurrent slices or the
directionnel orders of the current. Therefore some estimates of the growth of
the \textsc{Lelong} function are established and the problem of algebraicity of
the current is treated as a result.
