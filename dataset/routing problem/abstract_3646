This paper discusses scalability of standard genetic programming (GP) and the
probabilistic incremental program evolution (PIPE). To investigate the need for
both effective mixing and linkage learning, two test problems are considered:
ORDER problem, which is rather easy for any recombination-based GP, and TRAP or
the deceptive trap problem, which requires the algorithm to learn interactions
among subsets of terminals. The scalability results show that both GP and PIPE
scale up polynomially with problem size on the simple ORDER problem, but they
both scale up exponentially on the deceptive problem. This indicates that while
standard recombination is sufficient when no interactions need to be
considered, for some problems linkage learning is necessary. These results are
in agreement with the lessons learned in the domain of binary-string genetic
algorithms (GAs). Furthermore, the paper investigates the effects of
introducing utnnecessary and irrelevant primitives on the performance of GP and
PIPE.
