Dyadic prediction methods operate on pairs of objects (dyads), aiming to
infer labels for out-of-sample dyads. We consider the full and almost full cold
start problem in dyadic prediction, a setting that occurs when both objects in
an out-of-sample dyad have not been observed during training, or if one of them
has been observed, but very few times. A popular approach for addressing this
problem is to train a model that makes predictions based on a pairwise feature
representation of the dyads, or, in case of kernel methods, based on a tensor
product pairwise kernel. As an alternative to such a kernel approach, we
introduce a novel two-step learning algorithm that borrows ideas from the
fields of pairwise learning and spectral filtering. We show theoretically that
the two-step method is very closely related to the tensor product kernel
approach, and experimentally that it yields a slightly better predictive
performance. Moreover, unlike existing tensor product kernel methods, the
two-step method allows closed-form solutions for training and parameter
selection via cross-validation estimates both in the full and almost full cold
start settings, making the approach much more efficient and straightforward to
implement.
