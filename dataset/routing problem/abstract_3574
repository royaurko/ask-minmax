In classical potential theory, one can solve the Dirichlet problem on
unbounded domains such as the upper half plane. These domains have two types of
boundary points; the usual finite boundary points and another point at
infinity. W. Woess has solved a discrete version of the Dirichlet problem on
the ends of graphs analogous to having multiple points at infinity and no
finite boundary. Whereas C. Kiselman has solved a similar version of the
Dirichlet problem on graphs analogous to bounded domains. In this work, we
combine the two ideas to solve a version of the Dirichlet problem on graphs
with finitely many ends and boundary points of the Kiselman type.
