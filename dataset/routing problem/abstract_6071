The ability to solve problems effectively is one of the hallmarks of human
cognition. Yet, in our opinion it gets far less research focus than it rightly
deserves. In this paper we outline a framework in which this effectivity can be
studied; we identify the possible roots and scope of this effectivity and the
cognitive processes directly involved. More particularly, we have observed that
people can use cognitive mechanisms to drive problem solving by the same manner
on which an optimal problem solving strategy suggested by Solomonoff (1986) is
based. Furthermore, we provide evidence for cognitive substrate hypothesis
(Cassimatis, 2006) which states that human level AI in all domains can be
achieved by a relatively small set of cognitive mechanisms. The results
presented in this paper can serve both cognitive psychology in better
understanding of human problem solving processes, and artificial intelligence
in designing more human like intelligent agents.
