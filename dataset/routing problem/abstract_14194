Results of investigation of the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the
Cauchy problems for a quasi-linear parabolic equation with a small parameter at
a higher derivative near singular points of limit solutions are presented.
Interest to the problem under consideration is explained by its applications to
a wide class of physical systems and probabilistic processes such as acoustic
waves in fluid and gas, hydrodynamical turbulence and nonlinear diffusion. The
following cases are considered: a singularity generated by a jump discontinuity
of the initial function, collision of two shock waves, gradient catastrophe,
transition of a weak discontinuity into a shock wave, a singularity generated
by a large initial gradient.
