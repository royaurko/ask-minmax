The problem of finding a finite state symbolic model which is bisimilar to a
hybrid dynamical system (HDS) and has the minimum number of states is
considered. The considered class of HDS allows for discrete-valued inputs that
only affect the jumps (events) of the HDS. Representation of the HDS in the
form of a transition system is revisited in comparison with prior works. An
algorithm is proposed for solving the problem which gives the bisimulation with
the minimum number of states if it already exists and also a parameter of the
algorithm is properly tuned. There is no need for stability assumptions and no
time discretization is applied. The results are applied to an example
