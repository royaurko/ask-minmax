This article introduces an algorithm for implicit High Dimensional Model
Representation (HDMR) of the Bellman equation. This approximation technique
reduces memory demands of the algorithm considerably. Moreover, we show that
HDMR enables fast approximate minimization which is essential for evaluation of
the Bellman function. In each time step, the problem of parametrized HDMR
minimization is relaxed into trust region problems, all sharing the same
matrix. Finding its eigenvalue decomposition, we effectively achieve estimates
of all minima. Their full-domain representation is avoided by HDMR and then the
same approach is used recursively in the next time step. An illustrative
example of N-armed bandid problem is included. We assume that the newly
established connection between approximate HDMR minimization and the trust
region problem can be beneficial also to many other applications.
