We study the bisymmetric nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem (BNIEP). This
problem is the problem of finding the necessary and sufficient conditions on a
list of $n$ complex numbers to be a spectrum of an $n \times n$ bisymmetric
nonnegative matrix. Most recently, some of the sufficient conditions for the
BNIEP are given by Julio and Soto in 2015. In this article, we give another
proof of one result (Theorem 4.3) in [Julio and Soto, 2015] and we obtain the
result very similar to the one (Theorem 4.2) in [Julio and Soto, 2015] using a
different method to construct our desired bisymmetric nonnegative matrix. We
also give some sufficient conditions for the BNIEP based on the sufficient
conditions for the nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem (NIEP) given by
Borobia in 1995. We give the condition that is both necessary and sufficient
for the BNIEP when $n \leq 4$ and then we show that for $n = 6$, the BNIEP and
the symmetric nonnegative eigenvalue problem (SNIEP) are different. Moreover,
some sufficient conditions for the bisymmetric positive inverse eigenvalue
problem are provided. Finally, we give a new result on a sufficient condition
for the BNIEP with the prescribed diagonal entries.
