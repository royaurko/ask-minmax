In this article, we focus on the analysis of discrete versions of the
Calderon problem in dimension d \geq 3. In particular, our goal is to obtain
stability estimates for the discrete Calderon problems that hold uniformly with
respect to the discretization parameter. Our approach mimics the one in the
continuous setting. Namely, we shall prove discrete Carleman estimates for the
discrete Laplace operator. A main difference with the continuous ones is that
there, the Carleman parameters cannot be taken arbitrarily large, but should be
smaller than some frequency scale depending on the mesh size. Following the
by-now classical Complex Geometric Optics (CGO) approach, we can thus derive
discrete CGO solutions, but with limited range of parameters. As in the
continuous case, we then use these solutions to obtain uniform stability
estimates for the discrete Calderon problems.
