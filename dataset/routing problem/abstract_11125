The general intractability of the constraint satisfaction problem has
motivated the study of restrictions on this problem that permit polynomial-time
solvability. One major line of work has focused on structural restrictions,
which arise from restricting the interaction among constraint scopes. In this
paper, we engage in a mathematical investigation of generalized hypertree
width, a structural measure that has up to recently eluded study. We obtain a
number of computational results, including a simple proof of the tractability
of CSP instances having bounded generalized hypertree width.
