We present a numerical study of the coupled time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii
equation, which describes the Bose-Einstein condensate of several types of
trapped bosons at ultralow temperature with both attractive and repulsive
interatomic interactions. The same approach is used to study both stationary
and time-evolution problems. We consider up to four types of atoms in the study
of stationary problems. We consider the time-evolution problems where the
frequencies of the traps or the atomic scattering lengths are suddenly changed
in a stable preformed condensate. We also study the effect of periodically
varying these frequencies or scattering lengths on a preformed condensate.
These changes introduce oscillations in the condensate which are studied in
detail. Good convergence is obtained in all cases studied.
