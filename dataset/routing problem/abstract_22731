We introduce an extension of the dynamical mean field approximation (DMFA)
which retains the causal properties and generality of the DMFA, but allows for
systematic inclusion of non-local corrections. Our technique maps the problem
to a self-consistently embedded cluster. The DMFA (exact result) is recovered
as the cluster size goes to one (infinity). As a demonstration, we study the
Falicov-Kimball model using a variety of cluster sizes. We show that the sum
rules are preserved, the spectra are positive definite, and the non-local
correlations suppress the CDW transition temperature. \
