Let $T(n)$ denote the maximum number of unit distances that a set of $n$
points in the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ can determine with the additional
condition that the distinct unit length directions determined by the
configuration must be $\mathbb{Q}$-independent. This is related to the Erdos
unit distance problem but with a simplifying additional assumption on the
direction set which holds "generically".
  We show that $T(n+1)-T(n)$ is the Hamming weight of $n$, i.e., the number of
nonzero binary coefficients in the binary expansion of $n$, and find a formula
for $T(n)$ explicitly. In particular $T(n)$ is $\Theta(n log(n))$. Furthermore
we describe a process to construct a set of $n$ points in the plane with
$\mathbb{Q}$-independent unit length direction set which achieves exactly
$T(n)$ unit distances. In the process of doing this, we show $T(n)$ is also the
same as the maximum number of edges a subset of vertices of size $n$ determines
in either the countably infinite lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{\infty}$ or the infinite
hypercube graph $\{0,1\}^{\infty}$.
  The problem of determining T(n) can be viewed as either a type of packing or
isoperimetric problem.
