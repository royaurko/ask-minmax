Below we discuss the existence of a motherbody measure for the exterior
inverse problem in potential theory in the complex plane. More exactly, we
study the question of representability almost everywhere (a.e.) in C of (a
branch of) an irreducible algebraic function as the Cauchy transform of a
signed measure supported on a finite number of compact semi-analytic curves and
a finite number of isolated points.
  Firstly, we present a large class of algebraic functions for which there
(conjecturally) always exists a positive measure with the above properties.
This class was discovered in our earlier study %of the eigenpolynomials of
exactly solvable linear differential operators. Secondly, we investigate in
detail the representability problem in the case when the Cauchy transform
satisfies a quadratic equation with polynomial coefficients a.e. in C. Several
conjectures and open problems are posed.
