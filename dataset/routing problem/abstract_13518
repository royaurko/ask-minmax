This paper considers some open questions related to the inverse problem of
pure point diffraction, in particular, what types of objects may diffract, and
which of these may exhibit the same diffraction. Some diverse objects with the
same simple lattice diffraction are constructed, including a tempered
distribution that is not a measure, and it is shown that there are uncountably
many such objects in the diffraction solution class of any pure point
diffraction measure with an infinite supporting set.
