A set of very simple rules for driving behavior used to simulate roadway
traffic gives realistic results. Because of its simplicity, it is easy to
implement the model on supercomputers (vectorizing and parallel), where we have
achieved real time limits of more than 4~million~kilometers (or more than
53~million vehicle sec/sec). The model can be used for applications where both
high simulation speed and individual vehicle resolution are needed. We use the
model for extended statistical analysis to gain insight into traffic phenomena
near capacity, and we discuss that this model is a good candidate for network
routing applications. (Submitted to Transportation Research Board Meeting, Jan.
