With increasing use of digital control it is natural to view control inputs
and outputs as stochastic processes assuming values over finite alphabets
rather than in a Euclidean space. As control over networks becomes increasingly
common, data compression by reducing the size of the input and output alphabets
without losing the fidelity of representation becomes relevant. This requires
us to define a notion of distance between two stochastic processes assuming
values in distinct sets, possibly of different cardinalities. If the two
processes are i.i.d., then the problem becomes one of defining a metric between
two probability distributions over distinct finite sets of possibly different
cardinalities. This is the problem addressed in the present paper. A metric is
defined in terms of a joint distribution on the product of the two sets, which
has the two given distributions as its marginals, and has minimum entropy.
Computing the metric exactly turns out to be NP-hard. Therefore an efficient
greedy algorithm is presented for finding an upper bound on the distance. This
problem also turns out to be NP-hard, so again a greedy algorithm is
constructed for finding a suboptimal reduced order approximation. Taken
together, all the results presented here permit the approximation of an i.i.d.
process over a set of large cardinality by another i.i.d. process over a set of
smaller cardinality. In future work, attempts will be made to extend this work
to Markov processes over finite sets.
