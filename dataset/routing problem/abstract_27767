A graph is inductive $k$-independent if there exists and ordering of its
vertices $v_{1},...,v_{n}$ such that $\alpha(G[N(v_{i})\cap V_{i}])\leq k $
where $N(v_{i})$ is the neighborhood of $v_{i}$, $V_{i}=\{v_{i},...,v_{n}\}$
and $\alpha$ is the independence number. In this article, by answering to a
question of [Y.Ye, A.Borodin, Elimination graphs, ACM Trans. Algorithms 8 (2)
(2012) 14:1-14:23], we design a polynomial time approximation algorithm with
ratio {$\overline{\Delta} \slash log(log(\overline{ \Delta}) \slash k)$ for the
maximum clique and also show that the decision version of this problem is fixed
parameter tractable for this particular family of graphs with complexity
$O(1.2127^{(p+k-1)^{k}}n)$. Then we study a subclass of inductive
$k$-independent graphs, namely $k$-degenerate graphs. A graph is $k$-degenerate
if there exists an ordering of its vertices $v_{1},...,v_{n}$ such that
$|N(v_{i})\cap V_{i}|\leq k $. Our contribution is an algorithm computing a
maximum clique for this class of graphs in time $O(1.2127^{k}(n-k+1))$, thus
improving previous best results. We also prove some structural properties for
inductive $k$-independent graphs.
