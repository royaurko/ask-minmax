We prove three results concerning convolution operators and lacunary maximal
functions associated to dilates of measures. First, we obtain an $H^1$ to
$L^{1,\infty}$ bound for lacunary maximal operators under a dimensional
assumption on the underlying measure and an assumption on an $L^p$ regularity
bound for some $p>1$. Secondly, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition
for $L^2$ boundedness of lacunary maximal operator associated to averages over
convex curves in the plane. Finally we prove an $L^p$ regularity result for
such averages. We formulate various open problems.
