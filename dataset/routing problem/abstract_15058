Long-range corrected (LC) hybrid functionals and asymptotically corrected
(AC) model potentials are two distinct density functional methods with correct
asymptotic behavior. They are known to be accurate for properties that are
sensitive to the asymptote of the exchange-correlation potential, such as the
highest occupied molecular orbital energies and Rydberg excitation energies of
molecules. To provide a comprehensive comparison, we investigate the
performance of the two schemes and others on a very wide range of applications,
including the asymptote problems, self-interaction-error problems, energy-gap
problems, charge-transfer problems, and many others. The LC hybrid scheme is
shown to consistently outperform the AC model potential scheme. In addition, to
be consistent with the molecules collected in the IP131 database [Y.-S. Lin,
C.-W. Tsai, G.-D. Li, and J.-D. Chai, J. Chem. Phys., 2012, 136, 154109], we
expand the EA115 and FG115 databases to include, respectively, the vertical
electron affinities and fundamental gaps of the additional 16 molecules, and
develop a new database AE113 (113 atomization energies), consisting of accurate
reference values for the atomization energies of the 113 molecules in IP131.
These databases will be useful for assessing the accuracy of density functional
methods.
