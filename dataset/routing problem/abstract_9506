We study the contact equivalence problem for toric contact structures on
$S^3$-bundles over $S^2$. That is, given two toric contact structures, one can
ask the question: when are they equivalent as contact structures while
inequivalent as toric contact structures? In general this appears to be a
difficult problem. To find inequivalent toric contact structures that are
contact equivalent, we show that the corresponding 3-tori belong to distinct
conjugacy classes in the contactomorphism group. To show that two toric contact
structures with the same first Chern class are contact inequivalent, we use
Morse-Bott contact homology. We treat a subclass of contact structures which
include the Sasaki-Einstein contact structures $Y^{p,q}$ studied by physicists.
In this subcase we give a complete solution to the contact equivalence problem
by showing that $Y^{p,q}$ and $Y^{p'q'}$ are inequivalent as contact structures
if and only if $p\neq p'$.
