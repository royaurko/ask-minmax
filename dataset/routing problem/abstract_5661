We consider a recently discovered representation for the general solution of
the Sturm-Liouville equation as a spectral parameter power series (SPPS). The
coefficients of the power series are given in terms of a particular solution of
the Sturm-Liouville equation with the zero spectral parameter. We show that,
among other possible applications, this provides a new and efficient numerical
method for solving initial value and boundary value problems. Moreover, due to
its convenient form the representation lends itself to numerical solution of
spectral Sturm-Liouville problems, effectively by calculation of the roots of a
polynomial. We discuss examples of the numerical implementation of the SPPS
method and show it to be equally applicable to a wide class of singular
Sturm-Liouville problems as well as to problems with spectral parameter
dependent boundary conditions.
