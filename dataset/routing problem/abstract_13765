We derive the quantitative modulus of continuity $$ \omega(r)=\left[ p+\ln
\left( \frac{r_0}{r} \right) \right]^{-\alpha (n,p)}, $$ which we conjecture to
be optimal, for solutions of the $p$-degenerate two-phase Stefan problem. Even
in the classical case $p=2$, this represents a twofold improvement with respect
to the 1984 state-of-the-art result by DiBenedetto and Friedman [J. reine
angew. Math., 1984], in the sense that we discard one logarithm iteration and
obtain an explicit value for the exponent $\alpha (n,p)$.
