This expository article, intended to be accessible to students, surveys
results about the presence or absence of zeroes of the Bergman kernel function
of a bounded domain in C^n. Six open problems are stated.
  The article is based on a lecture at the third Korean several complex
variables symposium held at the Global Analysis Research Center at Seoul
National University in December 1998.
