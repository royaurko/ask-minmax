Vecer derived a degenerate parabolic equation with a boundary condition
characterizing the price of Asian options with generally sampled average. It is
well understood that there exists a unique probabilistic solution to such a
problem but it remained unclear whether the probabilistic solution is a
classical solution. We prove that the probabilistic solutions to Vecer's PDE
are regular.
