The product landscape method has been recently proposed to solve hierarchy
problems such as the cosmological constant problem. We suggest that the
parameter distribution on logarithmic scales should be used as a benchmark for
hierarchy, and the preferred hierarchy scales can be obtained from the
distribution peak. It is shown that generating hierarchy from purely product
distribution is very inefficient. To achieve a reasonably acceptable
efficiency, other effects such as accumulation of weak hierarchy in the
effective theory should be incorporated.
