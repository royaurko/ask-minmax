We consider the sandpile model on a part of the square lattice, bounded by a
polygon. We modify the maximal stable state by adding a grain of sand at each
of the $n$ fixed points: the consequent relaxation produces pictures where we
can see tropical curves. These curves pass through the same $n$ fixed points
and solve a version of the Steiner tree problem: minimization of {\it tropical
symplectic area}. In order to show this, we develop several technics to deal
with particular integer-valued solutions of certain Dirichlet problems and to
study the continuous version of the considered relaxation which reveals an
interesting dynamics on polytopes.
