We present local existence theorem of the initial value problem for third
order semilinear dispersive partial differential equations in two space
dimensions. This type of equations arises in the study of gravity wave of deep
water, and cannot be solved by the classical energy method. To solve the
initial value problem, we make full use of pseudodifferential operators with
nonsmooth coefficients.
