Two approaches are suggested to the definition of asymmetric generalized
Weibull distribution. These approaches are based on the representation of the
two-sided Weibull distributions as variance-mean normal mixtures or more
general scale-location mixtures of the normal laws. Since both of these
mixtures can be limit laws in limit theorems for random sums of independent
random variables, these approaches can provide additional arguments in favor of
asymmetric two-sided Weibull-type models of statistical regularities observed
in some problems related to stopped random walks, in particular, in problems of
modeling the evolution of financial markets.
