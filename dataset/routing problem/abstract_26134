We prove a result on the representation of squares by second degree
polynomials in the field of $p$-adic meromorphic functions in order to solve
positively B\"uchi's $n$ squares problem in this field (that is, the problem of
the existence of a constant $M$ such that any sequence $(x_n^2)$ of $M$ - not
all constant - squares whose second difference is the constant sequence $(2)$
satisfies $x_n^2=(x+n)^2$ for some $x$). We prove (based on works by Vojta) an
analogous result for function fields of characteristic zero, and under a
Conjecture by Bombieri, an analogous result for number fields. Using an
argument by B\"uchi, we show how the obtained results improve some theorems
about undecidability for the field of $p$-adic meromorphic functions and the
ring of $p$-adic entire functions.
