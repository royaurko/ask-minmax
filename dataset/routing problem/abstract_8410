Nowadays, chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics lack research focuses. Here we
mention a few major open problems: 1. an effective description of chaos and
turbulence, 2. rough dependence on initial data, 3. arrow of time, 4. the
paradox of enrichment, 5. the paradox of pesticides, 6. the paradox of
plankton.
