We use the Legendre polynomials and the Hermite polynomials as two examples
to illustrate a simple and systematic technique on deriving asymptotic formulas
for orthogonal polynomials via recurrence relations. Another application of
this technique is to provide a solution to a problem recently raised by M. E.
