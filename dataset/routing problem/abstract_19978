We perform a perturbative analysis of the nonabelian Aharonov-Bohm problem to
one loop in a field theoretic framework, and show the necessity of contact
interactions for renormalizability of perturbation theory. Moreover at critical
values of the contact interaction strength the theory is finite and preserves
classical conformal invariance.
