Computational complexity is essential to understanding the properties of
black hole horizons. The problem of Alice creating a firewall behind the
horizon of Bob's black hole is a problem of computational complexity. In
general we find that while creating firewalls is possible, it is extremely
difficult and probably impossible for black holes that form in sudden collapse,
and then evaporate. On the other hand if the radiation is bottled up then after
an exponentially long period of time firewalls may be common. It is possible
that gravity will provide tools to study problems of complexity; especially the
range of complexity between scrambling and exponential complexity.
