The model checking problem for various fragments of first-order logic has
attracted much attention over the last two decades: in particular, for the
primitive positive and the positive Horn fragments, which are better known as
the constraint satisfaction problem and the quantified constraint satisfaction
problem, respectively. These two fragments are in fact the only ones for which
there is currently no known complexity classification. All other syntactic
fragments can be easily classified, either directly or using Schaefer's
dichotomy theorems for SAT and QSAT, with the exception of the positive
equality free fragment. This outstanding fragment can also be classified and
enjoys a tetrachotomy: according to the model, the corresponding model checking
problem is either tractable, NP-complete, co-NP-complete or Pspace-complete.
Moreover, the complexity drop is always witnessed by a generic solving
algorithm which uses quantifier relativisation. Furthermore, its complexity is
characterised by algebraic means: the presence or absence of specific
surjective hyper-operations among those that preserve the model characterise
the complexity.
