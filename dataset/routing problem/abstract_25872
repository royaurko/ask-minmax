Integer factorization is one of the vital algorithms discussed as a part of
analysis of any black-box cipher suites where the cipher algorithm is based on
number theory. The origin of the problem is from Discrete Logarithmic Problem
which appears under the analysis of the crypto-graphic algorithms as seen by a
crypt-analyst. The integer factorization algorithm poses a potential in
computational science too, obtaining the factors of a very large number is
challenging with a limited computing infrastructure. This paper analyses the
Pollards Rho heuristic with a varying input size to evaluate the performance
under a multi-core environment and also to estimate the threshold for each
computing infrastructure.
