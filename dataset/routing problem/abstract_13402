We consider the classical problem of estimating norms of higher order
derivatives of algebraic polynomial via the norms of polynomial itself. The
corresponding extremal problem for general polynomials in uniform norm was
solved by A. A. Markov. In $1926,$ Bernstein found the exact constant in the
Markov inequality for monotone polynomials. T. Erdelyi showed that the order of
the constants in constrained Markov-Nikolskii inequality for $k-$ absolutely
monotone polynomials is the same as in the classical one in case $0<p\le
q\le\infty.$ In this paper, we find the exact order for all values of
$0<p,q\le\infty.$ It turned out that for the case $q<p$ constrained
Markov-Nikolskii inequality can be significantly improved.
