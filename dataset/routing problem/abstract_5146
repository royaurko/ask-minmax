The Newtonian n-Body Problem is modified assuming positive inertial masses
but different sign for the interacting force which is assumed with the
possibility of two different signs for the gravitational masses, according to
the prescription two masses with same sign attract one to the other, two masses
of different sign repel one to the other. As in electrostatics the signed mass
is called charge. The inertial mass is always positive. The two body problem
behaves as the similar Coulomb problem of charged particles with two equal
charges. The solution is a central configuration with almost same behavior that
the Newton two-body problem for hyperbolic orbits. The 3-Body problem was found
with collinear solutions. The four body case of charged central configurations
has only the planar [1] and collinear solutions.
