The interface problem describing the scattering of time-harmonic
electromagnetic waves by a dielectric body is often formulated as a pair of
coupled boundary integral equations for the electric and magnetic current
densities on the interface $\Gamma$. In this paper, following an idea developed
by Kleinman and Martin \cite{KlMa} for acoustic scattering problems, we
consider methods for solving the dielectric scattering problem using a single
integral equation over $\Gamma$ for a single unknown density. One knows that
such boundary integral formulations of the Maxwell equations are not uniquely
solvable when the exterior wave number is an eigenvalue of an associated
interior Maxwell boundary value problem. We obtain four different families of
integral equations for which we can show that by choosing some parameters in an
appropriate way, they become uniquely solvable for all real frequencies. We
analyze the well-posedness of the integral equations in the space of finite
energy on smooth and non-smooth boundaries.
