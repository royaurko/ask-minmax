The occurrence of glass transition is believed to be associated to
cooperative motion with a growing length scale with decreasing temperature. We
provide a novel route to calculate the size of cooperatively rearranging
regions CRR of glass-forming polymers combining the Adam-Gibbs theory of the
glass transition with the self-concentration concept. To do so we explore the
dynamics of glass-forming polymers in different environments. The material
specific parameter $\alpha$ connecting the size of the CRR to the
configurational entropy is obtained in this way. Thereby, the size of CRR can
be precisely quantified in absolute values. This size results to be in the
range 1 $\div$ 3 nm at the glass transition temperature depending on the
glass-forming polymer.
