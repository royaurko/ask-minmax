We consider approximate Bayesian model choice for model selection problems
that involve models whose Fisher-information matrices may fail to be invertible
along other competing submodels. Such singular models do not obey the
regularity conditions underlying the derivation of Schwarz's Bayesian
information criterion (BIC) and the penalty structure in BIC generally does not
reflect the frequentist large-sample behavior of their marginal likelihood.
While large-sample theory for the marginal likelihood of singular models has
been developed recently, the resulting approximations depend on the true
parameter value and lead to a paradox of circular reasoning. Guided by examples
such as determining the number of components of mixture models, the number of
factors in latent factor models or the rank in reduced-rank regression, we
propose a resolution to this paradox and give a practical extension of BIC for
singular model selection problems.
