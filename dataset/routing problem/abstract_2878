The Paulsen Problem in Hilbert space frame theory has proved to be one of the
most intractable problems in the field. We will help explain why by showing
that this problem is equivalent to a fundamental, deep problem in operator
theory. Along the way we will give a new exact computation for chordal
distances, we will give a generalization of these problems and we will spell
out exactly the complementary versions of the problem.
