State statistics of linear systems satisfy certain structural constraints
that arise from the underlying dynamics and the directionality of input
disturbances. In the present paper we study the problem of completing partially
known state statistics. The dynamical interaction between state variables is
known while the directionality of input excitation is uncertain. Thus, the goal
of the inverse problem that we formulate is to identify the dynamics and
directionality of input excitation so as to explain the observed sample
statistics. In particular, we seek to explain the data with the least number of
possible input disturbance channels. This can be formulated as a rank
minimization problem, and for its solution, we employ a convex relaxation based
on the nuclear norm. The resulting optimization problem can be cast as a
semidefinite program and solved efficiently using general-purpose solvers for
small- and medium-size problems. We develop a customized alternating
minimization algorithm to solve the problem for large-scale systems. We provide
an example to illustrate that identified colored-in-time stochastic
disturbances represent an effective means for explaining available second-order
state statistics.
