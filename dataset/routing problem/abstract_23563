We propose a partial solution to the cosmological constant problem by using
the simple observation that a three-brane in a six-dimensional bulk is flat. A
model is presented in which Standard Model vacuum energy is always absorbed by
the transverse space. The latter is a tear-drop like space with a conical
singularity, which preserves bulk supersymmetry and gives rise to conventional
macroscopic 4D gravity with no cosmological constant. Its cone acts like a
drain, depleting vacuum energy from the three-brane to the tear drop increasing
its volume. We stress that although gravity is treated classically, Standard
Model is handled quantum-field theoretically and the model is robust against
Standard Model corrections and particular details. The price paid is the
presence of boundaries which are nevertheless physically harmless by
appropriate boundary conditions.
