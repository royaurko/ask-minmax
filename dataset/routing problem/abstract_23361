The problem of evaluating the cross section of production of large black
holes in particle collisions at trans-Planckian energies is revisited. It is
argued that the geometric cross section claimed in the literature would in fact
lead to an exponentially growing with energy total cross section dominated by
production of many "small" black holes. On the other hand, the semiclassical
treatment of this problem, leading to an exponentially suppressed cross section
for production of large black holes, requires that in the classical limit the
cross section vanishes for massless colliding particles. The latter behavior
can in principle be probed by numerical simulations in the classical general
relativity.
