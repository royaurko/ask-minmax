The flatness and cosmological constant problems are solved with varying speed
of light c, gravitational coupling strength G and cosmological parameter
Lambda, by explicitly assuming energy conservation of observed matter. The
present solution to the flatness problem is the same as the previous solution
in which energy conservation was absent.
