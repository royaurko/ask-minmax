In this paper, we prove the local uniqueness of an inverse problem arising in
the nonstationary flow of a nonhomogeneous incompressible asymmetric fluid in a
bounded domain with smooth boundary. The direct problem is an initial-boundary
value problem for a system for the velocity field, the angular velocity of
rotation of the fluid particles, the mass density and the pressure
distribution. The inverse problem consists in the external force recover
assuming an integral measurements on the boundary. We characterize the inverse
problem solutions using an operator equation of second kind, which is deduced
form the application of the Helmholtz decomposition. We introduce several
estimates which implies the hypothesis of the Tikhonov fixed point theorem.
