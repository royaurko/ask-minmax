In this work, we focus on separable convex optimization problems with box
constraints and a set of triangular linear constraints. The solution is given
in closed-form as a function of some Lagrange multipliers that can be computed
through an iterative procedure in a finite number of steps. Graphical
interpretations are given casting valuable insights into the proposed algorithm
and allowing to retain some of the intuition spelled out by the water-filling
policy. It turns out that it is not only general enough to compute the solution
to different instances of the problem at hand but also remarkably simple in the
way it operates. We also show how some power allocation problems in signal
processing and communications can be solved with the proposed algorithm.
