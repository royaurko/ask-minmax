The boundary knot method (BKM) [1] is a meshless boundary-type radial basis
function (RBF) collocation scheme, where the nonsingular general solution is
used instead of fundamental solution to evaluate the homogeneous solution,
while the dual reciprocity method (DRM) is employed to approximation of
particular solution. Despite the fact that there are not nonsingular RBF
general solutions available for Laplace and biharmonic problems, this study
shows that the method can be successfully applied to these problems. The
high-order general and fundamental solutions of Burger and Winkler equations
are also first presented here.
