Isotope frequency shifts of local pair modes due to B$^{10}$ (B$^{11}$)
substitutional and H (D) interstitial in crystalline silicon are calculated as
a many body problem with a simple model and found to be in agreement with
experiment. A comparison of the obtained results is made with other theoretical
calculations.
