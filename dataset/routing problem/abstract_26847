Many systems for which compressive sensing is used today are dynamical. The
common approach is to neglect the dynamics and see the problem as a sequence of
independent problems. This approach has two disadvantages. Firstly, the
temporal dependency in the state could be used to improve the accuracy of the
state estimates. Secondly, having an estimate for the state and its support
could be used to reduce the computational load of the subsequent step. In the
linear Gaussian setting, compressive sensing was recently combined with the
Kalman filter to mitigate above disadvantages. In the nonlinear dynamical case,
compressive sensing can not be used and, if the state dimension is high, the
particle filter would perform poorly. In this paper we combine one of the most
novel developments in compressive sensing, nonlinear compressive sensing, with
the particle filter. We show that the marriage of the two is essential and that
neither the particle filter or nonlinear compressive sensing alone gives a
satisfying solution.
