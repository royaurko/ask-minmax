We study the problem of particles undergoing Brownian motion in an expanding
sphere whose surface is an absorbing boundary for the particles. The problem is
akin to that of the diffusion of impurities in a grain of polycrystalline
material undergoing grain growth. We solve the time dependent diffusion
equation for particles in a d-dimensional expanding sphere to obtain the
particle density function (function of space and time). The survival rate or
the total number of particles per unit volume as a function of time is
evaluated. We have obtained particular solutions exactly for the case where d=3
and a parabolic growth of the sphere. Asymptotic solutions for the particle
density when the sphere growth rate is small relative to particle diffusivity
and vice versa are derived.
