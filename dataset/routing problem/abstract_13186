We consider models of inflection point inflation. The main drawback of such
models is that they suffer from the overshoot problem. Namely the initial
condition should be fine tuned to be near the inflection point for the universe
to inflate. We show that stringy realizations of inflection point inflation are
common and offer a natural resolution to the overshoot problem.
