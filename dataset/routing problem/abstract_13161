A modified $k$-deck of a graph is obtained by removing $k$ edges in all
possible ways and adding $k$ (not necessarily new) edges in all possible ways.
Krasikov and Roditty used these decks to give an independent proof of
M\"uller's result on the edge reconstructibility of graphs. They asked if a
$k$-edge deck could be constructed from its modified $k$-deck. In this paper,
we solve the problem when $k=1$. We also offer new proofs of Lov\'asz's result,
one describing the constructed graph explicitly, (thus answering a question of
Bondy), and another based on the eigenvalues of Johnson graph.
