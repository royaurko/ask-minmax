A semi-infinite material under a solidification process with the
Solomon-Wilson- Alexiades's mushy zone model with a heat flux condition at the
fixed boundary is considered. The associated free boundary problem is
overspecified through a convective boundary condition with the aim of the
simultaneous determination of the temperature, the two free boundaries of the
mushy zone and one thermal coefficient among the latent heat by unit mass, the
thermal conductivity, the mass density, the specific heat and the two
coefficients that characterize the mushy zone. Bulk temperature and
coefficients which characterize the heat flux and the heat transfer at the
boundary are assumed to be determined experimentally. Explicit formulae for the
unknowns are given for the resulting six phase-change problems, beside
necessary and sufficient conditions on data in order to obtain them. In
addition, relationship between the phase-change process solved in this paper
with an analogous process overspecified by a temperature boundary condition is
presented, and this second problem is solved by considering a large heat
transfer coefficient at the boundary in the problem with the convective
boundary condition. Formulae for the unknown thermal coefficients corresponding
to both problems are summarized in two tables.
