Abduction is one of the most important forms of reasoning; it has been
successfully applied to several practical problems such as diagnosis. In this
paper we investigate whether the computational complexity of abduction can be
reduced by an appropriate use of preprocessing. This is motivated by the fact
that part of the data of the problem (namely, the set of all possible
assumptions and the theory relating assumptions and manifestations) are often
known before the rest of the problem. In this paper, we show some complexity
results about abduction when compilation is allowed.
