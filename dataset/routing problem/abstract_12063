In this paper we investigate a problem of state estimation for the dynamical
system described by the linear operator equation with unknown parameters in
Hilbert space. We present explicit expressions for linear minimax estimation
and error provided that any pair of uncertain parameters belongs to the
quadratic bounding set. As an application of the main result we present the
solution of minimax estimation problem for the linear descriptor differential
equation with constant matrices.
