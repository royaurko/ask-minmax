A famous problem posed by Diophantus was to find sets of distinct positive
rational numbers such that the product of any two is one less than a rational
square. Such Diophantine sets have been used to construct high rank elliptic
curves. Here I demonstrate a link with Cayley's hyperdeterminants which
provides a fruitful generalisation of Diophantine quadruples.
