We establish some quantitative concentration estimates for the empirical
measure of many independent variables, in transportation distances. As an
application, we provide some error bounds for particle simulations in a model
mean field problem. The tools include coupling arguments, as well as regularity
and moments estimates for solutions of certain diffusive partial differential
equations.
