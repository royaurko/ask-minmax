Many people expect the Internet to change American politics, most likely in
the direction of increasing direct citizen participation and forcing government
officials to respond more quickly to voter concerns. A recent California
initiative with these objectives would contributorize use of encrypted digital
signatures over the Internet to qualify candidates, initiatives, and other
ballot measures. Proponents of Internet signature gathering say it will
significantly lower the cost of qualifying initiatives and thereby reduce the
influence of organized, well-financed interest groups. They also believe it
will increase both public participation in the political process and public
understanding about specific measures. However, opponents question whether
Internet security is adequate to prevent widespread abuse and argue that the
measure would create disadvantages for those who lack access to the Internet.
Beyond issues of security, cost, and access lie larger questions about the
effects of Internet signature gathering on direct democracy. Would it encourage
greater and more informed public participation in the political process? Or
would it flood voters with ballot measures and generally worsen current
problems with the initiative process itself? Because we lack good data on these
questions, answers to them today are largely conjectural. We can be fairly
sure, however, that Internet petition signing, like Internet voting, will have
unintended consequences.
