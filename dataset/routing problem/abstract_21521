Yoon et al. proposed a new efficient remote user authentication scheme using
smart cards to solve the security problems of W. C. Ku and S. M. Chen scheme.
This paper reviews Yoon et al. scheme and then proves that the password change
phase of Yoon et al. scheme is still insecure. This paper also proves that the
Yoon et al. is still vulnerable to parallel session attack.
