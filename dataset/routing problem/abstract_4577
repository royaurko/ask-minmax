We apply the analytic-numerical method of Roberts to determine the linear
stability of time-reversible periodic simultaneous binary collision orbits in
the symmetric collinear four body problem with masses 1, m, m, 1, and also in a
symmetric planar four-body problem with equal masses. For the collinear
problem, this verifies the earlier numerical results of Sweatman for linear
stability.
