I review the development of numerical evolution codes for general relativity
based upon the characteristic initial value problem. Progress is traced from
the early stage of 1D feasibility studies to current 3D black codes that
simulate binary black holes. A prime application of characteristic evolution is
Cauchy-characteristic matching, which is also reviewed.
