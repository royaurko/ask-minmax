We present a novel technique to obtain relativistic corrections to the
central force problem in the Lagrangian formulation, using a generalized
potential energy function. We derive a general expression for a generalized
potential energy function for all powers of the velocity, which when made a
part of the regular classical Lagrangian can reproduce the correct
(relativistic) force equation. We then go on to derive the Hamiltonian and
estimate the corrections to the total energy of the system up to the fourth
power in $|\vec{v}|/c$. We found that our work is able to provide a more
comprehensive understanding of relativistic corrections to the central force
results and provides corrections to both the kinetic and potential energy of
the system. We employ our methodology to calculate relativistic corrections to
the circular orbit under the gravitational force and also the first-order
corrections to the ground state energy of the hydrogen atom using a
semi-classical approach. Our predictions in both problems give reasonable
agreement with the known results. Thus we feel that this work has pedagogical
value and can be used by undergraduate students to better understand the
central force and the relativistic corrections to it.
