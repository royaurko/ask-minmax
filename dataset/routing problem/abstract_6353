Scattering properties of a material are changed when the material is injected
with small acoustically soft particles. It is shown that its new scattering
behavior can be understood as a solution of a potential scattering problem with
the potential $q$ explicitly related to the density of the small particles. In
this paper we examine the inverse problem of designing a material with the
desired focusing properties. An algorithm for such a problem is examined from
the theoretical as well as from the numerical perspective.
