The Levi-Civita transformation is applied in the two-dimensional (2D) Dirac
and Klein-Gordon (KG) equations with equal external scalar and vector
potentials. The Coulomb and harmonic oscillator problems are connected via the
Levi-Civita transformation. These connections lead to an approach to solve the
Coulomb problems using the results of the harmonic oscillator potential in the
above-mentioned relativistic systems.
