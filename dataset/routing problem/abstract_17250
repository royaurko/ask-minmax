We investigate the downlink multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) scheduling problem in
the presence of imperfect Channel State Information at the transmitter (CSIT)
that comprises of coarse and current CSIT as well as finer but delayed CSIT.
This scheduling problem is characterized by an intricate `exploitation -
exploration tradeoff' between scheduling the users based on current CSIT for
immediate gains, and scheduling them to obtain finer albeit delayed CSIT and
potentially larger future gains. We solve this scheduling problem by
formulating a frame based joint scheduling and feedback approach, where in each
frame a policy is obtained as the solution to a Markov Decision Process. We
prove that our proposed approach can be made arbitrarily close to the optimal
and then demonstrate its significant gains over conventional MU-MIMO
scheduling.
