A comprehensive approach for real-time computations using a database of
parameterized linear reduced-order models (ROMs) is proposed. The method
proceeds by sampling offline ROMs for specific values of the parameters and
interpolating online the associated reduced operators. In the offline phase, a
pre-processing step transforms the reduced operators into consistent sets of
generalized coordinates prior to their interpolation. The present paper also
introduces a consistency enforcement approach for models defined on arbitrary
underlying meshes. In the online phase, the operators are interpolated on
matrix manifolds. The proposed framework is illustrated on two realistic
multi-physics problems: an inverse acoustic scattering problem around a
submarine and flutter predictions for a wing-tank system. The second
application is implemented on a mobile device, illustrating the capability of
the proposed framework to operate in real-time.
