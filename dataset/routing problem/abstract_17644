This work concerns the use of the iterative algorithm (KMF algorithm)
proposed by Kozlov, Mazya and Fomin to solve the Cauchy problem for Laplaces
equation. This problem consists to recovering the lacking data on some part of
the boundary using the over specified conditions on the other part of the
boundary. We describe an alternating formulation of the KMF algorithm and its
relationship with a classical formulation. The implementation of this algorithm
for a regular domain is performed by the finite element method using the
software Freefem. The numerical tests developed show the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm since it allows to have more accurate results as well as
reducing the number of iterations needed for convergence.
