This paper studies the third boundary problem of the Laplace equation with
azimuthal symmetry.Many solutions of the boundary value problems in spherical
coordinates are available in the form of infinite series of Legendre
polynomials but the evaluation of the summing series shows many computational
difficulties. Integral transform is a challenge as it involves an inverse
Legendre transform. Here, the closed-form solution of the Laplace equation with
the Robin boundary conditions on a sphere is solved by the Legendre transform.
This analytical solution is expressed with the Appell hypergeometric function
F1. The Robin boundary conditions is a weighted combination of Dirichlet
boundary conditions and Neumann boundary conditions. In many experimental
approaches, this weight h, the Robin coefficient, is the main unknown parameter
for example in transport phenomena where the Robin coefficient is the
dimensionless Biot number. The usefulness of this formula is illustrated by
some examples of inverse problems in mass and heat transfer, in optics, in
corrosion detection and in physical geodesy. This result is also useful to
validate numerical methods.
