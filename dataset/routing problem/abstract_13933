A variable speed of light (VSL) cosmology is developed with a spontaneous
breaking of Lorentz invariance in the early universe. The initial value
problems of cosmology are solved: the horizon and flatness problems. The model
predicts primordial scalar and tensor fluctuation spectral indices $n_s=0.96$
and $n_t=- 0.04$, respectively.
