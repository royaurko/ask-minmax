In this study, we consider a linear differential equation with fuzzy boundary
values. We express the solution of the problem in terms of a fuzzy set of crisp
real functions. Each real function from the solution set satisfies differential
equation, and its boundary values belong to intervals, determined by the
corresponding fuzzy numbers. The least possibility among possibilities of
boundary values in corresponding fuzzy sets is defined as the possibility of
the real function in the fuzzy solution. In order to find the fuzzy solution we
propose a method based on the properties of linear transformations. We show
that, if the corresponding crisp problem has a unique solution then the fuzzy
problem has unique solution too. We also prove that if the boundary values are
triangular fuzzy numbers, then the value of the solution at any time is also a
triangular fuzzy number. We find that the fuzzy solution determined by our
method is the same as the one that is obtained from solution of crisp problem
by the application of the extension principle. We present two examples
describing the proposed method.
