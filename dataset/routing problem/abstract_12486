This paper focuses on the problem of the estimation of the cumulative hazard
function of a distribution on a general complete separable metric space when
the data points are subject to censoring by an arbitrary adapted random set. A
problem involving observability of the estimator proposed in [8] and [9] is
resolved and a functional central limit theorem is proven for the revised
estimator. Several examples and applications are discussed, and the validity of
bootstrap methods is established in each case.
