I briefly review the arguments why the braneworld models with infinite-volume
extra dimensions could solve the cosmological constant problem, evading
Weinberg's no-go theorem. Then I discuss in detail the established properties
of these models, as well as the features which should be studied further in
order to conclude whether these models can truly solve the problem. This
article is dedicated to the memory of Ian Kogan.
