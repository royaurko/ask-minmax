In recent years, finding new satisfiability algorithms for various circuit
classes has been a very active line of research. Despite considerable progress,
we are still far away from a definite answer on which circuit classes allow
fast satisfiability algorithms. This survey takes a (far from exhaustive) look
at some recent satisfiability algorithms for a range of circuit classes and
high- lights common themes. A special focus is given to connections between
satisfiability algorithms and circuit lower bounds. A second focus is on
reductions from satisfiability algorithms to a range of polynomial time
problems, such as matrix multiplication and the Vector Domination Problem.
