Cyber-physical systems, such as mobile robots, must respond adaptively to
dynamic operating conditions. Effective operation of these systems requires
that sensing and actuation tasks are performed in a timely manner.
Additionally, execution of mission specific tasks such as imaging a room must
be balanced against the need to perform more general tasks such as obstacle
avoidance. This problem has been addressed by maintaining relative utilization
of shared resources among tasks near a user-specified target level. Producing
optimal scheduling strategies requires complete prior knowledge of task
behavior, which is unlikely to be available in practice. Instead, suitable
scheduling strategies must be learned online through interaction with the
system. We consider the sample complexity of reinforcement learning in this
domain, and demonstrate that while the problem state space is countably
infinite, we may leverage the problem's structure to guarantee efficient
learning.
