Any new scalar fields that perturbatively solve the hierarchy problem by
stabilizing the Higgs mass also generate new contributions to the Higgs
field-strength renormalization, irrespective of their gauge representation.
These new contributions are physical and their magnitude can be inferred from
the requirement of quadratic divergence cancellation, hence they are directly
related to the resolution of the hierarchy problem. Upon canonically
normalizing the Higgs field these new contributions lead to modifications of
Higgs couplings which are typically great enough that the hierarchy problem and
the concept of electroweak naturalness can be probed thoroughly within a
precision Higgs program. Specifically, at a Linear Collider this can be
achieved through precision measurements of the Higgs associated production
cross-section. This would lead to indirect constraints on perturbative
solutions to the hierarchy problem in the broadest sense, even if the relevant
new fields are gauge singlets.
