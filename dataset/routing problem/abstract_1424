An insulator to metal transition below 240K is induced by applying a 7T
magnetic field in Pr0.5Ca0.5MnO3 thin films grown by the Pulsed Laser
Deposition technique on (100) SrTiO3 substrates. This value of the melting
magnetic field, much lower that the one required in bulk (20T), is assumed to
be an effect of the tensile stress. These results confirm the importance of the
bandwidth in the control of the physical properties of this compound and open
the route to get colossal magnetoresistive properties by using strain effects.
