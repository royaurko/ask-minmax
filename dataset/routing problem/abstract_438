Mobility in wireless networks causes a major issue from the IP-addressing
perspective. When a Mobile Node (MN) moves to another subnet, it will probably
get assigned a new IP address. This causes a routing problem since the MN will
not be reachable with its previous IP address known to the other communication
party. Real time applications might suffer from connection drops, which is
recognized as inconvenience in the currently used service, unless some solution
is provided. An approach to maintain session continuity while traversing
heterogeneous networks of different subnet addresses is proposed. Here, a
cross-layer module is implemented in OMNeT++ with NAT functionality to provide
a seamless handover. A proof of concept is also shown with analogy to the
Mobile IPv6 protocol provided in INET.
