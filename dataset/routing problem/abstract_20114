We study the inviscid Burgers equation in the presence of spatially periodic
potential force. We prove that for foliated initial value problem there are
always solutions developing shocks in a finite time.
  We give an application of this result to a quasi-linear system of
conservation laws which appeared in the study of integrable Hamiltonian systems
with 1.5 degrees of freedom.
