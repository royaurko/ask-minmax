We deal with a system of two coupled differential equations, describing the
evolution of a first order phase transition. In particular, we have two
non-linear parabolic equations: the first one is deduced from a balance law for
entropy and it describes the evolution of the absolute temperature; the other
one is an equilibrium equation for microforces and it regulates the behaviour
of a scalar phase parameter. Moreover, the second equation shows a
time-relaxation coefficient related to the time-derivative of the phase
parameter.
  We prove well-posedness of solution to the given system, using a standard
method of approximating problems; afterwards, we study the behaviour of the
system as the time-relaxation coefficient tends to zero: as a result, we find
out that the original problem converges to a new problem, with a stationary
phase equation.
