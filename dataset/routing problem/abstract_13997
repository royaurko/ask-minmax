Formulating a Schubert problem as the solutions to a system of equations in
either Pl\"ucker space or in the local coordinates of a Schubert cell typically
involves more equations than variables. We present a novel primal-dual
formulation of any Schubert problem on a Grassmannian or flag manifold as a
system of bilinear equations with the same number of equations as variables.
This formulation enables numerical computations in the Schubert calculus to be
certified using algorithms based on Smale's \alpha-theory.
