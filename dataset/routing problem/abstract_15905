In the present paper, a class of partial differential equations related to
various plate and rod problems is studied by Lie transformation group methods.
A system of equations determining the generators of the admitted point Lie
groups (symmetries) is derived. A general statement of the associated
group-classification problem is given. A simple intrinsic relation is deduced
allowing to recognize easily the variational symmetries among the ''ordinary''
symmetries of a self-adjoint equation of the class examined. Explicit formulae
for the conserved currents of the corresponding (via Noether's theorem)
conservation laws are suggested. Solutions of group-classification problems are
presented for subclasses of equations of the foregoing type governing stability
and vibration of plates, rods and fluid conveying pipes resting on variable
elastic foundations and compressed by axial forces. The obtained
group-classification results are used to derive conservation laws and
group-invariant solutions readily applicable in plate statics or rod dynamics.
