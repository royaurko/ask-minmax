Self-similar solutions to the problem of a strong imploding relativistic
shock wave are calculated. These solutions represent the relativistic
generalisation of the Newtonian Gouderley-Landau-Stanyukovich problem of a
strong imploding spherical shock wave converging to a centre. The solutions are
found assuming that the pre-shocked flow has a uniform density, and are
accurate for sufficiently large times after the formation of the shock wave.
