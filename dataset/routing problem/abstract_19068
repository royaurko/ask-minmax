This paper investigates the distributed power allocation problem for
coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmissions in distributed antenna systems
(DAS). Traditional duality based optimization techniques cannot be directly
applied to this problem, because the non-strict concavity of the CoMP
transmission's achievable rate with respect to the transmission power induces
that the local power allocation subproblems have non-unique optimum solutions.
We propose a distributed power allocation algorithm to resolve this non-strict
concavity difficulty. This algorithm only requires local information exchange
among neighboring base stations serving the same user, and is thus scalable as
the network size grows. The step-size parameters of this algorithm are
determined by only local user access relationship (i.e., the number of users
served by each antenna), but do not rely on channel coefficients. Therefore,
the convergence speed of this algorithm is quite robust to different channel
fading coefficients. We rigorously prove that this algorithm converges to an
optimum solution of the power allocation problem. Simulation results are
presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed power allocation
algorithm.
