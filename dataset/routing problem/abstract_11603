For the Cauchy problem for an operator differential equation of the form
$y'(z) = Ay(z)$, where $A$ is a closed linear operator on a Banach space over
the completion of an algebraic closure of the field of $p$-adic numbers, a
criterion of correct solvability in the class of locally analytic
vector-functions is established. It is shown how the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya
theorem for $p$-adic partial differential equations may be obtained as a
particular case from this criterion.
