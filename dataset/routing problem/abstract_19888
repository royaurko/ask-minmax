The problem of large-scale correlations of particles produced in high-energy
collisions is discussed. Among them are, e.g., those correlations which lead to
ring-like and elliptic flow shapes of individual high-multiplicity events in
the polar+azimuthal angles plane. The wavelet method of analysis which allows
to disentangle various patterns is proposed and applied to central Pb-Pb
collisions at 158A GeV.
