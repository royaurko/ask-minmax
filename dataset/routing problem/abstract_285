Routing packets opportunistically is an essential part of multihop ad hoc
wireless sensor networks. The existing routing techniques are not adaptive
opportunistic. In this paper we have proposed an adaptive opportunistic routing
scheme that routes packets opportunistically in order to ensure that packet
loss is avoided. Learning and routing are combined in the framework that
explores the optimal routing possibilities. In this paper we implemented this
Reinforced learning framework using a customer simulator. The experimental
results revealed that the scheme is able to exploit the opportunistic to
optimize routing of packets even though the network structure is unknown.
