We will report some results concerning the Yamabe problem and the Nirenberg
problem. Related topics will also be discussed. Such studies have led to new
results on some conformally invariant fully nonlinear equations arising from
geometry. We will also present these results which include some Liouville type
theorems, Harnack type inequalities, existence and compactness of solutions to
some nonlinear version of the Yamabe problem.
