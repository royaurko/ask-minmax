Besides their astrophysical interest, compact stars also provide an arena for
understanding the properties of theories of gravity that differ from Einstein's
general relativity. Numerous studies have shown that different modified
theories of gravity can modify the bulk properties (such as mass and radius) of
neutron stars for given assumptions on the microphysics. What is not usually
stressed though is the strong degeneracy in the predictions of these theories
for the stellar mass and radius. Motivated by this observation, in this paper
we take an alternative route and construct a stellar structure formalism which,
without adhering to any particular theory of gravity, describes in a simple
parametrized form the departure from compact stars in general relativity. This
"post-Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV)" formalism for spherical static stars is
inspired by the well-known parametrized post-Newtonian theory, extended to
second post-Newtonian order by adding suitable correction terms to the fully
relativistic TOV equations. We show how neutron star properties are modified
within our formalism, paying special attention to the effect of each correction
term. We also show that the formalism is equivalent to general relativity with
an "effective" (gravity-modified) equation of state.
