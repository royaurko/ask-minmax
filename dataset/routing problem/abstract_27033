We re-address the problem of construction of new infinite-dimensional
completely integrable systems on the basis of known ones, and we reveal a
working mechanism for such transitions. By splitting the problem's solution in
two steps, we explain how the classical technique of Gardner's deformations
facilitates -- in a regular way -- making the first, nontrivial move, in the
course of which the drafts of new systems are created (often, of hydrodynamic
type). The other step then amounts to higher differential order extensions of
symbols in the intermediate hierarchies (e.g., by using the techniques of
Dubrovin et al. [1,2] and Ferapontov et al. [3,4]).
