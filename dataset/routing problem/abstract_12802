Recently it was shown that kink baryons and kink-antikink scattering in the
massless Gross-Neveu model are closely related to one- and two-soliton
solutions of the sinh-Gordon equation. Here we generalize these findings to the
case of n kinks and antikinks. Using the known n soliton solution of the
sinh-Gordon equation, we solve the general n kink-antikink scattering problem
in the large N Gross-Neveu model analytically, mapping the time-dependent
Hartree-Fock approach onto inverse scattering theory.
