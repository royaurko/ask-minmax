We study a nonlocal diffusion operator in a bounded smooth domain prescribing
the flux through the boundary. This problem may be seen as a generalization of
the usual Neumann problem for the heat equation. First, we prove existence,
uniqueness and a comparison principle. Next, we study the behavior of solutions
for some prescribed boundary data including blowing up ones. Finally, we look
at a nonlinear flux boundary condition.
