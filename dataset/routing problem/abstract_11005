A problem of the crossover from percolation to diffusion transport is
considered. A general scaling theory is proposed. It introduces
phenomenologically four critical exponents which are connected by two
equations. One exponent is completely new. It describes the increase of the
diffusion below percolation threshold. As an example, an exact solution of one
dimensional lattice problem is given. In this case the new exponent $q=2$.
