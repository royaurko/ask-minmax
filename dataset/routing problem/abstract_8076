In this paper we study the nonzero-sum Dynkin game in continuous time which
is a two player non-cooperative game on stopping times. We show that it has a
Nash equilibrium point for general stochastic processes. As an application, we
consider the problem of pricing American game contingent claims by the utility
maximization approach.
