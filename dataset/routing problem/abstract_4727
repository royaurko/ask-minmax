In this paper, we introduce a system of split variational inequality problems
in real Hilbert spaces. Using projection method, we propose an iterative
algorithm for the system of split variational inequality problems. Further, we
prove that the sequence generated by the iterative algorithm converges strongly
to a solution of the system of split variational inequality problems.
Furthermore, we discuss some consequences of the main result. The iterative
algorithms and results presented in this paper generalize, unify and improve
the previously known results of this area.
