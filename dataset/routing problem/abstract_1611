The electronic nematic order characterized by broken rotational symmetry has
been suggested to play an important role in the phase diagram of the high
temperature cuprates. We study the interplay between the electronic nematic
order and a spin density wave order in the presence of a magnetic field. We
show that a cooperation of the nematicity and the magnetic field induces a
finite coupling between the spin density wave and spin-triplet staggered flux
orders. As a consequence of such a coupling, the magnon gap decreases as the
magnetic field increases, and it eventually condenses beyond a critical
magnetic field leading to a field-induced spin density wave order. Both
commensurate and incommensurate orders are studied, and the experimental
implications of our findings are discussed.
