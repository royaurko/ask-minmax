Erik Verlinde recently proposed an idea about the thermodynamic origin of
gravity. Though this is a beautiful idea which may resolve many long standing
problems in the theories of gravity, it also raises many other problems. In
this article I will comment on some of the problems of Verlinde's proposal with
special emphasis on the thermodynamical origin of the principle of relativity.
It is found that there is a large group of hidden symmetries of thermodynamics
which contains the Poincare group of the spacetime for which space is emergent.
This explains the thermodynamic origin of the principle of relativity.
