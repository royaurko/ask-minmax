We prove some old and new isoperimetric inequalities with the best constant
using the ABP method applied to an appropriate linear Neumann problem. More
precisely, we obtain a new family of sharp isoperimetric inequalities with
weights (also called densities) in open convex cones of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Our
result applies to all nonnegative homogeneous weights satisfying a concavity
condition in the cone. Remarkably, Euclidean balls centered at the origin
(intersected with the cone) minimize the weighted isoperimetric quotient, even
if all our weights are nonradial ---except for the constant ones.
  We also study the anisotropic isoperimetric problem in convex cones for the
same class of weights. We prove that the Wulff shape (intersected with the
cone) minimizes the anisotropic weighted perimeter under the weighted volume
constraint.
  As a particular case of our results, we give new proofs of two classical
results: the Wulff inequality and the isoperimetric inequality in convex cones
of Lions and Pacella.
