A backdoor set is a set of variables of a propositional formula such that
fixing the truth values of the variables in the backdoor set moves the formula
into some polynomial-time decidable class. If we know a small backdoor set we
can reduce the question of whether the given formula is satisfiable to the same
question for one or several easy formulas that belong to the tractable class
under consideration. In this survey we review parameterized complexity results
for problems that arise in the context of backdoor sets, such as the problem of
finding a backdoor set of size at most k, parameterized by k. We also discuss
recent results on backdoor sets for problems that are beyond NP.
