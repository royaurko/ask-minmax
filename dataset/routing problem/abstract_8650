For many finite groups, the Inverse Galois Problem can be approached through
modular/automorphic Galois representations. This is a report explaining the
basic strategy, ideas and methods behind some recent results. It focusses
mostly on the 2-dimensional case and underlines in particular the importance of
understanding coefficient fields.
