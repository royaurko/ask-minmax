In this paper, we first formalize the problem to be solved, i.e., the Scatter
Problem (SP). We then show that SP cannot be deterministically solved. Next, we
propose a randomized algorithm for this problem. The proposed solution is
trivially self-stabilizing. We then show how to design a self-stabilizing
version of any deterministic solution for the Pattern Formation and the
Gathering problems.
