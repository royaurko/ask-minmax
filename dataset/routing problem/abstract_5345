The hypergraph transversal problem has been intensively studied, from both a
theoretical and a practical point of view. In particular , its incremental
complexity is known to be quasi-polynomial in general and polynomial for
bounded hypergraphs. Recent applications in computational biology however
require to solve a generalization of this problem, that we call bi-objective
transversal problem. The instance is in this case composed of a pair of
hypergraphs (A, B), and the aim is to find minimal sets which hit all the
hyperedges of A while intersecting a minimal set of hyperedges of B. In this
paper, we formalize this problem, link it to a problem on monotone boolean
$\land$ -- $\lor$ formulae of depth 3 and study its incremental complexity.
