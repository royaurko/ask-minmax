Direct searches and the hints for the Higgs at ~125 GeV put increasing
pressure on simple models of SUSY breaking, in particular (but not exclusively)
on those that automatically solve the flavour problem, such as gauge mediation.
SUSY-breaking parameters are pushed to higher and higher values, increasing the
fine-tuning required to achieve electroweak symmetry breaking at the observed
scale. In this note we consider the situation for models which do not attempt
to solve the flavour problem. To treat them on equal footing, we consider the
combined fine-tuning arising from electroweak symmetry breaking as well as from
fulfilling flavour constraints. We also consider CP. We find that for an
anarchic flavour (and CP) structure of the soft SUSY breaking terms, the
minimum in the fine-tuning occurs at a scale of a few TeV. This is consistent
with the current experimental situation and leads to motivating conclusions for
direct searches as well as future flavour and CP measurements.
