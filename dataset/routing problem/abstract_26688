We consider secure multi-terminal source coding problems in the presence of a
public helper. Two main scenarios are studied: 1) source coding with a helper
where the coded side information from the helper is eavesdropped by an external
eavesdropper; 2) triangular source coding with a helper where the helper is
considered as a public terminal. We are interested in how the helper can
support the source transmission subject to a constraint on the amount of
information leaked due to its public nature. We characterize the tradeoff
between transmission rate, incurred distortion, and information leakage rate at
the helper/eavesdropper in the form of a rate-distortion-leakage region for
various classes of problems.
