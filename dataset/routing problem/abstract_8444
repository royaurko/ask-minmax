Explicit relations of matrices for two-dimensional finite element method with
third-order triangular elements are given. They are more simple than relations
presented in other works and could be easily implemented in new algorithms for
both isotropic and anisotropic materials. Numerical examples are given
comparatively using second-order and third-order triangular elements for
problems of wave propagation in rectangular waveguides which have analytic
solutions.
