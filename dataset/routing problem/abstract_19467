The continuum-fitting method is one of the two most important methods of
determining the black hole spins in the accreting sources. Fits for a sequence
of the increasing luminosities in a given source show an apparent decrease in
the spin, which indicates a problem in the disk model. We perform simple tests
whether the outflow from the disk close to the inner radius can fix this
problem. We design four simple parametric models of the outflow from the disk
close to the inner radius, and we compare these models with the apparent
decrease trend of the spins in LMC X-3 and GRS 1915+105. Models without
explicit dependence of parameters on the luminosity do not reproduce the spin
measurements, but the simplest model with luminosity-dependent parameter
(truncation radius of the disk) properly represents the trend. We perform tests
of the sensitivity of the RXTE data to various disk models. The assumption of
an outflow removes the artifact of the spin decrease with an increase of the
source luminosity, but the solution is not unique due to the too low quality of
the RXTE data.
