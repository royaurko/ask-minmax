We present the first polynomial-time approximation schemes (PTASes) for the
following subset-connectivity problems in edge-weighted graphs of bounded
genus: Steiner tree, low-connectivity survivable-network design, and subset
TSP. The schemes run in O(n log n) time for graphs embedded on both orientable
and non-orientable surfaces. This work generalizes the PTAS frameworks of
Borradaile, Klein, and Mathieu from planar graphs to bounded-genus graphs: any
future problems shown to admit the required structure theorem for planar graphs
will similarly extend to bounded-genus graphs.
