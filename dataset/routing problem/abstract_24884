We investigate symmetry properties of the solar magnetic field in the
framework of the linear Parker's migratory dynamo model. We show that the
problem can be mapped onto the well-known quantum-mechanical double-well
problem. Using the WKB approximation, we construct analytical solutions for the
dipole and quadrupole configurations of the generated magnetic field. Our
asymptotic analysis within the equatorial region indicates the existence of an
additional weak dynamo wave which violates the Hale's polarity law. We estimate
the spatial decay decrement of this wave. We also calculate explicitly the
splitting of the eigenvalues corresponding to the dipole and quadrupole modes.
The real part of the dipole eigenvalue is shown to exceed the quadrupole one. A
sufficiently long time after generation the dipole mode should dominate the
quadrupole one. The relevant observational evidences of the properties obtained
are discussed.
