A reference potential approach to the one-dimensional quantum-mechanical
inverse problem is developed. All spectral characteristics of the system,
including its discrete energy spectrum, the full energy dependence of the phase
shift, and the Jost function, are expected to be known. The technically most
complicated task in ascertaining the potential, solution of a relevant integral
equation, has been decomposed into two relatively independent problems. First,
one uses Krein method to calculate an auxiliary potential with exactly the same
spectral density as the initial reference potential, but with no bound states.
Thereafter, using Gelfand-Levitan method, it is possible to introduce, one by
one, all bound states, along with calculating another auxiliary potential of
the same spectral density at each step. For the system under study (diatomic
xenon molecule), the kernel of the Krein integral equation can be accurately
ascertained with the help of solely analytic means. At small distances the
calculated auxiliary potential with no bound states practically coincides with
the initial reference potential, which is in full agreement with general
theoretical considerations. Several possibilities of solving the Krein equation
are proposed and the prospects of further research discussed.
