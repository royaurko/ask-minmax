This paper establishes a general framework for describing hybrid dynamical
systems which is particularly suitable for numerical simulation. In this
context, the data structures used to describe the sets and functions which
comprise the dynamical system are crucial since they provide the link between a
natural mathematical formulation of a problem and the correct application of
standard numerical algorithms. We describe a partial implementation of the
design methodology and use this simulation tool for a specific control problem
in robotics as an illustration of the utility of the approach for practical
applications.
