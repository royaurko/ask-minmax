Future Communication networks are tending towards a diverse wireless
networking world where the positioning information (PI) could be helpful in
different techniques like the dynamic resource allocation. On the other hand,
the PI could be widely used for cooperative techniques in the relay and/or
routing selection process. In this paper, we propose to use the PI in the
selection of the relays and then to apply an efficient double layer distributed
space time block code (DLSTBC) scheme between the different relays. Using the
amplify and forward (AF) technique, we show that the proposed code is very
efficient whatever the transmitted power is. Moreover, we show that the relay
selection process based on PI yields very powerful results when compared to the
random relay selection (RS) process
