Basic problems for the construction of a scenario for the Life are discussed.
To study the problems in terms of dynamical systems theory, a scheme of
intra-inter dynamics is presented. It consists of internal dynamics of a unit,
interaction among the units, and the dynamics to change the dynamics itself,
for example by replication (and death) of units according to their internal
states. Applying the dynamics to cell differentiation, isologous
diversification theory is proposed. According to it, orbital instability leads
to diversified cell behaviors first. At the next stage, several cell types are
formed, first triggered by clustering of oscillations, and then as attracting
states of internal dynamics stabilized by the cell-to-cell interaction. At the
third stage, the differentiation is determined as a recursive state by cell
division. At the last stage, hierarchical differentiation proceeds, with the
emergence of stochastic rule for the differentiation to sub-groups, where
regulation of the probability for the differentiation provides the diversity
and stability of cell society. Relevance of the theory to cell biology is
discussed.
