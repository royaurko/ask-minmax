We consider vector induced lattice gauge theories, in particular we consider
the QED induced and we show that at negative temperature corresponds to the
dimer problem while at positive temperature it describes a gas of branched
polymers with loops. We argue that these models are critical at $D_{cr}=6$ for
$N\ne\infty$ and they are {\sl not} critical for $N=\infty$.
