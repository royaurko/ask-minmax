The need to blend observational data and mathematical models arises in many
applications and leads naturally to inverse problems. Parameters appearing in
the model, such as constitutive tensors, initial conditions, boundary
conditions, and forcing can be estimated on the basis of observed data. The
resulting inverse problems are often ill-posed and some form of regularization
is required. These notes discuss parameter estimation in situations where the
unknown parameters vary across multiple scales. We illustrate the main ideas
using a simple model for groundwater flow.
  We will highlight various approaches to regularization for inverse problems,
including Tikhonov and Bayesian methods. We illustrate three ideas that arise
when considering inverse problems in the multiscale context. The first idea is
that the choice of space or set in which to seek the solution to the inverse
problem is intimately related to whether a homogenized or full multiscale
solution is required. This is a choice of regularization. The second idea is
that, if a homogenized solution to the inverse problem is what is desired, then
this can be recovered from carefully designed observations of the full
multiscale system. The third idea is that the theory of homogenization can be
used to improve the estimation of homogenized coefficients from multiscale
data.
