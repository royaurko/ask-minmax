In a recent paper, Geyer, Klimchitskaya, and Mostepanenko [Phys. Rev. A 67,
062102 (2003); quant-ph/0306038] proposed the final solution of the problem of
temperature correction to the Casimir force between real metals. The basic idea
was that one cannot use the dielectric permittivity in the frequency region
where a real current may arise leading to Joule heating of the metal. Instead,
the surface impedance approach is proposed as a solution of all contradictions.
The purpose of this comment is to show that (i) the main idea contradicts to
the fluctuation dissipation theorem, (ii) the proposed method to calculate the
force gives wrong value of the temperature correction since the contribution of
low frequency fluctuations is calculated with the impedance which is not
applicable at low frequencies. In the impedance approach the right result for
the reflection coefficients in the n=0 term of the Lifshitz formula is given.
