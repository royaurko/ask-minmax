In this paper we propose on continuous level a class of domain decomposition
methods of Robin-Robin type to solve the problems of unilateral contact between
elastic bodies with nonlinear Winkler covers. These methods are based on
abstract nonstationary iterative algorithms for nonlinear variational equations
in reflexive Banach spaces. We also provide numerical investigations of
obtained methods using finite element approximations.
