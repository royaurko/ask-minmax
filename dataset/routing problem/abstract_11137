ODRL is a popular XML-based language for stating the conditions under which
resources can be accessed legitimately. The language is described in English
and, as a result, agreements written in ODRL are open to interpretation. To
address this problem, we propose a formal semantics for a representative
fragment of the language. We use this semantics to determine precisely when a
permission is implied by a set of ODRL statements and show that answering such
questions is a decidable NP-hard problem. Finally, we define a tractable
fragment of ODRL that is also fairly expressive.
