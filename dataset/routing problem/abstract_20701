We address the problem of finding self-consistent parquet equations for
two-body correlated Greens functions that arise out of a cumulant expansion.
The general theory as developed for non-relativistic electron systems
reproduces the conventional two-body parquet diagrammatic technique for the
vertex functions. As an application, the crossing-invariant linearized basic
parquet equations are treated for the correlated two-particle Greens function.
