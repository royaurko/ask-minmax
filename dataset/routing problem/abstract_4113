We consider a non-local isoperimetric problem with a repulsive Coulombic
term. In dimension three this corresponds to the Gamow's famous liquid drop
model. We show that whenever the mass is small the ball is the unique minimizer
of the problem. The proof is based on a strong version of a quantitative
isoperimetric inequality.
