We use Jacob's ladders to solve the fine problem how to divide of the
Hardy-Littlewood integral to equal parts, for example of magnitude $h=6.6\times
10^{-27}$ (the numerical value of elementary Planck quantum). The result of the
paper cannot be obtained in known theories of Balasubramanian, Heath-Brown and
Ivic.
