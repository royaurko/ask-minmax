In this paper, we study the uniform definability problem of connectives of
propositional dependence logic (PD).
  Every propositional formula with intuitionistic disjunction and
intuitionistic implication of team semantics can be translated equivalently
into a formula of PD without these two connectives. In this paper, we show that
although such a (non-uniform) translation exists, neither intuitionistic
disjunction nor intuitionistic implication is uniformly definable in PD.
