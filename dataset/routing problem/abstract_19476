Kernelization is a theoretical formalization of efficient preprocessing for
NP-hard problems. Empirically, preprocessing is highly successful in practice,
for example in state-of-the-art ILP-solvers like CPLEX. Motivated by this,
previous work studied the existence of kernelizations for ILP related problems,
e.g., for testing feasibility of Ax <= b. In contrast to the observed success
of CPLEX, however, the results were largely negative. Intuitively, practical
instances have far more useful structure than the worst-case instances used to
prove these lower bounds.
  In the present paper, we study the effect that subsystems with (Gaifman graph
of) bounded treewidth or totally unimodularity have on the kernelizability of
the ILP feasibility problem. We show that, on the positive side, if these
subsystems have a small number of variables on which they interact with the
remaining instance, then we can efficiently replace them by smaller subsystems
of size polynomial in the domain without changing feasibility. Thus, if large
parts of an instance consist of such subsystems, then this yields a substantial
size reduction. We complement this by proving that relaxations to the
considered structures, e.g., larger boundaries of the subsystems, allow
worst-case lower bounds against kernelization. Thus, these relaxed structures
can be used to build instance families that cannot be efficiently reduced, by
any approach.
