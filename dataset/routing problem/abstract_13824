In this paper we consider the Cauchy problem for 2D viscous shallow water
system in Besov spaces. We firstly prove the local well-posedness of this
problem in $B^s_{p,r}(\mathbb{R}^2)$, $s>max\{1,\frac{2}{p}\}$, $1\leq p,r\leq
\infty$ by using the Littlewood-Paley theory, the Bony decomposition and the
theories of transport equations and transport diffusion equations. Then we can
prove the global existence of the system with small enough initial data in
$B^s_{p,r}(\mathbb{R}^2)$, $1\leq p\leq2$, $1\leq r<\infty$ and
$s>\frac{2}{p}$. Our obtained results generalize and cover the recent results
in \cite{W}.
