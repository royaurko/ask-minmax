Microresonator optical frequency combs based on cascaded four-wave mixing are
potentially attractive as a multi-wavelength source for on-chip optical
communications. In this paper we compare time domain coherence, radio-frequency
(RF) intensity noise, and individual line optical communications performance
for combs generated from two different silicon nitride microresonators. The
comb generated by one microresonator forms directly with lines spaced by a
single free spectral range (FSR) and exhibits high coherence, low noise, and
excellent 10 Gbit/s optical communications results. The comb generated by the
second microresonator forms initially with multiple FSR line spacing, with
additional lines later filling to reach single FSR spacing. This comb exhibits
degraded coherence, increased intensity noise, and severely degraded
communications performance. This study is to our knowledge the first to
simultaneously investigate and observe a correlation between the route to comb
formation, the coherence, noise, and optical communications performance of a
Kerr comb.
