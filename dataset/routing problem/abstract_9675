This paper is concerned with the derivation of computable and guaranteed
upper and lower bounds of the difference between the exact and the approximate
solution of a boundary value problem for static Maxwell equations. Our analysis
is based upon purely functional argumentation and does not attract specific
properties of an approximation method. Therefore, the estimates derived in the
paper at hand are applicable to any approximate solution that belongs to the
corresponding energy space. Such estimates (also called error majorants of the
functional type) have been derived earlier for elliptic problems.
