The problems and paradoxes of the Lifshitz theory in application to real
dielectric and semiconductor materials are reviewed. It is shown that the
inclusion of drift current of conduction electrons into the model of dielectric
response results in contradictions with both thermodynamics and experimental
data of different experimental groups. Physical reasons why the problems and
paradoxes arise are analyzed and found to be connected with the violation of
basic applicability condition of the Lifshitz theory, the thermal equilibrium.
A recent alternative approach to the resolution of the problems based on the
inclusion of screening effects and diffusion current is considered and
demonstrated to be thermodynamically and experimentally inconsistent. It is
argued that the inclusion of the diffusion current leads to an even deeper
violation of thermal equilibrium. Phenomenologically, the Lifshitz theory with
role of drift and diffusion currents neglected is shown to be free of problems
and in agreement with both thermodynamics and all available experimental data.
