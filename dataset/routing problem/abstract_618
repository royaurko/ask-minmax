In this paper, we design a greedy routing on networks of mobile agents. In
the greedy routing algorithm, every time step a packet in agent $i$ is
delivered to the agent $j$ whose distance from the destination is shortest
among searched neighbors of agent $i$. Based on the greedy routing, we study
the traffic dynamics and traffic-driven epidemic spreading on networks of
mobile agents. We find that the transportation capacity of networks and the
epidemic threshold increase as the communication radius increases. For moderate
moving speed, the transportation capacity of networks is the highest and the
epidemic threshold maintains a large value. These results can help controlling
the traffic congestion and epidemic spreading on mobile networks.
