We discuss the rigidity problem for Mori fibrations on del Pezzo surfaces of
degree 1, 2 and 3 over ${\mathbb P}^1$ and formulate the following conjecture:
such a del Pezzo fibration $V/{\mathbb P}^1$ is birationally rigid if and only
if its quasi-effective and adjunction thresholds coincide. We prove the "only
if" part of this conjecture.
