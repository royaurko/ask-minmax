This paper shows how the enclosure method which was originally introduced for
elliptic equations can be applied to inverse initial boundary value problems
for parabolic equations. For the purpose a prototype of inverse initial
boundary value problems whose governing equation is the heat equation is
considered. An explicit method to extract an approximation of the value of the
support function at a given direction of unknown discontinuity embedded in a
heat conductive body from the temperature for a suitable heat flux on the
lateral boundary for a fixed observation time is given.
