In this paper we study the one dimensional second order total generalised
variation regularisation (TGV) problem with $L^{2}$ data fitting term. We
examine some properties of this model and we calculate exact solutions using
simple piecewise affine functions as data terms. We investigate how these
solutions behave with respect to the TGV parameters and we verify our results
using numerical experiments.
