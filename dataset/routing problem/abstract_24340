Tiwari proved that termination of linear programs (loops with linear loop
conditions and updates) over the reals is decidable through Jordan forms and
eigenvectors computation. Braverman proved that it is also decidable over the
integers. In this paper, we consider the termination of loops with polynomial
loop conditions and linear updates over the reals and integers. First, we prove
that the termination of such loops over the integers is undecidable. Second,
with an assumption, we provide an complete algorithm to decide the termination
of a class of such programs over the reals. Our method is similar to that of
Tiwari in spirit but uses different techniques. Finally, we conjecture that the
termination of linear programs with polynomial loop conditions over the reals
is undecidable in general by %constructing a loop and reducing the problem to
another decision problem related to number theory and ergodic theory, which we
guess undecidable.
