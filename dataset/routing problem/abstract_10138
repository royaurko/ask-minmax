We establish the Gleason result for finitely generated ideals in the context
of Frechet algebras, and, in particular, provide an affirmative answer to the
question about the Gleason result in (uniform) commutative Frechet algebras
(posed by Carpenter in 1970). As a welcome bonus of our method, we characterize
locally Stein algebras, and, as an application of this characterization, we
also provide an affirmative answer to the Gleason problem for such algebras,
which recaptures all the classical results on the Gleason problem in the theory
of several complex variables.
