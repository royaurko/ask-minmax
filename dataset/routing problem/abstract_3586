The Steklov problem is an eigenvalue problem with the spectral parameter in
the boundary conditions, which has various applications. Its spectrum coincides
with that of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator. Over the past years, there has
been a growing interest in the Steklov problem from the viewpoint of spectral
geometry. While this problem shares some common properties with its more
familiar Dirichlet and Neumann cousins, its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions have
a number of distinctive geometric features, which makes the subject especially
appealing. In this survey we discuss some recent advances and open questions,
particularly in the study of spectral asymptotics, spectral invariants,
eigenvalue estimates, and nodal geometry.
