We use residue currents on toric varieties to obtain bounds on the support of
solutions to polynomial ideal membership problems. Our bounds depend on the
Newton polytopes of the polynomial systems and are therefore well adjusted to
sparse systems of polynomials. We present variants of classical results due to
Macaulay and Max Noether.
