In this article, we consider a receding horizon control of discrete-time
state-dependent jump linear systems, particular kind of stochastic switching
systems, subject to possibly unbounded random disturbances and probabilistic
state constraints. Due to a nature of the dynamical system and the constraints,
we consider a one-step receding horizon. Using inverse cumulative distribution
function, we convert the probabilistic state constraints to deterministic
constraints, and obtain a tractable deterministic receding horizon control
problem. We consider the receding control law to have a linear state-feedback
and an admissible offset term. We ensure mean square boundedness of the state
variable via solving linear matrix inequalities off-line, and solve the
receding horizon control problem on-line with control offset terms. We
illustrate the overall approach applied on a macroeconomic system.
