There is a long standing problem about how close a connection exists between
superfluidity and Bose condensation. Employing recent technology, for the case
of confined finite Bose condensed systems in TOP traps, these questions
concerning superfluidity and Bose condensation can be partially resolved if the
velocity profile of the trapped atoms can be directly measured.
