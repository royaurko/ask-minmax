The Cauchy problem is investigated for the parabolic type in the some finite
part $[t_0, t_1] \subset [0, \infty)$ of the semi axis $t \in [0, \infty)$ and
degenarated to Schrodinger type in the remain part of the same semi axes the
second order parabolic equation. The existence of the solution is proved under
some conditions on the data and the explicit integral representation is
constructed.
