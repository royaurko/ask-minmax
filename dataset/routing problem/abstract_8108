We prove weighted estimates for the maximal regularity operator. Such
estimates were motivated by boundary value problems. We take this opportunity
to study a class of weak solutions to the abstract Cauchy problem. We also give
a new proof of maximal regularity for closed and maximal accretive operators
following from Kato's inequality for fractional powers and almost orthogonality
arguments.
