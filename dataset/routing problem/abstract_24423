Neutrino emission due to the pair breaking and formation processes in the
bulk triplet superfluid in neutron stars is investigated with taking into
account of anomalous weak interactions. We consider the problem in the BCS
approximation discarding Fermi-liquid effects. In this approach we derive
self-consistent equations for anomalous vector and axial-vector vertices of
weak interactions taking into account the $^{3}P_{2}- ^{3}F_{2}$ mixing.
Further we simplify the problem and consider the pure $^{3}P_{2}$ pairing with
$m_{j}=0$, as is adopted in the minimal cooling paradigm. As was expected
because of current conservation we have obtained a large suppression of the
neutrino emissivity in the vector channel. More exactly, the neutrino emission
through the vector channel vanishes in the nonrelativistic limit $V_F=0$. The
axial channel is also found to be moderately suppressed. The total neutrino
emissivity is suppressed by a factor of $1.9\times10^{-1}$ relative to original
estimates using bare weak vertices.
