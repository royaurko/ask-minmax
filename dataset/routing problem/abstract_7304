The paper is concerned with parabolic time-periodic boundary value problems
which are of theoretical interest and arise in different practical
applications. The multiharmonic finite element method is well adapted to this
class of parabolic problems. We study properties of multiharmonic
approximations and derive guaranteed and fully computable bounds of
approximation errors. For this purpose, we use the functional a posteriori
error estimation techniques earlier introduced by S. Repin. Numerical tests
confirm the efficiency of the a posteriori error bounds derived.
