This paper presents a comprehensive approach to the evaluation of macroscopic
material parameters for natural stone and quarry masonry. To that end, a
reliable non-linear material model on a meso-scale is developed to cover the
random arrangement of stone blocks and quasi-brittle behaviour of both basic
components, as well as the impaired cohesion and tensile strength on the
interface between the blocks and mortar joints. The paper thus interrelates the
following three problems: (i) definition of a suitable periodic unit cell (PUC)
representing a particular masonry structure; (ii) derivation of material
parameters of individual constituents either experimentally or running a mixed
numerical-experimental problem; (iii) assessment of the macroscopic material
parameters including the tensile and compressive strengths and fracture energy.
