Grid computing is a type of distributed computing which allows sharing of
computer resources through Internet. It not only allows us to share files but
also most of the software and hardware resources. An efficient resource
discovery mechanism is the fundamental requirements for grid computing systems,
as it supports resource management and scheduling of applications. Among
various discovery mechanisms,Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technology witnessed rapid
development and the key component for this success is efficient lookup
applications of P2P. Chord is a P2P structural model widely used as a routing
protocol to find resources in grid environment. Plenty of ideas are implemented
by researchers to improve the lookup performance of chord protocol in Grid
environment. In this paper, we discuss the recent researches made on Chord
Structured P2P protocol and present our proposed methods in which we use the
address of Recently Visited Node (RVN) and fuzzy technique to easily locate the
grid resources by reducing message complexity and time complexity.
