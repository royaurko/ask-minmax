We study, both classically and quantum-mechanically, the problem of a neutral
particle with spin, moving in one-dimension in an inhomogeneous magnetic field.
This problem serves for us as a toy model to study the trapping of neutral
particles. We identify K, the ratio between the precessional frequency of the
particle and its vibration frequency, as the relevant parameter of the problem.
Classicaly, we find that when the magnetic moment is antiparallel to the
direction of the magnetic field, the particle is trapped provided that K<0.5.
We also find that viscous friction, be it translational or precessional,
destabilizes the system. Quantum-mechanically, we study the problem of spin
half particle in the same field. Treating K as a small parameter for the
perturbation from the adiabatic Hamiltonian, we find the lifetime of the
particle in its trapped ground-state.
