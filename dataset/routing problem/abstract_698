We consider approximate {\em path-reporting} distance oracles, distance
labeling and labeled routing with extremely low space requirement, for general
undirected graphs. For distance oracles, we show how to break the n\log n space
bound of Thorup and Zwick if approximate {\em paths} rather than distances need
to be reported. For approximate distance labeling and labeled routing, we break
the previously best known space bound of O(log n) words per vertex. The cost
for such space efficiency is an increased stretch.
