In the present article, we consider Algebraic Geometry codes on some rational
surfaces. The estimate of the minimum distance is translated into a point
counting problem on plane curves. This problem is solved by applying the upper
bound "\`a la Weil" of Aubry and Perret together with the bound of Homma and
Kim for plane curves. The parameters of several codes from rational surfaces
are computed. Among them, the codes defined by the evaluation of forms of
degree 3 on an elliptic quadric are studied. As far as we know, such codes have
never been treated before. Two other rational surfaces are studied and very
good codes are found on them. In particular, a [57,12,34] code over
$\mathbf{F}_7$ and a [91,18,53] code over $\mathbf{F}_9$ are discovered, these
codes beat the best known codes up to now.
