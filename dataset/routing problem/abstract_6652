Many probability measures in the multiverse depend exponentially on some
observable parameters, giving rise to potential problems such as youngness
bias, Q-catastrophe etc. In this paper we explore a possibility that the
exponential runaway dependence should be viewed not as a problem, but as a
feature that may help us to fix all parameters in the landscape, including the
value of the cosmological constant, without using anthropic considerations.
