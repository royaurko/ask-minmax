The purpose of this article is to provide, with the help of a fluctuation
identity, a generic link between a number of known identities for the first
passage time and overshoot above/below a fixed level of a Levy process and the
solution of Gerber and Shiu [Astin Bull. 24 (1994) 195-220], Boyarchenko and
Levendorskii [Working paper series EERS 98/02 (1998), Unpublished manuscript
(1999), SIAM J. Control Optim. 40 (2002) 1663-1696], Chan [Original unpublished
manuscript (2000)], Avram, Chan and Usabel [Stochastic Process. Appl. 100
(2002) 75-107], Mordecki [Finance Stoch. 6 (2002) 473-493], Asmussen, Avram and
Pistorius [Stochastic Process. Appl. 109 (2004) 79-111] and Chesney and
Jeanblanc [Appl. Math. Fin. 11 (2004) 207-225] to the American perpetual put
optimal stopping problem. Furthermore, we make folklore precise and give
necessary and sufficient conditions for smooth pasting to occur in the
considered problem.
