In this paper we investigate the behavior and the existence of positive and
non-radially symmetric solutions to nonlinear exponential elliptic model
problems defined on a solid torus $\bar{T}$ of $\mathbb{R}^3$, when data are
invariant under the group $G=O(2)\times I \subset O(3)$. The model problems of
interest are stated below: ${ll} {\bf(P_1)} & \displaystyle
  \Delta\upsilon+\gamma=f(x)e^\upsilon, \upsilon>0\quad \mathrm{on} \quad T,
\quad\upsilon |_{_{\partial T}}=0.$ and ${ll}\bf{(P_2)} & \displaystyle
\Delta\upsilon+a+fe^\upsilon=0, \upsilon>0\quad \mathrm{on}\quad T, [1.3ex]
&\displaystyle \frac{\partial \upsilon}{\partial n}+b+ge^\upsilon=0\quad
\mathrm{on} \quad{\partial T}.$ We prove that exist solutions which are
$G-$invariant and these exhibit no radial symmetries. In order to solve the
above problems we need to find the best constants in the Sobolev inequalities
in the exceptional case.
