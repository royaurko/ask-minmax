We study optimal control of diffusions with slow and fast variables and
address a question raised by practitioners: is it possible to first eliminate
the fast variables before solving the optimal control problem and then use the
optimal control computed from the reduced-order model to control the original,
high-dimensional system? The strategy "first reduce, then optimize"--rather
than "first optimize, then reduce"--is motivated by the fact that solving
optimal control problems for high-dimensional multiscale systems is numerically
challenging and often computationally prohibitive. We state sufficient and
necessary conditions, under which the "first reduce, then control" strategy can
be employed and discuss when it should be avoided. We further give numerical
examples that illustrate the "first reduce, then optmize" approach and discuss
possible pitfalls.
