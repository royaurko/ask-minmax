This paper examines some solutions for confluent and double-confluent Heun
equations. In the first place, we review two Leaver's solutions in series of
regular and irregular confluent hypergeometric functions for the confluent
equation and introduce an additional expansion in series of irregular confluent
hypergeometric functions. Then, we find the conditions under which one of these
solutions can be written as a linear combination of the others. In the second
place, by means of limiting procedures we generate solutions for the
double-confluent equation as well as for special limits of both the confluent
and double-confluent equations. Finally, we present problems which are ruled by
each of these four equations and establish relations among Heun equations and
quasi-exactly solvable problems.
