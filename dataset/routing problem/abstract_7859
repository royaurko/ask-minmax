We give the first examples of infinite sets of primes S such that Hilbert's
Tenth Problem over Z[S^{-1}] has a negative answer. In fact, we can take S to
be a density 1 set of primes. We show also that for some such S there is a
punctured elliptic curve E' over Z[S^{-1}] such that the topological closure of
E'(Z[S^{-1}]) in E'(R) has infinitely many connected components.
