Geospatial intelligence has traditionally relied on the use of archived and
unvarying data for planning and exploration purposes. In consequence, the tools
and methods that are architected to provide insight and generate projections
only rely on such datasets. Albeit, if this approach has proven effective in
several cases, such as land use identification and route mapping, it has
severely restricted the ability of researchers to inculcate current information
in their work. This approach is inadequate in scenarios requiring real-time
information to act and to adjust in ever changing dynamic environments, such as
evacuation and rescue missions. In this work, we propose PlanetSense, a
platform for geospatial intelligence that is built to harness the existing
power of archived data and add to that, the dynamics of real-time streams,
seamlessly integrated with sophisticated data mining algorithms and analytics
tools for generating operational intelligence on the fly. The platform has four
main components - i. GeoData Cloud - a data architecture for storing and
managing disparate datasets; ii. Mechanism to harvest real-time streaming data;
iii. Data analytics framework; iv. Presentation and visualization through web
interface and RESTful services. Using two case studies, we underpin the
necessity of our platform in modeling ambient population and building occupancy
at scale.
