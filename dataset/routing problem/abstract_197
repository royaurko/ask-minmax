The capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) involves distributing
(identical) items from a depot to a set of demand locations, using a single
capacitated vehicle. We study a generalization of this problem to the setting
of multiple vehicles having non-uniform speeds (that we call Heterogenous
CVRP), and present a constant-factor approximation algorithm.
  The technical heart of our result lies in achieving a constant approximation
to the following TSP variant (called Heterogenous TSP). Given a metric denoting
distances between vertices, a depot r containing k vehicles with possibly
different speeds, the goal is to find a tour for each vehicle (starting and
ending at r), so that every vertex is covered in some tour and the maximum
completion time is minimized. This problem is precisely Heterogenous CVRP when
vehicles are uncapacitated.
  The presence of non-uniform speeds introduces difficulties for employing
standard tour-splitting techniques. In order to get a better understanding of
this technique in our context, we appeal to ideas from the 2-approximation for
scheduling in parallel machine of Lenstra et al.. This motivates the
introduction of a new approximate MST construction called Level-Prim, which is
related to Light Approximate Shortest-path Trees. The last component of our
algorithm involves partitioning the Level-Prim tree and matching the resulting
parts to vehicles. This decomposition is more subtle than usual since now we
need to enforce correlation between the size of the parts and their distances
to the depot.
