We study the optimal control of a steady-state dead oil isotherm problem. The
problem is described by a system of nonlinear partial differential equations
resulting from the traditional modelling of oil engineering within the
framework of mechanics of a continuous medium. Existence and regularity results
of the optimal control are proved, as well as necessary optimality conditions.
