Feature selection is an important problem in high-dimensional data analysis
and classification. Conventional feature selection approaches focus on
detecting the features based on a redundancy criterion using learning and
feature searching schemes. In contrast, we present an approach that identifies
the need to select features based on their discriminatory ability among
classes. Area of overlap between inter-class and intra-class distances
resulting from feature to feature comparison of an attribute is used as a
measure of discriminatory ability of the feature. A set of nearest attributes
in a pattern having the lowest area of overlap within a degree of tolerance
defined by a selection threshold is selected to represent the best available
discriminable features. State of the art recognition results are reported for
pattern classification problems by using the proposed feature selection scheme
with the nearest neighbour classifier. These results are reported with
benchmark databases having high dimensional feature vectors in the problems
involving images and micro array data.
