Under the framework in our previous paper, we derive a dynamic programming
principle (DPP) for a general controlled/stopped martingale problem. Next, we
restrict to the diffusion process case, where the martingale problem gives a
weak and a relaxed formulation of the control problem. We then study its strong
formulation, including its DPP and also its equivalence to other formulations
under some regularity conditions. Finally, for the controlled Markov
diffusion-jump processes problem, we present a Markovian selection approach.
