In this paper, we define Tribonacci-Lucas polynomials and present
Tribonacci-Lucas numbers and polynomials as a binomial sum. Then, we introduce
incomplete Tribonacci-Lucas numbers and polynomials. In addition we derive
recurrence relations, some properties and generating functions of these numbers
and polynomials. Also, we find the generating function of incomplete Tribonacci
polynomials which is given as the open problem in [12].
