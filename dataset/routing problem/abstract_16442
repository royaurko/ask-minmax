The work we describe here is a part of a research program of developing
foundations of declarative solving of search problems. We consider the model
expansion task as the task representing the essence of search problems where we
are given an instance of a problem and are searching for a solution satisfying
certain properties. Such tasks are common in artificial intelligence, formal
verification, computational biology. Recently, the model expansion framework
was extended to deal with multiple modules. In the current paper, inspired by
practical combined solvers, we introduce an algorithm to solve model expansion
tasks for modular systems. We show that our algorithm closely corresponds to
what is done in practice in different areas such as Satisfiability Modulo
Theories (SMT), Integer Linear Programming (ILP), Answer Set Programming (ASP).
