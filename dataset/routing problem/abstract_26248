We consider two natural Lagrangian intersection problems in the context of
symplectic toric manifolds: displaceability of torus orbits and of a torus
orbit with the real part of the toric manifold. Our remarks address the fact
that one can use simple cartesian product and symplectic reduction
considerations to go from basic examples to much more sophisticated ones. We
show in particular how rigidity results for the above Lagrangian intersection
problems in weighted projective spaces can be combined with these
considerations to prove analogous results for all monotone toric symplectic
manifolds. We also discuss non-monotone and/or non-Fano examples, including
some with a continuum of non-displaceable torus orbits.
