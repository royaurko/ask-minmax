We consider the problem of the symplectic realization of a Poisson-Nijenhuis
manifold. By applying a new technique developed by M. Crainic and I. Marcut for
the study of the above problem in the case of a Poisson manifold, we establish
the existence, under a condition, of a nondegenerate Poisson-Nijenhuis
structure on an open neighborhood of the zero-section of the cotangent bundle
of the manifold, which symplectizes the initial structure. Additionally, we
present some examples.
