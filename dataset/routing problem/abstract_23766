We consider Cauchy type integrals $I(t)={1\over 2\pi i}\int_{\gamma}
{g(z)dz\over z-t}$ with $g(z)$ an algebraic function. The main goal is to give
constructive (at least, in principle) conditions for $I(t)$ to be an algebraic
function, a rational function, and ultimately an identical zero near infinity.
This is done by relating the Monodromy group of the algebraic function $g$, the
geometry of the integration curve $\gamma$, and the analytic properties of the
Cauchy type integrals. The motivation for the study of these conditions is
provided by the fact that certain Cauchy type integrals of algebraic functions
appear in the infinitesimal versions of two classical open questions in
Analytic Theory of Differential Equations: the Poincar\'e Center-Focus problem
and the second part of the Hilbert 16-th problem.
