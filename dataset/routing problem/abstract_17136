This paper formulates and solves a sequential detection problem that involves
the mutual information (stochastic observability) of a Gaussian process
observed in noise with missing measurements. The main result is that the
optimal decision is characterized by a monotone policy on the partially ordered
set of positive definite covariance matrices. This monotone structure implies
that numerically efficient algorithms can be designed to estimate and implement
monotone parametrized decision policies.The sequential detection problem is
motivated by applications in radar scheduling where the aim is to maintain the
mutual information of all targets within a specified bound. We illustrate the
problem formulation and performance of monotone parametrized policies via
numerical examples in fly-by and persistent-surveillance applications involving
a GMTI (Ground Moving Target Indicator) radar.
