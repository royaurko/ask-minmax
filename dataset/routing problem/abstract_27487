autonomous swarms of mobile robots that self-organize and cooperate to solve
global objectives. The overwhelming majority of works so far considers handmade
algorithms and correctness proofs. This paper is the first to propose a formal
framework to automatically design dis- tributed algorithms that are dedicated
to autonomous mobile robots evolving in a discrete space. As a case study, we
consider the problem of gathering all robots at a particular location, not
known beforehand. Our contribution is threefold. First, we propose an encoding
of the gathering problem as a reachability game. Then, we automatically
generate an optimal distributed algorithm for three robots evolv- ing on a
fixed size uniform ring. Finally, we prove by induction that the generated
algorithm is also correct for any ring size except when an impossibility result
holds (that is, when the number of robots divides the ring size).
