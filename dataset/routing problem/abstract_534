One of the open problems in nuclear structure is how to predict properties of
finite nuclei from the knowledge of a bare nucleon-nucleon interaction of the
meson-exchange type. We point out that a promising starting point consists in
Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (DBHF) calculations us- ing realistic
nucleon-nucleon interactions like the Bonn potentials, which are able to
reproduce satisfactorily the properties of symmetric nuclear matter without the
need for 3-body forces, as is necessary in non-relativistic BHF calculations.
However, the DBHF formalism is still too com- plicated to be used directly for
finite nuclei. We argue that a possible route is to define effective
Lagrangians with density-dependent nucleon-meson coupling vertices, which can
be used in the Relativistic Hartree (or Relativistic Mean Field (RMF)) or
preferrably in the Relativistic Hartree- Fock (RHF) approach. The
density-dependence is matched to the nuclear matter DBHF results. We review the
present status of nuclear matter DBHF calculations and discuss the various
schemes to construct the self-energy, which lead to differences in the
predictions. We also discuss how effective Lagrangians have been constructed
and are used in actual calculations. We point out that completely consistent
calculations in this scheme still have to be performed.
