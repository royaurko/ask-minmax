We present a robust adaptive beamforming algorithm based on the worst-case
criterion and the constrained constant modulus approach, which exploits the
constant modulus property of the desired signal. Similarly to the existing
worst-case beamformer with the minimum variance design, the problem can be
reformulated as a second-order cone (SOC) program and solved with interior
point methods. An analysis of the optimization problem is carried out and
conditions are obtained for enforcing its convexity and for adjusting its
parameters. Furthermore, low-complexity robust adaptive beamforming algorithms
based on the modified conjugate gradient (MCG) and an alternating optimization
strategy are proposed. The proposed low-complexity algorithms can compute the
existing worst-case constrained minimum variance (WC-CMV) and the proposed
worst-case constrained constant modulus (WC-CCM) designs with a quadratic cost
in the number of parameters. Simulations show that the proposed WC-CCM
algorithm performs better than existing robust beamforming algorithms.
Moreover, the numerical results also show that the performances of the proposed
low-complexity algorithms are equivalent or better than that of existing robust
algorithms, whereas the complexity is more than an order of magnitude lower.
