We study the approximate string matching and regular expression matching
problem for the case when the text to be searched is compressed with the
Ziv-Lempel adaptive dictionary compression schemes. We present a time-space
trade-off that leads to algorithms improving the previously known complexities
for both problems. In particular, we significantly improve the space bounds,
which in practical applications are likely to be a bottleneck.
