We consider the problem of random sampling for band-limited functions. When
can a band-limited function $f$ be recovered from randomly chosen samples
$f(x_j), j\in \mathbb{N}$? We estimate the probability that a sampling
inequality of the form
  A\|f\|_2^2 \leq \sum_{j\in \mathbb{N}} |f(x_j)|^2 \leq B \|f\|_2^2 hold
uniformly all functions $f\in L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ with supp $\hat{f} \subseteq
[-1/2,1/2]^d$ or some subset of \bdl functions. In contrast to discrete models,
the space of band-limited functions is infinite-dimensional and its functions
"live" on the unbounded set $\mathbb{R}^d$. This fact raises new problems and
leads to both negative and positive results. (a) With probability one, the
sampling inequality fails for any reasonable definition of a random set on
$\mathbb{R}^d$, e.g., for spatial Poisson processes or uniform distribution
over disjoint cubes. (b) With overwhelming probability, the sampling inequality
holds for certain compact subsets of the space of band-limited functions and
for sufficiently large sampling size.
