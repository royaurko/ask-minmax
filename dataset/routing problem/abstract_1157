The binodals and the non-ergodicity lines of a binary mixture of hard
sphere-like particles with large size ratio are computed for studying the
interplay between dynamic arrest and phase separation in depletion-driven
colloidal mixtures. Contrarily to the case of hard core plus short range
effective attraction, physical gellation without competition with the
fluid-phase separation can occur in such mixtures. This behavior due to the
oscillations in the depletion potential should concern all simple mixtures with
non-ideal depletant, justifying further studies of their dynamic properties.
