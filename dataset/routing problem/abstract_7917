We study the best-choice problem for processes which generalise the process
of records from Poisson-paced i.i.d. observations. Under the assumption that
the observer knows distribution of the process and the horizon, we determine
the optimal stopping policy and for a parametric family of problems also derive
an explicit formula for the maximum probability of recognising the last record.
