We extend the idea of assisted inflation to the case of power-law potentials
and demonstrate the simultaneous resolution of two major problems that plague
chaotic inflation. The implementation of the same idea in the framework of a
5-dimensional, scalar field theory leads to a model of chaotic inflation free
of fine-tuning.
