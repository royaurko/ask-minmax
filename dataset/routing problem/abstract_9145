The problem of finding the longest common subsequence (LCS) for a set of
sequences is a very interesting and challenging problem in computer science.
This problem is NP-complete, but because of its importance, many heuristic
algorithms have been proposed, such as Long Run algorithm and Expansion
algorithm.
  However, the performance of many current heuristic algorithms deteriorates
fast when the number of sequences and sequence length increase. In this paper,
we have proposed a post process heuristic algorithm for the LCS problem, the
Deposition and Extension algorithm (DEA). This algorithm first generates common
subsequence by the process of sequences deposition, and then extends this
common subsequence. The algorithm is proven to generate Common Subsequences
(CSs) with guaranteed lengths. The experiments show that the results of DEA
algorithm are better than those of Long Run and Expansion algorithm, especially
on many long sequences. The algorithm also has superior efficiency both in time
and space.
