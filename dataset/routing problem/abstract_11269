We re-examine the neutrino decay solution to the solar neutrino problem in
light of the new data from Gallex II and Kamiokande III. We compare the
experimental data with the solar models of Bahcall and Pinsonneault and
Turck-Chieze and find that neutrino decay is ruled out as a solution to the
solar neutrino problem at better than the 98\% c.l. even when solar model
uncertainties are taken into account.
