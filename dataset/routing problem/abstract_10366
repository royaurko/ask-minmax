We consider the problem of utility maximization with exponential preferences
in a market where the traded stock/risky asset price is modelled as a
L\'evy-driven pure jump process (i.e. the driving L\'evy process has no
Brownian component). In this setting, we study the terminal utility
optimization problem in the presence of a European contingent claim. We
consider in detail the BSDE (backward stochastic differential equations)
characterising the value function. First we analyse the well-definedness of the
generator. This leads to some conditions on the market model related to
conditions for the market to admit no free lunches. Then we give bounds on the
candidate optimal strategy.
  Thereafter, we discuss the example of a cross-hedging problem and, under
severe assumptions on the structure of the claim, we give explicit solutions.
Finally, we establish an explicit solution for a related BSDE with a suitable
terminal condition but a simpler generator.
