The synthesis of xAgI(1-x)[Ag2O.B2O3] amorphous superionic conductors is done
via mechanochemical synthesis route (for x = 0.5 and 0.7). Ionic conductivities
of 3 mOhm-1cm-1 for x = 0.5 sample and 5mOhm-1cm-1 for x = 0.7 sample at room
temperature, are observed, which are higher than those of the melt quenched
glassy samples. Impedance plots (Nyquist plots) are found to be depressed
semicircles with a tail at low frequency end. The corresponding equivalent
circuit is postulated and each circuit element is related to a physical
process. The ac conductivity is analyzed in view of the universal dynamic
response (Bode Plots). A unique feature of the mechnochemically synthesized
glasses is that their dc conductivity vs. 1/T behavior exhibit two distinct
regions with different activation energies. The activation energy for dc
conductivity (Edc) and that for ac conductivity (Eac) and the frequency
exponent n are found to satisfy the UDR-relation, Eac= (1-n)Edc in the lower
temperature regime. In the high temperature region, however, this correlation
could not be established due to lack of sac data over the available frequency
domain.
