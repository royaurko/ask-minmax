In this paper, a pointwise weighted identity for some stochastic partial
differential operators (with complex principal parts) is established. This
identity presents a unified approach in studying the controllability,
observability and inverse problems for some deterministic/stochastic partial
differential equations. Based on this identity, one can deduce all the known
Carleman estimates and observability results, for some deterministic partial
differential equations, stochastic heat equations, stochastic Schr\"odinger
equations and stochastic transport equations. Meanwhile, as its new
application, we study an inverse problem for linear stochastic complex
Ginzburg-Landau equations.
