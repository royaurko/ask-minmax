Given an embedded planar acyclic digraph G, we define the problem of acyclic
hamiltonian path completion with crossing minimization (Acyclic-HPCCM) to be
the problem of determining a hamiltonian path completion set of edges such
that, when these edges are embedded on G, they create the smallest possible
number of edge crossings and turn G to a hamiltonian acyclic digraph. Our
results include: 1. We provide a characterization under which a planar
st-digraph G is hamiltonian. 2. For an outerplanar st-digraph G, we define the
st-polygon decomposition of G and, based on its properties, we develop a
linear-time algorithm that solves the Acyclic-HPCCM problem. 3. For the class
of planar st-digraphs, we establish an equivalence between the Acyclic-HPCCM
problem and the problem of determining an upward 2-page topological book
embedding with minimum number of spine crossings. We infer (based on this
equivalence) for the class of outerplanar st-digraphs an upward topological
2-page book embedding with minimum number of spine crossings. To the best of
our knowledge, it is the first time that edge-crossing minimization is studied
in conjunction with the acyclic hamiltonian completion problem and the first
time that an optimal algorithm with respect to spine crossing minimization is
presented for upward topological book embeddings.
