This paper formulates the Nash problem for a pair consisting of a toric
variety and an invariant ideal and gives an affirmative answer to the problem.
We also prove that the minimal log-discrepacy is computed by a divisor
corresponding to a Nash component, if the minimal log-discrepancy is finite. On
the other hand there exists a Nash component such that the corresponding
divisor has negative log-discrepancy, if the minimal log-discrepancy is
$-/infty$.
