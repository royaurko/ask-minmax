Understanding of free-format multi-step arithmetic word problems with
extraneous information is discussed. A model including a full set of general
skills necessary for understanding such problems was developed and computer
implemented. The validity of the simulation was confirmed by testing on a
variety of word problems with extraneous information. The results of this study
show the way for moving from an intuitive understanding of word problems to a
conscious and controlled process.
