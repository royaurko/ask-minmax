Triple patterning lithography (TPL) is one of the most promising techniques
in the 14nm logic node and beyond. Conventional LELELE type TPL technology
suffers from native conflict and overlapping problems. Recently, as an
alternative process, triple patterning lithography with end cutting (LELE-EC)
was proposed to overcome the limitations of LELELE manufacturing. In LELE-EC
process the first two masks are LELE type double patterning, while the third
mask is used to generate the end-cuts. Although the layout decomposition
problem for LELELE has been well-studied in the literature, only few attempts
have been made to address the LELE-EC layout decomposition problem. In this
paper we propose the comprehensive study for LELE-EC layout decomposition.
Conflict graph and end-cut graph are constructed to extract all the geometrical
relationships of both input layout and end-cut candidates. Based on these
graphs, integer linear programming (ILP) is formulated to minimize the conflict
number and the stitch number. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
