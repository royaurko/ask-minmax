In this paper we ?rst consider a linear time invariant systems with almost
periodic forcing term. We propose a new deterministic quadratic control
problem, motivated by Da-Prato. With the help of associated degenerate Riccati
equation we study the existence and uniqueness of an almost automorphic
solutions.
