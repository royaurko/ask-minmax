A finite element approximation of the Stokes equations under a certain
nonlinear boundary condition, namely, the slip or leak boundary condition of
friction type, is considered. We propose an approximate problem formulated by a
variational inequality, prove an existence and uniqueness result, present an
error estimate, and discuss a numerical realization using an iterative
Uzawa-type method. Several numerical examples are provided to support our
theoretical results.
