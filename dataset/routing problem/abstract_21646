We construct the upper and lower Bellman functions for the $L^p$
(quasi)-norms of BMO functions. These appear as solutions to a series of
Monge--Amp\`ere boundary value problems on a non-convex plane domain. The
knowledge of the Bellman functions leads to sharp constants in inequalities
relating average oscillations of BMO functions and various BMO norms.
