The permanent vs. determinant problem is one of the most important problems
in theoretical computer science, and is the main target of geometric complexity
theory proposed by Mulmuley and Sohoni. The current best lower bound for the
determinantal complexity of the d by d permanent polynomial is d^2/2, due to
Mignon and Ressayre in 2004. Inspired by their proof method, we introduce a
natural rank concept of polynomials, called the bi-polynomial rank. The
bi-polynomial rank is related to width of an arithmetic branching program. The
bi-polynomial rank of a homogeneous polynomial p of even degree 2k is defined
as the minimum n such that p can be written as a summation of n products of
polynomials of degree k. We prove that the bi-polynomial rank gives a lower
bound of the determinantal complexity. As a consequence, the above Mignon and
Ressayre bound is improved to (d-1)^2 + 1 over the field of reals. We show that
the computation of the bi-polynomial rank is formulated as a rank minimization
problem. Applying the concave minimization technique, we reduce the problem of
lower-bounding determinantal complexity to that of proving the positive
semidefiniteness of matrices, and this is a new approach for the permanent vs.
determinant problem. We propose a computational approach for giving a lower
bound of this rank minimization, via techniques of the concave minimization.
This also yields a new strategy to attack the permanent vs. determinant
problem.
