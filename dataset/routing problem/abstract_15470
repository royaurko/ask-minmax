The discreteness problem, that is, the problem of determining whether or not
a given finitely generated group G of orientation preserving isometries of
hyperbolic three-space is discrete as a subgroup of the whole isometry group of
hyperbolic three space, is a challenging problem that has been investigated for
more than a century and is still open. It is known that G is discrete if, and
only if, every non-elementary two generator subgroup is. Several sufficient
conditions for discreteness are also known as are some necessary conditions,
though no single necessary and sufficient condition is known. There is a finite
discreteness algorithm for the two generator subgroups of the isometry group of
hyperbolic two-space. But the situation in three dimensions is more delicate
because there are geometrically infinite groups.
  We present a semi-algorithm, that is, a procedure that terminates sometimes
but not always. There is no standard way to find an infinite sequence of
distinct elements that converges to the identity to show that a group is not
discrete. Our semi-algorithm either produces such an infinite sequence or finds
a finite sequence that produces a right angled hexagon in hyperbolic
three-space which has a special property that is a generalization of the notion
of convexity. We call it a canonical hexagon. If the group is discrete, free
and geometrically finite, it always has an essentially unique canonical hexagon
which the procedure finds in a finite number of steps.
