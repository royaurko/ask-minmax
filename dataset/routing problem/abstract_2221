Liquid-phase exfoliation is one of the most promising routes for large scale
production of multilayer graphene dispersions. These dispersions, which may be
used in coatings, composites or paints, are believed to contain disorder-free
graphene multilayers. Here we address the nature of defects in such samples
obtained by liquid-phase exfoliation of graphite powder in
N-methyl--2--pyrrolidone. Our Raman spectroscopy data challenges the assumption
that these multilayers are free of bulk defects, revealing that defect
localization strongly depends on the sonication time. For short ultrasound
times, defects are located mainly at the layer edges but they turn out to build
up in the bulk for ultrasonic times above 2 h. This knowledge may help to
devise better strategies to achieve high-quality graphene dispersions.
