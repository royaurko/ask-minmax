The equilibrium points and their linear stability has been discussed in the
generalized photogravitational Chermnykh's problem. The bigger primary is being
considered as a source of radiation and small primary as an oblate spheroid.
The effect of radiation pressure has been discussed numerically. The collinear
points are linearly unstable and triangular points are stable in the sense of
Lyapunov stability provided $\mu< \mu_{Routh}=0.0385201$. The effect of
gravitational potential from the belt is also examined. The mathematical
properties of this system are different from the classical restricted three
body problem.
