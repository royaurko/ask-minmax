We establish existence and multiplicity theorems for a Dirichlet boundary
value problem at resonance, which is a nonlinear subcritical perturbation of a
linear eigenvalue problem studied by Cuesta. Our framework includes a
sign-changing potential and we locate the solutions by using the Mountain Pass
lemma and the Saddle Point theorem.
