The capacity of carbon atomic chains with different terminations for hydrogen
storage is studied using first-principles density functional theory
calculations. Unlike the physisorption of H2 on the H-terminated chain, we show
that two Li (Na) atoms each capping one end of the carbon chain can hold ten H2
molecules with optimal binding energies for room temperature storage. The
hybridization of the Li 2p states with the H2 sigma orbitals contributes to the
H2 adsorption. However, the binding mechanism of the H2 molecules on Na arises
only from the polarization interaction between the charged Na atom and the H2.
Moreover, additional H2 molecules can be bound to the carbon atoms at the chain
ends due to the charge transfer between Li 2s2p (Na 3s) and C 2p states.
Importantly, dimerization of these isolated metal-capped chains does not affect
the hydrogen binding energy significantly. In addition, a single chain can be
stabilized effectively by termination on the C60 clusters. With a hydrogen
uptake of > 10 wt % on Li-coated C60-Cn-C60 (n = 5, 8), the Li12C60-Cn-Li12C60
complex, without reducing the number of adsorbed H2 molecules per Li, can serve
as better building blocks of polymers than the (Li12C60)2 dimer. These findings
suggest a new route to design cluster-assembled storage materials based on
terminated sp carbon chains.
