In this paper, we address a simplified version of a problem arising from
volcanology. Specifically, as reduced form of the boundary value problem for
the Lam\'e system, we consider a Neumann problem for harmonic functions in the
half-space with a cavity $C$. Zero normal derivative is assumed at the boundary
of the half-space; differently, at $\partial C$, the normal derivative of the
function is required to be given by an external datum $g$, corresponding to a
pressure term exerted on the medium at $\partial C$. Under the assumption that
the (pressurized) cavity is small with respect to the distance from the
boundary of the half-space, we establish an asymptotic formula for the solution
of the problem. Main ingredients are integral equation formulations of the
harmonic solution of the Neumann problem and a spectral analysis of the
integral operators involved in the problem. In the special case of a datum $g$
which describes a constant pressure at $\partial C$, we recover a simplified
representation based on a polarization tensor.
