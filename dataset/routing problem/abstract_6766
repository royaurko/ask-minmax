One of the important problems in multiprocessor systems is Task Graph
Scheduling. Task Graph Scheduling is an NP-Hard problem. Both learning automata
and genetic algorithms are search tools which are used for solving many NP-Hard
problems. In this paper a new hybrid method based on Genetic Algorithm and
Learning Automata is proposed. The proposed algorithm begins with an initial
population of randomly generated chromosomes and after some stages, each
chromosome maps to an automaton. Experimental results show that superiority of
the proposed algorithm over the current approaches.
