The paper is concerned with the problem of existence of solutions for the
Heath-Jarrow-Morton equation with linear volatility. Necessary conditions and
sufficient conditions for the existence of weak solutions and strong solutions
are provided. It is shown that the key role is played by the logarithmic growth
conditions of the Laplace exponent.
