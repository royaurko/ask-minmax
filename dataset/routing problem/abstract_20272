There is a long-standing problem of algebra to extend the symmetric monoidal
structure of abelian groups, given by the tensor product, to a non abelian
setting. In this paper we show that such an extension is possible. Morover our
non abelian tensor product remains even right exact and balanced. We describe
the new non-abelian tensor product in the context of quadratic algebra which
extends linear algebra.
