We provide an O(log log OPT)-approximation algorithm for the problem of
guarding a simple polygon with guards on the perimeter. We first design a
polynomial-time algorithm for building epsilon-nets of size O(1/epsilon log log
1/epsilon) for the instances of Hitting Set associated with our guarding
problem. We then apply the technique of Bronnimann and Goodrich to build an
approximation algorithm from this epsilon-net finder. Along with a simple
polygon P, our algorithm takes as input a finite set of potential guard
locations that must include the polygon's vertices. If a finite set of
potential guard locations is not specified, e.g. when guards may be placed
anywhere on the perimeter, we use a known discretization technique at the cost
of making the algorithm's running time potentially linear in the ratio between
the longest and shortest distances between vertices. Our algorithm is the first
to improve upon O(log OPT)-approximation algorithms that use generic net
finders for set systems of finite VC-dimension.
