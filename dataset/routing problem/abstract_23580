We consider a new braneworld model with a bulk scalar field coupled to
gravity. The bulk scalar action is inspired by the proposed low energy
effective action around the tachyon vacuum. A class of warped geometries
representing solutions of this Einstein-scalar system for a specific scalar
potential is found. The geometry is non singular with a decaying warp factor
and a negative Ricci curvature. The solution of the hierarchy problem is
obtained using this type of warping. Though qualitatively similar to the usual
Randall--Sundrum I model there are interesting quantitative differences.
Additionally, in the RS-II set up the graviton zero mode as well as spin half
massless fermions are found to be localised on the brane.
