Two-particle correlations have been measured for identified negative pions
from central 158 AGeV Pb+Pb collisions and fitted radii of about 7 fm in all
dimensions have been obtained. A multi-dimensional study of the radii as a
function of kT is presented, including a full correction for the resolution
effects of the apparatus. The cross term Rout-long of the standard fit in the
Longitudinally CoMoving System (LCMS) and the vl parameter of the generalised
Yano-Koonin fit are compatible with 0, suggesting that the source undergoes a
boost invariant expansion. The shapes of the correlation functions in Qinv and
Qspace have been analyzed in detail. They are not Gaussian but better
represented by exponentials. As a consequence, fitting Gaussians to these
correlation functions may produce different radii depending on the acceptance
of the experimental setup used for the measurement.
