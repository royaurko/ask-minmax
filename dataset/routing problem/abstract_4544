In this article we consider the problem of choosing an optimal sampling
scheme for the regression problem simultaneously with that of model selection.
We consider a batch type approach and an on-line approach following algorithms
recently developed for the classification problem. Our main tools are
concentration-type inequalities which allow us to bound the supremum of the
deviations of the sampling scheme corrected by an appropriate weight function.
