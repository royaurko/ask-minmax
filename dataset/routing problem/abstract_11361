One proposed solution of the moduli problem of string cosmology requires that
the moduli are quite heavy, their decays reheating the universe to temperatures
above the scale of nucleosynthesis. In many of these scenarios, the moduli are
approximately supersymmetric; it is then crucial that the decays to gravitinos
are helicity suppressed. In this paper, we discuss situations where these
decays are, and are not, suppressed. We also comment on a possible gravitino
problem from inflaton decay.
