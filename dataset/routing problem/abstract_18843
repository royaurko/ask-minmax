Lemmings is a computer puzzle game developed by DMA Design and published by
Psygnosis in 1991, in which the player has to guide a tribe of lemming
creatures to safety through a hazardous landscape, by assigning them specific
skills that modify their behavior in different ways. In this paper we study the
optimization problem of saving the highest number of lemmings in a given
landscape with a given number of available skills.
  We prove that the game is PSPACE-complete, even if there is only one lemming
to save, and only Builder and Basher skills are available. We thereby settle an
open problem posed by Cormode in 2004, and again by Forisek in 2010. However we
also prove that, if we restrict the game to levels in which the available
Builder skills are only polynomially many (and there is any number of other
skills), then the game is solvable in NP. Similarly, if the available Basher,
Miner, and Digger skills are polynomially many, the game is solvable in NP.
  Furthermore, we show that saving the maximum number of lemmings is APX-hard,
even when only one type of skill is available, whatever this skill is. This
contrasts with the membership in P of the decision problem restricted to levels
with no "deadly areas" (such as water or traps) and only Climber and Floater
skills, as previously established by Cormode.
