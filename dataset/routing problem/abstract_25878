Many methods have been proposed for community detection in networks. Some of
the most promising are methods based on statistical inference, which rest on
solid mathematical foundations and return excellent results in practice. In
this paper we show that two of the most widely used inference methods can be
mapped directly onto versions of the standard minimum-cut graph partitioning
problem, which allows us to apply any of the many well-understood partitioning
algorithms to the solution of community detection problems. We illustrate the
approach by adapting the Laplacian spectral partitioning method to perform
community inference, testing the resulting algorithm on a range of examples,
including computer-generated and real-world networks. Both the quality of the
results and the running time rival the best previous methods.
