A widely used defense practice against malicious traffic on the Internet is
through blacklists: lists of prolific attack sources are compiled and shared.
The goal of blacklists is to predict and block future attack sources. Existing
blacklisting techniques have focused on the most prolific attack sources and,
more recently, on collaborative blacklisting. In this paper, we formulate the
problem of forecasting attack sources (also referred to as predictive
blacklisting) based on shared attack logs as an implicit recommendation system.
We compare the performance of existing approaches against the upper bound for
prediction, and we demonstrate that there is much room for improvement.
Inspired by the recent Netflix competition, we propose a multi-level prediction
model that is adjusted and tuned specifically for the attack forecasting
problem. Our model captures and combines various factors, namely:
attacker-victim history (using time-series) and attackers and/or victims
interactions (using neighborhood models). We evaluate our combined method on
one month of logs from Dshield.org and demonstrate that it improves
significantly the state-of-the-art.
