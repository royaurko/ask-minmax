Within a theory of the existing fundamental length on the order of Planck's a
high-energy deformation of the General Relativity for the space with horizon
has been constructed. On this basis, Markov's work of the early eighties of the
last century has been given a new interpretation to show that the heuristic
model considered by him may be placed on a fundamental footing. The obtained
results have been applied to solving of the dark energy problem, making it
possible to frame the following hypothesis: a dynamic cosmological term is a
measure of deviation from a thermodynamic identity (the first law of
thermodynamics) of the high-energy (Planck's) deformation of Einstein equations
for horizon spaces in their thermodynamic interpretation.
