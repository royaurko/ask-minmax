We discuss various problems regarding the structure of the foliation of some
foliated submanifolds S of C^n, in particular Levi flat ones. As a general
scheme, we suppose that S is bounded along a coordinate (or a subset of
coordinates), and prove that the leaves of its foliation are complex planes.
