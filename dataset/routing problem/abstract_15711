We revisit some questions in supersymmetric hybrid inflation (SHI). We
analyze the amount of fine tuning required in various models, the problem of
decay at the end of inflation and the generation of baryons after inflation. We
find that the most natural setting for HI is in supersymmetric models with
non-renormalizable couplings. Furthermore, we argue that almost inevitably, one
of the fields involved is a modulus, with Planck scale variation. The resulting
moduli problem can be solved in two ways: either by a massive modulus (which
requires some fine tuning), or an enhanced symmetry point, in which the moduli
becomes strongly coupled to the Standard Model. Various possibilities for
baryon production are discussed.
