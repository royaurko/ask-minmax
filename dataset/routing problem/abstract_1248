We analyze the network congestion game with atomic players, asymmetric
strategies, and the maximum latency among all players as social cost. This
important social cost function is much less understood than the average
latency. We show that the price of anarchy is at most two, when the network is
a ring and the link latencies are linear. Our bound is tight. This is the first
sharp bound for the maximum latency objective.
