We consider the problem of estimating a signal corrupted by independent
interference with the assistance of a cost-constrained helper who knows the
interference causally or noncausally. When the interference is known causally,
we characterize the minimum distortion incurred in estimating the desired
signal. In the noncausal case, we present a general achievable scheme for
discrete memoryless systems and novel lower bounds on the distortion for the
binary and Gaussian settings. Our Gaussian setting coincides with that of
assisted interference suppression introduced by Grover and Sahai. Our lower
bound for this setting is based on the relation recently established by Verd\'u
between divergence and minimum mean squared error. We illustrate with a few
examples that this lower bound can improve on those previously developed. Our
bounds also allow us to characterize the optimal distortion in several
interesting regimes. Moreover, we show that causal and noncausal estimation are
not equivalent for this problem. Finally, we consider the case where the
desired signal is also available at the helper. We develop new lower bounds for
this setting that improve on those previously developed, and characterize the
optimal distortion up to a constant multiplicative factor for some regimes of
interest.
