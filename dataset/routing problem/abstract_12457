The static n-body problem of General Relativity states that there are, under
a reasonable energy condition, no static $n$-body configurations for $n > 1$,
provided the configuration of the bodies satisfies a suitable separation
condition. In this paper we solve this problem in the case that there exists a
closed, noncompact, totally geodesic surface disjoint from the bodies. This
covers the situation where the configuration has a reflection symmetry across a
noncompact surface disjoint from the bodies.
