In this paper we study the solution space structure of model RB, a standard
prototype of Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSPs) with growing domains. Using
rigorous the first and the second moment method, we show that in the solvable
phase close to the satisfiability transition, solutions are clustered into
exponential number of well-separated clusters, with each cluster contains
sub-exponential number of solutions. As a consequence, the system has a
clustering (dynamical) transition but no condensation transition. This picture
of phase diagram is different from other classic random CSPs with fixed domain
size, such as random K-Satisfiability (K-SAT) and graph coloring problems,
where condensation transition exists and is distinct from satisfiability
transition. Our result verifies the non-rigorous results obtained using cavity
method from spin glass theory, and sheds light on the structures of solution
spaces of problems with a large number of states.
