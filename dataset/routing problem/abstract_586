A Connected Dominating Set (CDS) based virtual backbone plays an important
role in wireless ad hoc networks for efficient routing and broadcasting. Each
node in the network can select some of its 1-hop neighbors as Multi Point Relay
(MPR) to cover all its 2-hop neighbors. A MPR based CDS is a promising approach
for broadcasting. A node in the CDS consumes more energy and the energy
depletes quickly than non dominating nodes. Although previous CDS construction
algorithms achieve good results in terms of the size of CDS, a minimum size CDS
does not necessarily guarantee an optimal network performance from an energy
efficient point of view. In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm for
energy efficient stable MPR based CDS construction to extend the lifetime of ad
hoc wireless networks by considering energy and velocity of nodes. We have also
implemented route discovery protocol to make use of the CDS nodes to relay
route request messages. The simulation results show that our algorithm
increases the lifetime up to 25% than previous works and 60% reduction in the
route request messages during route discovery process.
