Boolean satisfiability ({\SAT}) has played a key role in diverse areas
spanning testing, formal verification, planning, optimization, inferencing and
the like. Apart from the classical problem of checking boolean satisfiability,
the problems of generating satisfying uniformly at random, and of counting the
total number of satisfying assignments have also attracted significant
theoretical and practical interest over the years. Prior work offered heuristic
approaches with very weak or no guarantee of performance, and theoretical
approaches with proven guarantees, but poor performance in practice.
  We propose a novel approach based on limited-independence hashing that allows
us to design algorithms for both problems, with strong theoretical guarantees
and scalability extending to thousands of variables. Based on this approach, we
present two practical algorithms, {\UniformWitness}: a near uniform generator
and {\approxMC}: the first scalable approximate model counter, along with
reference implementations. Our algorithms work by issuing polynomial calls to
{\SAT} solver. We demonstrate scalability of our algorithms over a large set of
benchmarks arising from different application domains.
