We are interested in the inverse problem of recovering a Robin coefficient
defined on some non accessible part of the boundary from available data on
another part of the boundary in the nonstationary Stokes system. We prove a
Lipschitz stability estimate under the \textit{a priori} assumption that the
Robin coefficient lives in some compact and convex subset of a finite
dimensional vectorial subspace of the set of continuous functions. To do so, we
use a theorem proved by L. Bourgeois which establishes Lipschitz stability
estimates for a class of inverse problems in an abstract framework.
