In this paper the problem of recovering an algebraic dynamics in a
perturbative approach is discussed. The mathematical environment in which the
physical problem is considered is that of algebras of unbounded operators
endowed with the quasi-uniform topology. After some remarks on the domain of
the perturbation, conditions are given for the dynamics to exist as the limit
of a net of regularized linear maps.
