In this work, we develop a cutting method for solving problems with moving
and growing interfaces in 3D. This new method is able to resolve large
displacement or deformation of immersed objects by combining the Arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian method with only small local mesh deformation defined on
the reference domain, that is decomposed into the macro-elements. The linear
system of algebraic equations arising after the temporal and spatial
discretizations of a model parabolic interface heat-conduction-like problem
with vector-valued functions is solved by either an all-at-once or a segregated
algebraic multigrid method.
