Intricate comparison between two given tertiary structures of proteins is as
important as the comparison of their functions. Several algorithms have been
devised to compute the similarity and dissimilarity among protein structures.
But, these algorithms compare protein structures by structural alignment of the
protein backbones which are usually unable to determine precise differences. In
this paper, an attempt has been made to compute the similarities and
dissimilarities among 3D protein structures using the fundamental mathematical
morphology operations and fractal geometry which can resolve the problem of
real differences. In doing so, two techniques are being used here in
determining the superficial structural (global similarity) and local similarity
in atomic level of the protein molecules. This intricate structural difference
would provide insight to Biologists to understand the protein structures and
their functions more precisely.
