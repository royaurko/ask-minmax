Computer modeling and simulations are performed to investigate capillary
bridges spontaneously formed between closely packed colloidal particles in
phase separating liquids. The simulations reveal a self-stabilization mechanism
that operates through diffusive equilibrium of two-phase liquid morphologies.
Such mechanism renders desired microstructural stability and uniformity to the
capillary bridges that are spontaneously formed during liquid solution phase
separation. This self-stabilization behavior is in contrast to conventional
coarsening processes during phase separation. The volume fraction limit of the
separated liquid phases as well as the adhesion strength and thermodynamic
stability of the capillary bridges are discussed. Capillary bridge formations
in various compact colloid assemblies are considered. The study sheds light on
a promising route to in-situ (in-liquid) firming of fragile colloidal crystals
and other compact colloidal microstructures via capillary bridges.
