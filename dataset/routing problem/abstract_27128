Kuhn-Tucker points play a fundamental role in the analysis and the numerical
solution of monotone inclusion problems, providing in particular both primal
and dual solutions. We propose a class of strongly convergent algorithms for
constructing the best approximation to a reference point from the set of
Kuhn-Tucker points of a general Hilbertian composite monotone inclusion
problem. Applications to systems of coupled monotone inclusions are presented.
Our framework does not impose additional assumptions on the operators present
in the formulation, and it does not require knowledge of the norm of the linear
operators involved in the compositions or the inversion of linear operators.
