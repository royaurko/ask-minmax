We consider the problem of separation of variables in the Kramers equation
admitting a non-trivial symmetry group. Provided the external potential $V(x)$
is at most quadratic, a complete solution of the problem of separation of
variables is obtained. Furthermore, we construct solutions of the Kramers
equation with separated variables in explicit form.
