Partially observable Markov decision processes have been widely used to
provide models for real-world decision making problems. In this paper, we will
provide a method in which a slightly different version of them called Mixed
observability Markov decision process, MOMDP, is going to join with our
problem. Basically, we aim at offering a behavioural model for interaction of
intelligent agents with musical pitch environment and we will show that how
MOMDP can shed some light on building up a decision making model for musical
pitch conveniently.
