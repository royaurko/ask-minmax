We study the Cauchy problem for a multidimensional scalar conservation law on
the Bohr compactification of $\R^n$. The existence and uniqueness of entropy
solutions are established in the general case of merely continuous flux vector.
We propose also the necessary and sufficient condition for the decay of entropy
solutions as time $t\to+\infty$.
