While in the early 90s High Energy Physics (HEP) lead the computing industry
by establishing the HTTP protocol and the first web-servers, the long
time-scale for planning and building modern HEP experiments has resulted in a
generally slow adoption of emerging computing technologies which rapidly become
commonplace in business and other scientific fields. I will overview some of
the fundamental computing problems in HEP computing and then present the
current state and future potential of employing new computing technologies in
addressing these problems.
