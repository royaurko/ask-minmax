The recovery of society after a large scale disaster generally consists of
two phases, short- and long-term recoveries. The problem of short-term recovery
is rather close to the problem of resilience in their goal, namely, bouncing
the damaged system back to the operating standards. The present paper proposes
an algorithm for the vital resource redistribution required for implementation
of the short-term recovery. The developed model is based on the cooperative
interaction of cities during the resource redistribution, ordering the cities
according to their priority in resource delivery, and a generating a
semi-optimal plan for the desired redistribution. Nonlinear effects caused by
the city limit capacities are taken into account. Two types of systems,
"uniform" and "centralized", are studied numerically. In particular it is
demonstrated that the cooperation effects are able to shorten substantially the
duration of the process required for its implementation.
