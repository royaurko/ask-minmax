In this paper, we consider fundamental problems of the dynamics of internal
gravity waves. We present analytical and numerical algorithms for calculating
the wave fields for a set of values of the parameters, as observed in the
ocean. We show that our mathematical models can describe the wave dynamics of
the Arctic Basin, taking into account the actual physical characteristics of
sea water, topography of its floor, etc. The numerical and analytical results
show that the internal gravity waves have a significant effect on underwater
sea objects in the Arctic Basin.
