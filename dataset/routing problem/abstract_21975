We consider a one-dimensional stochastic differential equations (SDE) with
irregular coefficients. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the
$L^p(\Omega)$-difference of SDEs using the norm of the difference of
coefficients, where the discontinuous drift coefficient satisfies a one-sided
Lipschitz condition and the diffusion coefficient is bounded, uniformly
elliptic and H\"older continuous. As an application, we consider the stability
problem.
