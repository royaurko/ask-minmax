In this talk attention is drawn to thermal properties due to the addition of
eight quark interactions in the standard $SU(3)\times SU(3)$ chiral
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model (NJL) with 't Hooft interaction (NJLH). The schematic
SU(3) flavor limit with massless current quarks as well as the realistic case
$m_u=m_d\ne m_s$ are discussed.
