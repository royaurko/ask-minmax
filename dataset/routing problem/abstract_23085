Noise is often used in the study of open systems, such as in classical
Brownian motion and in Quantum Dynamics, to model the influence of the
environment. However generalising results from G\"{o}del and Chaitin in
mathematics suggests that systems that are sufficiently rich that
self-referencing is possible contain intrinsic randomness. We argue that this
is relevant to modelling the universe, even though it is by definition a closed
system. We show how a three-dimensional process-space may arise, as a Prigogine
dissipative structure, from a non-geometric order-disorder model driven by,
what is termed, self-referential noise.
