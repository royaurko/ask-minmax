The main challenge in wireless sensor network is to improve the fault
tolerance of each node and also provide an energy efficient fast data routing
service. In this paper we propose an energy efficient node fault diagnosis and
recovery for wireless sensor networks referred as fault tolerant multipath
routing scheme for energy efficient wireless sensor network (FTMRS).The FTMRS
is based on multipath data routing scheme. One shortest path is use for main
data routing in FTMRS technique and other two backup paths are used as
alternative path for faulty network and to handle the overloaded traffic on
main channel. Shortest path data routing ensures energy efficient data routing.
The performance analysis of FTMRS shows better results compared to other
popular fault tolerant techniques in wireless sensor networks.
