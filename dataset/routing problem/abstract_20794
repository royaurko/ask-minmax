EI-categories are a simultaneous generalisation of finite groups and finite
quivers without oriented cycles. It is therefore a natural question to ask for
a characterisation of finite representation type. For special classes of
EI-categories a complete characterisation is obtained using quiver techniques.
For EI-categories with two objects we present a necessary criterion for finite
representation type. The complexity of this classification problem is
illustrated by some examples.
