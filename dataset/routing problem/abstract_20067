We answer three problems by J. D. Monk on cardinal invariants of Boolean
algebras. Two of these are whether taking the algebraic density pi(A), resp.
the topological density d(A), of a Boolean algebra A commutes with formation
of ultraproducts; the third one compares the number of endomorphisms and of
ideals of a Boolean algebra.
