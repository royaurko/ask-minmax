The problem of describing low-energy two-body scattering for systems with two
open channels with different thresholds is addressed in the context of an
effective field theory. In particular, the problem where the threshold is
unnaturally small and the cross section at low energy is unnaturally large is
considered. It is shown that the lowest-order point coupling associated with
the mixing of the channels scales as $\Lambda^{-2}$ rather than $\Lambda^{-1}$
(the scaling of the same-channel coupling and the scaling in a single-channel
case) where $\Lambda$ is the ultraviolet cutoff. The renormalization of the
theory at lowest order is given explicitly. The treatment of higher orders is
straightforward. The potential implications for systems with deep open channels
are discussed.
