We study the following geometric representation problem: Given a graph whose
vertices correspond to axis-aligned rectangles with fixed dimensions, arrange
the rectangles without overlaps in the plane such that two rectangles touch if
the graph contains an edge between them. This problem is called \textsc{Contact
Representation of Word Networks} (\textsc{Crown}) since it formalizes the
geometric problem behind drawing word clouds in which semantically related
words are close to each other. \textsc{Crown} is known to be NP-hard, and there
are approximation algorithms for certain graph classes for the optimization
version, \textsc{Max-Crown}, in which realizing each desired adjacency yields a
certain profit. We present the first $O(1)$-approximation algorithm for the
general case, when the input is a complete weighted graph, and for the
bipartite case. Since the subgraph of realized adjacencies is necessarily
planar, we also consider several planar graph classes (namely stars, trees,
outerplanar, and planar graphs), improving upon the known results. For some
graph classes, we also describe improvements in the unweighted case, where each
adjacency yields the same profit. Finally, we show that the problem is APX-hard
on bipartite graphs of bounded maximum degree.
