We present a waveform relaxation version of the Dirichlet-Neumann method for
parabolic problem. Like the Dirichlet-Neumann method for steady problems, the
method is based on a non-overlapping spatial domain decomposition, and the
iteration involves subdomain solves with Dirichlet boundary conditions followed
by subdomain solves with Neumann boundary conditions. However, each subdomain
problem is now in space and time, and the interface conditions are also
time-dependent. Using a Laplace transform argument, we show for the heat
equation that when we consider finite time intervals, the Dirichlet-Neumann
method converges, similar to the case of Schwarz waveform relaxation
algorithms. The convergence rate depends on the length of the subdomains as
well as the size of the time window. In this discussion, we only stick to the
linear bound. We illustrate our results with numerical experiments.
