We consider two inverse problems related to the tokamak \textsl{Tore Supra}
through the study of the magnetostatic equation for the poloidal flux. The
first one deals with the Cauchy issue of recovering in a two dimensional
annular domain boundary magnetic values on the inner boundary, namely the
limiter, from available overdetermined data on the outer boundary. Using tools
from complex analysis and properties of genereralized Hardy spaces, we
establish stability and existence properties. Secondly the inverse problem of
recovering the shape of the plasma is addressed thank tools of shape
optimization. Again results about existence and optimality are provided. They
give rise to a fast algorithm of identification which is applied to several
numerical simulations computing good results either for the classical harmonic
case or for the data coming from \textsl{Tore Supra}.
