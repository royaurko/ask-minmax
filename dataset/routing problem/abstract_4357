We present several examples of quasi-exactly solvable $N$-body problems in
one, two and higher dimensions. We study various aspects of these problems in
some detail. In particular, we show that in some of these examples the
corresponding polynomials form an orthogonal set and many of their properties
are similar to those of the Bender-Dunne polynomials. We also discuss QES
problems where the polynomials do not form an orthogonal set.
