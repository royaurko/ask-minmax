We present a novel laser mode-locking scheme and discuss its unusual
properties and feasibility using a theoretical model. A large set of
single-frequency continuous-wave lasers oscillate by amplification in spatially
separated gain media. They are mutually phase-locked by nonlinear feedback from
a common saturable absorber. As a result, ultra short pulses are generated. The
new scheme offers three significant benefits: the light that is amplified in
each medium is continuous wave, thereby avoiding issues related to group
velocity dispersion and nonlinear effects that can perturb the pulse shape. The
set of frequencies on which the laser oscillates, and therefore the pulse
repetition rate, is controlled by the geometry of resonator-internal optical
elements, not by the cavity length. Finally, the bandwidth of the laser can be
controlled by switching gain modules on and off. This scheme offers a route to
mode-locked lasers with high average output power, repetition rates that can be
scaled into the THz range, and a bandwidth that can be dynamically controlled.
The approach is particularly suited for implementation using semiconductor
diode laser arrays.
