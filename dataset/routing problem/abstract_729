In this paper, Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) is used for Zone
Routing Protocol (ZRP) in Mobile Ad-hoc Network instead of Genetic Algorithm
(GA). It is an evolutionary approach, it is used when the network size grows
and the search space increases. When the destination is outside the zone, EDA
is applied to find the route with minimum cost and time. Finally, the
implementation of proposed method is compared with Genetic ZRP, i.e., GZRP and
the result demonstrates better performance for the proposed method. Since the
method provides a set of paths to the destination, it results in load balance
to the network. As both EDA and GA use random search method to reach the
optimal point, the searching cost reduced significantly, especially when the
number of data is large.
