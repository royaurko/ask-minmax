We consider the problem of recognizing a vocabulary--a collection of words
(sequences) over a finite alphabet--from a potential subsequence of one of its
words. We assume the given subsequence is received through a deletion channel
as a result of transmission of a random word from one of the two generic
underlying vocabularies. An exact maximum a posterior (MAP) solution for this
problem counts the number of ways a given subsequence can be derived from
particular subsets of candidate vocabularies, requiring exponential time or
space.
  We present a polynomial approximation algorithm for this problem. The
algorithm makes no prior assumption about the rules and patterns governing the
structure of vocabularies. Instead, through off-line processing of
vocabularies, it extracts data regarding regularity patterns in the
subsequences of each vocabulary. In the recognition phase, the algorithm just
uses this data, called subsequence-histogram, to decide in favor of one of the
vocabularies. We provide examples to demonstrate the performance of the
algorithm and show that it can achieve the same performance as MAP in some
situations.
  Potential applications include bioinformatics, storage systems, and search
engines.
