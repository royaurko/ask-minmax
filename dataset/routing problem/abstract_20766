The paper concerns the automorphism groups of Cayley graphs over cyclic
groups which have a rational spectrum (rational circulant graphs for short).
With the aid of the techniques of Schur rings it is shown that the problem is
equivalent to consider the automorphism groups of orthogonal group block
structures of cyclic groups. Using this observation, the required groups are
expressed in terms of generalized wreath products of symmetric groups.
