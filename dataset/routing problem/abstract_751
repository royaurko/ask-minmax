We study the optimal routing on multilayered communication networks, which
are composed of two layers of subnetworks. One is a wireless network, and the
other is a wired network. We develop a simple recurrent algorithm to find an
optimal routing on this kind of multilayered network, where the single-channel
transmission mode and the multichannel transmission mode used on the wireless
subnetwork are considered, respectively. Compared with the performance of the
shortest path algorithm, our algorithm can significantly enhance the transport
capacity. We show that our methods proposed in this letter could take advantage
of the coupling of the two layers to the most extent, so that the wireless
subnetwork could sufficiently utilize the wired subnetwork for transportation.
