We study the one-way number-on-the-forehead (NOF) communication complexity of
the $k$-layer pointer jumping problem with $n$ vertices per layer. This classic
problem, which has connections to many aspects of complexity theory, has seen a
recent burst of research activity, seemingly preparing the ground for an
$\Omega(n)$ lower bound, for constant $k$. Our first result is a surprising
sublinear -- i.e., $o(n)$ -- upper bound for the problem that holds for $k \ge
3$, dashing hopes for such a lower bound. A closer look at the protocol
achieving the upper bound shows that all but one of the players involved are
collapsing, i.e., their messages depend only on the composition of the layers
ahead of them. We consider protocols for the pointer jumping problem where all
players are collapsing. Our second result shows that a strong $n - O(\log n)$
lower bound does hold in this case. Our third result is another upper bound
showing that nontrivial protocols for (a non-Boolean version of) pointer
jumping are possible even when all players are collapsing. Our lower bound
result uses a novel proof technique, different from those of earlier lower
bounds that had an information-theoretic flavor. We hope this is useful in
further study of the problem.
