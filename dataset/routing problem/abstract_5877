We show strongly secret achievable rate regions for two different wiretap
multiple-access channel coding problems. In the first problem, each encoder has
a private message and both together have a common message to transmit. The
encoders have entropy-limited access to common randomness. If no common
randomness is available, then the achievable region derived here does not allow
for the secret transmission of a common message. The second coding problem
assumes that the encoders do not have a common message nor access to common
randomness. However, they may have a conferencing link over which they may
iteratively exchange rate-limited information. This can be used to form a
common message and common randomness to reduce the second coding problem to the
first one. We give the example of a channel where the achievable region equals
zero without conferencing or common randomness and where conferencing
establishes the possibility of secret message transmission. Both coding
problems describe practically relevant networks which need to be secured
against eavesdropping attacks.
