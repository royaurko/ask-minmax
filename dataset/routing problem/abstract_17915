Record linkage concerns identifying semantically equivalent records in
databases. Blocking methods are employed to avoid the cost of full pairwise
similarity comparisons on $n$ records. In a seminal work, Hernandez and Stolfo
proposed the Sorted Neighborhood blocking method. Several empirical variants
have been proposed in recent years. In this paper, we investigate the
complexity of the Sorted Neighborhood procedure on which the variants are
built. We show that achieving maximum performance on the Sorted Neighborhood
procedure entails solving a sub-problem, which is shown to be NP-complete by
reducing from the Travelling Salesman Problem. We also show that the
sub-problem can occur in the traditional blocking method. Finally, we draw on
recent developments concerning approximate Travelling Salesman solutions to
define and analyze three approximation algorithms.
