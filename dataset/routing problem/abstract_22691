We justify a recently proposed prescription for performing Green Function
Monte Carlo calculations on systems of lattice fermions, by which one is able
to avoid the sign problem. We generalize the prescription such that it can also
be used for problems with hopping terms of different signs. We prove that the
effective Hamiltonian, used in this method, leads to an upper bound for the
ground-state energy of the real Hamiltonian, and we illustrate the
effectiveness of the method on small systems.
