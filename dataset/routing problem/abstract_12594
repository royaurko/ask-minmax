We use probabilistic methods to study classical solutions for systems of
interacting semilinear parabolic partial differential equations. In a modeling
framework for a financial market with interacting Ito and point processes, such
PDEs are shown to provide a natural description for the solution of hedging and
valuation problems for contingent claims with a recursive payoff structure.
