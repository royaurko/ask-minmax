The school choice mechanism design problem focuses on assignment mechanisms
matching students to public schools in a given school district. The well-known
Gale Shapley Student Optimal Stable Matching Mechanism (SOSM) is the most
efficient stable mechanism proposed so far as a solution to this problem.
However its inefficiency is well-documented, and recently the Efficiency
Adjusted Deferred Acceptance Mechanism (EADAM) was proposed as a remedy for
this weakness. In this note we describe two related adjustments to SOSM with
the intention to address the same inefficiency issue. In one we create possibly
artificial coalitions among students where some students modify their
preference profiles in order to improve the outcome for some other students.
Our second approach involves trading cliques among students where those
involved improve their assignments by waiving some of their priorities. The
coalition method yields the EADAM outcome among other Pareto dominations of the
SOSM outcome, while the clique method yields all possible Pareto optimal Pareto
dominations of SOSM. The clique method furthermore incorporates a natural
solution to the problem of breaking possible ties within preference and
priority profiles. We discuss the practical implications and limitations of our
approach in the final section of the article.
