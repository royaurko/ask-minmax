The random XORSAT problem deals with large random linear systems of Boolean
variables. The difficulty of such problems is controlled by the ratio of number
of equations to number of variables. It is known that in some range of values
of this parameter, the space of solutions breaks into many disconnected
clusters. Here we study precisely the corresponding geometrical organization.
In particular, the distribution of distances between these clusters is computed
by the cavity method. This allows to study the `x-satisfiability' threshold,
the critical density of equations where there exist two solutions at a given
distance.
