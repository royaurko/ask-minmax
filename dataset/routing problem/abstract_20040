We consider the uniqueness problem of a negative eigenvalue in the spectrum
of small fluctuations about a bounce solution in a multidimensional case. Our
approach is based on the concept of conjugate points from Morse theory and is a
natural generalization of the nodal theorem approach usually used in one
dimensional case. We show that bounce solution has exactly one conjugate point
at $\tau=0$ with multiplicity one.
