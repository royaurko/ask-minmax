Recent frequency-modulated atomic force microscopy (FM-AFM) can measure
three-dimensional force distribution between a probe and a sample surface in
liquid. The force distribution is, in the present circumstances, assumed to be
solvation structure on the sample surface, because the force distribution and
solvation structure have somewhat similar shape. However, the force
distribution is exactly not the solvation structure. If we would like to obtain
the solvation structure by using the liquid AFM, a method for transforming the
force distribution into the solvation structure is necessary. Therefore, in
this letter, we present the transforming method in a brief style. We call this
method as a solution for an inverse problem, because the solvation structure is
obtained at first and the force distribution is obtained next in general
calculation processes. The method is formulated (mainly) by statistical
mechanics of liquid.
