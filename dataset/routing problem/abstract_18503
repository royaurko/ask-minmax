We re-examine the fine tuning problem of the Higgs mass, when an
antisymmetric two form Kalb-Ramond (KR) field is present in the bulk of a
Randall-Sundrum (RS) braneworld. Taking into account the back-reaction of the
KR field, we obtain the exact correction to the RS metric. The modified metric
also warps the Higgs mass from Planck scale (in higher dimension) to TeV scale
(on the visible brane) for a range of values of $kr$ exceeding the original RS
value (where $k=$ Planck mass and $r=$ size of extra dimension). However, it
requires an extraordinary suppression of the KR field density, indicating the
re-appearence of the fine tuning problem in a different guise. The new
spacetime also generates a small negative cosmological constant on the visible
brane. These results are particularly relevant for certain string based models,
where the KR field is unavoidably present in the bulk. We further show that
such a bulk antisymmetric KR field fails to stabilize the braneworld.
