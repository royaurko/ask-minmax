In our proposed model, the route selection is a function of following
parameters: hop count, trust level of node and security level of application.
In this paper, to focus on secure neighbor detection, trust factor evaluation,
operational mode, route discovery and route selection. The paper mainly address
the security of geographic routing. The watchdog identifies misbehaving nodes,
while the Pathselector avoids routing packets through these nodes. The
watchdog, the pathselector is run by each server. In order to keep the source
informed about the destination's mobility, the destination keeps sending the
alert message to its previous hop telling that it has changed its position and
any reference to it for data packet forwarding be informed to the VHR server.
