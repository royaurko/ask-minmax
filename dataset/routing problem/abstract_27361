It is known that design of elastic cloaks is much more challenging than the
design idea for acoustic cloaks, cloaks of electromagnetic waves or scalar
problems of anti-plane shear. In this paper, we address fully the fourth-order
problem and develop a model of a broadband invisibility cloak for channelling
flexural waves in thin plates around finite inclusions. We also discuss an
option to employ efficiently an elastic pre-stress and body forces to achieve
such a result. An asymptotic derivation provides a rigorous link between the
model in question and elastic wave propagation in thin solids. This is
discussed in detail to show connection with non-symmetric formulations in
vector elasticity studied in earlier work.
