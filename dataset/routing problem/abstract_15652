In this talk I review the `puzzles' associated with the fermion mass matrices
and describe some recent attempts to resolve them, at least partially. Models
which attempt to explain the observed mass hierarchy as arising from radiative
corrections are discussed. I then scrutinize possible inter--relations among
quark and lepton masses and the mixing angles in the context of grand unified
theories. It is argued that the absence of CP violation in the strong
interaction sector (the strong CP problem) may also have its origin in the
structure of the quark mass matrices; such a resolution does not invoke
approximate global $U(1)$ symmetries resulting in the axion. Arguments in favor
of tiny neutrino masses are summarized (the solar neutrino puzzle, atmospheric
neutrino problem) and ways to accommodate them naturally are described.
