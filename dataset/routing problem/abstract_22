In the current paper we have investigated the capacitated distance constraint
vehicle routing problem for the standard approximation algorithm. This problem
consists of a number of different types of vehicles at the depot which differ
at their capacity, cost and maximum distance bound. We have designed an
approximation algorithm for this problem in the case that the tours are
balanced.
