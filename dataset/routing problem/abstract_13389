Let $\Lambda X$ be the free loop space on a simply connected finite
$CW$-complex $X$ and $\beta_{i}(\Lambda X;\Bbbk)$ be the cardinality of a
minimal generating set of $H^{i}(\Lambda X;\Bbbk)$ for $\Bbbk$ to be a
commutative ring with unit. The sequence $ \beta_{i}(\Lambda X;\Bbbk) $ grows
unbounded if and only if $\tilde {H}^{\ast}(X;\Bbbk)$ requires at least two
algebra generators. This in particular answers to a long standing problem
whether a simply connected closed smooth manifold has infinitely many
geometrically distinct closed geodesics in any Riemannian metric.
