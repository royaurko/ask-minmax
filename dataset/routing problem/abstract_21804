We consider the Cauchy problem for systems of cubic nonlinear Klein-Gordon
equations in one space dimension. Under a suitable structural condition on the
nonlinearity, we will show that the small amplitude solution gains an
additional logarithmic decay in comparison with the free evolution in the sense
of $L^p$, $2\le p \le \infty$.
