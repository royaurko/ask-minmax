The observed dark energy in the universe might give particles inertial mass.
We investigate one realization of this idea, that the dark energy field might
be a decayed scalar component of a supermultiplet field in the early universe
that creates inertial mass through spontaneous symmetry breaking, e.g. a Higgs
field. To investigate this possibility, the cosmological Friedmann equation of
energy balance is augmented in a standard way to incorporate a minimally
coupled cosmological Higgs. For epochs where the expansion of the universe is
driven by matter and radiation and not the scalar field, the observed hidden
nature of the Higgs field can be codified into a single differential equation
that we call the "hidden higgs" condition. The resulting differential equation
is solved for the time dependant scalar field and a simple and interesting
solution is found analytically. Such a Higgs field decays from Planck scale
energies rapidly and approximately exponentially from onset, leaving only the
initially negligible constant term of the potential as a final cosmological
constant. Such evolution replaces the hierarchy problem with the problem of
explaining why such evolution is physically justified.
