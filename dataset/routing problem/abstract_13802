This paper proposes a very simple perturbative technique to calculate the
low-lying eigenvalues and eigenstates of a parity-symmetric quantum-mechanical
potential. The technique is to solve the time-independent Schroedinger
eigenvalue problem as a perturbation series in which the perturbation parameter
is the energy itself. Unlike nearly all perturbation series for physical
problems, for the ground state this perturbation expansion is convergent and,
even though the ground-state energy is in general not small compared with 1,
the perturbative results are numerically accurate. The perturbation series is
divergent for higher energy levels but can be easily evaluated by using methods
such as Pade summation.
