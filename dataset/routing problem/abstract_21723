We address the problem of classification of integrable
differential-difference equations in 2+1 dimensions with one/two discrete
variables. Our approach is based on the method of hydrodynamic reductions and
its generalisation to dispersive equations. We obtain a number of
classification results of scalar integrable equations including that of the
intermediate long wave and Toda type.
