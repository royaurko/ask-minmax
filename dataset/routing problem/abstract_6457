In this paper, we address the problem of how many randomly labeled patterns
can be correctly classified by a single-layer perceptron when the patterns are
correlated with each other. In order to solve this problem, two analytical
schemes are developed based on the replica method and Thouless-Anderson-Palmer
(TAP) approach by utilizing an integral formula concerning random rectangular
matrices. The validity and relevance of the developed methodologies are shown
for one known result and two example problems. A message-passing algorithm to
perform the TAP scheme is also presented.
