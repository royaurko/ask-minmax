We prove a point-wise and average bound for the number of incidences between
points and hyper-planes in vector spaces over finite fields. While our
estimates are, in general, sharp, we observe an improvement for product sets
and sets contained in a sphere. We use these incidence bounds to obtain
significant improvements on the arithmetic problem of covering ${\mathbb F}_q$,
the finite field with q elements, by $A \cdot A+... +A \cdot A$, where A is a
subset ${\mathbb F}_q$ of sufficiently large size. We also use the incidence
machinery we develope and arithmetic constructions to study the Erdos-Falconer
distance conjecture in vector spaces over finite fields. We prove that the
natural analog of the Euclidean Erdos-Falconer distance conjecture does not
hold in this setting due to the influence of the arithmetic. On the positive
side, we obtain good exponents for the Erdos -Falconer distance problem for
subsets of the unit sphere in $\mathbb F_q^d$ and discuss their sharpness. This
results in a reasonably complete description of the Erdos-Falconer distance
problem in higher dimensional vector spaces over general finite fields.
