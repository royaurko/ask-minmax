We show that in a large volume scenario of type IIB string or F-theory
compactifications, single thermal inflation provides only a partial solution to
the cosmological problem of the light volume modulus. We then clarify the
conditions for double thermal inflation, being a simple extension of the usual
single thermal inflation scenario, to solve the cosmological moduli problem in
the case of relatively light moduli masses. Using a specific example, we
demonstrate that double thermal inflation can be realized in large volume
scenario in a natural manner, and the problem of the light volume modulus can
be solved for the whole relevant mass range. We also find that right amount of
baryon asymmetry and dark matter can be obtained via a late-time Affleck-Dine
mechanism and the decays of the visible sector NLSP to flatino LSP.
