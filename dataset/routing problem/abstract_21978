The concept of freeness was introduced by Voiculescu in the context of
operator algebras. Later it was observed that it is also relevant for large
random matrices. We will show how the combination of various free probability
results with a linearization trick allows to address successfully the problem
of determining the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of general selfadjoint
polynomials in independent random matrices.
