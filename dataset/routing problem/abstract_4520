We give an updated extended survey of results related to the celebrated
unsolved generalized R. L. Moore problem. In particular, we address the problem
of characterizing codimension one manifold factors, i.e. spaces $X$ having the
property that $X \times \mathbb{R}$ is a topological manifold. A main part of
the paper is devoted to many efficient general position techniques, which have
been used to solve special cases of this problem.
