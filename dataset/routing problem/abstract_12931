Continuing our previous work (Cohn, Lam, Lu, Yang, Nonlinear Analysis (2011),
doi: 10.1016 /j.na.2011.09.053), we obtain a class of Trudinger-Moser
inequalities on the entire Heisenberg group, which indicate what the best
constants are. All the existing proofs of similar inequalities on unbounded
domain of the Euclidean space or the Heisenberg group are based on
rearrangement argument. In this note, we propose a new approach to solve this
problem. Specifically we get the global Trudinger-Moser inequality by gluing
local estimates with the help of cut-off functions. Our method still works for
similar problems when the Heisenberg group is replaced by the Eclidean space or
complete noncompact Riemannian manifolds.
