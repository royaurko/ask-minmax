Let D be an arbitrary subset of the natural numbers. For every n, let M(n;D)
be the maximum of the cardinality of a set of Hamiltonian paths in the complete
graph K_n such that the union of any two paths from the family contains a not
necessarily induced cycle of some length from D. We determine or bound the
asymptotics of M(n;D) in various special cases. This problem is closely related
to that of the permutation capacity of graphs and constitutes a further
extension of the problem area around Shannon capacity. We also discuss how to
generalize our cycle-difference problems and present an example where cycles
are replaced by 4-cliques. These problems are in a natural duality to those of
graph intersection, initiated by Erd\"os, Simonovits and S\'os. The lack of
kernel structure as a natural candidate for optimum makes our problems quite
challenging.
