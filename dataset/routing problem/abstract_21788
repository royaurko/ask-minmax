A parabolic integro differential operator operator L suitable to describe
many phenomena in various physical fields,is considered. By means of
equivalence between L and the third order equation which describe the evolution
inside an exponentially shaped Josephson junction (ESJJ), an asymptotic
analysis for (ESJJ) is achieved, evaluating explicitly boundary contributions
related to the Dirichlet problem.
