We prove a global result in time for the initial value problem for the
relativistic Boltzmann equation on the flat Robertson-Walker sapace time, in
the functional framework appropriate to the coupling with Einstein's equations.
We had nowhere to restrict the size of the initial data which can hence be
taken arbitrarily large.
