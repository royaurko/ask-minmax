In some areas of management and commerce, especially in Electronic commerce
(E-commerce), that are accelerated by advances in Web technologies, it is
essential to support the decision making process using formal methods. Among
the problems of E-commerce applications: reducing the time of data access so
that huge databases can be searched quickly; decreasing the cost of database
design ... etc. We present the application of Decision Diagrams design using
Information Theory approach to improve database access speeds. We show that
such utilization provides systematic and visual ways of applying Decision
Making methods to simplify complex Web engineering problems.
