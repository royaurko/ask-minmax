In this paper, we consider the boundary M of a weakly pseudoconvex domain in
a Stein manifold. We point out a striking difference between the local
cohomology and the global cohomology of M, and illustrate this with an example.
We also discuss the first and second Cousin problems, and the strong Poincare
problem for CR meromorphic functions on the weakly pseudoconvex boundary M.
