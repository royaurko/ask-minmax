The main question we raise here is the following one: given a real orthogonal
n by n matrix X, is it true that there exists a rational orthogonal matrix Y
having the same zero-pattern? We conjecture that this is the case and prove it
for n<=5. We also consider the related problem for symmetric orthogonal
matrices.
