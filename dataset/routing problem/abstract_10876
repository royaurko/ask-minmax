This is the abstract prepared for Workshop on Topology and Geometry (Zhang
jiang, China, October 1994), and is a review of my recent works. What kinds of
combinations of singularities can appear in small deformation fibers of a fixed
singularity? We consider this problem for hypersurface singularities on complex
analytic spaces of dimension 2. For all singularities in the beginning par t of
Arnold's classification list, the answer to this problem is given by a unique
principle described by Dynkin graphs. This article contains several figures. I
will send the hard copy containin g figures by mail with envelope and stamps
under request.
