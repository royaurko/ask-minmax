Current observations stimulate the production of fully three-dimensional
explosion models, which in turn motivates three-dimensional spectrum synthesis
for supernova atmospheres. We briefly discuss techniques adapted to address the
latter problem, and consider some fundamentals of line formation in supernovae
without recourse to spherical symmetry. Direct and detailed extensions of the
technique are discussed, and future work is outlined.
