Two theorems and one conjecture about nodal sets of eigenfunctions arising in
various spectral problems for the Laplacian are reviewed. It occurred that all
these assertions are incorrect or only partly correct, but their analysis has
brought better understanding of the corresponding area of mathematical physics.
The contribution made by V. I. Arnold is emphasized.
