This note makes a self-contained exposition of the basic facts of big bang
cosmology as they relate to inflation. The fundamental problems with that model
are then explored. A quartic scalar potential model of inflation is evaluated
which provides the solution of those problems and makes predictions which will
soon be definitively tested. The possibility that the recently discovered
fundamental Higgs scalar field drives inflation is explored.
