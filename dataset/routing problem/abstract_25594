Recent work of Ein-Lazarsfeld-Smith and Hochster-Huneke raised the problem of
determining which symbolic powers of an ideal are contained in a given ordinary
power of the ideal. Bocci-Harbourne defined a quantity called the resurgence to
address this problem for homogeneous ideals in polynomial rings, with a focus
on zero dimensional subschemes of projective space; the methods and results
obtained there have much less to say about higher dimensional subschemes. Here
we take the first steps toward extending this work to higher dimensional
subschemes. We introduce new asymptotic versions of the resurgence and obtain
upper and lower bounds on them for ideals of smooth subschemes, generalizing
what is done by Bocci-Harbourne. We apply these bounds to ideals of unions of
general lines in ${\bf P}^N$. We also pose a Nagata type conjecture for
symbolic powers of ideals of lines in ${\bf P}^3$.
