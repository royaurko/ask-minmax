We demonstrate a novel route of spatially organizing the colloid arrangements
on the polymer-grafted substrate by use of self-consistent field and density
functional theories. We find that grafting of polymers onto a substrate can
effectively control spatial dispersions of deposited colloids as a result of
the balance between colloidal settling force and entropically elastic force of
brushes, and colloids can form unexpected ordered structures on a grafting
substrate. The depositing process of colloidal particles onto the elastic
"soft" substrate includes two steps: brush-mediated one-dimensional arrangement
of colloidal crystals and controlled layer-by-layer growth driven entropically
by non-adsorbing polymer solvent with increasing the particles. The result
indicates a possibility for the production of highly ordered and defect-free
structures by simply using the grafted substrate instead of periodically
patterned templates, under appropriate selection of colloidal size, effective
depositing potential, and brush coverage density.
