Since the work [13] by Guo [Invent. Math. 153 (2003), no. 3, 593--630], how
to establish the global existence of perturbative classical solutions around a
global Maxwellian to the Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system with the whole range
of soft potentials has been an open problem. This is mainly due to the complex
structure of the system, in particular, the degenerate dissipation at large
velocity, the velocity-growth of the nonlinear term induced by the Lorentz
force, and the regularity-loss of the electromagnetic fields. This paper aims
to resolve this problem in the whole space provided that initial perturbation
has sufficient regularity and velocity-integrability.
