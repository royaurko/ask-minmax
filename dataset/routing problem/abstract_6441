We consider the N-vortex problem on a ellipsoid of revolution. Applying
standard techniques of classical perturbation theory we construct a sequence of
conformal transformations from the ellipsoid into the complex plane. Using
these transformations the equations of motion for the N-vortex problem on the
ellipsoid are written as a formal series on the eccentricity of the ellipsoid's
generating ellipse. First order equations are obtained explicitly. We show
numerically that the truncated first order system for the three-vortices system
on the symmetric ellipsoid is non-integrable.
