We present algorithms for generating alternative solutions for explicit
acyclic AND/OR structures in non-decreasing order of cost. The proposed
algorithms use a best first search technique and report the solutions using an
implicit representation ordered by cost. In this paper, we present two versions
of the search algorithm -- (a) an initial version of the best first search
algorithm, ASG, which may present one solution more than once while generating
the ordered solutions, and (b) another version, LASG, which avoids the
construction of the duplicate solutions. The actual solutions can be
reconstructed quickly from the implicit compact representation used. We have
applied the methods on a few test domains, some of them are synthetic while the
others are based on well known problems including the search space of the 5-peg
Tower of Hanoi problem, the matrix-chain multiplication problem and the problem
of finding secondary structure of RNA. Experimental results show the efficacy
of the proposed algorithms over the existing approach. Our proposed algorithms
have potential use in various domains ranging from knowledge based frameworks
to service composition, where the AND/OR structure is widely used for
representing problems.
