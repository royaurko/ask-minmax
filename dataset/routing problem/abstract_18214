This article is devoted to computing the eigenvalue of the Laplace eigenvalue
problem by the weak Galerkin (WG) finite element method with emphasis on
obtaining lower bounds. The WG method is on the use of weak functions and their
weak derivatives defined as distributions. Weak functions and weak derivatives
can be approximated by polynomials with various degrees. Different combination
of polynomial spaces leads to different WG finite element methods, which makes
WG methods highly flexible and efficient in practical computation. We establish
the optimal-order error estimates for the WG finite element approximation for
the eigenvalue problem. Comparing with the classical nonconforming finite
element method which can just provide lower bound approximation by linear
elements with only the second order convergence, the WG methods can naturally
provide lower bound approximation with a high order convergence (larger than
$2$). Some numerical results are also presented to demonstrate the efficiency
of our theoretical results.
