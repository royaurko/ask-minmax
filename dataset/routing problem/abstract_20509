Given a constant of motion for the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator with
linear dissipation in the velocity, the problem to get the Hamiltonian for this
system is pointed out, and the quantization up to second order in the
perturbation approach is used to determine the modification on the eigenvalues
when dissipation is taken into consideration. This quantization is realized
using the constant of motion instead of the Hamiltonian.
