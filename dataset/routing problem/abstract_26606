For many systems of differential equations modeling problems in science and
engineering, there are natural splittings of the right hand side into two
parts, one non-stiff or mildly stiff, and the other one stiff. For such systems
implicit-explicit (IMEX) integration combines an explicit scheme for the
non-stiff part with an implicit scheme for the stiff part.
  In a recent series of papers two of the contributors (Sandu and Zhang) have
developed IMEX GLMs, a family of implicit-explicit schemes based on general
linear methods. It has been shown that, due to their high stage order, IMEX
GLMs require no additional coupling order conditions, and are not marred by
order reduction.
  This work develops a new extrapolation-based approach to construct practical
IMEX GLM pairs of high order. We look for methods with large absolute stability
region, assuming that the implicit part of the method is A- or L-stable. We
provide examples of IMEX GLMs with optimal stability properties. Their
application to a two dimensional test problem confirms the theoretical
findings.
