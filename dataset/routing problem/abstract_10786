This article is a continuation of our discussion of the variable coefficient
thin obstacle problem which was started in \cite{KRS14}. We first prove the
$C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity of the regular free boundary for some $\alpha \in
(0,1]$. In order to obtain this in a framework which is strong enough to deal
with rough non-flat obstacles, we construct a new barrier function which has
the (almost) scaling critical behavior in appropriate cones. Here we rely on
the Reifenberg flatness of the regular free boundary. The H\"older regularity
of the regular free boundary then allows us to obtain the leading asymptotic
expansion with error estimate in cones and the optimal $C^{1,1/2}$ regularity
of solutions to the variable coefficient thin obstacle problem. Using
variations of the arguments in \cite{KRS14} and the present article, we finally
also deal with the (variable coefficient) thin obstacle problem in the presence
of inhomogeneities and non-flat obstacles. Furthermore, it is possible to treat
non-flat boundaries and interior thin obstacles. Working in the setting of
$(n+1)$ space dimensions with $n\geq 1$, we consider $W^{1,p}$ metrics and
$W^{2,p}$ obstacles with $p\in(2(n+1),\infty]$.
