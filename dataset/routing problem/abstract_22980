The pre-coloring extension problem consists, given a graph $G$ and a subset
of nodes to which some colors are already assigned, in finding a coloring of
$G$ with the minimum number of colors which respects the pre-coloring
assignment. This can be reduced to the usual coloring problem on a certain
contracted graph. We prove that pre-coloring extension is polynomial for
complements of Meyniel graphs. We answer a question of Hujter and Tuza by
showing that ``PrExt perfect'' graphs are exactly the co-Meyniel graphs, which
also generalizes results of Hujter and Tuza and of Hertz. Moreover we show
that, given a co-Meyniel graph, the corresponding contracted graph belongs to a
restricted class of perfect graphs (``co-Artemis'' graphs, which are
``co-perfectly contractile'' graphs), whose perfectness is easier to establish
than the strong perfect graph theorem. However, the polynomiality of our
algorithm still depends on the ellipsoid method for coloring perfect graphs.
