The evolution of magnetic domain structure in epitaxial
La$_{0.625}$Ca$_{0.375}$MnO$_3$ films on (001) NdGaO$_3$ is monitored as a
function of temperature and magnetic field using Magnetic Force Microscopy. We
see two distinct regions of magnetic orientational order; one in-plane
displaying contrast-less image and the other tilted away from the film plane
forming a distinct stripe pattern. A strong domain splitting is observed at the
boundary of two regions, which is resilient to reorientation with temperature
and magnetic field. We propose a model magnetic free energy functional to
explain the mechanism of domain splitting seen in manganite films.
