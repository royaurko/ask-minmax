Given $U$ an $n\times m$ matrix of rank $n$ and $V$ block of columns inside
$U$, we consider the problem of extracting a block of columns of rank $n$ which
minimize the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the inverse while preserving the block
$V$. This generalizes a previous result of Gluskin-Olevskii, and improves the
estimates when given a "good" block $V$.
