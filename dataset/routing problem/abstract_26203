We propose a new class of models with gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking,
the cascade supersymmetry breaking. This class of models is consistent with the
gravitino mass as low as O(1)eV without having suppressed gaugino masses, nor
the Landau pole problems of the gauge coupling constants of the Standard Model
below the scale of the grand unification. In particular, there is no
supersymmetric vacuum in the vicinity of the supersymmetry breaking vacuum even
for such a low gravitino mass. Thus, the model does not have a vacuum stability
problem decaying into supersymmetric vacua.
