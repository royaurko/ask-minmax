The predominant knowledge-based approach to automated model construction,
compositional modelling, employs a set of models of particular functional
components. Its inference mechanism takes a scenario describing the constituent
interacting components of a system and translates it into a useful mathematical
model. This paper presents a novel compositional modelling approach aimed at
building model repositories. It furthers the field in two respects. Firstly, it
expands the application domain of compositional modelling to systems that can
not be easily described in terms of interacting functional components, such as
ecological systems. Secondly, it enables the incorporation of user preferences
into the model selection process. These features are achieved by casting the
compositional modelling problem as an activity-based dynamic preference
constraint satisfaction problem, where the dynamic constraints describe the
restrictions imposed over the composition of partial models and the preferences
correspond to those of the user of the automated modeller. In addition, the
preference levels are represented through the use of symbolic values that
differ in orders of magnitude.
