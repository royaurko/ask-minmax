We argue, using a phenomenological holographic approach, that walking,
strongly coupled gauge theories generate a suitable potential for a small field
inflation model. We show that the effective description is a model of a single
inflaton. We determine the tunings necessary in the gauge sector to generate
inflation and overcome the \eta problem.
