We explore the application of Monte Carlo transport methods to solving
coupled radiation-hydrodynamics problems. We use a time-dependent,
frequency-dependent, 3-dimensional radiation transport code, that is special
relativistic and includes some detailed microphysical interactions such as
resonant line scattering. We couple the transport code to two different
1-dimensional (non-relativistic) hydrodynamics solvers: a spherical Lagrangian
scheme and a Eulerian Godunov solver. The gas-radiation energy coupling is
treated implicitly, allowing us to take hydrodyanimcal time-steps that are much
longer than the radiative cooling time. We validate the code and assess its
performance using a suite of radiation hydrodynamical test problems, including
ones in the radiation energy dominated regime. We also develop techniques that
reduce the noise of the Monte Carlo estimated radiation force by using the
spatial divergence of the radiation pressure tensor. The results suggest that
Monte Carlo techniques hold promise for simulating the multi-dimensional
radiation hydrodynamics of astrophysical systems.
