An edge weighting problem of a graph G is an assignment of an integer weight
to each edge e. Based on edge weighting problem, several types of
vertex-coloring problems are put forward. A simple observation illuminates that
edge weighting problem has a close relationship with special factors of graphs.
In this paper, we obtain several results on the existence of factors with the
pre-specified degrees, which generalizes earlier results in [2, 3]. Using these
results, we investigate edge-weighting problem. In particular, we prove that
every 4-colorable graph admits a vertex-coloring 4-edge-weighting.
