We propose a distributed algorithm for controlling traffic signals. Our
algorithm is adapted from backpressure routing, which has been mainly applied
to communication and power networks. We formally prove that our algorithm
ensures global optimality as it leads to maximum network throughput even though
the controller is constructed and implemented in a completely distributed
manner. Simulation results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms
SCATS, an adaptive traffic signal control system that is being used in many
cities.
