An introduction to moduli spaces of representations of quivers is given, and
results on their global geometric properties are surveyed. In particular, the
geometric approach to the problem of classification of quiver representations
is motivated, and the construction of moduli spaces is reviewed. Topological,
arithmetic and algebraic methods for the study of moduli spaces are discussed.
