We study decidability of verification problems for timed automata extended
with unbounded discrete data structures. More detailed, we extend timed
automata with a pushdown stack. In this way, we obtain a strong model that may
for instance be used to model real-time programs with procedure calls. It is
long known that the reachability problem for this model is decidable. The goal
of this paper is to identify subclasses of timed pushdown automata for which
the language inclusion problem and related problems are decidable.
