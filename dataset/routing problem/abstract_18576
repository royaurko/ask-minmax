We consider the general problem of finding the minimum weight $\bm$-matching
on arbitrary graphs. We prove that, whenever the linear programming (LP)
relaxation of the problem has no fractional solutions, then the belief
propagation (BP) algorithm converges to the correct solution. We also show that
when the LP relaxation has a fractional solution then the BP algorithm can be
used to solve the LP relaxation. Our proof is based on the notion of graph
covers and extends the analysis of (Bayati-Shah-Sharma 2005 and Huang-Jebara
2007}.
  These results are notable in the following regards: (1) It is one of a very
small number of proofs showing correctness of BP without any constraint on the
graph structure. (2) Variants of the proof work for both synchronous and
asynchronous BP; it is the first proof of convergence and correctness of an
asynchronous BP algorithm for a combinatorial optimization problem.
