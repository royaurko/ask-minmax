Integrability and chaos are two of the main concepts associated with
nonlinear physical systems which have revolutionized our understanding of them.
Highly stable exponentially localized solitons are often associated with many
of the important integrable nonlinear systems while motions which are
sensitively dependent on initial conditions are associated with chaotic
systems. Besides dramatically raising our perception of many natural phenomena,
these concepts are opening up new vistas of applications and unfolding
technologies: Optical soliton based information technology, magnetoelectronics,
controlling and synchronization of chaos and secure communications, to name a
few. These developments have raised further new interesting questions and
potentialities. We present a particular view of some of the challenging
problems and payoffs ahead in the next few decades by tracing the early
historical events, summarizing the revolutionary era of 1950-70 when many
important new ideas including solitons and chaos were realized and reviewing
the current status. Important open problems both at the basic and applied
levels are discussed.
