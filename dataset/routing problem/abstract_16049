We provide a direct proof of a quadratic estimate that plays a central role
in the determination of domains of square roots of elliptic operators and, as
shown more recently, in some boundary value problems with $L^2$ boundary data.
We develop the application to the Kato conjecture and to a Neumann problem.
This quadratic estimate enjoys some equivalent forms in various settings. This
gives new results in the functional calculus of Dirac type operators on forms.
