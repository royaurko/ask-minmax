We propose a unified approach to addition of resistors and capacitors such
that the formulae are always simply additive. This approach has the advantage
of being consistent with the intuition of the students. To demonstrate our
point of view, we re-work some well-known end-of-the-chapter textbook problems
and propose some additional new problems.
