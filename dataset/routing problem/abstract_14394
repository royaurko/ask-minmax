In this work, we apply a time-space adaptive discontinuous Galerkin method
using the elliptic reconstruction technique with a robust (in P\'eclet number)
elliptic error estimator in space, for the convection dominated parabolic
problems with non-linear reaction mechanisms. We derive a posteriori error
estimators in the $L^{\infty}(L^2)+L^2(H^1)$-type norm using backward Euler in
time and discontinuous Galerkin (symmetric interior penalty Galerkin (SIPG)) in
space. Numerical results for advection dominated reactive transport problems in
homogeneous and heterogeneous media demonstrate the performance of the
time-space adaptive algorithm.
