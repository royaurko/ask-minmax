We study several aspects concerning slice regular functions mapping the
quaternionic open unit ball into itself. We characterize these functions in
terms of their Taylor coefficients at the origin and identify them as
contractive multipliers of the Hardy space. In addition, we formulate and solve
the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation problem in the class of such functions
presenting necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and for the
uniqueness of a solution. Finally, we describe all solutions to the problem in
the indeterminate case.
