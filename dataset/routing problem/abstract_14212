The way in which random permutations have been used in various
permutation-based methods leads to anti-conservativeness, especially in
multiple testing contexts. Problems arise in particular for Westfall and
Young's maxT method, a more recent method by Meinshausen and a global test that
we introduce. We illustrate this using simulations. We solve the problem of
anti-conservativeness by proving that an exact test is obtained, if the
identity map is added to the randomly drawn permutations.
