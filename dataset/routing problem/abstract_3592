This paper shows that the OSGA algorithm -- which uses first-order
information to solve convex optimization problems with optimal complexity --
can be used to efficiently solve arbitrary bound-constrained convex
optimization problems. This is done by constructing an explicit method as well
as an inexact scheme for solving the bound-constrained rational subproblem
required by OSGA. This leads to an efficient implementation of OSGA on
large-scale problems in applications arising signal and image processing,
machine learning and statistics. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
promising performance of OSGA on such problems. ions to show the efficiency of
the proposed scheme. A software package implementing OSGA for bound-constrained
convex problems is available.
