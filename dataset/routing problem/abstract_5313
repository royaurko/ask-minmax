We call a matrix completely mixable if the entries in its columns can be
permuted so that all row sums are equal. If it is not completely mixable, we
want to determine the smallest maximal and largest minimal row sum attainable.
These values provide a discrete approximation of of minimum variance problems
for discrete distributions, a problem motivated by the question how to estimate
the $\alpha$-quantile of an aggregate random variable with unknown dependence
structure given the marginals of the constituent random variables. We relate
this problem to the multidimensional bottleneck assignment problem and show
that there exists a polynomial $2$-approximation algorithm if the matrix has
only $3$ columns. In general, deciding complete mixability is
$\mathcal{NP}$-complete. In particular the swapping algorithm of Puccetti et
al. is not an exact method unless $\mathcal{NP}\subseteq\mathcal{ZPP}$. For a
fixed number of columns it remains $\mathcal{NP}$-complete, but there exists a
PTAS. The problem can be solved in pseudopolynomial time for a fixed number of
rows, and even in polynomial time if all columns furthermore contain entries
from the same multiset.
