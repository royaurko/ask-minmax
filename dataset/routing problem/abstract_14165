We provide an overview of CPF, the certification problem format, and explain
some design decisions. Whereas CPF was originally invented to combine three
different formats for termination proofs into a single one, in the meanwhile
proofs for several other properties of term rewrite systems are also
expressible: like confluence, complexity, and completion. As a consequence, the
format is already supported by several tools and certifiers. Its acceptance is
also demonstrated in international competitions: the certified tracks of both
the termination and the confluence competition utilized CPF as exchange format
between automated tools and trusted certifiers.
