In railway operations, a timetable is established to determine the departure
and arrival times for the trains or other rolling stock at the different
stations or relevant points inside the rail network or a subset of this
network. The elaboration of this timetable is done to respond to the commercial
requirements for both passenger and freight traffic, but also it must respect a
set of security and capacity constraints associated with the railway network,
rolling stock and legislation. Combining these requirements and constraints, as
well as the important number of trains and schedules to plan, makes the
preparation of a feasible timetable a complex and time-consuming process, that
normally takes several months to be completed. This article addresses the
problem of generating periodic timetables, which means that the involved trains
operate in a recurrent pattern. For instance, the trains belonging to the same
train line, depart from some station every 15 minutes or one hour. To tackle
the problem, we present a constraint-based model suitable for this kind of
problem. Then, we propose a genetic algorithm, allowing a rapid generation of
feasible periodic timetables. Finally, two case studies are presented, the
first, describing a sub-set of the Netherlands rail network, and the second a
large portion of the Nord-pas-de-Calais regional rail network, both of them are
then solved using our algorithm and the results are presented and discussed.
