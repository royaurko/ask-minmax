We prove the $W^{1,2}_p$-estimate and solvability for the Dirichlet problem
of second-order parabolic equations in simple convex polytopes with time
irregular coefficients, when $p\in (1,2]$. We also consider the corresponding
Neumann problem in a half space when $p\in [2,\infty)$. Similar results are
obtained for equations in a half space with coefficients which are measurable
in a tangential direction and have small mean oscillations in the other
directions.
