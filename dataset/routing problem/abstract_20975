In this paper, the problem of pattern avoidance in generalized non-crossing
trees is studied. The generating functions for generalized non-crossing trees
avoiding patterns of length one and two are obtained. Lagrange inversion
formula is used to obtain the explicit formulas for some special cases.
Bijection is also established between generalized non-crossing trees with
special pattern avoidance and the little Schr\"{o}der paths.
