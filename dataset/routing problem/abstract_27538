This paper addresses the applications of different techniques for solving
container terminals problems. We have built a simulation model that can be used
to analyze the performance of container terminal operations. The proposed
approach is intended to be applied for a real case study in Alexandria
Container Terminal (ACT) at Alexandria port. The implementation of our approach
shows that a proposed model increases the efficiency of Alexandria container
terminal at Alexandria port.
