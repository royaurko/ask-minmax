The problem of angular correlation in the double photoionization (DPI) of
rare gas atoms is considered in some depth. We refer particularly to the
efficiency operator for the detection of an electron by a detector having
cylindrical symmetry. The different factors in the efficiency operator are
discussed in detail keeping in mind the fundamental epistemological question of
the role of the detection process in such experiments.
