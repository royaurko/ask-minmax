A symmetric matrix $C$ is completely positive (CP) if there exists an
entrywise nonnegative matrix $B$ such that $C=BB^T$. The CP-completion problem
is to study whether we can assign values to the missing entries of a partial
matrix (i.e., a matrix having unknown entries) such that the completed matrix
is completely positive. We propose a semidefinite algorithm for solving general
CP-completion problems, and study its properties. When all the diagonal entries
are given, the algorithm can give a certificate if a partial matrix is not
CP-completable, and it almost always gives a CP-completion if it is
CP-completable. When diagonal entries are partially given, similar properties
hold. Computational experiments are also presented to show how CP-completion
problems can be solved.
