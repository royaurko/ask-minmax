A solution for the problem of understanding observed rotation curves in
galaxies without the introduction of dark matter halos is presented. This
solution has been obtained upon considering the distribution of masses in the
expanding universe, then, having a cosmological character. A formal limiting
radius for galaxies depending on cosmological parameters is given. The
empirical conclusions derived from the theory of M. Milgrom and J. Bekenstein
arise as direct consequences of the present approach without any need of
drastically modifying newtonian dynamics.
