The use of web services has dominated software industry. Existing
technologies of web services are extended to give value added customized
services to customers through composition. Automated web service composition is
a very challenging task. This paper proposed the solution of existing problems
and proposed a technique by combination of interface based and functionality
based rules. The proposed framework also solves the issues related to
unavailability of updated information and inaccessibility of web services from
repository/databases due to any fault/failure. It provides updated information
problem by adding aging factor in repository/WSDB (Web Services Database) and
inaccessibility is solved by replication of WSDB. We discussed data
distribution techniques and proposed our framework by using one of these
strategies by considering quality of service issues. Finally, our algorithm
eliminates the dynamic service composition and execution issues, supports web
service composition considering QoS (Quality of Service), efficient data
retrieval and updation, fast service distribution and fault tolerance.
