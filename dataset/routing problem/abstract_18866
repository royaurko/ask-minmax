We consider supervised learning problems within the positive-definite kernel
framework, such as kernel ridge regression, kernel logistic regression or the
support vector machine. With kernels leading to infinite-dimensional feature
spaces, a common practical limiting difficulty is the necessity of computing
the kernel matrix, which most frequently leads to algorithms with running time
at least quadratic in the number of observations n, i.e., O(n^2). Low-rank
approximations of the kernel matrix are often considered as they allow the
reduction of running time complexities to O(p^2 n), where p is the rank of the
approximation. The practicality of such methods thus depends on the required
rank p. In this paper, we show that in the context of kernel ridge regression,
for approximations based on a random subset of columns of the original kernel
matrix, the rank p may be chosen to be linear in the degrees of freedom
associated with the problem, a quantity which is classically used in the
statistical analysis of such methods, and is often seen as the implicit number
of parameters of non-parametric estimators. This result enables simple
algorithms that have sub-quadratic running time complexity, but provably
exhibit the same predictive performance than existing algorithms, for any given
problem instance, and not only for worst-case situations.
