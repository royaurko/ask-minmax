The paper presents bifurcation behavior of a single phase induction motor.
This paper also attempts to discuss the bifurcation behavior of the system
based on the evolution of different state variables. The bifurcation diagrams
drawn looking at different state variables are different in terms of
periodicity and route to chaos. The knowledge of the dynamics of the system
obtained from bifurcation diagrams give useful guidelines to control the
operation of the induction motor depending on the need of an application for
better performance.
