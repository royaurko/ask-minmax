We explore the possibility of applying the framework of frequent pattern
mining to a class of continuous objects appearing in nature, namely knots. We
introduce the frequent knot mining problem and present a solution. The key
observation is that a database consisting of knots can be transformed into a
transactional database. This observation is based on the Prime Decomposition
Theorem of knots.
