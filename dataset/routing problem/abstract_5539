In this paper, a unifying framework for orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) multiuser resource allocation is presented. The isolated
seeming problems of maximizing a weighted sum of rates for a given power budget
$\bar{P}$ and minimizing sum power for given rate requirements
$\mathbf{\bar{R}}$ can be interpreted jointly in this framework. To this end we
embed the problems in a higher dimensional space. Based on these results, we
subsequently consider the combined problem of maximizing a weighted sum of
rates under given rate requirements $\mathbf{\bar{R}}$ and a fixed power budget
$\bar{P}$. This new problem is challenging, since the additional constraints do
not allow to use the hitherto existing approaches. Interestingly, the optimal
decoding orders turn out to be the ordering of the Lagrangian factors in all
problems.
