Say that an edge of a graph G dominates itself and every other edge adjacent
to it. An edge dominating set of a graph G = (V,E) is a subset of edges E' of E
which dominates all edges of G. In particular, if every edge of G is dominated
by exactly one edge of E' then E' is a dominating induced matching. It is known
that not every graph admits a dominating induced matching, while the problem to
decide if it does admit is NP-complete. In this paper we consider the problem
of finding a minimum weighted dominating induced matching, if any, of a graph
with weighted edges. We describe two exact algorithms for general graphs. The
algorithms are efficient in the cases where G admits a known vertex dominating
set of small size, or when G contains a polynomial number of maximal
independent sets.
