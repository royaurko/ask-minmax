In contrast to the broad stream of sustainable developments on fusion energy,
new aspects are developed now by applying ultra-short, ultra-powerful laser
pulses in a plasma-block ignition scheme by avoiding the well known
difficulties of thermal-pressure instabilities and losses through using
electro-dynamic non-thermal energy conversion. A further advantage is given by
the new 10 kilo-Tesla magnetic fields for fusion of uncompressed proton-boron
fuel which avoids problems of dangerous nuclear radiation.
