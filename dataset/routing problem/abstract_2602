We explore a generic mechanism whereby a droplet of active matter acquires
motility by the spontaneous breakdown of a discrete symmetry. The model we
study offers a simple representation of a "cell extract" comprising, e.g., a
droplet of actomyosin solution. (Such extracts are used experimentally to model
the cytoskeleton.) Actomyosin is an active gel whose polarity describes the
mean sense of alignment of actin fibres. In the absence of polymerization and
depolymerization processes ('treadmilling'), the gel's dynamics arises solely
from the contractile motion of myosin motors; this should be unchanged when
polarity is inverted. Our results suggest that motility can arise in the
absence of treadmilling, by spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of polarity
inversion symmetry. Adapting our model to wall-bound cells in two dimensions,
we find that as wall friction is reduced, treadmilling-induced motility falls
but SSB-mediated motility rises. The latter might therefore be crucial in three
dimensions where frictional forces are likely to be modest. At a supra-cellular
level, the same generic mechanism can impart motility to aggregates of
non-motile but active bacteria; we show that SSB in this (extensile) case leads
generically to rotational as well as translational motion.
