The solar core, because of its density and temperature, is not a
weakly-interacting or a high-temperature plasma. Collective effects have time
scales comparable to the average time between collisions, and the microfield
distribution influences the particle dynamics. In this conditions ion and
electron diffusion is a non-Markovian process, memory effects are present and
the equilibrium statistical distribution function differs from the Maxwellian
one. We show that, even if the deviations from the standard velocity
distribution that are compatible with our present knowledge of the solar
interior are small, they are sufficient to sensibly modify the sub-barrier
nuclear reaction rates. The consequent changes of the neutrino fluxes are
comparable to the flux deficits that constitute the solar neutrino problem.
