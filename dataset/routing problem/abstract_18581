The field theory of nonrelativistic fermions interacting via contact
interactions can be used to calculate the properties of few-body systems of
cold atoms confined in harmonic traps. The state-operator correspondence of
Non-Relativistic Conformal Field Theory (NRCFT) shows that the energy
eigenvalues (in oscillator units) of N harmonically trapped fermions can be
calculated from the scaling dimensions of N-fermion operators in the NRCFT.
They are also in one-to-one correspondence with zero-energy, scale-invariant
solutions to the N-body problem in free space. We show that these two mappings
of the trapped fermion problem to free space problems are related by an
automorphism of the SL(2,R) algebra of the conformal symmetry of fermions at
the unitary limit. This automorphism exchanges the internal Hamiltonian of the
gas with the trapping potential and hence provides a novel method for deriving
virial theorems for trapped Fermi gases at the unitary limit. We also show that
the state-operator correspondence can be applied directly in three spatial
dimensions by calculating the scaling dimensions of two- and three-fermion
operators and finding agreement with known exact results for energy levels of
two and three trapped fermions at the unitary limit.
