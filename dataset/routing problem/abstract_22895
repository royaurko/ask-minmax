"Grid" computing has emerged as an important new field, distinguished from
conventional distributed computing by its focus on large-scale resource
sharing, innovative applications, and, in some cases, high-performance
orientation. In this article, we define this new field. First, we review the
"Grid problem," which we define as flexible, secure, coordinated resource
sharing among dynamic collections of individuals, institutions, and
resources-what we refer to as virtual organizations. In such settings, we
encounter unique authentication, contributorization, resource access, resource
discovery, and other challenges. It is this class of problem that is addressed
by Grid technologies. Next, we present an extensible and open Grid
architecture, in which protocols, services, application programming interfaces,
and software development kits are categorized according to their roles in
enabling resource sharing. We describe requirements that we believe any such
mechanisms must satisfy, and we discuss the central role played by the
intergrid protocols that enable interoperability among different Grid systems.
Finally, we discuss how Grid technologies relate to other contemporary
technologies, including enterprise integration, application service provider,
storage service provider, and peer-to-peer computing. We maintain that Grid
concepts and technologies complement and have much to contribute to these other
approaches.
