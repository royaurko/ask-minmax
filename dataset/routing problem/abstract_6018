The main problems of school course timetabling are time, curriculum, and
classrooms. In addition there are other problems that vary from one institution
to another. This paper is intended to solve the problem of satisfying the
teachers preferred schedule in a way that regards the importance of the teacher
to the supervising institute, i.e. his score according to some criteria.
Genetic algorithm (GA) has been presented as an elegant method in solving
timetable problem (TTP) in order to produce solutions with no conflict. In this
paper, we consider the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to efficiently obtain a
score for each teacher, and consequently produce a GA-based TTP solution that
satisfies most of the teachers preferences.
