Micrometeorology, city comfort, land use management and air quality
monitoring increasingly become important environmental issues. To serve the
needs, meteorology needs to achieve a serious advance in representation and
forecast on micro-scales (meters to 100 km) called meteorological terra
incognita. There is a suitable numerical tool, namely, the large-eddy
simulation modelling (LES) to support the development. However, at present, the
LES is of limited utility for applications. The study addresses two problems.
First, the data assimilation problem on micro-scales is investigated as a
possibility to recover the turbulent fields consistent with the mean
meteorological profiles. Second, the methods to incorporate of the unresolved
surface structures are investigated in a priopi numerical experiments. The
numerical experiments demonstrated that the simplest nudging or Newtonian
relaxation technique for the data assimilation is applicable on the turbulence
scales. It is also shown that the filtering property of the three layers
artificial neural network (ANN) can be used for formulation of the surface
stress from the unresolved surface features.
