In this paper we prove that the focusing, $d$-dimensional mass critical
nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger initial value problem is globally well-posed and
scattering for $u_{0} \in L^{2}(\mathbf{R}^{d})$, $\| u_{0}
\|_{L^{2}(\mathbf{R}^{d})} < \| Q \|_{L^{2}(\mathbf{R}^{d})}$, where $Q$ is the
ground state, and $d \geq 1$. We first establish an interaction Morawetz
estimate that is positive definite when $\| u_{0} \|_{L^{2}(\mathbf{R}^{d})} <
\| Q \|_{L^{2}(\mathbf{R}^{d})}$, and has the appropriate scaling. Next, we
will prove a frequency localized interaction Morawetz estimate similar to the
estimates made in \cite{D2}, \cite{D3}, \cite{D4}. See also \cite{CKSTT4} for
the energy critical case. Since we are considering an $L^{2}$ - critical
initial value problem we will localize to low frequencies.
