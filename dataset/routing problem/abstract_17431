There are numerous advantages of using Electric Vehicles (EVs) as an
alternative method of transportation. However, an increase in EV usage in the
existing residential distribution grid poses problems such as overloading the
existing infrastructure. In this paper, we have modeled and simulated a
residential distribution grid in GridLAB-D (an open-source software tool used
to model, simulate, and analyze power distribution systems) to illustrate the
problems associated with a higher EV market penetration rates in the
residential domain. Power grid upgrades or control algorithms at the
transformer level are required to overcome issues such as transformer
overloading. We demonstrate the method of coordinating EV charging in a
residential distribution grid so as to overcome the overloading problem without
any upgrades in the distribution grid.
