The following problem was proposed in 2010 by S. Lando.
  Let $M$ and $N$ be two unions of the same number of disjoint circles in a
sphere. Do there always exist two spheres in 3-space such that their
intersection is transversal and is a union of disjoint circles that is situated
as $M$ in one sphere and as $N$ in the other? Union $M'$ of disjoint circles is
{\it situated} in one sphere as union $M$ of disjoint circles in the other
sphere if there is a homeomorphism between these two spheres which maps $M'$ to
$M$.
  We prove (by giving an explicit example) that the answer to this problem is
"no". We also prove a necessary and sufficient condition on $M$ and $N$ for
existing of such intersecting spheres. This result can be restated in terms of
graphs. Such restatement allows for a trivial brute-force algorithm checking
the condition for any given $M$ and $N$. It is an open question if a faster
algorithm exist.
