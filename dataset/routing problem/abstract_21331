In this book the contributors introduce the notion of DSm vector spaces of refined
labels. They also realize the refined labels as a plane and a n-dimensional
space. Further, using these refined labels, several algebraic structures are
defined. Finally DSm semivector space or refined labels is described. Authors
also propose some research problems.
