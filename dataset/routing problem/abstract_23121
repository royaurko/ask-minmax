Treating the Teukolsky perturbation equation numerically as a 2+1 PDE and
smearing the singularities in the particle source term by the use of narrow
Gaussian distributions, we have been able to reproduce earlier results for
equatorial circular orbits that were computed using the frequency domain
formalism. A time domain prescription for a more general evolution of nearly
geodesic orbits under the effects of radiation reaction is presented. This
approach can be useful when tackling the more realistic problem of a
stellar-mass black hole moving on a generic orbit around a supermassive black
hole under the influence of radiation reaction forces.
