A feedback neural approach to static communication routing in asymmetric
networks is presented, where a mean field formulation of the Bellman-Ford
method for the single unicast problem is used as a common platform for
developing algorithms for multiple unicast, multicast and multiple multicast
problems. The appealing locality and update philosophy of the Bellman-Ford
algorithm is inherited. For all problem types the objective is to minimize a
total connection cost, defined as the sum of the individual costs of the
involved arcs, subject to capacity constraints. The methods are evaluated for
synthetic problem instances by comparing to exact solutions for cases where
these are accessible, and else with approximate results from simple heuristics.
The computational demand is modest.
