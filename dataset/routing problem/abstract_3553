The Traveling Tournament Problem (TTP) is a benchmark problem in sports
scheduling and has been extensively studied in recent years. The Mirrored
Traveling Tournament Problem (mTTP) is variation of the TTP that represents
certain types of sports scheduling problems where the main objective is to
minimize the total distance traveled by all the participating teams. In this
paper we test a parallel simulated annealing approach for solving the mTTP
using OpenMP on shared memory systems and we found that this approach is
superior especially with respect to the number of solution instances that are
probed per second. We also see that there is significant speed up of 1.5x -
2.2x in terms of number of solutions explored per unit time.
