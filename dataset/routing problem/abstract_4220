In this paper we completely characterize those weighted Hardy spaces that are
Poletsky--Stessin Hardy spaces $H^p_u$. We also provide a reduction of
$H^\infty$ problems to $H^p_u$ problems and demonstrate how such a reduction
can be used to make shortcuts in the proofs of the interpolation theorem and
corona problem.
