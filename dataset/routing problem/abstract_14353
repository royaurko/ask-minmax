In the present paper we study a singular perturbation problem for a
Navier-Stokes-Korteweg model with Coriolis force. Namely, we perform the
incompressible and fast rotation asymptotics simultaneously, while we keep the
capillarity coefficient constant in order to capture surface tension effects in
the limit. We consider here the case of variable rotation axis: we prove the
convergence to a linear parabolic-type equation with variable coefficients. The
proof of the result relies on compensated compactness arguments. Besides, we
look for minimal regularity assumptions on the variations of the axis.
