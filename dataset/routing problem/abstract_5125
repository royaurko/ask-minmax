We consider the hybrid problem of reconstructing the isotropic electric
conductivity of a body $\Omega$ from interior Current Density Imaging data
obtainable using MRI measurements. We only require knowledge of the magnitude
$|J|$ of one current generated by a given voltage $f$ on the boundary
$\partial\Omega$. As previously shown, the corresponding voltage potential u in
$\Omega$ is a minimizer of the weighted least gradient problem
  \[u=\hbox{argmin} \{\int_{\Omega}a(x)|\nabla u|: u \in H^{1}(\Omega), \ \
u|_{\partial \Omega}=f\},\] with $a(x)= |J(x)|$. In this paper we present an
alternating split Bregman algorithm for treating such least gradient problems,
for $a\in L^2(\Omega)$ non-negative and $f\in H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$. We
give a detailed convergence proof by focusing to a large extent on the dual
problem. This leads naturally to the alternating split Bregman algorithm. The
dual problem also turns out to yield a novel method to recover the full vector
field $J$ from knowledge of its magnitude, and of the voltage $f$ on the
boundary. We then present several numerical experiments that illustrate the
convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm.
