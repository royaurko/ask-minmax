For the List Accessing Problem, Move-To-Front(MTF) algorithm has been proved
to be the best performing online list accessing algorithm till date in the
literature[10]. In this paper, we have made a comprehensive analysis of MTF
algorithm and developed an Improved-MTF (IMTF) offline algorithm. We have
generated two new types of data set and devise a new method of experimental
analysis for our proposed algorithm. Our experimental analysis shows that IMTF
is performing better than MTF algorithm.
