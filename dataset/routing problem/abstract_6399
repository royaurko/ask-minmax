Gravitation has posed a puzzle and a problem for many decades. Attempts to
unify it with other fundamental interactions have failed. These problems and
puzzles have been underscored by the likes of Witten and Weinberg. We survey
this and argue that gravitation has a different character compared to other
fundamental interactions - it is an energy distributed over all the elementary
particles in the universe. The above puzzle and problem is resolved
satisfactorily. These considerations lead to a varying $G$ cosmology consistent
with observation. It is argued that apart from the usual tests, the above
explains in addition the anomalous accelerations of the Pioneer spacecrafts.
Further tests are also proposed.
