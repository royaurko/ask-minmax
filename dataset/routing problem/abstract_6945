For an indecomposable $3\times 3$ stochastic matrix (i.e., 1-step transition
probability matrix) with coinciding negative eigenvalues, a new necessary and
sufficient condition of the imbedding problem for time homogeneous Markov
chains is shown by means of an alternate parameterization of the transition
rate matrix (i.e., intensity matrix, infinitesimal generator), which avoids
calculating matrix logarithm or matrix square root. In addition, an implicit
description of the imbedding problem for the $3\times 3$ stochastic matrix in
Johansen [J. Lond. Math. Soc., 8, 345-351. (1974)] is pointed out.
