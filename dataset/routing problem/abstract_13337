We investigate dynamics of a jet collimated by magneto-torsional
oscillations. The problem is reduced to an ordinary differential equation
containing a singularity and depending on a parameter. We find a parameter
range for which this system has stable periodic solutions and study
bifurcations of these solutions. We use Poincar\'e sections to demonstrate
existence of domains of regular and chaotic motions. We investigate transition
from periodic to chaotic solutions through a sequence of period doublings.
