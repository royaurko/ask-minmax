A critical look is taken at the calculation of the Casimir effect. The
boundary conditions play an important role and should be imposed in a physical
way. An acceptable result for the vacuum energy is only obtained when different
regularization schemes yield the same result. Radiative corrections to the
Casimir force between two parallel plates due to electromagnetic vacuum
fluctuations have been obtained both in full QED and in a low-energy, effective
field theory with conflicting results. Including surface terms in the effective
Lagrangian, the QED result can be understood. Finally, a problem with the
electromagnetic vacuum energy on $S^3$ is pointed out and a solution suggested.
The structure of higher order corrections to this result is discussed.
