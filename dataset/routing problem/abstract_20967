Motivated by B. Tsirelson's construction of $E_0$-semigroups of type III, we
investigate a $C_0$-semigroup acting on the space of square integrable
functions of the half line whose difference from the shift semigroup is a
Hilbert-Schmidt operator. We give a description of such semigroups in terms of
analytic functions on the right-half plane and construct several examples.
