The seesaw mechanism that explains the small neutrino masses comes naturally
with supersymmetric (SUSY) grand unification and leptogenesis. However, the
framework suffers from the SUSY flavor and CP problems, and has a severe
cosmological gravitino problem. We propose anomaly mediation as a simple
solution to all these problems, which is viable once supplemented by the
D-terms for U(1)_Y and U(1)_{B-L}. Even though the right-handed neutrino mass
explicitly breaks U(1)_{B-L} and hence reintroduces the flavor problem, we show
that it lacks the logarithmic enhancement and poses no threat to the framework.
The thermal leptogenesis is then made easily consistent with the gravitino
constraint.
