Exciton optical absorption in self-similar aperiodic one-dimensional systems
is considered, focusing our attention on Thue-Morse and Fibonacci lattices as
canonical examples. The absorption line shape is evaluated by solving the
microscopic equations of motion of the Frenkel-exciton problem on the lattice,
in which on-site energies take on two values, according to the Thue-Morse or
Fibonacci sequences. Results are compared to those obtained in random lattices
with the same stechiometry and size. We find that aperiodic order causes the
occurrence of well-defined characteristic features in the absorption spectra
which clearly differ from the case of random systems, indicating a most
peculiar exciton dynamics. We successfully explain the obtained spectra in
terms of the two-center problem. This allows us to establish the origin of all
the absorption lines by considering the self-similar aperiodic lattices as
composed of two-center blocks, within the same spirit of the renormalization
group ideas.
