In this paper the contributor presents a kind of Soft Computing Technique, mainly
an application of fuzzy set theory of Prof. Zadeh [16], on a problem of Medical
Experts Systems. The choosen problem is on design of a physician's decision
model which can take crisp as well as fuzzy data as input, unlike the
traditional models. The contributor presents a mathematical model based on fuzzy set
theory for physician aided evaluation of a complete representation of
information emanating from the initial interview including patient past
history, present symptoms, and signs observed upon physical examination and
results of clinical and diagnostic tests.
