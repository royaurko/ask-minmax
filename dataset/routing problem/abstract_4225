The one-dimensional impact problem in the case of Fung's quasi-linear
viscoelastic model is studied for the relaxation function of the standard solid
model (or Zener model). At that, quasi-linear viscoelastic Maxwell and
Kelvin-Voigt models are recovered as limit cases. The results of numerical
simulations for some illustrative values of the dimensionless problem
parameters are presented.
