The study of the possibility of existence of the non-propagating, trapped
continental shelf waves (CSWs)along curved coasts reduces mathematically to a
spectral problem for a self-adjoint operator pencil in a curved strip. Using
the methods developed in the setting of the waveguide trapped mode problem, we
show that such CSWs exist for a wide class of coast curvature and depth
profiles.
