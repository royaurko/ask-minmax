We reconsider the Mott transition problem in the presence of long range
Coulomb interactions. Using an extended DMFT, that sums an important class of
diagrams absent in ordinary DMFT, we show that in the presence of Coulomb the
Mott transition in two and three dimensions is discontinuous as envisioned by
Mott.
