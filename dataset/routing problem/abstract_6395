A longstanding question that has puzzled Physicists is the so called gauge
hierarchy problem, that is why is there such a wide gap between the mass of a
Planck particle, $10^{-5}gms$ and the mass of a typical elementary particle
$\sim 10^{-25}gms$. We show that the answer to this problem lies in a
particular characterization of gravitation. This moreover also provides a
picture of a Planck scale underpinning for the entire universe itself.
