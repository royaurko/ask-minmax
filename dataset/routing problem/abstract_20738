Due to a lack of coherent analysis, many common practices of humankind
preserve low-efficient procedures. Balancing tubes during centrifugation
exemplifies such a problem in laboratory practice. Using combination of
symmetry group theory and genetic algorithm methodology we demonstrate that
there is an array of surprisingly non-trivial algorithms for going about this
procedure.
