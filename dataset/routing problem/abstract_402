Statistically distinguishing between phase-coherent and noncoherent chaotic
dynamics from time series is a contemporary problem in nonlinear sciences. In
this work, we propose different measures based on recurrence properties of
recorded trajectories, which characterize the underlying systems from both
geometric and dynamic viewpoints. The potentials of the individual measures for
discriminating phase-coherent and noncoherent chaotic oscillations are
discussed. A detailed numerical analysis is performed for the chaotic R\"ossler
system, which displays both types of chaos as one control parameter is varied,
and the Mackey-Glass system as an example of a time-delay system with
noncoherent chaos. Our results demonstrate that especially geometric measures
from recurrence network analysis are well suited for tracing transitions
between spiral- and screw-type chaos, a common route from phase-coherent to
noncoherent chaos also found in other nonlinear oscillators. A detailed
explanation of the observed behavior in terms of attractor geometry is given.
