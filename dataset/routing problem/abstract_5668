We investigate a computational device that harnesses the effects of
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) to accelerate the speed of finding the
solution of a given optimization problem. Many computationally difficult
problems, including NP-complete problems, can be formulated as a ground state
search problem. In a BEC, below the critical temperature, bosonic particles
have a natural tendency to accumulate in the ground state. Furthermore, the
speed of attaining this configuration is enhanced as a result of final state
stimulation. We propose a physical device that incorporates these basic
properties of bosons into the optimization problem, such that an optimized
solution is found by a simple cooling of the physical temperature of the
device. We find that the speed of convergence to the ground state can be sped
up by a factor of $ N$ at a given error, where N is the boson number per site.
