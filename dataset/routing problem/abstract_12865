In this work we study the polytope associated with a 0,1-integer programming
formulation for the Equitable Coloring Problem. We find several families of
valid inequalities and derive sufficient conditions in order to be
facet-defining inequalities. We also present computational evidence that shows
the efficacy of these inequalities used in a cutting-plane algorithm.
