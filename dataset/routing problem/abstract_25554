In this paper, the inverse problem of reconstructing reflectivity function of
a medium is examined within a blind deconvolution framework. The ultrasound
pulse is estimated using higher-order statistics, and Wiener filter is used to
obtain the ultrasonic reflectivity function through wavelet-based models. A new
approach to the parameter estimation of the inverse filtering step is proposed
in the nondestructive evaluation field, which is based on the theory of
Fourier-Wavelet regularized deconvolution (ForWaRD). This new approach can be
viewed as a solution to the open problem of adaptation of the ForWaRD framework
to perform the convolution kernel estimation and deconvolution
interdependently. The results indicate stable solutions of the estimated pulse
and an improvement in the radio-frequency (RF) signal taking into account its
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and axial resolution. Simulations and experiments
showed that the proposed approach can provide robust and optimal estimates of
the reflectivity function.
