The double slit experiment (DSE) is known as an important cornerstone in the
foundations of physical theories such as Quantum Mechanics and Special
Relativity. A large number of different variants of it were designed and
performed over the years. We perform and discuss here a new verion with the
somewhat unexpected results of obtaining interference pattern from single-slit
screen. This outcome, which shows that the routes of the photons through the
array were changed, leads one to discuss it, using the equivalence principle,
in terms of geodesics mechanics. We show using either the Brill's version of
the canonical formulation of general relativity or the linearized version of it
that one may find corresponding and analogous situations in the framework of
general relativity.
