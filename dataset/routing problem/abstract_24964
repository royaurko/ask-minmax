The complete cancellation of Gribov copies and the Neuberger 0/0 problem of
lattice BRST can be avoided in modified lattice Landau gauge. In compact U(1),
where the problem is a lattice artifact, there remain to be Gribov copies but
their number is exponentially reduced. Moreover, there is no cancellation of
copies there as the sign of the Faddeev-Popov determinant is positive. Applied
to the maximal Abelian subgroup this avoids the perfect cancellation amongst
the remaining Gribov copies for SU(N) also. In addition, based on a definition
of gauge fields on the lattice as stereographically-projected link variables,
it provides a framework for gauge fixed Monte-Carlo simulations. This will
include all Gribov copies in the spirit of BRST. Their average is not zero, as
demonstrated explicitly in simple models. This might resolve present
discrepancies between gauge-fixed lattice and continuum studies of QCD Green's
functions.
