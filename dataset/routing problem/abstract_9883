In this paper we introduce and study the strip planarity testing problem,
which takes as an input a planar graph $G(V,E)$ and a function $\gamma:V
\rightarrow \{1,2,\dots,k\}$ and asks whether a planar drawing of $G$ exists
such that each edge is monotone in the $y$-direction and, for any $u,v\in V$
with $\gamma(u)<\gamma(v)$, it holds $y(u)<y(v)$. The problem has strong
relationships with some of the most deeply studied variants of the planarity
testing problem, such as clustered planarity, upward planarity, and level
planarity. We show that the problem is polynomial-time solvable if $G$ has a
fixed planar embedding.
