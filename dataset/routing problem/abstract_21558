Classically time is kept fixed for infinitesimal variations in problems in
mechanics. Apparently, there appears to be no mathematical justification in the
literature for this standard procedure. This can be explained canonically by
unveiling the intrinsic mathematical structure of time in Lagrangian mechanics.
Moreover, this structure also offers a general method to deal with inertial
forces.
