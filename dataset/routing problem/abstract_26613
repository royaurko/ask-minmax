We study boundary value problems for the Laplacian on a domain $\Omega$
consisting of the left half of the Sierpinski Gasket ($SG$), whose boundary is
essentially a countable set of points $X$. For harmonic functions we give an
explicit Poisson integral formula to recover the function from its boundary
values, and characterize those that correspond to functions of finite energy.
We give an explicit Dirichlet to Neumann map and show that it is invertible. We
give an explicit description of the Dirichlet to Neumann spectra of the
Laplacian with an exact count of the dimensions of eigenspaces. We compute the
exact trace spaces on $X$ of the $L^2$ and $L^\infty$ domains of the Laplacian
on $SG$. In terms of the these trace spaces, we characterize the functions in
the $L^2$ and $L^\infty$ domains of the Laplacian on $\Omega$ that extend to
the corresponding domains on $SG$, and give an explicit linear extension
operator in terms of piecewise biharmonic functions.
