In real-life temporal scenarios, uncertainty and preferences are often
essential and coexisting aspects. We present a formalism where quantitative
temporal constraints with both preferences and uncertainty can be defined. We
show how three classical notions of controllability (that is, strong, weak, and
dynamic), which have been developed for uncertain temporal problems, can be
generalized to handle preferences as well. After defining this general
framework, we focus on problems where preferences follow the fuzzy approach,
and with properties that assure tractability. For such problems, we propose
algorithms to check the presence of the controllability properties. In
particular, we show that in such a setting dealing simultaneously with
preferences and uncertainty does not increase the complexity of controllability
testing. We also develop a dynamic execution algorithm, of polynomial
complexity, that produces temporal plans under uncertainty that are optimal
with respect to fuzzy preferences.
