In this paper we investigate the problem of lifting of Galois covers between
algebraic curves from characteristic p>0 to characteristic 0. We prove a
refined version of the main result of Garuti concerning this problem in [Ga].
We formulate a refined version of the Oort conjecture on liftings of cyclic
Galois covers between curves. We introduce the notion of fake liftings of
cyclic Galois covers between curves, their existence would contradict the Oort
conjecture, and we study the geometry of their semi-stable models. Finally, we
introduce and investigate on some examples the smoothening process, which
ultimately aims to show that fake liftings do not exist. This in turn would
imply the Oort conjecture.
