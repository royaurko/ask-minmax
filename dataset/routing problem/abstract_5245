CA has grown as potential classifier for addressing major problems in
bioinformatics. Lot of bioinformatics problems like predicting the protein
coding region, finding the promoter region, predicting the structure of protein
and many other problems in bioinformatics can be addressed through Cellular
Automata. Even though there are some prediction techniques addressing these
problems, the approximate accuracy level is very less. An automated procedure
was proposed with MACA (Multiple Attractor Cellular Automata) which can address
all these problems. The genetic algorithm is also used to find rules with good
fitness values. Extensive experiments are conducted for reporting the accuracy
of the proposed tool. The average accuracy of MACA when tested with ENCODE,
BG570, HMR195, Fickett and Tongue, ASP67 datasets is 78%.
