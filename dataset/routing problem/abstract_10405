The present issue of the series <<Modern Problems in Mathematical Physics>>
represents the Proceedings of the Students Training Contest Olympiad in
Mathematical and Theoretical Physics and includes the statements and the
solutions of the problems offered to the participants. The contest Olympiad was
held on May 21st-24th, 2010 by Scientific Research Laboratory of Mathematical
Physics of Samara State University, Steklov Mathematical Institute of Russia's
Academy of Sciences, and Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (State
University) in cooperation.
  The present Proceedings is intended to be used by the students of physical
and mechanical-mathematical departments of the universities, who are interested
in acquiring a deeper knowledge of the methods of mathematical and theoretical
physics, and could be also useful for the persons involved in teaching
mathematical and theoretical physics.
