We describe the development of a junior-senior level course for Physics
majors designed to teach Mathematica skills in support of their undergraduate
coursework, but also to introduce students to modern research level results.
Standard introductory and intermediate level Physics homework-style problems
are used to teach Mathematica commands and programming methods, which are then
applied, in turn, to more sophisticated problems in some of the core
undergraduate subjects, along with making contact with recent research papers
in a variety of fields.
