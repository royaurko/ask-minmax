This paper explores features of an idealized mathematical machine (algorithm)
that would be capable of reconstructing the gravitational nature (the
multipolar structure or spacetime metric) of a compact object, by observing
gravitational radiation emitted by a small object that orbits and spirals into
it. An outline is given of the mathematical developments that must be carried
out in order to construct such a machine.
