On an arbitrary compact Riemann surface, necessary and sufficient conditions
are found for the existence of semistable vector bundles with slope between
zero and one and a prescribed number of linearly independent holomorphic
sections. Existence is achieved by minimizing the Yang-Mills-Higgs functional.
