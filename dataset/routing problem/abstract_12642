Nonlinear polynomial selection algorithms for the number field sieve address
the problem of constructing polynomials with small coefficients by reducing to
instances of the well-studied problem of finding short vectors in lattices. The
reduction rests upon the construction of modular geometric progressions with
small terms. In this paper, the methods used to construct the geometric
progressions are extended, resulting in the development of two nonlinear
polynomial selection algorithms.
