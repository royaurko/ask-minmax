We introduce a ZFC method that enables us to build spaces (in fact special
dense subspaces of certain Cantor cubes) in which we have "full control" over
all dense subsets.
  Using this method we are able to construct, in ZFC, for each uncountable
regular cardinal $\lambda$ a 0-dimensional $T_2$, hence Tychonov, space which
is $\mu$-resolvable for all $\mu < \lambda$ but not $\lambda$-resolvable. This
yields the final (negative) solution of a celebrated problem of Ceder and
Pearson raised in 1967: Are $\omega$-resolvable spaces maximally resolvable?
This method enables us to solve several other open problems concerning
resolvability as well.
