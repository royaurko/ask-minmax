The spectral problem for matrices with a block-hierarchical structure is
often considered in context of the theory of complex systems. In the present
article, a new class of matrices with a block-rectangular non-symmetric
hierarchical structure is introduced and the corresponding spectral problem is
investigated. Using these results we study a model of error generation in
information sequence where such block-rectangular hierarchical matrices appear
in a natural way.
