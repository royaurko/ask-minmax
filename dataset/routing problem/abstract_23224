We explore the gauge hierarchy problem within the framework of supersymmetric
$SU(3)_c \times SU(3)_L \times SU(3)_R$ with a minimal set of higgs
supermultiplets. Imposition of a suitable discrete (alternatively $R$) symmetry
`prevents' the electroweak higgs doublets from becoming superheavy through
renormalizable couplings. A full resolution of the problem requires
consideration of the non-renormalizable couplings which play an essential role.
Other key differences from the minimal supersymmetric $SU(5)$ model include the
fact that the proton is stable and that an effective $5 + \bar{5}$
supermultiplet appears around the $TeV$ mass scale.
