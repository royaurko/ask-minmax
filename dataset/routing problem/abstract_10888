We calculate predictions from defect models of structure formation for both
the matter and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) over all observable scales.
Our results point to a serious problem reconciling the observed large-scale
galaxy distribution with the COBE normalization, a result which is robust for a
wide range of defect parameters. We conclude that standard scaling defect
models are in conflict with the data, and show how attempts to resolve the
problem by considering non-scaling defects would require radical departures
from the standard scaling picture.
