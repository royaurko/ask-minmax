In this paper, two sequences of minimal isoparametric hypersurfaces are
constructed via the representations of Cli?ord algebra. Based on these
constructions, we give estimates on eigenvalues of the Laplacian of the focal
submanifolds of isoparametric hypersurfaces with four principal curvatures in
unit spheres. This part is a continuation of [TY13] and [TXY14]. In 1980, Eells
and Lemaire [EL83] posed a problem to characterize the compact Riemannian
manifold M for which there is an eigenmap from M to S^n with dim(M) no less
than n. In 1993, Eells and Ratto emphasized again in [ER93] that it is quite
natural to study eigenmaps to unit spheres. As another application of our
constructions, the focal maps give rise to many examples of submersive
eigenmaps from minimal isoparametric hypersurfaces to unit spheres. At last, by
investigating the second fundamental forms of focal submanifolds of
isoparametric hypersurfaces in unit spheres, we provide infinitely many counter
examples to two conjectures of Leung [Le82] on minimal submanifolds in unit
spheres. Notice that these conjectures have been proved in the case that the
normal connection is flat [HV01].
