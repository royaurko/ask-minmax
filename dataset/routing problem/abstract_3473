The algebraic structure of V.P. Potapov's Fundamental Matrix Inequality (FMI)
is discussed and its interpolation meaning is analyzed. Functional model spaces
are involved. A general Abstract Interpolation Problem is formulated which
seems to cover all the classical and recent problems in the field and the
solution set of this problem is described using the Arov--Grossman formula. The
extension theory of isometric operators is the proper language for treating
interpolation problems of this type.
