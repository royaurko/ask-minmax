Topological insulators are a new phase of matter that exhibits exotic surface
electronic properties. Determining the spin texture of this class of material
is of paramount importance for both fundamental understanding of its
topological order and future spin-based applications. In this article, we
review the recent experimental and theoretical studies on the differential
coupling of left- versus right-circularly polarized light to the topological
surface states in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. These studies have
shown that the polarization of light and the experimental geometry plays a very
important role in both photocurrent intensity and spin polarization of
photoelectrons emitted from the topological surface states. A general
photoemission matrix element calculation with spin-orbit coupling can
quantitatively explain the observations and is also applicable to topologically
trivial systems. These experimental and theoretical investigations suggest that
optical excitation with circularly polarized light is a promising route towards
mapping the spin-orbit texture and manipulating the spin orientation in
topological and other spin-orbit coupled materials.
