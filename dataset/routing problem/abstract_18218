The main purpose of this paper is to establish the existence of positive
solutions to a class of quasilinear elliptic equations involving the
(p-q)-Laplacian operator. We consider a nonlinearity that can be subcritical at
infinity and supercritical at the origin; we also consider potential functions
that can vanish at infinity. The approach is based on variational arguments
dealing with the mountain-pass lemma and an adaptation of the penalization
method. In order to overcome the lack of compactness we modify the original
problem and the associated energy functional. Finally, to show that the
solution of the modified problem is also a solution of the original problem we
use an estimate obtained by the Moser iteration scheme.
