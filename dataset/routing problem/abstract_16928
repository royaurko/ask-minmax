We study the evolution of the probability density of an asexual, one locus
population under natural selection and random evolution. This evolution is
governed by a Fokker-Planck equation with degenerate coefficients on the
boundaries, supplemented by a pair of conservation laws. It is readily shown
that no classical or standard weak solution definition yields solvability of
the problem. We provide an appropriate definition of weak solution for the
problem, for which we show existence and uniqueness. The solution displays a
very distinctive structure and, for large time, we show convergence to a unique
stationary solution that turns out to be a singular measure supported at the
endpoints. An exponential rate of convergence to this steady state is also
proved.
