Delaunay and Gabriel graphs are widely studied geometric proximity
structures. Motivated by applications in wireless routing, relaxed versions of
these graphs known as \emph{Locally Delaunay Graphs} ($LDGs$) and \emph{Locally
Gabriel Graphs} ($LGGs$) were proposed. We propose another generalization of
$LGGs$ called \emph{Generalized Locally Gabriel Graphs} ($GLGGs$) in the
context when certain edges are forbidden in the graph. Unlike a Gabriel Graph,
there is no unique $LGG$ or $GLGG$ for a given point set because no edge is
necessarily included or excluded. This property allows us to choose an
$LGG/GLGG$ that optimizes a parameter of interest in the graph. We show that
computing an edge maximum $GLGG$ for a given problem instance is NP-hard and
also APX-hard. We also show that computing an $LGG$ on a given point set with
dilation $\le k$ is NP-hard. Finally, we give an algorithm to verify whether a
given geometric graph $G=(V,E)$ is a valid $LGG$.
