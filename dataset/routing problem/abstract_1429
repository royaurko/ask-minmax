We simulate two-dimensional Josephson junction arrays, including full mutual-
inductance effects, as they are cooled below the transition temperature in a
magnetic field. We show numerical simulations of the array magnetization as a
function of position, as detected by a scanning SQUID which is placed at a
fixed height above the array. The calculated magnetization images show striking
agreement with the experimental images obtained by A. Nielsen et al. The
average array magnetization is found to be paramagnetic for many values of the
applied field, confirming that paramagnetism can arise from magnetic screening
in multiply-connected superconductors without the presence of d-wave
superconductivity.
