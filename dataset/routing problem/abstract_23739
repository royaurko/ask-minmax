A meromorphic transform between complex manifolds is a surjective mutivalued
map with an analytic graph. Let $F_n$ be a sequence of meromorphic transforms
from a compact Kahler manifold X into compact Kahler manifolds X_n. We give
conditions which imply that the behavior of the sequence of preimages
$F_n^{-1}(x_n)$ of x_n does not depend on the generic sequence of points
(x_1,x_2,....). Using this formalism, we obtain sharp results on the limit
distribution of common zeros, of $l$ random holomorphic sections of high powers
$L^n$ of a positive holomorphic line bundle L over a projective manifold X. We
consider also the equidistribution problem for random iteration of
correspondences. If f is a meromorphic self correspondence of a compact Kahler
manifold X, under a hypothesis on the dynamical degrees, we construct an
$f^*$-invariant probability measure $\mu$ such that quasi-p.s.h. functions are
$\mu$-integrable. Every projective manifold admits such correspondences. When f
is a meromorphic map, the measure $\mu$ is exponentially mixing. We give some
analogous results for random iterations of correspondences. We also consider
the problem of equidistribution of preimages of subvarieties for a
correspondences and more precisely for polynomial automorphisms.
