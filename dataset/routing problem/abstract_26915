In gravity mediated models and in particular in models with strongly
stabilized moduli, there is a natural hierarchy between gaugino masses, the
gravitino mass and moduli masses: $m_{1/2} \ll m_{3/2} \ll m_{\phi}$. Given
this hierarchy, we show that 1) moduli problems associated with excess entropy
production from moduli decay and 2) problems associated with moduli/gravitino
decays to neutralinos are non-existent. Placed in an inflationary context, we
show that the amplitude of moduli oscillations are severely limited by strong
stabilization. Moduli oscillations may then never come to dominate the energy
density of the Universe. As a consequence, moduli decay to gravitinos and their
subsequent decay to neutralinos need not overpopulate the cold dark matter
density.
