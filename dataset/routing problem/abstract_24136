Level set methods are versatile and extensible techniques for general front
tracking problems, including the practically important problem of predicting
the advance of a firefront across expanses of surface vegetation. Given a rule,
empirical or otherwise, to specify the rate of advance of an infinitesimal
segment of firefront arc normal to itself (i.e., given the firespread rate as a
function of known local parameters relating to topography, vegetation, and
meteorology), level set methods harness the well developed mathematical
machinery of hyperbolic conservation laws on Eulerian grids to evolve the
position of the front in time. Topological challenges associated with the
swallowing of islands and the merger of fronts are tractable.
  The principal goals of this paper are to: collect key results from the two
largely distinct scientific literatures of level sets and firespread;
demonstrate the practical value of level set methods to wildland fire modeling
through numerical experiments; probe and address current limitations; and
propose future directions in the simulation of, and the development of
decision-aiding tools to assess countermeasure options for, wildland fires. In
addition, we introduce a freely available two-dimensional level set code used
to produce the numerical results of this paper and designed to be extensible to
more complicated configurations.
