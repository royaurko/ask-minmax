In this note we report the solution of the problem of defining the
$S$-transform in Free Probability Theory in arbitrary dimensions. This is
achieved by generalising the theory and embedding it into an
algebraic-geometric framework. Finally, we classify the groups arising as
distributions of s-tuples of non-commutative random variables.
