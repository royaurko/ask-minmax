Using Maz'ya type integral identities with power weights, we obtain new
boundary estimates for biharmonic functions on Lipschitz and convex domains in
$R^n$. For $n\ge 8$, combined with a result in \cite{S2}, these estimates lead
to the solvability of the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem for the biharmonic equation
on Lipschitz domains for a new range of $p$. In the case of convex domains, the
estimates allow us to show that the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem is uniquely
solvable for any $2-\e<p<\infty$ and $n\ge 4$.
