Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) have recently become
popular among many AI researchers because they serve as a natural model for
planning under uncertainty. Value iteration is a well-known algorithm for
finding optimal policies for POMDPs. It typically takes a large number of
iterations to converge. This paper proposes a method for accelerating the
convergence of value iteration. The method has been evaluated on an array of
benchmark problems and was found to be very effective: It enabled value
iteration to converge after only a few iterations on all the test problems.
