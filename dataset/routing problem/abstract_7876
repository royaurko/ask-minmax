Consider a bounded domain with the Dirichlet condition on a part of the
boundary and the Neumann condition on its complement. Does the spectrum of the
Laplacian determine uniquely which condition is imposed on which part? We
present some results, conjectures and problems related to this variation on the
isospectral theme.
