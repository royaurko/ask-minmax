A logical explanation as to why the choice of the Pian-Sumihara basis (as a
linear basis to approximate stress) leads to greater efficiency in enhanced
strain problems, is presented. An Airy stress function and the consequent
selective simplification resulting from the differentiation of an implied,
single, parent approximating polynomial, are the essence of this argument.
