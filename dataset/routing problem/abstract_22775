We study segregation patterns in a hard sphere binary model under gravity
subject to sequences of taps. We discuss the appearance of the ``Brazil nut''
effect (where large particles move up) and the ``reverse Brazil nut'' effects
in the stationary states reached by ``tap'' dynamics. In particular, we show
that the stationary state depends only on two thermodynamical quantities: the
gravitational energy of the first and of the second species and not on the
sample history. To describe the properties of the system, we generalize
Edwards' approach by introducing a canonical distribution characterized by two
configurational temperatures, conjugate to the energies of the two species.
This is supported by Monte Carlo calculations showing that the average of
several quantities over the tap dynamics and over such distribution coincide.
The segregation problem can then be understood as an equilibrium statistical
mechanics problem with two control parameters.
