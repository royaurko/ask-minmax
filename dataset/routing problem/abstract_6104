The problem of the cosmic coincidence is a longstanding puzzle. This
conundrum may be solved by introducing a coupling between the two dark sectors.
In this Letter, we study a coupled quintessence scenario in which the scalar
field evolves in a power law potential and the mass of dark matter particles
depends on a power law function of $\phi$. It is shown that this scenario has a
stable attractor solution and can thus provide a natural solution to the cosmic
coincidence problem.
