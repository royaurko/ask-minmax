The problem of forced convection along an isothermal moving plate is a
classical problem of fluid mechanics that has been solved for the first time in
1961 by Sakiadis (1961). It appears that the first work concerning mixed
convection along a moving plate is that of Moutsoglou and Chen (1980).
Thereafter, many solutions have been obtained for different aspects of this
class of boundary layer problems. In the previous works the fluid properties
have been assumed constant. Ali (2006) in a recent paper treated, for the first
time, the mixed convection problem with variable viscosity. He used the local
similarity method to solve this problem but there are doubts about the validity
of his results. For that reason we resolved the above problem with the direct
numerical solution of the boundary layer equations without any transformation.
