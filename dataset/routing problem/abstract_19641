Very recently Fonseca and Pires [Phys. Rev. B 73, 012403(2006)] have studied
the soliton--magnon scattering for the isotropic antiferromagnet and calculated
``exact'' phase shifts, which were compared with the ones obtained by the Born
approximation. In this Comment we correct both the soliton and magnon solutions
and point out the way how to study correctly the scattering problem.
