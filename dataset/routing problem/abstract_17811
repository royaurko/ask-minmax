In this paper, we study the problem of cooperative communications in
cognitive radio systems where the secondary user has limited relaying room for
the overheard primary packets. More specifically, we characterize the stable
throughput region of a cognitive radio network with a finite relaying buffer at
the secondary user. Towards this objective, we formulate a constrained
optimization problem for maximizing the secondary user throughput while
guaranteeing the stability of the primary user queue. We consider a general
cooperation policy where the packet admission and queue selection
probabilities, at the secondary user, are both dependent on the state (length)
of the finite relaying buffer. Despite the sheer complexity of the optimization
problem, attributed to its non-convexity, we transform it to a linear program.
Our numerical results reveal a number of valuable insights, e.g., it is always
mutually beneficial to cooperate in delivering the primary packets in terms of
expanding the stable throughput region. In addition, the stable throughput
region of the system, compared to the case of infinite relaying queue capacity,
marginally shrinks for limited relaying queue capacity.
