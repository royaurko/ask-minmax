We consider left-right symmetric model with spontaneous CP-violation. The
Lagrangian of this model is CP invariant and the Yukawa couplings are real. Due
to spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry, some of the neutral Higgses
acquire complex vacuum expectation values, which lead to CP-violation. In the
model considered here, we identify the neutrino Dirac mass matrix with that of
Fritzsch type charged lepton mass matrix. We assume a hierarchical spectrum of
the right handed neutrino masses and derive a bound on this hierarchy by
assuming that the decay of the lightest right handed neutrino produces the
baryon asymmetry via the leptogenesis route. It is shown that the mass
hierarchy we obtain is compatible with the current neutrino oscillation data.
