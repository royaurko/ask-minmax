Riemann--Hilbert techniques are used in the theory of completely integrable
differential equations to generate solutions that contain a free function which
can be used at least in principle to solve initial or boundary value problems.
The solution of a boundary value problem is thus reduced to the identification
of the jump data of the Riemann-Hilbert problem from the boundary data. But
even if this can be achieved,it is very difficult to get explicit solutions
since the matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem is equivalent to an integral equation.
In the case of the Ernst equation (the stationary axisymmetric Einstein
equations in vacuum), it was shown in a previous work that the matrix problem
is gauge equivalent to a scalar problem on a Riemann surface. If the jump data
of the original problem are rational functions, this surface will be compact
which makes it possible to give explicit solutions in terms of hyperelliptic
theta functions. In the present work, we discuss Riemann-Hilbert problems on
Riemann surfaces in the framework of fibre bundles. This makes it possible to
treat the compact and the non-compact case in the same setting and to apply
general existence theorems.
