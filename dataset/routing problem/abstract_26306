Recently there has been much interest in "sparsifying" sums of rank one
matrices: modifying the coefficients such that only a few are nonzero, while
approximately preserving the matrix that results from the sum. Results of this
sort have found applications in many different areas, including sparsifying
graphs. In this paper we consider the more general problem of sparsifying sums
of positive semidefinite matrices that have arbitrary rank.
  We give several algorithms for solving this problem. The first algorithm is
based on the method of Batson, Spielman and Srivastava (2009). The second
algorithm is based on the matrix multiplicative weights update method of Arora
and Kale (2007). We also highlight an interesting connection between these two
algorithms.
  Our algorithms have numerous applications. We show how they can be used to
construct graph sparsifiers with auxiliary constraints, sparsifiers of
hypergraphs, and sparse solutions to semidefinite programs.
