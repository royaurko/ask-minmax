The basic statistical methods of data representation did not change since
their emergence. Their simplicity was dictated by the intricacies of
computations in the before computers epoch. It turns out that such approach is
not uniquely possible in the presence of quick computers. The suggested here
method improves significantly the reliability of data processing and their
graphical representation. In this paper we show problems of the standard data
processing which can bring to incorrect results. A method solving these
problems is proposed. It is based on modification of data representation. The
method was implemented in a computer program Consensus5. The program
performances are illustrated through varied examples.
