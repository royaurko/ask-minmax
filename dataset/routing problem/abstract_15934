This paper shows how partial differential problems can be solved thanks to
cellular computing and an adaptation of the Least Squares Finite Elements
Method. As cellular computing can be implemented on distributed parallel
architectures, this method allows the distribution of a resource demanding
differential problem over a computer network.
