Dawson and Perkins [Ann. Probab. 26 (1988) 1088--1138] constructed a
stochastic model of an interacting two-type population indexed by a countable
site space which locally undergoes a mutually catalytic branching mechanism. In
Klenke and Mytnik [Preprint (2008), arXiv:0901.0623], it is shown that as the
branching rate approaches infinity, the process converges to a process that is
called the infinite rate mutually catalytic branching process (IMUB). It is
most conveniently characterized as the solution of a certain martingale
problem. While in the latter reference, a noise equation approach is used in
order to construct a solution to this martingale problem, the aim of this paper
is to provide a Trotter-type construction. The construction presented here will
be used in a forthcoming paper, Klenke and Mytnik [Preprint (2009)], to
investigate the long-time behavior of IMUB (coexistence versus segregation of
types). This paper is partly based on the Ph.D. thesis of the second contributor
(2008), where the Trotter approach was first introduced.
