This seminar report contains a detailed account of the proof of the main
results in Monod and Ozawa's recent JFA paper on the Dixmier unitarizability
problem. The proof is exactly identical to their proof, but our more pedestrian
presentation is hopefully more accessible to nonexperts. This text is not
intended for publication (but it might end up as part of an updated version of
our Springer Lecture Notes 1618).
