We show that the edge-clique graphs of cocktail party graphs have unbounded
rankwidth. This, and other observations lead us to conjecture that the
edge-clique cover problem is NP-complete for cographs. We show that the
independent set problem on edge-clique graphs of cographs and of
distance-hereditary graphs can be solved in O(n^4) time. We show that the
independent set problem on edge-clique graphs of graphs without odd wheels
remains NP-complete.
