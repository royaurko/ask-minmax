Effective conductivity of a 2D random composite is expressed in the form of
long series in the volume fraction of ideally conducting disks. The problem of
a {\it direct} reconstruction of the critical index for superconductivity from
the series is solved with good accuracy, for the first time. General analytical
expressions for conductivity in the whole range of concentrations are derived
and compared with the regular composite and existing models.
