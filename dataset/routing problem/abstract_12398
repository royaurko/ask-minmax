The goal of this paper is to critically evaluate a heuristic algorithm for
the Inverse Banzhaf Index problem by Laruelle and Widgr\'en. Few qualitative
results are known about the approximation quality of the heuristics for this
problem. The intuition behind the operation of this approximation algorithm is
analysed and evaluated. We found that the algorithm can not handle general
inputs well, and often fails to improve inputs. It is also shown to diverge
after only tens of iterations. We present three alternative extensions of the
algorithm that do not alter the complexity but can result in up to a factor 6.5
improvement in solution quality.
