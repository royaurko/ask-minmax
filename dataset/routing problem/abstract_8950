The unification problem in algebras capable of describing sets has been
tackled, directly or indirectly, by many researchers and it finds important
applications in various research areas--e.g., deductive databases, theorem
proving, static analysis, rapid software prototyping. The various solutions
proposed are spread across a large literature. In this paper we provide a
uniform presentation of unification of sets, formalizing it at the level of set
theory. We address the problem of deciding existence of solutions at an
abstract level. This provides also the ability to classify different types of
set unification problems. Unification algorithms are uniformly proposed to
solve the unification problem in each of such classes.
  The algorithms presented are partly drawn from the literature--and properly
revisited and analyzed--and partly novel proposals. In particular, we present a
new goal-driven algorithm for general ACI1 unification and a new simpler
algorithm for general (Ab)(Cl) unification.
