In recent years some near-optimal estimates have been established for certain
sum-product type estimates. This paper gives some first extremal results which
provide information about when these bounds may or may not be tight. The main
tool is a new result which provides a nontrivial upper bound on the
multiplicative energy of a sum set or difference set.
