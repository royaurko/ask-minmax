Recommender systems can change our life a lot and help us select suitable and
favorite items much more conveniently and easily. As a consequence, various
kinds of algorithms have been proposed in last few years to improve the
performance. However, all of them face one critical problem: data sparsity. In
this paper, we proposed a two-step recommendation algorithm via iterative local
least squares (ILLS). Firstly, we obtain the ratings matrix which is
constructed via users' behavioral records, and it is normally very sparse.
Secondly, we preprocess the "ratings" matrix through ProbS which can convert
the sparse data to a dense one. Then we use ILLS to estimate those missing
values. Finally, the recommendation list is generated. Experimental results on
the three datasets: MovieLens, Netflix, RYM, suggest that the proposed method
can enhance the algorithmic accuracy of AUC. Especially, it performs much
better in dense datasets. Furthermore, since this methods can improve those
missing value more accurately via iteration which might show light in
discovering those inactive users' purchasing intention and eventually solving
cold-start problem.
