We introduce an abstract setting that allows to discuss wave equations with
time-dependent boundary conditions by means of operator matrices. We show that
such problems are well-posed if and only if certain perturbations of the same
problems with homogeneous, time-independent boundary conditions are well-posed.
As applications we discuss two wave equations in $L^p(0,1)$ and in
$L^2(\Omega)$ equipped with dynamical and acoustic-like boundary conditions,
respectively.
