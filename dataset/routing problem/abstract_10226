This work considers the problem of super-resolution. The goal is to resolve a
Dirac distribution from knowledge of its discrete, low-pass, Fourier
measurements. Classically, such problems have been dealt with parameter
estimation methods. Recently, it has been shown that convex-optimization based
formulations facilitate a continuous time solution to the super-resolution
problem. Here we treat super-resolution from low-pass measurements in Phase
Space. The Phase Space transformation parametrically generalizes a number of
well known unitary mappings such as the Fractional Fourier, Fresnel, Laplace
and Fourier transforms. Consequently, our work provides a general super-
resolution strategy which is backward compatible with the usual Fourier domain
result. We consider low-pass measurements of Dirac distributions in Phase Space
and show that the super-resolution problem can be cast as Total Variation
minimization. Remarkably, even though are setting is quite general, the bounds
on the minimum separation distance of Dirac distributions is comparable to
existing methods.
