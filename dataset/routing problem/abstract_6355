Two methods based on Fourier series expansions (a Chandrasekhar
functions-based method and a shifted Legendre polynomials -based method) are
used to study analytically the eigenvalue problem governing the linear
convection problem with an uniform internal heat source in a horizontal fluid
layer bounded by two rigid walls. For each method some theoretical remarks are
made. Numerical results are given and they are compared with some existing
ones. Good agrement is found.
