A detailed investigation of hybrid inflation and the subsequent reheating
process is performed within a mu problem solving supersymmetric model based on
a left-right symmetric gauge group. The process of baryogenesis via
leptogenesis is especially studied. For mu and tau neutrino masses consistent
with the small angle MSW resolution of the solar neutrino problem and the
recent results of the SuperKamiokande experiment, we show that maximal mu-tau
neutrino mixing can be achieved. The required value of the relevant coupling
constant is, however, quite small (of the order 10^{-6}).
