In recent work, robust Principal Components Analysis (PCA) has been posed as
a problem of recovering a low-rank matrix $\mathbf{L}$ and a sparse matrix
$\mathbf{S}$ from their sum, $\mathbf{M}:= \mathbf{L} + \mathbf{S}$ and a
provably exact convex optimization solution called PCP has been proposed. This
work studies the following problem. Suppose that we have partial knowledge
about the column space of the low rank matrix $\mathbf{L}$. Can we use this
information to improve the PCP solution, i.e. allow recovery under weaker
assumptions? We propose here a simple but useful modification of the PCP idea,
called modified-PCP, that allows us to use this knowledge. We derive its
correctness result which shows that, when the available subspace knowledge is
accurate, modified-PCP indeed requires significantly weaker incoherence
assumptions than PCP. Extensive simulations are also used to illustrate this.
Comparisons with PCP and other existing work are shown for a stylized real
application as well. Finally, we explain how this problem naturally occurs in
many applications involving time series data, i.e. in what is called the online
or recursive robust PCA problem. A corollary for this case is also given.
