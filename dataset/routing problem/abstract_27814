Guessing games for directed graphs were introduced by Riis for studying
multiple unicast network coding problems. In a guessing game, the players toss
generalised dice and can see some of the other outcomes depending on the
structure of an underlying digraph. They later guess simultaneously the outcome
of their own die. Their objective is to find a strategy which maximises the
probability that they all guess correctly. The performance of the optimal
strategy for a graph is measured by the guessing number of the digraph.
  Christofides and Markstr\"om studied guessing numbers of undirected graphs
and defined a strategy which they conjectured to be optimal. One of the main
results of this paper is a disproof of this conjecture.
  The main tool so far for computing guessing numbers of graphs is information
theoretic inequalities. In the paper we show that Shannon's information
inequalities, which work particularly well for a wide range of graph classes,
are not sufficient for computing the guessing number.
  Finally we pose a few more interesting questions some of which we can answer
and some which we leave as open problems.
