The challenging problems, in the field of control of chaos or of transition
to chaos, lie in the domain of infinite-dimensional systems. Access to all
variables being impossible in this case and the controlling action being
limited to a few collective variables, it will not in general be possible to
drive the whole system to the desired behaviour. A paradigmatic problem of this
type is the control of the transition to turbulence in the boundary layer of
fluid motion. By analysing a boundary layer flow for an ionized fluid near an
airfoil, one concludes that active control of the transition amounts to the
resolution of an generalized integro-differential eigenvalue problem. To cope
with the required response times and phase accuracy, electromagnetic control,
whenever possible, seems more appropriate than mechanical control by
microactuators.
