In this work, we are concerned with the diffusive optical tomography (DOT)
problem in the case when only one or two pairs of Cauchy data is available. We
propose a simple and efficient direct sampling method (DSM) to locate
inhomogeneities inside a homogeneous background and solve the DOT problem in
both full and limited aperture cases. This new method is easy to implement and
less expensive computationally. Numerical experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness and robustness against noise in the data. This provides a new
promising numerical strategy for the DOT problem.
