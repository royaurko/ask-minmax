We study the QCD phase structure at high temperature and density adopting a
histogram method. Because the quark determinant is complex at finite density,
the Monte-Carlo method cannot be applied directly. We use a reweighting method
and try to solve the problems which arise in the reweighting method, i.e. the
sign problem and the overlap problem. We discuss the chemical potential
dependence of the probability distribution function in the heavy quark mass
region and examine the applicability of the approach in the light quark region.
