We prove necessary optimality conditions of Euler-Lagrange type for a problem
of the calculus of variations with time delays, where the delay in the unknown
function is different from the delay in its derivative. Then, a more general
optimal control problem with time delays is considered. Main result gives a
convergence theorem, allowing to obtain a solution to the delayed optimal
control problem by considering a sequence of delayed problems of the calculus
of variations.
