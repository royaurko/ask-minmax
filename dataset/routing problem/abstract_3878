The Cauchy problem is considered for the perturbed strictly hyperbolic 2x2
system of quasilinear equations. The unperturbed problem has a persistent
solution with two discontinuity lines (shock waves). Both an asymptotics of
shock waves position in the plane (x,t) and an asymptotics of the perturbed
problem solution are discussed.
