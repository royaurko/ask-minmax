The Art Gallery Problem is one of the most well-known problems in
Computational Geometry, with a rich history in the study of algorithms,
complexity, and variants. Recently there has been a surge in experimental work
on the problem. In this survey, we describe this work, show the chronology of
developments, and compare current algorithms, including two unpublished
versions, in an exhaustive experiment. Furthermore, we show what core
algorithmic ingredients have led to recent successes.
