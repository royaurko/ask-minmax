For a graph $H$, the $H$-free Edge Deletion problem asks whether there exist
at most $k$ edges whose deletion from the input graph $G$ results in a graph
without any induced copy of $H$. We prove that $H$-free Edge Deletion is
NP-complete if $H$ is a graph with at least two edges and every component of
$H$ is either a tree or a regular graph. Furthermore, we obtain that these
NP-complete problems cannot be solved in parameterized subexponential time,
i.e., in time $2^{o(k)}\cdot |G|^{O(1)}$, unless Exponential Time Hypothesis
fails.
