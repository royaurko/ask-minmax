A general study of the fermionic structure of the 331 models with \beta
arbitrary shows the possibility of obtaining 331 vector-like models with mirror
fermions. On one hand, the existence of mirror fermions gives a possible way to
fit the discrepancy in the bottom quark asymmetries from the prediction of the
standard model. On the other hand, the vector-like nature of the model permits
to address the problem of the fermion mass hierarchy, and in particular the
problem of the neutrino mass and mixing pattern. Specifically, we consider a
model with four families and \beta =-1/\sqrt{3} where the additional family
corresponds to a mirror fermion of the third generation of the Standard Model.
We also show how to generate ansatzs about the mass matrices of the fermions
according to the phenomenology. In particular, it is possible to get a natural
fit for the neutrino hierarchical masses and mixing angles. Moreover, by means
of the mixing between the third quark family and its mirror fermion, a possible
solution for the A_{FB}^{b} discrepancy is obtained.
