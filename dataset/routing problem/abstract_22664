We address the problem of automatically constructing a thesaurus
(hierarchically clustering words) based on corpus data. We view the problem of
clustering words as that of estimating a joint distribution over the Cartesian
product of a partition of a set of nouns and a partition of a set of verbs, and
propose an estimation algorithm using simulated annealing with an energy
function based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) Principle. We
empirically compared the performance of our method based on the MDL Principle
against that of one based on the Maximum Likelihood Estimator, and found that
the former outperforms the latter. We also evaluated the method by conducting
pp-attachment disambiguation experiments using an automatically constructed
thesaurus. Our experimental results indicate that we can improve accuracy in
disambiguation by using such a thesaurus.
