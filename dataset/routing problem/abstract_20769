We survey the recent developments in the area that grew out of attempts to
extend an analog of Hilbert's Tenth Problem to the field of rational numbers
and rings of integers of number fields. The paper is based on a plenary talk
the contributor gave at the North American Annual ASL meeting at the University of
Notre Dame in May of 2009.
