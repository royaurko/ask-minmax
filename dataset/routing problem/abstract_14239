We consider the problem of adaptive observer design in the settings when the
system is allowed to be nonlinear in the parameters, and furthermore they are
to satisfy additional feasibility constraints. A solution to the problem is
proposed that is based on the idea of universal observers and non-uniform
small-gain theorem. The procedure is illustrated with an example.
