We propose a Preconditioned Locally Harmonic Residual (PLHR) method for
computing several interior eigenpairs of a generalized Hermitian eigenvalue
problem, without traditional spectral transformations, matrix factorizations,
or inversions. PLHR is based on a short-term recurrence, easily extended to a
block form, computing eigenpairs simultaneously. PLHR can take advantage of
Hermitian positive definite preconditioning, e.g., based on an approximate
inverse of an absolute value of a shifted matrix, introduced in [SISC, 35
(2013), pp. A696-A718]. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that PLHR is
efficient and robust for certain classes of large-scale interior eigenvalue
problems, involving Laplacian and Hamiltonian operators, especially if memory
requirements are tight.
