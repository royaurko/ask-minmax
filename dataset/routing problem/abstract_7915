In this paper, we prove that all automorphisms of categories of free S-acts
are semi-inner, which solves a variation of a well known B. Plotkin's problem
in the case of monoids. We also give a description of automorphisms of
categories of finitely generated free algebras of varieties of unary algebras,
and show that among varieties of unary algebras only the variety of mono-unary
algebras is perfect.
