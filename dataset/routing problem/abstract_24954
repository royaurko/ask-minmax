Scarf's lemma is one of the fundamental results in combinatorics, originally
introduced to study the core of an N-person game. Over the last four decades,
the usefulness of Scarf's lemma has been demonstrated in several important
combinatorial problems seeking "stable" solutions. However, the complexity of
the computational version of Scarf's lemma (SCARF) remained open. In this
paper, we prove that SCARF is complete for the complexity class PPAD. This
proves that SCARF is as hard as the computational versions of Brouwer's fixed
point theorem and Sperner's lemma. Hence, there is no polynomial-time algorithm
for SCARF unless PPAD \subseteq P. We also show that fractional stable paths
problem and finding strong fractional kernels in digraphs are PPAD-hard.
