We discuss the solution of a nonlinear ordinary differential equation that
appears in a model for MHD viscous flow caused by a shrinking sheet. We propose
an accurate numerical solution and derive simple analytical expressions. Our
results suggest that a recent perturbation treatment of the same problem
exhibits a pathological behaviour and conjecture its probable cause.
