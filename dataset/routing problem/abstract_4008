We produce a family of reductions for Schubert intersection problems whose
applicability is checked by calculating a linear combination of the dimensions
involved. These reductions do not alter the Littlewood-Richardson coefficient,
and they lead to an explicit solution of the intersection problem when this
coefficient is 1.
