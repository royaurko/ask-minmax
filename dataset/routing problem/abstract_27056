We present an order-theoretic approach to the study of countably infinite
locally 2-arc-transitive bipartite graphs. Our approach is motivated by
techniques developed by Warren and others during the study of cycle-free
partial orders. We give several new families of previously unknown countably
infinite locally-2-arc-transitive graphs, each family containing continuum many
members. These examples are obtained by gluing together copies of incidence
graphs of semilinear spaces, satisfying a certain symmetry property, in a
tree-like way. In one case we show how the classification problem for that
family relates to the problem of determining a certain family of highly
arc-transitive digraphs. Numerous illustrative examples are given.
