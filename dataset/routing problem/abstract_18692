The previously reported neBEM solver has been used to solve electrostatic
problems having three-dimensional edges and corners in the physical domain.
Both rectangular and triangular elements have been used to discretize the
geometries under study. In order to maintain very high level of precision, a
library of C functions yielding exact values of potential and flux influences
due to uniform surface distribution of singularities on flat triangular and
rectangular elements has been developed and used. Here we present the exact
expressions proposed for computing the influence of uniform singularity
distributions on triangular elements and illustrate their accuracy. We then
consider several problems of electrostatics containing edges and singularities
of various orders including plates and cubes, and L-shaped conductors. We have
tried to show that using the approach proposed in the earlier paper on neBEM
and its present enhanced (through the inclusion of triangular elements) form,
it is possible to obtain accurate estimates of integral features such as the
capacitance of a given conductor and detailed ones such as the charge density
distribution at the edges / corners without taking resort to any new or special
formulation. Results obtained using neBEM have been compared extensively with
both existing analytical and numerical results. The comparisons illustrate the
accuracy, flexibility and robustness of the new approach quite comprehensively.
