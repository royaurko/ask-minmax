The method is proposed for the study of many-point boundary value problems
for systems of nonlinear ODE, by reducing them to special equivalent integral
equations, and allows us [in contrast with the known method [1]] to consider
boundary and initial value problems. Here we avoid the mechanism of Green's
function whose construction is quite nontrivial, especially in case of
many-point boundary value problems. The proposed algorithm [2, 3] makes it
easier to write out the condition of unique solvability of such problems.
