This paper studies the relationship between the Lyapunov function of a
macrosystem whose dynamics is governed by the laws of stochastic chemical
kinetics and the invariant measure of this macrosystem arising at large times.
A necessary and sufficient condition for the reduction of the search problem
for the equilibrium of the macrosystem (the most probable macrostate of the
invariant measure of this macrosystem) to an entropy-linear programming problem
is given.
