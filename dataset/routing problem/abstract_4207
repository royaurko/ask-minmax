The general abstract arbitrary order (N) Cauchy problem was solved in a
closed form as a sum of exponential propagator functions. The infinite sparse
exponential series was solved with the aid of a homogeneous differential
equation. It generated a linear combination of exponential functions. The
Cauchy problem solution was formed with N linear combinations of N exponential
propagators.
