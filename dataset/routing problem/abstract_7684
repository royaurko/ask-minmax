We discuss the problem of how to calculate the distance between two
cosmological objects given their redshifts and angular separation on the sky.
Although of a fundamental nature, this problem and its solution seem to lack a
detailed description in the literature. We present a new variant of its
solution and quantitatively assess the most commonly used approximation.
