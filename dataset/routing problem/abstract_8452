We consider a singular limit problem for the Navier-Stokes system of a
rotating compressible fluid, where the Rossby and Mach numbers tend
simultaneously to zero. The limit problem is identified as the 2-D
Navier-Stokes system in the ``horizontal'' variables containing an extra term
that accounts for compressibility in the original system.
