We study the following inverse graph-theoretic problem: how many vertices
should a graph have given that it has a specified value of some parameter. We
obtain asymptotic for the minimal number of vertices of the graph with the
given number $n$ of maximal independent sets for a class of natural numbers
that can be represented as concatenation of periodic binary words.
