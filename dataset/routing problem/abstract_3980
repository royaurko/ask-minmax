In this Note, we review the main existing results, methods, and some key open
problems on the controllability of nonlinear hyperbolic and parabolic
equations. Especially, we describe our recent universal approach to solve the
local controllability problem of quasilinear time-reversible evolution
equations, which is based on a new unbounded perturbation technique. It is also
worthy to mention that the technique we develop can also be applied to other
problems for quasilinear equations, say local existence, stabilization, etc.
