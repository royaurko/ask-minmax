Systems exploiting network coding to increase their throughput suffer greatly
from pollution attacks which consist of injecting malicious packets in the
network. The pollution attacks are amplified by the network coding process,
resulting in a greater damage than under traditional routing. In this paper, we
address this issue by designing an unconditionally secure authentication code
suitable for multicast network coding. The proposed scheme is robust against
pollution attacks from outsiders, as well as coalitions of malicious insiders.
Intermediate nodes can verify the integrity and origin of the packets received
without having to decode, and thus detect and discard the malicious messages
in-transit that fail the verification. This way, the pollution is canceled out
before reaching the destinations. We analyze the performance of the scheme in
terms of both multicast throughput and goodput, and show the goodput gains. We
also discuss applications to file distribution.
