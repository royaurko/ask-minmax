We investigate how to exploit intermittent feedback for interference
management by studying the two-user Gaussian interference channel (IC). We
approximately characterize (within a universal constant) the capacity region
for the Gaussian IC with intermittent feedback. We exactly characterize the the
capacity region of the linear deterministic version of the problem, which gives
us insight into the Gaussian problem. We find that the characterization only
depends on the forward channel parameters and the marginal probability
distribution of each feedback link. The result shows that passive and
unreliable feedback can be harnessed to provide multiplicative capacity gain in
Gaussian interference channels. We find that when the feedback links are active
with sufficiently large probabilities, the perfect feedback sum-capacity is
achieved to within a constant gap. In contrast to other schemes developed for
interference channel with feedback, our achievable scheme makes use of
quantize-map-and-forward to relay the information obtained through feedback,
performs forward decoding, and does not use structured codes. We also develop
new outer bounds enabling us to obtain the (approximate) characterization of
the capacity region.
