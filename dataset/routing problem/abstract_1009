It is shown that the interaction of large amplitude electromagnetic waves
with a hot electron-positron (e-p) plasma (a principal constituent of the
universe in the MeV epoch) leads to a bunching of mass, energy, and angular
momentum in stable, long-lived structures. Electromagnetism in the MeV epoch,
then, could provide a possible route for seeding the observed large-scale
structure of the universe.
