We show that the gravitino-overproduction problem is prevalent among
inflation models in supergravity. An inflaton field generically acquires
(effective) non-vanishing auxiliary field, if the Kahler potential is
non-minimal. The inflaton field then decays into a pair of the gravitinos,
thereby severely constraining many of the inflation models especially in the
case of the gravity-mediated SUSY breaking.
