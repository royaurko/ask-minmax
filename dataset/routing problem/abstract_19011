In this review, we describe applications of the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth
method (PERM), a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm with resampling, to various
problems in polymer physics. PERM produces samples according to any given
prescribed weight distribution, by growing configurations step by step with
controlled bias, and correcting "bad" configurations by "population control".
The latter is implemented, in contrast to other population based algorithms
like e.g. genetic algorithms, by depth-first recursion which avoids storing all
members of the population at the same time in computer memory. The problems we
discuss all concern single polymers (with one exception), but under various
conditions: Homopolymers in good solvents and at the $\Theta$ point, semi-stiff
polymers, polymers in confining geometries, stretched polymers undergoing a
forced globule-linear transition, star polymers, bottle brushes, lattice
animals as a model for randomly branched polymers, DNA melting, and finally --
as the only system at low temperatures, lattice heteropolymers as simple models
for protein folding. PERM is for some of these problems the method of choice,
but it can also fail. We discuss how to recognize when a result is reliable,
and we discuss also some types of bias that can be crucial in guiding the
growth into the right directions.
