We investigate the classical eigenvalue problem that arises in hydrodynamics
and is referred to as the sloshing problem. It describes free liquid
oscillations in a liquid container W in R^3. We study the case when W is an
axially symmetric, convex, bounded domain satisfying the John condition. The
Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z) are chosen so that the mean free surface of the
liquid lies in (x,z)-plane and y-axis is directed upwards (y-axis is the axis
of symmetry). Our first result states that the fundamental eigenvalue has
multiplicity 2 and for each fundamental eigenfunction phi there is a change of
x,z coordinates by a rotation around y-axis so that phi is odd in x-variable.
  The second result of the paper gives the following monotonicity property of
the fundamental eigenfunction phi. If phi is odd in x-variable then it is
strictly monotonic in x-variable. This property has the following
hydrodynamical meaning. If liquid oscillates freely with fundamental frequency
according to phi then the free surface elevation of liquid is increasing along
each line parallel to x-axis during one period of time and decreasing during
the other half period. The proof of the second result is based on the method
developed by D. Jerison and N. Nadirashvili for the hot spots problem for
Neumann Laplacian.
