Suppose $X$ is a time-homogeneous diffusion on an interval $I^X \subseteq
\mathbb R$ and let $\mu$ be a probability measure on $I^X$. Then $\tau$ is a
solution of the Skorokhod embedding problem (SEP) for $\mu$ in $X$ if $\tau$ is
a stopping time and $X_\tau \sim \mu$.
  There are well-known conditions which determine whether there exists a
solution of the SEP for $\mu$ in $X$. We give necessary and sufficient
conditions for there to exist an integrable solution. Further, if there exists
a solution of the SEP then there exists a minimal solution. We show that every
minimal solution of the SEP has the same first moment.
  When $X$ is Brownian motion, every integrable embedding of $\mu$ is minimal.
However, for a general diffusion there may be integrable embeddings which are
not minimal.
