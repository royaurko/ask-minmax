This paper looks at Turing's postulations about Artificial Intelligence in
his paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', published in 1950. It notes
how accurate they were and how relevant they still are today. This paper notes
the arguments and mechanisms that he suggested and tries to expand on them
further. The paper however is mostly about describing the essential ingredients
for building an intelligent model and the problems related with that. The
discussion includes recent work by the contributor himself, who adds his own
thoughts on the matter that come from a purely technical investigation into the
problem. These are personal and quite speculative, but provide an interesting
insight into the mechanisms that might be used for building an intelligent
system.
