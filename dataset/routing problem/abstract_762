The radionuclide 161Tb (T1/2=6.89 d) is potentially important for internal
radiotherapy. It is generally produced through the 160Gd(n,{\gamma})161Gd -
161Tb route at research reactors. In this work the possibility of its
production at a cyclotron was investigated. Determination of the excitation
function of the 160Gd(d,x)161Tb production route and that of the disturbing
160Gd(d,2n)160Tb side reaction was done over the deuteron energy range up to 50
MeV using the stacked-foil technique and high-resolution gamma-ray
spectrometry. A comparison of this production route with the established
(n,\gamma) reaction at a nuclear reactor is made.
