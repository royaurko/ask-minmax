In this paper, the contributor studies quaternionic Monge-Amp\`ere equations and
obtains the existence and uniqueness of the solutions to the Dirichlet problem
for such equations without any restriction on domains. Our paper not only
answers to the open problem proposed by Semyon Alesker in [3], but also extends
relevant results in [7] to the quaternionic vector space.
