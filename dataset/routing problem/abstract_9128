We propose an alternative implementation of preconditioning techniques for
the solution of non-linear problems. Within the framework of Newton-Krylov
methods, preconditioning techniques are needed to improve the performance of
the solvers. We propose a different implementation approach to re-utilize
existing semi-implicit methods to precondition fully implicit non-linear
schemes. We propose a predictor-corrector approach where the fully non-linear
scheme is the corrector and the pre-existing semi-implicit scheme is the
predictor. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it allows to retrofit
existing codes, with only minor modifications, in particular avoiding the need
to reformulate existing methods in terms of variations, as required instead by
other approaches now currently used. To test the performance of the approach we
consider a non-linear diffusion problem and the standard driven cavity problem
for incompressible flows.
