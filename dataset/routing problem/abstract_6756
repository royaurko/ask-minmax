We characterize the price of a European option on several assets for a very
risk averse seller, in a market with small transaction costs as a solution of a
nonlinear diffusion equation. This problem turns out to be one of asymptotic
analysis of parabolic PDE, and the interesting feature is the role of a
nonlinear PDE eigenvalue problem. In particular, we generalize previous work of
Guy Barles and H. Mete Soner who studied this problem for a European option on
a single asset.
