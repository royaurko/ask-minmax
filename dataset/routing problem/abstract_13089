Garside calculus is the common mechanism that underlies a certain type of
normal form for the elements of a monoid, a group, or a category. Originating
from Garside's approach to Artin's braid groups, it has been extended to more
and more general contexts, the latest one being that of categories and what are
called Garside families. One of the benefits of this theory is to lead to
algorithms solving effectively the naturally occurring problems, typically the
Word Problem. The aim of this paper is to present and solve these algorithmic
questions in the new extended framework.
