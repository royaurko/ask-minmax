This paper deals with nonnegative solutions of the one dimensional degenerate
parabolic equations with zero homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. To
obtain an existence result, we prove a sharp gradient estimate of |u_x|.
Besides, we investigate the behaviors of nonnegative solutions such as the
quenching phenomenon, and the finite speed of propagation. Our results of the
Dirichlet problem will be extended to the associated Cauchy problem. In
addition, we show that the phenomenon of the instantaneous shrinking of compact
support of the nonnegative solutions occurs if f satisfies some growth
condition.
