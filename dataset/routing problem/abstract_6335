We study the inverse problem for the second order self-adjoint hyperbolic
equation with the boundary data given on a part of the boundary. This paper is
the continuation of the contributor's paper [E]. In [E] we presented the crucial
local step of the proof. In this paper we prove the global step. Our method is
a modification of the BC-method with some new ideas. In particular, the way of
the determination of the metric is new.
