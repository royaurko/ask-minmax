We prove that the number of cyclically symmetric, self-complementary plane
partitions contained in a cube of side $2n$ equals the square of the number of
totally symmetric, self-complementary plane partitions contained in the same
cube, without explicitly evaluating either of these numbers. This appears to be
the first direct proof of this fact. The problem of finding such a proof was
suggested by Stanley.
