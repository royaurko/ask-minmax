The significance of having detected an astrophysical gamma ray source is
usually calculated by means of a formula derived by Li & Ma in 1983. We solve
the same problem in terms of Bayesian statistics, which provides a logically
more satisfactory framework. We do not use any subjective elements in the
present version of Bayesian statistics. We show that for large count numbers
and a weak source the Li & Ma formula agrees with the Bayesian result. For
other cases the two results differ, both due to the mathematically different
treatment and the fact that only Bayesian inference can take into account prior
knowldege.
