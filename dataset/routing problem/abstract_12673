We revisit the problem of calculating the probability current for
discontinuous states, such that may arise in atom trapping or as a result of
projective measurements. In the first passage time representation, the problem
reduces to evaluation of a localised wave originating from the discontinuity,
whose interference with the initial state determines the transfer of
probability. Depending on the type of discontinuity, the current behaves as
$t^{1/2}$, $t^{3/2}$ or $const(t)$. Our approach generalises earlier work on
this subject.
