The relation between self awareness and intelligence is an open problem these
days. Despite the fact that self awarness is usually related to Emotional
Intelligence, this is not the case here. The problem described in this paper is
how to model an agent which knows (Cognitive) Binary Logic and which is also
able to pass (without any mistake) a certain family of Turing Tests designed to
verify its knowledge and its discourse about the modal states of truth
corresponding to well-formed formulae within the language of Propositional
Binary Logic.
