We study the kernelizability of a class of NP-hard graph modification
problems based on vertex degree properties. Our main positive results refer to
NP-hard graph completion (that is, edge addition) cases while we show that
there is no hope to achieve analogous results for the corresponding vertex or
edge deletion versions. Our algorithms are based on a method that transforms
graph completion problems into efficiently solvable number problems and
exploits f-factor computations for translating the results back into the graph
setting. Indeed, our core observation is that we encounter a win-win situation
in the sense that either the number of edge additions is small (and thus faster
to find) or the problem is polynomial- time solvable. This approach helps in
answering an open question by Mathieson and Szeider [JCSS 2012].
