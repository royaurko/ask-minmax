Deformed Special Relativity is usually presented as a deformation of Special
Relativity accommodating a new universal constant, the Planck mass, while
respecting the relativity principle. In order to avoid some fundamental
problems (e.g. soccer ball problem), we argue that we should switch point of
view and consider instead the Newton constant $G$ as the universal constant.
