We demonstrate that the flow of a longitudinal spin current with different
spin polarization will induce different patterns of charge accumulation in a
two-terminal strip, or electric current distribution in a four-terminal
Hall-bar structure, of two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit
coupling (RSOC). For an in-plane polarized spin current, charges will
accumulate either by the two lateral edges or around the center of the strip
structure while, for an out-of-plain polarized spin current, charge densities
will show opposite signs by the two lateral edges leading to a Hall voltage.
Our calculation offers a new route to experimentally detect or differentiate
pure spin currents with various spin polarization.
