Isotropic cosmology built in the framework of the Poincar\'e gauge theory of
gravity based on sufficiently general expression of gravitational Lagrangian is
considered. The derivation of cosmological equations and equations for torsion
functions in the case of the most general homogeneous isotropic models is
given. Physical aspects of isotropic cosmology connected with possible solution
of dark energy problem and problem of cosmological singularity are discussed.
