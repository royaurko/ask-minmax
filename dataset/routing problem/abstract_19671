This paper presents a new architecture called FAIS for imple- menting
intelligent agents cooperating in a special Multi Agent environ- ment, namely
the RoboCup Rescue Simulation System. This is a layered architecture which is
customized for solving fire extinguishing problem. Structural decision making
algorithms are combined with heuristic ones in this model, so it's a hybrid
architecture.
