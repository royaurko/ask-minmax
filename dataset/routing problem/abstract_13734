We consider the problem of counting (stable) equilibriums of an important
family of algebraic differential equations modeling multistable biological
regulatory systems. The problem can be solved, in principle, using real
quantifier elimination algorithms, in particular real root classification
algorithms. However, it is well known that they can handle only very small
cases due to the enormous computing time requirements. In this paper, we
present a special algorithm which is much more efficient than the general
methods. Its efficiency comes from the exploitation of certain interesting
structures of the family of differential equations.
