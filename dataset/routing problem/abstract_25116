In this work, we study the problem of power allocation in teams. Each team
consists of two agents who try to split their available power between the tasks
of communication and jamming the nodes of the other team. The agents have
constraints on their total energy and instantaneous power usage. The cost
function is the difference between the rates of erroneously transmitted bits of
each team. We model the problem as a zero-sum differential game between the two
teams and use {\it{Isaacs'}} approach to obtain the necessary conditions for
the optimal trajectories. This leads to a continuous-kernel power allocation
game among the players. Based on the communications model, we present
sufficient conditions on the physical parameters of the agents for the
existence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE). Finally, we present
simulation results for the case when the agents are holonomic.
