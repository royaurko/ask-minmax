The mode coupling theory (MCT) of glasses, while offering an incomplete
description of glass transition physics, represents the only established route
to first-principles prediction of rheological behavior in nonergodic materials
such as colloidal glasses. However, the constitutive equations derivable from
MCT are somewhat intractable, hindering their practical use and also their
interpretation. Here, we present a schematic (single-mode) MCT model which
incorporates the tensorial structure of the full theory. Using it, we calculate
the dynamic yield surface for a large class of flows.
