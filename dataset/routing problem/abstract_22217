Let $\Sigma$ be a hypersurface in an $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$,
$n\geqslant 2$. We study the isometric extension problem for isometric
immersions $f:\Sigma\to\mathbb R^n$, where $\mathbb R^n$ is equipped with the
Euclidean standard metric. Using a weak form of convex integration suggested by
Sz\'ekelyhidi, we construct "one-sided" isometric Lipschitz-extensions and
obtain an accompanying density result.
