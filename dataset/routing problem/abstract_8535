We develop a new discrete mathematical model which includes the classical
Sudoku puzzle, Latin Squares and gerechte designs. This problem is described by
integer equations and a special type of inequality constraint. We consider
solutions of this generalized problem and derive a necessary condition on these
solutions. The results are illustrated with examples.
