We demonstrate that the method of coupled Gaussian wave packets is a
full-fledged alternative to direct numerical solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation of condensates with electromagnetically induced attractive 1/r
interaction, or with dipole-dipole interaction. Moreover, Gaussian wave packets
are superior in that they are capable of producing both stable and unstable
stationary solutions, and thus of giving access to yet unexplored regions of
the space of solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We apply the method to
clarify the theoretical nature of the collapse mechanism of blood-cell shaped
dipolar condensates: On the route to collapse the condensate passes through a
pitchfork bifurcation, where the ground state itself turns unstable, before it
finally vanishes in a tangent bifurcation.
