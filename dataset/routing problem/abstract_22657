Infants face the difficult problem of segmenting continuous speech into words
without the benefit of a fully developed lexicon. Several sources of
information in speech might help infants solve this problem, including prosody,
semantic correlations and phonotactics. Research to date has focused on
determining to which of these sources infants might be sensitive, but little
work has been done to determine the potential usefulness of each source. The
computer simulations reported here are a first attempt to measure the
usefulness of distributional and phonotactic information in segmenting phoneme
sequences. The algorithms hypothesize different segmentations of the input into
words and select the best hypothesis according to the Minimum Description
Length principle. Our results indicate that while there is some useful
information in both phoneme distributions and phonotactic rules, the
combination of both sources is most useful.
