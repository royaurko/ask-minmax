We study the asymptotic behaviour of occupation times of a transient random
walk in quenched random environment on a strip in a sub-diffusive regime. The
asymptotic behaviour of hitting times, which is a more traditional object of
study, is the exactly same. As a particular case, we solve a long standing
problem of describing the asymptotic behaviour of a random walk with bounded
jumps on a one-dimensional lattice
