In this paper, we consider the diffusive competition problem with a free
boundary and sign-changing intrinsic growth rate in heterogeneous time-periodic
environment, consisting of an invasive species with density $u$ and a native
species with density $v$. We assume that $v$ undergoes diffusion and growth in
$R^{N}$ , and $u$ exists initially in a ball $B_{h_0}(0)$, but invades into the
environment with spreading front $\{r = h(t)\}$. The effect of the dispersal
rate $d_1$, the initial occupying habitat $h_0$, the initial density $u_0$ of
invasive species $u$, and the parameter $\mu$ (see (1.3)) on the dynamics of
this free boundary problem are studied. A spreading-vanishing dichotomy is
obtained and some sufficient conditions for the invasive species spreading and
vanishing are provided. Moreover, when spreading of $u$ happens, some rough
estimates of the spreading speed are also given.
