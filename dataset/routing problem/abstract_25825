In this paper, we are interested in the spectral properties of the
generalised principal eigenvalue of some nonlocal operator. That is, we look
for the existence of some particular solution $(\lambda,\phi)$ of a nonlocal
operator. $$\int_{\O}K(x,y)\phi(y)\, dy +a(x)\phi(x) =-\lambda \phi(x),$$ where
$\O\subset\R^n$ is an open bounded connected set, $K$ a nonnegative kernel and
$a$ is continuous. We prove that for the generalised principal eigenvalue
$\lambda_p:=\sup \{\lambda \in \R \, |\, \exists \, \phi \in C(\O), \phi > 0
\;\text{so that}\; \oplb{\phi}{\O}+ a(x)\phi + \lambda\phi\le 0\}$ there exists
always a solution $(\mu, \lambda_p)$ of the problem in the space of signed
measure. Moreover $\mu$ a positive measure. When $\mu$ is absolutely continuous
with respect to the Lebesgue measure, $\mu =\phi_p(x)$ is called the principal
eigenfunction associated to $\lambda_p$. In some simple cases, we exhibit some
explicit singular measures that are solutions of the spectral problem.
