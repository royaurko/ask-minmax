Numerical simulation is an important tool to help us understand the process
of structure formation in the universe. However many simulation results of cold
dark matter (CDM) halos on small scale are inconsistent with observations: the
central density profile is too cuspy and there are too many substructures. Here
we point out that these two problems may be connected with a hitherto
unrecognized bias in the simulation halos. Although CDM halos in nature and in
simulation are both virialized systems of collisionless CDM particles,
gravitational encounter cannot be neglected in the simulation halos because
they contain much less particles. We demonstrate this by two numerical
experiments, showing that there is a difference on the microcosmic scale
between the natural and simulation halos. The simulation halo is more akin to
globular clusters where gravitational encounter is known to lead to such
drastic phenomena as core collapse. And such artificial core collapse process
appears to link the two problems together in the bottom-up scenario of
structure formation in the $\Lambda$CDM universe. The discovery of this bias
also has implications on the applicability of the Jeans Theorem in Galactic
Dynamics.
