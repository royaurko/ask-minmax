The $k$-vertex disjoint paths problem is one of the most studied problems in
algorithmic graph theory. In 1994, Schrijver proved that the problem can be
solved in polynomial time for every fixed $k$ when restricted to the class of
planar digraphs and it was a long standing open question whether it is
fixed-parameter tractable (with respect to parameter $k$) on this restricted
class. Only recently, \cite{CMPP}.\ achieved a major breakthrough and answered
the question positively. Despite the importance of this result (and the
brilliance of their proof), it is of rather theoretical importance. Their proof
technique is both technically extremely involved and also has at least double
exponential parameter dependence. Thus, it seems unrealistic that the algorithm
could actually be implemented. In this paper, therefore, we study a smaller
class of planar digraphs, the class of upward planar digraphs, a well studied
class of planar graphs which can be drawn in a plane such that all edges are
drawn upwards. We show that on the class of upward planar digraphs the problem
(i) remains NP-complete and (ii) the problem is fixed-parameter tractable.
While membership in FPT follows immediately from \cite{CMPP}'s general result,
our algorithm has only single exponential parameter dependency compared to the
double exponential parameter dependence for general planar digraphs.
Furthermore, our algorithm can easily be implemented, in contrast to the
algorithm in \cite{CMPP}.
