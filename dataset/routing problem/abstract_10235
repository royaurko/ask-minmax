The Single Allocation Ordered Median Hub Location problem is a recent hub
model introduced in Puerto et al. (2011) that provides a unifying analysis of a
wide class of hub location mod- els. In this paper, we deal with the
capacitated version of this problem, presenting two formulations as well as
some preprocessing phases for fixing variables. In addition, a strengthening of
one of these formulations is also studied through the use of some fami- lies of
valid inequalities. A battery of test problems with data taken from the AP
library are solved where it is shown that the running times have been
significantly reduced with the improvements presented in the paper.
