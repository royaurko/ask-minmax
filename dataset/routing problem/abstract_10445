We comment on the Lee-Yang zero analysis for the study of the phase structure
of QCD at high temperature and baryon number density by Monte-Carlo
simulations. We find that the sign problem for non-zero density QCD induces a
serious problem in the finite volume scaling analysis of the Lee-Yang zeros for
the investigation of the order of the phase transition. If the sign problem
occurs at large volume, the Lee-Yang zeros will always approach the real axis
of the complex parameter plane in the thermodynamic limit. This implies that a
scaling behavior which would suggest a crossover transition will not be
obtained. To clarify this problem, we discuss the Lee-Yang zero analysis for
SU(3) pure gauge theory as a simple example without the sign problem, and then
consider the case of non-zero density QCD. It is suggested that the
distribution of the Lee-Yang zeros in the complex parameter space obtained by
each simulation could be more important information for the investigation of
the critical endpoint in the $(T, \mu_q)$ plane than the finite volume scaling
behavior.
