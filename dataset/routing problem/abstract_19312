The Owens Valley Radio Observatory 40 meter telescope is currently monitoring
a sample of about 1700 blazars every three days at 15 GHz, with the main
scientific goal of determining the relation between the variability of blazars
at radio and gamma-rays as observed with the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.
The time domain relation between radio and gamma-ray emission, in particular
its correlation and time lag, can help us determine the location of the
high-energy emission site in blazars, a current open question in blazar
research. To achieve this goal, continuous observation of a large sample of
blazars in a time scale of less than a week is indispensable. Since we only
look at bright targets, the time available for target observations is mostly
limited by source observability, calibration requirements and slewing of the
telescope. Here I describe the implementation of a practical solution to this
scheduling, calibration, and slewing time minimization problem. This solution
combines ideas from optimization, in particular the traveling salesman problem,
with astronomical and instrumental constraints. A heuristic solution using well
stablished optimization techniques and astronomical insights particular to this
situation, allow us to observe all the sources in the required three days
cadence while obtaining reliable calibration of the radio flux densities.
Problems of this nature will only be more common in the future and the ideas
presented here can be relevant for other observing programs.
