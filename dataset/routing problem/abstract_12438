We present a strategy for solving time-dependent problems on grids with local
refinements in time using different time steps in different regions of space.
We discuss and analyze two conservative approximations based on finite volume
with piecewise constant projections and domain decomposition techniques. Next
we present an iterative method for solving the composite-grid system that
reduces to solution of standard problems with standard time stepping on the
coarse and fine grids. At every step of the algorithm, conservativity is
ensured. Finally, numerical results illustrate the accuracy of the proposed
methods.
