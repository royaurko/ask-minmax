We repeat the numerical experiments for diffusion limited aggregation (DLA)
and show that there is a potentially infinite set of conserved quantities for
the long time asymptotics. We connect these observations with the exact
integrability of the continuum limit of the DLA (quasi-static Stefan problem).
The conserved quantities of the Stefan problem (harmonic moments) when
discretized are our conserved quantities. These numerical experiments show that
the exact integrability of the Stefan problem may be continued beyond the
formation of cusps in the moving boundary.
