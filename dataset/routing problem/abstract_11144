The paper is devoted to the problem of mapping affine loop nests onto
distributed memory parallel computers. A method to find affine transformations
of loop nests for parallel execution and distribution of data over processors
is presented. The method tends to minimize the number of communications between
processors and to improve locality of data within one processor. A problem of
determination of data exchange sequence is investigated. Conditions to
determine the ability to arrange broadcast is presented.
