Low-mass stars play a key role in many different areas of astrophysics. In
this article, I provide a brief overview of the evolution of low-mass stars,
and discuss some of the uncertainties and problems currently affecting low-mass
stellar models. Emphasis is placed on the following topics: the solar abundance
problem, mass loss on the red giant branch, and the level of helium enrichment
associated to the multiple populations that are present in globular clusters.
