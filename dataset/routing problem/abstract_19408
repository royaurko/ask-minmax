Continued demand for accurate and computationally efficient transport methods
to solve optically thick, fixed-source transport problems has inspired research
on variance-reduction (VR) techniques for Monte Carlo (MC). Methods that use
deterministic results to create VR maps for MC constitute a dominant branch of
this research, with Forward Weighted-Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance
Sampling (FW-CADIS) being a particularly successful example. However, locations
in which energy and spatial self-shielding are combined, such as thin plates
embedded in concrete, challenge FW-CADIS. In these cases the deterministic flux
cannot appropriately capture transport behavior, and the associated VR
parameters result in high variance in and following the plate.
  This work presents a new method that improves performance in transport
calculations that contain regions of combined space and energy self-shielding
without significant impact on the solution quality in other parts of the
problem. This method is based on FW-CADIS and applies a Resonance Factor
correction to the adjoint source. The impact of the Resonance Factor method is
investigated in this work through an example problem. It is clear that this new
method dramatically improves performance in terms of lowering the maximum 95%
confidence interval relative error and reducing the compute time. Based on this
work, we recommend that the Resonance Factor method be used when the accuracy
of the solution in the presence of combined space and energy self-shielding is
important.
