We give an improved analysis of the simple $D^2$-sampling based PTAS for the
$k$-means clustering problem given by Jaiswal, Kumar, and Sen (Algorithmica,
2013). The improvement on the running time is from $O\left(nd \cdot
2^{\tilde{O}(k^2/\epsilon)}\right)$ to $O\left(nd \cdot
2^{\tilde{O}(k/\epsilon)}\right)$.
