We provide a compactness principle which is applicable to different
formulations of Plateau's problem in codimension one and which is exclusively
based on the theory of Radon measures and elementary comparison arguments.
Exploiting some additional techniques in geometric measure theory, we can use
this principle to give a different proof of a theorem by Harrison and Pugh and
to answer a question raised by Guy David.
