Network coding has proved its efficiency in increasing the network
performance for traditional ad-hoc networks. In this paper, we investigate
using network coding for enhancing the throughput of multi-hop cognitive radio
networks. We formulate the network coding throughput maximization problem as a
graph theory problem, where different constraints and primary users'
characteristics are mapped to the graph structure. We then show that the
optimal solution to this problem in NP-hard and propose a heuristic algorithm
to efficiently solve it.
  Evaluation of the proposed algorithm through NS2 simulations shows that we
can increase the throughput of the constrained secondary users' network by
150\% to 200\% for a wide range of scenarios covering different primary users'
densities, traffic loads, and spectrum availability.
