In this paper we turn the spotlight on a class of lexicographic ranking
functions introduced by Bradley, Manna and Sipma in a seminal CAV 2005 paper,
and establish for the first time the complexity of some problems involving the
inference of such functions for linear-constraint loops (without precondition).
We show that finding such a function, if one exists, can be done in polynomial
time in a way which is sound and complete when the variables range over the
rationals (or reals). We show that when variables range over the integers, the
problem is harder -- deciding the existence of a ranking function is
coNP-complete. Next, we study the problem of minimizing the number of
components in the ranking function (a.k.a. the dimension). This number is
interesting in contexts like computing iteration bounds and loop
parallelization. Surprisingly, and unlike the situation for some other classes
of lexicographic ranking functions, we find that even deciding whether a
two-component ranking function exists is harder than the unrestricted problem:
NP-complete over the rationals and $\Sigma^P_2$-complete over the integers.
