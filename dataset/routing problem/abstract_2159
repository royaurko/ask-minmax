We review the case for testing preferred acceleration scale theories of
gravity (sometimes falling under the guise of MOdified Newtonian Dynamics) in
the Solar System using the forthcoming LISA Pathfinder (LPF) mission. Using a
combination of analytical and numerical results, we suggest that different
types of theory should be detectable using the predicted anomalous tidal
stresses effects around the saddle points of the Newtonian gravitational field.
The saddle point bubbles expected extent of $\sim 400$ km are to be contrasted
with potential miss parameters of $\leq 10$ km, making such a test in easy
reach of LPF. We also consider routes to constraining our theories from data,
based on scenarios of both null and positive results.
