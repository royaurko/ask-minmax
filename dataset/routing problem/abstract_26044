Sometimes it becomes a matter of natural choice for an observer (A) that he
prefers a coordinate system of two-dimensional spatial x-y coordinates from
which he observes another observer (B) who is moving at a uniform speed along a
line of motion, which is not collinear with As chosen x or y axis. It becomes
necessary in such cases to develop Lorentz transformations where the line of
motion is not aligned with either the x or the y-axis. In this paper we develop
these transformations and show that under such transformations, two orthogonal
systems (in their respective frames) appear non-orthogonal to each other. We
also illustrate the usefulness of the transformation by applying it to three
problems including the rod-slot problem. The derivation has been done before
using vector algebra. Such derivations assume that the axes of K and K-prime
are parallel. Our method uses matrix algebra and shows that the axes of K and
K-prime do not remain parallel, and in fact K and K-prime which are properly
orthogonal are observed to be non-orthogonal by K-prime and K respectively.
