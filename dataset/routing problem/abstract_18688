List accessing problem has been studied as a problem of significant
theoretical and practical interest in the context of linear search. Various
list accessing algorithms have been proposed in the literature and their
performances have been analyzed theoretically and experimentally.
Move-To-Front(MTF),Transpose (TRANS) and Frequency Count (FC) are the three
primitive and widely used list accessing algorithms. Most of the other list
accessing algorithms are the variants of these three algorithms. As mentioned
in the literature as an open problem, direct bounds on the behavior and
performance of these list accessing algorithms are needed to allow realistic
comparisons. MTF has been proved to be the best performing online algorithm
till date in the literature for real life inputs with locality of reference.
Motivated by the above challenging research issue, in this paper, we have
generated four types of input request sequences corresponding to real life
inputs without locality of reference. Using these types of request sequences,
we have made an analytical study for evaluating the performance of MTF list
accessing algorithm to obtain some novel and interesting theoretical results.
