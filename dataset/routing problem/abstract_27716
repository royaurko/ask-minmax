It is known that a $C_0$-group provides the Cauchy problem solution for the
evolution partial differential equation with the evolution operator equal to
the infinitesimal generator of the group. Using the Chernoff theorem one
obtains the $C_0$-group (and thus solves the Cauchy problem) via finding the
appropriate family of integral operators. The solution then is given in a form
of a Feynman formula, i.e. it is represented as a limit of a multiple integral
when the multiplicity tends to infinity.
  In this paper we sufficiently extend the set of appropriate families for the
Schr\"odinger equation and introduce quasi-Feynman formulas, a new class of
integral representations of a function. Both Feynman formulas and quasi-Feynman
formulas approximate Feynman path integrals. The technique presented works for
a large class of Hamiltonians describing dynamics in a large class of
configuration spaces and opens some challenging questions. We discuss the
advantages and limitations of this new approach and evaluate one simple model
example of its application.
