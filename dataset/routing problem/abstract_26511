We consider the rates of noise-induced switching between the stable states of
dissipative dynamical systems with delay and also the rates of noise-induced
extinction, where such systems model population dynamics. We study a class of
systems where the evolution depends on the dynamical variables at a preceding
time with a fixed time delay, which we call hard delay. For weak noise, the
rates of inter-attractor switching and extinction are exponentially small.
Finding these rates to logarithmic accuracy is reduced to variational problems.
The solutions of the variational problems give the most probable paths followed
in switching or extinction. We show that the equations for the most probable
paths are acausal and formulate the appropriate boundary conditions. Explicit
general results are obtained for small delay compared to the relaxation rate.
We also develop a direct variational method to find the rates. We find that the
analytical results agree well with the numerical simulations for both switching
and extinction rates.
