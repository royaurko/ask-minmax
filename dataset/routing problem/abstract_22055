We study the evolution equations for a regularized version of Dirac-harmonic
maps from closed Riemannian surfaces. We establish the existence of a global
weak solution for the regularized problem, which is smooth away from finitely
many singularities. Moreover, we discuss the convergence of the evolution
equations and address the question if we can remove the regularization in the
end.
