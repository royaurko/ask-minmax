We discuss two problems which are particularly challenging for approximations
in time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to capture:
momentum-distributions in ionization processes, and memory-dependence in
real-time dynamics. We propose an extension of TDDFT to phase-space densities,
discuss some formal aspects of such a "phase-space density functional theory"
and explain why it could ameliorate the problems in both cases. For each
problem, a two-electron model system is exactly numerically solved and analysed
in phase-space via the Wigner function distribution.
