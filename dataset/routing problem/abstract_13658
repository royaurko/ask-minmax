The phase retrieval problem has a long history and is an important problem in
many areas of optics. Theoretical understanding of phase retrieval is still
limited and fundamental questions such as uniqueness and stability of the
recovered solution are not yet fully understood. This paper provides several
additions to the theoretical understanding of sparse phase retrieval. In
particular we show that if the measurement ensemble can be chosen freely, as
few as 4k-1 phaseless measurements suffice to guarantee uniqueness of a
k-sparse M-dimensional real solution. We also prove that 2(k^2-k+1) Fourier
magnitude measurements are sufficient under rather general conditions.
