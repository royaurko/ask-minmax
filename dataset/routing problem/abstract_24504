In this paper the coupling between dark energy and the other components of
the cosmological fluid has been studied. Firstly, it will be shown that the
application of general cosmological equations, deduced by the contributors in a
previous work, to the known data of the Abell cluster A586 using the
Layzer-Irvine theory gives similar results compared to the work of other
contributors. The aforesaid method present some problems: the application of an
approximate theory (Layzer-Irvine theory), it has only one experimental datum
and finally, it gives results that are a bit difficult to admit considering a
physical reasoning. In order to avoid the above-mentioned problems, a way to
study the coupling of dark energy with other Universe components has been
shown. The results obtained have a sensible physical behavior. They also fix
the required functionality of the product $w_\Lambda \Omega_\Lambda$ in order
to verify the main known properties of the Universe's behavior. Finally, these
results permit to make predictions about a set of different cosmological
properties.
