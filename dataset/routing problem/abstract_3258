We consider two problems that have vexed physicists for several decades --
dark matter and the cosmological constant. The problem has been that the former
has not been detected while the latter gives a far higher value than detected
by observation. We argue that a time varying gravitational constant obviates
the former problem, while the latter problem can be circumvented by considering
the average density of the universe.
