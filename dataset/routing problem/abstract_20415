We consider two situations that can be modeled by oscillators. First we show
that the universe itself is a normal mode of Planck scale oscillators. Next we
show that a background Zero Point Field or dark energy can be modeled by
electromagnetic oscillators. This in turn leads to an observable
"fluctuational" current in a solenoid.
