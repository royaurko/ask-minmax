We give effectivized Holder-logarithmic energy and regularity dependent
stability estimates for the Gel'fand inverse boundary value problem in
dimension $d=3$. This effectivization includes explicit dependance of the
estimates on coefficient norms and related parameters. Our new estimates are
given in $L^2$ and $L^\infty$ norms for the coefficient difference and related
stability efficiently increases with increasing energy and/or coefficient
difference regularity. Comparisons with preceeding results are given.
