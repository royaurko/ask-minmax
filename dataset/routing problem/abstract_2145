Time perception is essential for task switching, and in the mammalian brain
appears alongside other processes. Memristors are electronic components used as
synapses and as models for neurons. The d.c. response of memristors can be
considered as a type of short-term memory. Interactions of the memristor d.c.
response within networks of memristors leads to the emergence of oscillatory
dynamics and intermittent spike trains, which are similar to neural dynamics.
Based on this data, the structure of a memristor network control for a robot as
it undergoes task switching is discussed and it is suggested that these
emergent network dynamics could improve the performance of role switching and
learning in an artificial intelligence and perhaps create artificial time
perception.
