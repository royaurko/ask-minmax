We investigate the multiplicity of nontrivial weak solutions for a class of
complex equations. This class of problems are related with the existence of
solitary waves for a nonlinear Sch\"{o}dinger equation. The main result is
established by using minimax methods and Lusternik-Schnirelman theory of
critical points.
