Carbon nanoribbons (CNRs) are graphene (planar) structures with large aspect
ratio. Carbon nanobelts (CNBs) are small graphene nanoribbons rolled up into
spiral-like structures, i. e., carbon nanoscrolls (CNSs) with large aspect
ratio. In this work we investigated the energetics and dynamical aspects of
CNBs formed from rolling up CNRs. We have carried out molecular dynamics
simulations using reactive empirical bond-order potentials. Our results show
that similarly to CNSs, CNBs formation is dominated by two major energy
contribution, the increase in the elastic energy due to the bending of the
initial planar configuration (decreasing structural stability) and the
energetic gain due to van der Waals interactions of the overlapping surface of
the rolled layers (increasing structural stability). Beyond a critical diameter
value these scrolled structures can be even more stable (in terms of energy)
than their equivalent planar configurations. In contrast to CNSs that require
energy assisted processes (sonication, chemical reactions, etc.) to be formed,
CNBs can be spontaneously formed from low temperature driven processes. Long
CNBs (length of $\sim$ 30.0 nm) tend to exhibit self-folded racket-like
conformations with formation dynamics very similar to the one observed for long
carbon nanotubes. Shorter CNBs will be more likely to form perfect scrolled
structures. Possible synthetic routes to fabricate CNBs from graphene membranes
are also addressed.
