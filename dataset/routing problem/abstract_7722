In this paper, we consider the problem of designing DNA sequences (codewords)
for DNA storage systems and DNA computing that are unlikely to fold back onto
themselves to form undesirable secondary structures. The paper addresses both
the issue of enumerating the sequences with such properties and the problem of
practical code construction.
