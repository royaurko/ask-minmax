Let $K$ be a field of characteristic not two and $K(x,y,z)$ the rational
function field over $K$ with three variables $x,y,z$. Let $G$ be a finite group
of acting on $K(x,y,z)$ by monomial $K$-automorphisms. We consider the
rationality problem of the fixed field $K(x,y,z)^G$ under the action of $G$,
namely whether $K(x,y,z)^G$ is rational (that is, purely transcendental) over
$K$ or not. We may assume that $G$ is a subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}(3,\mathbb{Z})
and the problem is determined up to conjugacy in $\mathrm{GL}(3,\mathbb{Z})$.
There are 73 conjugacy classes of $G$ in $\mathrm{GL}(3,\mathbb{Z})$. By
results of Endo-Miyata, Voskresenski\u\i, Lenstra, Saltman, Hajja, Kang and
Yamasaki, 8 conjugacy classes of 2-groups in $\mathrm{GL}(3,\mathbb{Z})$ have
negative answers to the problem under certain monomial actions over some base
field $K$, and the necessary and sufficient condition for the rationality of
$K(x,y,z)^G$ over $K$ is given. In this paper, we show that the fixed field
$K(x,y,z)^G$ under monomial action of $G$ is rational over $K$ except for
possibly negative 8 cases of 2-groups and unknown one case of the alternating
group of degree four. Moreover we give explicit transcendental bases of the
fixed fields over $K$. For unknown case, we obtain an affirmative solution to
the problem under some conditions. In particular, we show that if $K$ is
quadratically closed field then $K(x,y,z)^G$ is rational over $K$. We also give
an application of the result to 4-dimensional linear Noether's problem.
