We give a detailed treatment of the ``bit-model'' of computability and
complexity of real functions and subsets of R^n, and argue that this is a good
way to formalize many problems of scientific computation. In the introduction
we also discuss the alternative Blum-Shub-Smale model. In the final section we
discuss the issue of whether physical systems could defeat the Church-Turing
Thesis.
