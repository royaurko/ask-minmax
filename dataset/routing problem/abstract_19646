We solve a problem of non-convex stochastic optimisation with help of
simulated annealing of Levy flights of a variable stability index. The search
of the ground state of an unknown potential is non-local due to big jumps of
the Levy flights process. The convergence to the ground state is fast due to a
polynomial decrease rate of the temperature.
