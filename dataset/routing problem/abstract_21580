We provide a given algebraic structure with the structure of an infinitesimal
algebraic skeleton. The necessary conditions for integrability of the absolute
parallelism of a tower with such a skeleton are dispersive nonlinear models and
related conservation laws given in the form of associated linear spectral
problems.
