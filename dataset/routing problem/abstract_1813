Over the Internet today, computing and communications environments are
significantly more complex and chaotic than classical distributed systems,
lacking any centralized organization or hierarchical control. There has been
much interest in emerging Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network overlays because they
provide a good substrate for creating large-scale data sharing, content
distribution and application-level multicast applications. In this paper we
present DistHash, a P2P overlay network designed to share large sets of
replicated distributed objects in the context of large-scale highly dynamic
infrastructures. We present original solutions to achieve optimal message
routing in hop-count and throughput, provide an adequate consistency approach
among replicas, as well as provide a fault-tolerant substrate.
