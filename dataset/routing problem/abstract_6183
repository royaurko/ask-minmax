We study the isomorphic implication problem for Boolean constraints. We show
that this is a natural analog of the subgraph isomorphism problem. We prove
that, depending on the set of constraints, this problem is in P, NP-complete,
or NP-hard, coNP-hard, and in parallel access to NP. We show how to extend the
NP-hardness and coNP-hardness to hardness for parallel access to NP for some
cases, and conjecture that this can be done in all cases.
