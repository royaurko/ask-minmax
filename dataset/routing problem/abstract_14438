Renegar's condition number is a data-driven computational complexity measure
for convex programs, generalizing classical condition numbers in linear
systems. We provide evidence that for a broad class of compressed sensing
problems, the worst case value of this algorithmic complexity measure taken
over all signals matches the restricted eigenvalue of the observation matrix,
which controls compressed sensing performance. This means that, in these
problems, a single parameter directly controls computational complexity and
recovery performance.
