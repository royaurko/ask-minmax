For any Thurston map with exactly four postcritical points, we present an
algorithm to compute the Weil-Petersson boundary values of the corresponding
Thurston pullback map. This procedure is carried out for the Thurston map
f(z)=3z^2/(2z^3+1) originally studied by Buff, et al. The dynamics of this
boundary map are investigated and used to solve the analogue of Hubbard's
Twisted Rabbit problem for f.
