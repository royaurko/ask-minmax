We present a prototype tool for automated reasoning for Coalition Logic, a
non-normal modal logic that can be used for reasoning about cooperative agency.
The theorem prover CLProver is based on recent work on a resolution-based
calculus for Coalition Logic that operates on coalition problems, a normal form
for Coalition Logic. We provide an overview of coalition problems and of the
resolution-based calculus for Coalition Logic. We then give details of the
implementation of CLProver and present the results for a comparison with an
existing tableau-based solver.
