Observations of the explosions of Population III (Pop III) stars have the
potential to teach us much about the formation and evolution of these
zero-metallicity objects. To realize this potential, we must tie observed
emission to an explosion model, which requires accurate light curve and spectra
calculations. Here, we discuss many of the pitfalls and problems involved in
such models, presenting some preliminary results from radiation-hydrodynamics
simulations.
