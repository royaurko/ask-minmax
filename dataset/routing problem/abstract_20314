In a previous paper, "Generalized Green functions and unipotent classes for
finite reductive groups, I", we have determined certain unknown scalars
involved in the algorithm of computing generalized Green functions in the case
of SL_n. In this paper, we consider a similar problem for the case of classical
groups Sp_{2n}, SO_N with arbitrary characteristic. Our result enables us, in
particular, to compute Green functions in bad characteristic case, which was
not known before.
