We consider differential equations driven by rough paths and study the
regularity of the laws and their long time behavior. In particular, we focus on
the case when the driving noise is a rough path valued fractional Brownian
motion with Hurst parameter $H\in(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2}]$. Our contribution
in this work is twofold. First, when the driving vector fields satisfy
H\"{o}rmander's celebrated "Lie bracket condition," we derive explicit
quantitative bounds on the inverse of the Malliavin matrix. En route to this,
we provide a novel "deterministic" version of Norris's lemma for differential
equations driven by rough paths. This result, with the added assumption that
the linearized equation has moments, will then yield that the transition laws
have a smooth density with respect to Lebesgue measure. Our second main result
states that under H\"{o}rmander's condition, the solutions to rough
differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion with
$H\in(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2}]$ enjoy a suitable version of the strong Feller
property. Under a standard controllability condition, this implies that they
admit a unique stationary solution that is physical in the sense that it does
not "look into the future."
