We discuss a few tightly connected problems, such as the $U(1)$ problem,
confinement, the $\theta$ -dependence within a framework of the dynamical toron
approach. We calculate two fundamental characteristics of the theory: the
vacuum expectation value (vev) of the Wilson loop and the topological
susceptibility. The analogy with well known 2+1 dimensional QED which exhibits
confinement phenomenon is also discussed.
