We address some questions related to radiation and energy conservation in
classical electromagnetism. We first treat the well-known problem of energy
accounting during radiation from a uniformly accelerating particle. We present
the problem in the form of a paradox, and then answer it using a modern
treatment of radiation reaction and self-force, as it appears in the expression
due to Eliezer and Ford and O'Connell. We clarify the influence of the Schott
force and the total radiated power, which differs from Larmor's formula.
Finally, we present a simple and highly visual argument which enables one to
track the radiated energy without the need to appeal to the far field in the
distant future (the 'wave zone').
