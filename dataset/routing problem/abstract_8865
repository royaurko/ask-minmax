In this work we extend a recent result of Krist\'aly, Marzantowicz and Varga
concerning the existence of three critical points for a class non-smooth
functionals. Using this result, we guarantee the existence of three solutions
to a inclusion quasilinear problem, with non-homogeneous boundary condition
through Orlicz Sobolev spaces.
