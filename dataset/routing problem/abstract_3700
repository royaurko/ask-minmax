Quality assurance makes sure the project will be completed based on the
previously approved specifications, standards and functionality. It is required
without defects and possible problems. It monitors and tries to progress the
development process from the start of the project. Software Quality Assurance
(SQA) is the combination of the entire software development process, which
includes software design, coding, source code control, code review, change
management, configuration management and release management. In this paper we
describe the solution for the key problems of software testing in quality
assurance. The existing software practices have some problems such as testing
practices, attitude of users and culture of organizations. All these tree
problems have some combined problems such as shortcuts in testing, reduction in
testing time, poor documentation etc. In this paper we are recommending
strategies to provide solution of the said problems mentioned above.
