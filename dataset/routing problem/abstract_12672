This paper is devoted to the study of a class of singular perturbation
elliptic type problems on compact Lie groups or homogeneous spaces
$\mathcal{M}$. By constructing a suitable Nash-Moser-type iteration scheme on
compact Lie groups and homogeneous spaces, we overcome the clusters of "small
divisor" problem, then the existence of solutions for nonlinear elliptic
equations with a singular perturbation is established. Especially, if
$\mathcal{M}$ is the standard torus $\textbf{T}^n$ or the spheres
$\textbf{S}^n$, our result shows that there is a local uniqueness of spatially
periodic solutions for nonlinear elliptic equations with a singular
perturbation.
