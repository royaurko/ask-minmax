We prove a congruence criterion for the algebraic theory of power operations
in Morava E-theory, analogous to Wilkerson's congruence criterion for torsion
free lambda-rings. In addition, we provide a geometric description of this
congruence criterion, in terms of sheaves on the moduli problem of deformations
of formal groups and Frobenius isogenies.
