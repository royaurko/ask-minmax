We address the problem of the determination of the images of
three-dimensional geometric and modular Galois representations. In the modular
case the existence of these representations is only conjectural. We give
conditions to ensure that the images are as large as possible for almost every
prime. We compute some examples and stress the applications to inverse Galois
theory.
