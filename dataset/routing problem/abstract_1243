In this paper, we study the thermal rectification in asymmetric U-shaped
graphene flakes by using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. The
graphene flakes are composed by a beam and two arms. It is found that the heat
flux runs preferentially from the wide arm to the narrow arm which indicates a
strong rectification effect. The dependence of the rectification ratio upon the
heat flux, the length and the width of the beam, the length and width of the
two arms are studied. The result suggests a possible route to manage heat
dissipation in U-shaped graphene based nanoelectronic devices.
