We show that several important resource allocation problems in wireless
networks fit within the common framework of Constraint Satisfaction Problems
(CSPs). Inspired by the requirements of these applications, where variables are
located at distinct network devices that may not be able to communicate but may
interfere, we define natural criteria that a CSP solver must possess in order
to be practical. We term these algorithms decentralized CSP solvers. The best
known CSP solvers were designed for centralized problems and do not meet these
criteria. We introduce a stochastic decentralized CSP solver and prove that it
will find a solution in almost surely finite time, should one exist, also
showing it has many practically desirable properties. We benchmark the
algorithm's performance on a well-studied class of CSPs, random k-SAT,
illustrating that the time the algorithm takes to find a satisfying assignment
is competitive with stochastic centralized solvers on problems with order a
thousand variables despite its decentralized nature. We demonstrate the
solver's practical utility for the problems that motivated its introduction by
using it to find a non-interfering channel allocation for a network formed from
data from downtown Manhattan.
