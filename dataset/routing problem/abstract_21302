After a brief recapitulation of the general interest of parton densities, we
discuss multiple hard interactions and multiparton distributions. We report on
recent theoretical progress in their QCD description, on outstanding conceptual
problems and on possibilities to use multiparton distributions as a laboratory
to test and improve our understanding of hadron structure.
