We consider three problems for the Helmholtz equation in interior and
exterior domains in R^d (d=2,3): the exterior Dirichlet-to-Neumann and
Neumann-to-Dirichlet problems for outgoing solutions, and the interior
impedance problem. We derive sharp estimates for solutions to these problems
that, in combination, give bounds on the inverses of the combined-field
boundary integral operators for exterior Helmholtz problems.
