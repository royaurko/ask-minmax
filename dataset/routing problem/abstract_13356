In the thesis at hand we give a comprehensive discussion of basic problems
for generalized Maxwell equations with mixed boundary conditions using the
calculus of alternating differential forms on Riemannian manifolds of arbitrary
dimension. We prove compactness results, Hodge decompositions and Poincare type
estimates. For the case of 'full' boundary conditions we present trace and
extension theorems, regularity theory as well as a detailed solution theory for
static Maxwell problems.
