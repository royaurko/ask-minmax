The expected length of longest common subsequences is a problem that has been
in the literature for at least twenty five years. Determining the limiting
constants \gamma_k appears to be quite difficult, and the current best bounds
leave much room for improvement. Boutet de Monvel explores an independent
version of the problem he calls the Bernoulli Matching model. He explores this
problem and its relation to the longest common subsequence problem. This paper
continues this pursuit by focusing on a simplification we term r-reach. For the
string model, L_r(u,v) is the longest common subsequence of u and v given that
each matched pair of letters is no more than r letters apart.
