We explore whether a new method to solve the constraints of Einstein's
equations, which does not involve elliptic equations, can be applied to provide
initial data for black holes. We show that this method can be successfully
applied to a nonlinear perturbation of a Schwarzschild black hole by
establishing the well-posedness of the resulting constraint problem. We discuss
its possible generalization to the boosted, spinning multiple black hole
problem.
