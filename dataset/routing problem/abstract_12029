Site swap is a mathematical notation used by jugglers to communicate, create
and study complex juggling patterns. Determining the number of possible site
swap juggling patterns with respect to certain limiting parameters such as
number of balls etc., is a problem that has been much studied and solved by
many mathematicians. However, when the patterns have a throw height restriction
(ceiling) the problem becomes difficult and is in general still open. In this
article we derive some formulae for computing the number of possible juggling
patterns with respect to certain ceiling types.
