We calculate the hydrodynamic solutions for a dilute Bose-Einstein condensate
with long-range dipolar interactions in a rotating, elliptical harmonic trap,
and analyse their dynamical stability. The static solutions and their regimes
of instability vary non-trivially on the strength of the dipolar interactions.
We comprehensively map out this behaviour, and in particular examine the
experimental routes towards unstable dynamics, which, in analogy to
conventional condensates, may lead to vortex lattice formation. Furthermore, we
analyse the centre of mass and breathing modes of a rotating dipolar
condensate.
