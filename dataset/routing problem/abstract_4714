We discuss the equivalence relation between the Euclidean bipartite matching
problem on the line and on the circumference and the Brownian bridge process on
the same domains. The equivalence allows us to compute the correlation function
and the optimal cost of the original combinatoric problem in the thermodynamic
limit; moreover, we solve also the minimax problem on the line and on the
circumference. The properties of the average cost and correlation functions are
discussed.
