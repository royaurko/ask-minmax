The following work presents a generalized (extended) finite element
formulation for the advection-diffusion equation. Using enrichment functions
that represent the exponential nature of the exact solution, smooth numerical
solutions are obtained for problems with steep gradients and high Peclet
numbers (up to Pe = 25) in one and two-dimensions. As opposed to traditional
stabilized methods that require the construction of stability parameters and
stabilization terms, the present work avoids numerical instabilities by
improving the classical Galerkin solution with an enrichment function. To
contextualize this method among other stabilized methods, we show by
decomposition of the solution (in a multiscale manner) an equivalence to both
Galerkin/least-squares type methods and those that use bubble functions. This
work also presents a strategy for constructing the enrichment function for
problems with complex geometries by employing a global-local approach.
