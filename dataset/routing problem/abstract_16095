We analyse the computational complexity of finding Nash equilibria in
stochastic multiplayer games with $\omega$-regular objectives. While the
existence of an equilibrium whose payoff falls into a certain interval may be
undecidable, we single out several decidable restrictions of the problem.
First, restricting the search space to stationary, or pure stationary,
equilibria results in problems that are typically contained in PSPACE and NP,
respectively. Second, we show that the existence of an equilibrium with a
binary payoff (i.e. an equilibrium where each player either wins or loses with
probability 1) is decidable. We also establish that the existence of a Nash
equilibrium with a certain binary payoff entails the existence of an
equilibrium with the same payoff in pure, finite-state strategies.
