We introduce a generalization of representations of quivers that contains
also representations of posets, vectorspace problems and other matrix problems.
Many examples, some of which are given in the paper, show that the language of
marked quivers is rather convenient and that the notion of their
representations can probably be considered as basic for a general theory of
matrix problems. Some historical comments from my personal point of view are
added in the Appendix.
