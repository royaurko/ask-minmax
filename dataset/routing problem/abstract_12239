We give a simple proof of existence of solutions of the dispersion manage-
ment and diffraction management equations for zero average dispersion,
respectively diffraction. These solutions are found as maximizers of non-linear
and non-local vari- ational problems which are invariant under a large
non-compact group. Our proof of existence of maximizer is rather direct and
avoids the use of Lions' concentration compactness argument or Ekeland's
variational principle.
