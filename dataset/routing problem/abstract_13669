In this paper we address the problem of sensor fusion. We formulate the joint
detection problem using a general linear observation model and inter-modality
independence assumption for noises. We derive the fusion architecture based on
the generalized likelihood ratio principle and calculate the expressions for
the distributions of the test statistic under the signal present and the null
hypotheses. To obtain these results we develop a methodology for the joint
detection algorithm analysis based on the theory of the Meijer G-function.
