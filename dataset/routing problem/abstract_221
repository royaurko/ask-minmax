We study a scenario for route planning in road networks, where the objective
to be optimized may change between every shortest path query. Since this
invalidates many of the known speedup techniques for road networks that are
based on preprocessing of shortest path structures, we investigate
optimizations exploiting solely the topological structure of networks. We
experimentally evaluate our technique on a large set of real-world road
networks of various data sources. With lightweight preprocessing our technique
answers long-distance queries across continental networks significantly faster
than previous approaches towards the same problem formulation.
