Problems with securing IP Telephony systems, insufficient standardization and
lack of security mechanisms emerged the need for new approaches and solutions.
In this paper a new, alternative security architecture for voice-systems is
presented. It is based on digital watermarking: a new, flexible and powerful
technology that is increasingly gaining more and more attention. Besides known
applications e.g. to solve copyright protection problems, we propose to use
digital watermarking to secure not only transmitted audio but also signaling
protocol that IP Telephony is based on.
