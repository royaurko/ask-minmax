We prove asymptotically isometric, coarsely geodesic metrics on a toral
relatively hyperbolic group are coarsely equal. The theorem applies to all
lattices in SO(n,1). This partly verifies a conjecture by Margulis. In the case
of hyperbolic groups/spaces, our result generalizes a theorem by Furman and a
theorem by Krat.
  We discuss an application to the isospectral problem for the length spectrum
of Riemannian manifolds. The positive answer to this problem has been known for
several cases. All of them have hyperbolic fundamental groups. We do not solve
the isospectral problem in the original sense, but prove the universal covers
are (1,C)-quasi-isometric if the fundamental group is a toral relatively
hyperbolic group.
