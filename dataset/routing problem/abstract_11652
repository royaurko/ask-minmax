We study the stability properties of linear time-varying systems in
continuous time whose system matrix is Metzler with zero row sums. This class
of systems arises naturally in the context of distributed decision problems,
coordination and rendezvous tasks and synchronization problems. The equilibrium
set contains all states with identical state components. We present sufficient
conditions guaranteeing uniform exponential stability of this equilibrium set,
implying that all state components converge to a common value as time grows
unbounded. Furthermore it is shown that this convergence result is robust with
respect to an arbitrary delay, provided that the delay affects only the
off-diagonal terms in the differential equation.
