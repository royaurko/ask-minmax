The technology related to networking moves wired connection to wireless
connection.The basic problem concern in the wireless domain, random packet loss
for the end to end connection. In this paper we show the performance and the
impact of the packet loss and delay, by the bit error rate throughput etc with
respect to the real world scenario vehicular ad hoc network in 3-dimension
space (VANET in 3D). Over the years software development has responded to the
increasing growth of wireless connectivity in developing network enabled
software. In this paper we consider the real world physical problem in three
dimensional wireless domain and map the problem to analytical problem . In this
paper we simulate that analytic problem with respect to real world scenario by
using enhanced antenna position system (EAPS) mounted over the mobile node in
3D space. In this paper we convert the real world problem into lab oriented
problem by using the EAPS -system and shown the performance in wireless domain
in 3 dimensional space.
