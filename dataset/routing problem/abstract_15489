We completely compute the Real Johnson-Wilson cohomology of
$\mathbb{C}P^\infty$. Applying techniques from equivariant stable homotopy
theory to the Bockstein spectral sequence, we produce permanent cycles and
solve extension problems to give an explicit description of the ring
$ER(n)^*(\mathbb{C}P^\infty)$
