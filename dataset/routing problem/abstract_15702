The problem of testing leptogenesis from low energy experiments is discussed
following three different perspectives. Firstly, we review the prospects that
from low energy experiments we could reconstruct the neutrino Yukawa coupling
matrix and hence constrain the leptogenesis mechanism. We emphasize the fact
that the experimental determination of the phases and mixings in the light
neutrino mass matrix is irrelevant for leptogenesis, unless additional
information about the texture of the Yukawa coupling matrix is provided by
other observables. Secondly, we show how the discovery of an extra gauge boson
could bring us important indications for leptogenesis. Thirdly, we discuss the
problems one encounters when attempting to build a leptogenesis mechanism at a
directly testable scale, presenting an explicit model which avoids these
problems.
