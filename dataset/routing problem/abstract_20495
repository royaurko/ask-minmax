It's argued that Information-Theoretical restrictions for the systems
selfdescription are important for Quantum Measurement Problem. They are
described by O information system restricted states R formalism by Breuer and
can be obtained also in Algebraic QM considering Segal Algebra of O
observables. From Segal theorem it's shown that R describes the random
measurement outcomes in the individual events.
