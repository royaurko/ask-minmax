We give sufficient conditions for two Cantor sets of the line to be nested
for a positive set of translation parameters. This problem occurs in
diophantine approximations. It also occurs as a toy model of the parameter
selection for non-uniformly hyperbolic attractors of the plane. For natural
Cantors sets, we show that this condition is optimal.
