In this paper I describe the history of the surreal trajectories problem and
argue that in fact it is not a problem for Bohm's theory. More specifically, I
argue that one can take the particle trajectories predicted by Bohm's theory to
be the actual trajectories that particles follow and that there is no reason to
suppose that good particle detectors are somehow fooled in the context of the
surreal trajectories experiments. Rather than showing that Bohm's theory
predicts the wrong particle trajectories or that it somehow prevents one from
making reliable measurements, such experiments ultimately reveal the special
role played by position and the fundamental incompatibility between Bohm's
theory and relativity.
