In this contribution we describe the hardware, firmware and software
components of the readout system of the MAGIC-II Cherenkov telescope on the
Canary island La Palma. The PMT analog signals are transmitted by means of
optical fibers from the MAGIC-II camera to the 80 m away counting house where
they are routed to the new high bandwidth and fully programmable receiver
boards (MONSTER), which convert back the signals from optical to electrical
ones. Then the signals are split, one half provide the input signals for the
level ONE trigger system while the other half is sent to the digitizing units.
The fast Cherenkov pulses are sampled by low-power Domino Ring Sampler chips
(DRS2) and temporarily stored in an array of 1024 capacitors. Signals are
sampled at the ultra-fast speed of 2 GSample/s, which allows a very precise
measurement of the signal arrival times in all pixels. They are then digitized
with 12-bit resolution by an external ADC readout at 40 MHz speed. The Domino
samplers are integrated in the newly designed mezzanines which equip a set of
fourteen multi-purpose PULSAR boards. Finally, the data are sent through an
S-LINK optical interface to a single computer. The entire DAQ hardware is
controlled through a VME interface and steered by the slow control software
program (MIR). The Data AcQuisition software program (DAQ) proceeds finally to
the event building and data storage.
