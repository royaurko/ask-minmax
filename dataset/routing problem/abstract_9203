We study the complexity of valued constraint satisfaction problems (VCSP). A
problem from VCSP is characterised by a \emph{constraint language}, a fixed set
of cost functions over a finite domain. An instance of the problem is specified
by a sum of cost functions from the language and the goal is to minimise the
sum. We consider the case of so-called \emph{conservative} languages; that is,
languages containing all unary cost functions, thus allowing arbitrary
restrictions on the domains of the variables. This problem has been studied by
Bulatov [LICS'03] for $\{0,\infty\}$-valued languages (i.e. CSP), by
Cohen~\etal\ (AIJ'06) for Boolean domains, by Deineko et al. (JACM'08) for
$\{0,1\}$-valued cost functions (i.e. Max-CSP), and by Takhanov (STACS'10) for
$\{0,\infty\}$-valued languages containing all finite-valued unary cost
functions (i.e. Min-Cost-Hom).
  We give an elementary proof of a complete complexity classification of
conservative finite-valued languages: we show that every conservative
finite-valued language is either tractable or NP-hard. This is the \emph{first}
dichotomy result for finite-valued VCSPs over non-Boolean domains.
