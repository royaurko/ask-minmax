In this paper, we consider a leader-following consensus problem for networks
of continuous-time integrator agents with a time-varying leader under
measurement noises. We propose a neighbor-based state-estimation protocol for
every agent to track the leader, and time-varying consensus gains are
introduced to attenuate the noises. By combining the tools of stochastic
analysis and algebraic graph theory, we study mean square convergence of this
multi-agent system under directed fixed as well as switching interconnection
topologies. Sufficient conditions are given for mean square consensus in both
cases. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate our theoretical
results.
