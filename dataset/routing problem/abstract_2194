Populations can evolve in order to adapt to external changes. The capacity to
evolve and adapt makes successful treatment of infectious diseases and cancer
difficult. Indeed, therapy resistance has quickly become a key challenge for
global health. Therefore, ideas of how to control evolving populations in order
to overcome this threat are valuable. Here we use the mathematical concepts of
stochastic optimal control to study what is needed to control evolving
populations. Following established routes to calculate control strategies, we
first study how a polymorphism can be maintained in a finite population by
adaptively tuning selection. We then introduce a minimal model of drug
resistance in a stochastically evolving cancer cell population and compute
adaptive therapies, where decisions are based on monitoring the response of the
tumor, which can outperform established therapy paradigms. For both case
studies, we demonstrate the importance of high-resolution monitoring of the
target population in order to achieve a given control objective: to control one
must monitor.
