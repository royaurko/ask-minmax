We design and prove the convergence of an iterative observer for the boundary
estimation problem for an elliptic equation namely Cauchy problem for Laplace
equation. The Laplace equation is formulated as a first order system of
equations in one of the space variables with state operator matrix A that maps
from D(A) to X, where D(A) and X are infinitedimensional Sobolev spaces. The
convergence of proposed iterative observer is established using semigroup
theory and the concept of observability for infinite dimensional systems. We
prove that A generates a strongly continuous semigroup T on a proper dense
subspace of X. We also show that for a given particular boundary observation
operator C, pair (C;A) is final state and exact observable. Further a theorem
is provided to prove a bi-implication between exact observability and existence
of observer gain. Numerical simulations are provided toward the end to show
efficiency of the algorithm.
