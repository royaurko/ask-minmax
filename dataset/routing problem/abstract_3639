What is neuroinformatics? We can define it as a direction of science and
information technology, dealing with development and study of the methods for
solution of problems by means of neural networks. A field of science cannot be
determined only by fixing what it is "dealing with". The main component,
actually constituting a scientific direction, is "THE GREAT PROBLEM", around
which the efforts are concentrated. One may state even categorically: if there
is no a great problem, there is no a field of science, but only more or less
skilful imitation. What is "THE GREAT PROBLEM" for neuroinformatics? The
problem of effective parallelism, the study of brain (solution of mysteries of
thinking), etc are discussed. The neuroinformatics was considered not only as a
science, but as a services sector too. The main ideas of generalized technology
of extraction of explicit knowledge from data are presented. The mathematical
achievements generated by neuroinformatics, the problem of provability of
neurocomputations, and benefits of neural network realization of solution of a
problem are discussed.
