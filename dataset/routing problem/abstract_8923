The reaction A+B --> B is studied when the reactants diffuse in phase space,
i.e. their dynamics is described by the Langevin equation. The steady-state
rate constants are calculated for both the target (static A and mobile B's) and
trapping (mobile A and static B's) problems when the reaction is assumed to
occur at the first contact. For Brownian dynamics (i.e., ordinary diffusion),
the rate constant for both problems is a monotonically decreasing function of
the friction coefficient $\gamma$. For Langevin dynamics, however, we find that
the steady-state rate constant exhibits a turnover behavior as a function of
$\gamma$ for the trapping problem but not for the target problem. This turnover
is different from the familiar Kramers' turnover of the rate constant for
escape from a deep potential well because the reaction considered here is an
activationless process.
