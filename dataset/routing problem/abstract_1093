We show that the nontwist phenomena previously observed in Hamiltonian
systems exist also in time-reversible non-Hamiltonian systems. In particular,
we study the two standard collision/reconnection scenarios and we compute the
parameter space breakup diagram of the shearless torus. Besides the Hamiltonian
routes, the breakup may occur due to the onset of attractors. We study these
phenomena in coupled phase oscillators and in non-area-preserving maps.
