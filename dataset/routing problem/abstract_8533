Recently, the weight distributions of the duals of the cyclic codes with two
zeros have been obtained for several cases. In this paper we solve one more
special case. The problem of finding the weight distribution is transformed
into a problem of evaluating certain character sums over finite fields, which
in turn can be solved by using the Jacobi sums directly.
