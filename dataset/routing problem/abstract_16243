We consider the problem of a single particle interacting with $N$ identical
fermions, at zero temperature and in one dimension. We calculate the binding
energy as well as the effective mass of the single particle. We use an
approximate method developed in the three-dimensional case, where the Hilbert
space for the excited states of the $N$ fermions is restricted to have at most
two particle-hole pairs. When the mass of the single particle is equal to the
fermion mass, we find an excellent agreement with the exact results of McGuire.
When the mass of the single particle is infinite, we solve exactly the problem
and find again excellent agreement between approximate results and exact ones.
This overall agreement in one dimension gives a strong validation for the
approximate method applied in three dimensions. Moreover it shows that our
approximate treatment is excellent for the one dimensional problem in the
general case with respect to the mass of the single particle.
