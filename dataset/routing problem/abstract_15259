In performing a Bayesian analysis, two difficult problems often emerge.
First, in estimating the parameters of some model for the data, the resulting
posterior distribution may be multi-modal or exhibit pronounced (curving)
degeneracies. Secondly, in selecting between a set of competing models,
calculation of the Bayesian evidence for each model is computationally
expensive using existing methods such as thermodynamic integration. Nested
Sampling is a Monte Carlo method targeted at the efficient calculation of the
evidence, but also produces posterior inferences as a by-product and therefore
provides means to carry out parameter estimation as well as model selection.
The main challenge in implementing Nested Sampling is to sample from a
constrained probability distribution. One possible solution to this problem is
provided by the Galilean Monte Carlo (GMC) algorithm. We show results of
applying Nested Sampling with GMC to some problems which have proven very
difficult for standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and down-hill methods,
due to the presence of large number of local minima and/or pronounced (curving)
degeneracies between the parameters. We also discuss the use of Nested Sampling
with GMC in Bayesian object detection problems, which are inherently
multi-modal and require the evaluation of Bayesian evidence for distinguishing
between true and spurious detections.
