We prove that at large disorder, Anderson localization in $\Z^d$ is stable
under localized time-periodic perturbations by proving that the associated
quasi-energy operator has pure point spectrum. The formulation of this problem
is motivated by questions of Anderson localization for non-linear Schr\"odinger
equations.
