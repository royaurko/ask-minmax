The main aim of this paper is to study soliton surfaces immersed in Lie
algebras associated with ordinary differential equations (ODE's) for elliptic
functions. That is, given a linear spectral problem for such an ODE in matrix
Lax representation, we search for the most general solution of the wave
function which satisfies the linear spectral problem. These solutions allow for
the explicit construction of soliton surfaces by the Fokas-Gel'fand formula for
immersion, as formulated in (Grundland and Post 2011) which is based on the
formalism of generalized vector fields and their prolongation structures. The
problem has been reduced to examining three types of symmetries, namely, a
conformal symmetry in the spectral parameter (known as the Sym-Tafel formula),
gauge transformations of the wave function and generalized symmetries of the
associated integrable ODE. The paper contains a detailed explanation of the
immersion theory of surfaces in Lie algebras in connection with ODE's as well
as an exposition of the main tools used to study their geometric
characteristics. Several examples of the Jacobian and P-Weierstrass elliptic
functions are included as illustrations of the theoretical results.
