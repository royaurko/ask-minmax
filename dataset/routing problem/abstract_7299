In this paper, we present the two-step trigonometrically fitted symmetric
Obrechkoff methods with algebraic order of twelve. The method is based on the
symmetric two-step Obrechkoff method, with 12 algebraic order, high phase-lag
order and is constructed to solve IVPs with periodic solutions such as orbital
problems. We compare the new method to some recently constructed optimized
methods from the literature. The numerical results obtained by the new method
for some problems show its superiority in efficiency, accuracy and stability.
