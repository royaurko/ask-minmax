We consider a class of random matching problems where the distance between
two points has a probability law which, for a small distance l, goes like l^r.
In the framework of the cavity method, in the limit of an infinite number of
points, we derive equations for p_k, the probability for some given point to be
matched to its k-th nearest neighbor in the optimal configuration. These
equations are solved in two limiting cases : r=0 - where we recover p_k=1/2^k,
as numerically conjectured by Houdayer et al. and recently rigorously proved by
Aldous - and r -> +infty. For 0<r<+infty, we are not able to solve the
equations analytically, but we compute the leading behavior of p_k for large k.
