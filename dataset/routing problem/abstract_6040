Recent efforts in cosmic ray (CR) confinement and transport theory are
discussed. Three problems are addressed as being crucial for understanding the
present day observations and their possible telltale signs of the CR origin.
The first problem concerns CR behavior right after their release from a source,
such as a supernova remnant (SNR). At this phase the CRs are confined near the
source by self-emitted Alfven waves. The second is the problem of diffusive
propagation of CRs through the turbulent ISM. This is a seemingly
straightforward and long-resolved problem, but it remains controversial and
reveals paradoxes. A resolution based on the Chapman-Enskog asymptotic CR
transport analysis, that also includes magnetic focusing, is suggested. The
third problem is about a puzzling sharp ($\sim10^{\circ}$) anisotropies in the
CR arrival directions that might bear on important clues of their transport
between the source and observer. The overarching goal is to improve our
understanding of all aspects of the CR's source escape and ensuing propagation
through the galaxy to the level at which their sources can be identified
observationally.
