In this paper we consider the classic problems of scattering of waves from
perfectly conducting cylinders with piecewise smooth boundaries. The scattering
problems are formulated as integral equations and solved using a Nystr\"om
scheme where the corners of the cylinders are efficiently handled by a method
referred to as Recursively Compressed Inverse Preconditioning (RCIP). This
method has been very successful in treating static problems in non-smooth
domains and the present paper shows that it works equally well for the
Helmholtz equation. In the numerical examples we specialize to scattering of E-
and H-waves from a cylinder with one corner. Even at a size kd=1000, where k is
the wavenumber and d the diameter, the scheme produces at least 13 digits of
accuracy in the electric and magnetic fields everywhere outside the cylinder.
