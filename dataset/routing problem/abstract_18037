Gibbs-type random probability measures and the exchangeable random partitions
they induce represent the subject of a rich and active literature. They provide
a probabilistic framework for a wide range of theoretical and applied problems
that are typically referred to as species sampling problems. In this paper, we
consider the class of looking-backward species sampling problems introduced in
Lijoi et al. (Ann. Appl. Probab. 18 (2008) 1519-1547) in Bayesian
nonparametrics. Specifically, given some information on the random partition
induced by an initial sample from a Gibbs-type random probability measure, we
study the conditional distributions of statistics related to the old species,
namely those species detected in the initial sample and possibly re-observed in
an additional sample. The proposed results contribute to the analysis of
conditional properties of Gibbs-type exchangeable random partitions, so far
focused mainly on statistics related to those species generated by the
additional sample and not already detected in the initial sample.
