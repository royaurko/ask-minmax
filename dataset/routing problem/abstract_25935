We present a new concept for homonuclear dipolar recoupling in
magic-angle-spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR experiments which avoids the problem
of dipolar truncation. This is accomplished through the introduction of a new
NMR pulse sequence design principle: the triple oscillating field technique. We
demonstrate this technique as an efficient means to accomplish broadband
dipolar recoupling of homonuclear spins, while decoupling heteronuclear dipolar
couplings and anisotropic chemicals shifts and retaining influence from
isotropic chemical shifts. In this manner, it possible to synthesize Ising
interactions in homonuclear spin networks and thereby avoid dipolar truncation
- a serious problem essentially all previous homonuclear dipolar recoupling
experiments suffer from. Combination of this recoupling concept with rotor
assisted dipolar refocusing enables easy readout of internuclear distances
through comparison with analytical Fresnel curves. This forms the basis for a
new class of solid-state NMR experiments with potential for structure analysis
of uniformly carbon labelled proteins through accurate measurement of
{13}C-{13}C internuclear distances. The concept is demonstrated experimentally
by measurement of C_alpha-C', C_\beta-C', and C_\gamma-C' internuclear
distances in powder samples of the amino acids \textit{L}-alanine and
\textit{L}-threonine.
