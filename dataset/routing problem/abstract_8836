In a real Banach space, we first prove that the sum of a monotone operator of
type (FPV) and maximal monotone operator Rockafellar's constraint qualification
is maximal. This prove leads to the solution of most interesting long-time
outstanding problem in monotone operator theory is the sum problem.
