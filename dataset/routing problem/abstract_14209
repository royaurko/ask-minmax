In this paper, we extend some of the multilevel convergence results obtained
by Xu and Zhu in [Xu and Zhu, M3AS 2008], to the case of second order linear
reaction-diffusion equations. Specifically, we consider the multilevel
preconditioners for solving the linear systems arising from the linear finite
element approximation of the problem, where both diffusion and reaction
coefficients are piecewise-constant functions. We discuss in detail the
influence of both the discontinuous reaction and diffusion coefficients to the
performance of the classical BPX and multigrid V-cycle preconditioners.
