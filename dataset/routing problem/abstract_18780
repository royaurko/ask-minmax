The second-order achievable asymptotics in typical random number generation
problems such as resolvability, intrinsic randomness, fixed-length source
coding are considered. In these problems, several researchers have derived the
first-order and the second-order achievability rates for general sources using
the information spectrum methods. Although these formulas are general, their
computation are quite hard. Hence, an attempt to address explicit computation
problems of achievable rates is meaningful. In particular, for i.i.d. sources,
the second-order achievable rates have earlier been determined simply by using
the asymptotic normality. In this paper, we consider mixed sources of two
i.i.d. sources. The mixed source is a typical case of nonergodic sources and
whose self-information does not have the asymptotic normality. Nonetheless, we
can explicitly compute the second-order achievable rates for these sources on
the basis of two-peak asymptotic normality. In addition, extensions of our
results to more general mixed sources, such as a mixture of countably infinite
i.i.d. sources or Markovian sources, and a continuous mixture of i.i.d.
sources, are considered.
