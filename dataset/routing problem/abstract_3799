We consider a transmission problem where the interior domain has infinitely
ramified structures. Transmission between the interior and exterior domains
only takes place at the fractal component of the boundary of the interior
domain. We also consider transmission problems in which the interior domain is
obtained by stopping the self-similar construction after a finite number of
steps; the transmission condition is then posed on a prefractal approximation
of the fractal interface. We prove the convergence in the sense of Mosco of the
energy forms associated with these problems to the energy form of the limit
problem. In particular, this implies the convergence of the solutions of the
approximated problems to the solution of the problem with fractal interface.
The proof relies in particular on an extension property of the interior domain.
Emphasis is put on the geometry of the ramified domain. The convergence result
is proved when the fractal interface has no self-contact, and for a particular
geometry with self-contacts for which an extension result is proved.
