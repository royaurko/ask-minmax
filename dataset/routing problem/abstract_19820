I discuss some new trends in particle theory beyond the standard model. Some
topics briefly covered include elecroweak baryogenesis, gauge versus non-gauge
discrete symmetries, the strong CP problem, dynamical symmetry breaking
scenarios, supersymmetric grand unification, new aspects in low energy
supersymmetry and superstring phenomenology.
