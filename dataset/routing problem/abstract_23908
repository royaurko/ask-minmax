We study unitary random matrix ensembles in the critical case where the
limiting mean eigenvalue density vanishes quadratically at an interior point of
the support. We establish universality of the limits of the eigenvalue
correlation kernel at such a critical point in a double scaling limit. The
limiting kernels are constructed out of functions associated with the second
Painleve equation. This extends a result of Bleher and Its for the special case
of a critical quartic potential.
  The two main tools we use are equilibrium measures and Riemann-Hilbert
problems. In our treatment of equilibrium measures we allow a negative density
near the critical point, which enables us to treat all cases simultaneously.
The asymptotic analysis of the Riemann-Hilbert problem is done with the
Deift/Zhou steepest descent analysis. For the construction of a local
parametrix at the critical point we introduce a modification of the approach of
Baik, Deift, and Johansson so that we are able to satisfy the required jump
properties exactly.
