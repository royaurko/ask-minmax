In this paper we construct Discontinuous Galerkin approximations of the
Stokes problem where the velocity field is H(div)-conforming. This implies that
the velocity solution is divergence-free in the whole domain. This property can
be exploited to design a simple and effective preconditioner for the final
linear system.
