The purpose of this paper is to study a non-convex fuzzy multi-objective
quadratic programming problem, in which both the technological coefficients and
resources are fuzzy with nonlinear membership function. A computational
procedure to find a fuzzy efficient solution of this problem is developed. A
numerical example is given to illustrate the procedure.
