We propose a new axionic solution of the strong CP problem with a
Peccei-Quinn mechanism using the gluino rather than quarks. The spontaneous
breaking of this new global U(1) at 10^{11} GeV also generates the
supersymmetry breaking scale of 1 TeV (solving the so-called \mu problem at the
same time) and results in the MSSM (Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model) with
R parity conservation. In this framework, electric dipole moments become
calculable without ambiguity.
