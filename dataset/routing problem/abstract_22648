The general solution of the inverse Frobenius-Perron problem considering the
construction of a fully chaotic dynamical system with given invariant density
is obtained within the class of one-dimensional unimodal maps. Some interesting
connections between this solution and the approach via conjugation
transformations are eluminated. The developed method is applied to obtain a
wide class of maps having as invariant density the two-parametric
beta-probability density function. Varying the parameters of the density a rich
variety of dynamics is observed. Observables like autocorrelation functions,
power spectra and Lyapunov exponents are calculated for representatives of this
family of maps and some theoretical predictions concerning the decay of
correlations are tested.
