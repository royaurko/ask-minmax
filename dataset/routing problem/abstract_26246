To deal with global problems we suggest to consider complex systems not in
space and time, but in a possible deeper reality, i.e., the hierarchical
network of prime integer relations. Encoded by arithmetic through the
self-organization processes the hierarchical network appears as the
mathematical structure of one harmonious and interconnected whole. Remarkably,
the holistic nature of the hierarchical network allows to formulate a single
universal objective of a complex system defined in terms of the integration
principle. We propose that by the realization of the integration principle the
Earth system could be transformed to become an integrated part of a larger
system with more capacity and energy to sustain life. Significantly, based on
integers and controlled by arithmetic only the hierarchical network has a
unique potential to provide an irreducible common ground fully trusted by
different parties and helping to reveal a higher collective purpose.
