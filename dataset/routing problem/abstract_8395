In this paper, we present a solution to the Schottky problem in the spirit of
Schottky and Jung for genus five curves. To do so, we exploit natural incidence
structures on the fibers of several maps to reduce all questions to statements
about the Prym map for genus six curves. This allows us to find all components
of the big Schottky locus and thus, to show that the small Schottky locus
introduced by Donagi is irreducible.
