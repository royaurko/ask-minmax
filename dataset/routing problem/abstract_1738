Bicontinuous, interfacially jammed emulsion gels (bijels) represent a class
of soft solid materials in which interpenetrating domains of two immiscible
fluids are stabilized by an interfacial colloidal monolayer. Such structures
can be formed by arrested spinodal decomposition from an initially single-phase
colloidal suspension. Here we explore by lattice Boltzmann simulation the
possible effects of using magnetic colloids in bijels. This may allow
additional control over the structure, during or after formation, by
application of a magnetic field or field gradient. These effects are modest for
typical parameters based on the magnetic nanoparticles used in conventional
ferrofluids, although significantly larger particles might be appropriate here.
Field gradient effects, which are cumulative across a sample, could then allow
a route for controlled breakdown of bijels as they do for particle-stabilized
droplet emulsions.
