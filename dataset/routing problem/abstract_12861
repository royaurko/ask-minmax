Some new aspects of axially symmetric spacetimes are discussed. These results
open the door for future interplay between analytical and numerical studies.
The new developments are based on the role of the total mass in axial symmetry.
Finally, a list of relevant open problems is presented. These problems can be
hopefully solved with an interaction between numerical and analytical insights.
