We consider space and time dependent fuzzy spheres $S^{2p}$ arising in
$D1-D(2p+1)$ intersections in IIB string theory and collapsing D(2p)-branes in
IIA string theory.
  In the case of $S^2$, where the periodic space and time-dependent solutions
can be described by Jacobi elliptic functions, there is a duality of the form
$r$ to ${1 \over r}$ which relates the space and time dependent solutions.
  This duality is related to complex multiplication properties of the Jacobi
elliptic functions. For $S^4$ funnels, the description of the periodic space
and time dependent solutions involves the Jacobi Inversion problem on a
hyper-elliptic Riemann surface of genus 3. Special symmetries of the Riemann
surface allow the reduction of the problem to one involving a product of genus
one surfaces. The symmetries also allow a generalisation of the $r$ to ${1
\over r} $ duality. Some of these considerations extend to the case of the
fuzzy $S^6$.
