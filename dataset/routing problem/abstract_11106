The paging problem is that of deciding which pages to keep in a memory of k
pages in order to minimize the number of page faults. This paper introduces the
marking algorithm, a simple randomized on-line algorithm for the paging
problem, and gives a proof that its performance guarantee (competitive ratio)
is O(log k). In contrast, no deterministic on-line algorithm can have a
performance guarantee better than k.
