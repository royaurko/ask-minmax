The inverse problem of finding the velocity profile from the surface
measurements of acoustic field is considered. The dimensionalities of the data
and of the unknown velocity profile are equal, both are equal 3. Analytical
explicit examples are given showing vast non-uniqueness of the solution to this
inverse problem.
