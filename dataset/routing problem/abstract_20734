In this note we give some sufficient conditions for an analytic function
$f(z)$ normalized by $f'(0)=1$ to belong to certain subfamilies of the class of
Bazilevic functions. In earlier works, the closure property of many classes of
functions under the Bernardi integral have been considered. The converse of
this problem is also considered here.
