The Bertrand's theorem can be formulated as the solution of an inverse
problem for a classical unidimensional motion. We show that the solutions of
these problems, if restricted to a given class, can be obtained by solving a
numerical equation. This permit a particulary compact and elegant proof of
Bertrand's theorem.
