It is pointed out that the strong CP problem may have a natural solution in
the context of a recently proposed dualized version of the Standard Model where
Higgs fields and generations emerge naturally. Although fermions have finite
pole-masses, the fermionic mass matrix itself is factorizable (having only one
nonzero eigenvalue) to all orders in perturbation theory thus allowing one to
perform a chiral transformation $\psi\to\psi'=e^{-i\gamma_{5}\alpha}\psi$ and
to rotate the theta-angle to zero.
