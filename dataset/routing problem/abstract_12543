For the first time it is shown that for thin metallic films thickness of
which does not exceed thickness of skin - layer, the problem of description of
surface plasma oscillations allows analytical solution under arbitrary ratio of
length of electrons free path and thickness of a film. The dependance of
frequency of surface plasma oscillations on wave number is carried out. We
consider a case of specularity - diffusive boundary value problems.
