We present a method for the resolution of (oscillatory) nonlinear problems.
It is based on the application of the Linear Delta Expansion to the
Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method. By applying it to the Duffing equation, we show
that our method substantially improves the approximation given by the simple
Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method.
