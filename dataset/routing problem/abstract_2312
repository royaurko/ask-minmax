Bolivia, a landlocked emerging country in South America, has one of the
smallest networks in the whole Internet. Before the IXP implementation,
delivering packets between national ISPs had to be sent them through
international transit links. Being aware of this situation and looking for
increasing the number of users, Bolivian government enacted a law to gather all
national ISPs on a single IXP in 2013.
  In spite of several articles have researched about this topic, no one before
has set the focus on measuring the evolution of end-users parameters in a South
American developing country, moreover after a significant changing on the
topology. For the current work, we have mainly studied hop, latency, traffic
and route variation, a long a seven months. Topology have not been studied
because Bolivian ISPs must be connected each others under legal obligation.
  To achieve our measurement goals, and under absence of global-scale measuring
projects in this country, we have developed our own active-measurement platform
among local ASes. During the platform development we had to deal with local ISP
fears, governmental agencies and regulation pressures.
  We also survey the main previous papers on IXP analysis, and we classfied
them on obtained data and their sources.
