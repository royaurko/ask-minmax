We are solving for the case of flat superspace some homological problems that
were formulated by Berkovits and Howe. (Our considerations can be applied also
to the case of supertorus.) These problems arise in the attempt to construct
integrals invariant with respect to supersymmetry. They appear also in other
situations, in particular, in the pure spinor formalism in supergravity.
