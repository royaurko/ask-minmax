In this paper, we evaluate and compare the impact of link duration and path
stability of routing protocols; Destination Sequence Distance vector (DSDV),
Dynamic MANET On- Demand (DYMO) and Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) at
different number of connections and node density. In order to improve the
efficiency of selected protocols; we enhance DYMO and OLSR. Simulation and
comparison of both default and enhanced routing protocols is carried out under
the performance parameters; Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Average End-to End
Delay (AE2ED) and Normalized Routing Overhead (NRO). From the results, we
observe that DYMO performs better than DSDV, MOD-OLSR and OLSR in terms of PDR,
AE2ED, link duration and path stability at the cost of high value of NRO.
