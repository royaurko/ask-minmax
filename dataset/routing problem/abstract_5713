We present a computationally-efficient method for recovering sparse signals
from a series of noisy observations, known as the problem of compressed sensing
(CS). CS theory requires solving a convex constrained minimization problem. We
propose to transform this optimization problem into a convex feasibility
problem (CFP), and solve it using subgradient projection methods, which are
iterative, fast, robust and convergent schemes for solving CFPs. As opposed to
some of the recently-introduced CS algorithms, such as Bayesian CS and gradient
projections for sparse reconstruction, which become inefficient as the problem
dimension and sparseness degree increase, the newly-proposed methods exhibit a
marked robustness with respect to these factors. This renders the subgradient
projection methods highly viable for large-scale compressible scenarios.
