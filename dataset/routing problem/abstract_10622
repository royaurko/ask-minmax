In a recent paper, we introduced the simultaneous representation problem
(defined for any graph class C) and studied the problem for chordal,
comparability and permutation graphs. For interval graphs, the problem is
defined as follows. Two interval graphs G_1 and G_2, sharing some vertices I
(and the corresponding induced edges), are said to be `simultaneous interval
graphs' if there exist interval representations R_1 and R_2 of G_1 and G_2,
such that any vertex of I is mapped to the same interval in both R_1 and R_2.
Equivalently, G_1 and G_2 are simultaneous interval graphs if there exist edges
E' between G_1-I and G_2-I such that G_1 \cup G_2 \cup E' is an interval graph.
  Simultaneous representation problems are related to simultaneous planar
embeddings, and have applications in any situation where it is desirable to
consistently represent two related graphs, for example: interval graphs
capturing overlaps of DNA fragments of two similar organisms; or graphs
connected in time, where one is an updated version of the other.
  In this paper we give an O(n^2*logn) time algorithm for recognizing
simultaneous interval graphs,where n = |G_1 \cup G_2|. This result complements
the polynomial time algorithms for recognizing probe interval graphs and
provides an efficient algorithm for the interval graph sandwich problem for the
special case where the set of optional edges induce a complete bipartite graph.
