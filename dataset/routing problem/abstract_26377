It is becoming common to archive research datasets that are not only large
but also numerous. In addition, their corresponding metadata and the software
required to analyse or display them need to be archived. Yet the manual
curation of research data can be difficult and expensive, particularly in very
large digital repositories, hence the importance of models and tools for
automating digital curation tasks. The automation of these tasks faces three
major challenges: (1) research data and data sources are highly heterogeneous,
(2) future research needs are difficult to anticipate, (3) data is hard to
index. To address these problems, we propose the Extract, Transform and Archive
(ETA) model for managing and mechanizing the curation of research data.
Specifically, we propose a scalable strategy for addressing the research-data
problem, ranging from the extraction of legacy data to its long-term storage.
We review some existing solutions and propose novel avenues of research.
