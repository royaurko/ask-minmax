The Cauchy- and periodic boundary value problem for the nonlinear
Schroedinger equations in $n$ space dimensions [u_t - i\Delta u = (\nabla
\bar{u})^{\beta}, |\beta|=m \ge 2, u(0)=u_0 \in H^{s+1}_x] is shown to be
locally well posed for $s > s_c := \frac{n}{2} - \frac{1}{m-1}$, $s \ge 0$. In
the special case of space dimension $n=1$ a global $L^2$-result is obtained for
NLS with the nonlinearity $N(u)= \partial_x (\bar{u} ^2)$.
  The proof uses the Fourier restriction norm method.
