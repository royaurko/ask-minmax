Direct gauge mediation models using the Intriligator-Seiberg-Shih (ISS)
metastable vacua suffer from the Landau pole problem of the standard model
gauge couplings and the existence of R symmetry forbidding gaugino masses.
These problems may be solved by using the recently proposed SUSY breaking
models in a conformal window of the vector-like $SU(N_C)$ gauge theory with
gauge singlets. In this paper we propose a model of gauge mediation based on
the SUSY-breaking model in the conformal window, and study the dynamics for the
SUSY breaking. In the model, there are massive vector-like bifundamental fields
charged under both $SU(N_C)$ and the standard model gauge group, and our model
can be regarded as a semi-direct gauge mediation model. The color number $N_C$
can be small to avoid the Landau pole problem, and the R symmetry is also
broken under a reasonable assumption on the strong dynamics of the model. The
model possesses only one free parameter, and the gaugino and sfermion masses
are naturally of the same order.
