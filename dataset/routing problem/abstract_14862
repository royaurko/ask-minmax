This paper shows how left and right actions of Lie groups on a manifold may
be used to complement one another in a variational reformulation of optimal
control problems equivalently as geodesic boundary value problems with
symmetry. We prove an equivalence theorem to this effect and illustrate it with
several examples. In finite-dimensions, we discuss geodesic flows on the Lie
groups SO(3) and SE(3) under the left and right actions of their respective Lie
algebras. In an infinite-dimensional example, we discuss optimal
large-deformation matching of one closed curve to another embedded in the same
plane. In the curve-matching example, the manifold $\Emb(S^1, \mathbb{R}^2)$
comprises the space of closed curves $S^1$ embedded in the plane
$\mathbb{R}^2$. The diffeomorphic left action $\Diff(\mathbb{R}^2)$ deforms the
curve by a smooth invertible time-dependent transformation of the coordinate
system in which it is embedded, while leaving the parameterisation of the curve
invariant. The diffeomorphic right action $\Diff(S^1)$ corresponds to a smooth
invertible reparameterisation of the $S^1$ domain coordinates of the curve. As
we show, this right action unlocks an important degree of freedom for
geodesically matching the curve shapes using an equivalent fixed boundary value
problem, without being constrained to match corresponding points along the
template and target curves at the endpoint in time.
