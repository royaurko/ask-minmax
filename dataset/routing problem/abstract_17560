We first consider the following problem. We are given a fixed perfect
matching $M$ of $[n]$ and we add random edges one at a time until there is a
Hamilton cycle containing $M$. We show that w.h.p. the hitting time for this
event is the same as that for the first time there are no isolated vertices in
the graph induced by the random edges. We then use this result for the
following problem. We generate random edges and randomly color them black or
white. A path/cycle is said to \emph{zebraic} if the colors alternate along the
path. We show that w.h.p. the hitting time for a zebraic Hamilton cycle
coincides with every vertex meeting at least one edge of each color. We then
consider some related problems and extend to multiple colors.
