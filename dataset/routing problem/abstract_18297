We consider the nonlinear boundary value problem consisting of the equation
\tag{1} -u" = f(u) + h, \quad \text{a.e. on $(-1,1)$,} where $h \in L^1(-1,1)$,
together with the multi-point, Dirichlet-type boundary conditions \tag{2} u(\pm
1) = \sum^{m^\pm}_{i=1}\alpha^\pm_i u(\eta^\pm_i) where $m^\pm \ge 1$ are
integers, $\alpha^\pm = (\alpha_1^\pm, ...,\alpha_m^\pm) \in [0,1)^{m^\pm}$,
$\eta^\pm \in (-1,1)^{m^\pm}$, and we suppose that $$
  \sum_{i=1}^{m^\pm} \alpha_i^\pm < 1 . $$ We also suppose that $f : \mathbb{R}
\to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, and $$ 0 < f_{\pm\infty}:=\lim_{s \to \pm\infty}
\frac{f(s)}{s} < \infty. $$ We allow $f_{\infty} \ne f_{-\infty}$ --- such a
nonlinearity $f$ is {\em jumping}.
  Related to (1) is the equation \tag{3} -u" = \lambda(a u^+ - b u^-), \quad
\text{on $(-1,1)$,} where $\lambda,\,a,\,b > 0$, and $u^{\pm}(x) =\max\{\pm
u(x),0\}$ for $x \in [-1,1]$. The problem (2)-(3) is `positively-homogeneous'
and jumping. Regarding $a,\,b$ as fixed, values of $\lambda = \lambda(a,b)$ for
which (2)-(3) has a non-trivial solution $u$ will be called {\em
half-eigenvalues}, while the corresponding solutions $u$ will be called {\em
half-eigenfunctions}.
  We show that a sequence of half-eigenvalues exists, the corresponding
half-eigenfunctions having specified nodal properties, and we obtain certain
spectral and degree theoretic properties of the set of half-eigenvalues. These
properties lead to solvability and non-solvability results for the problem
(1)-(2). The set of half-eigenvalues is closely related to the `Fucik spectrum'
of the problem, which we briefly describe. Equivalent solvability and
non-solvability results for (1)-(2) are obtained from either the
half-eigenvalue or the Fucik spectrum approach.
