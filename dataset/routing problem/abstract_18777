Multicell coordinated beamforming (MCBF) has been recognized as a promising
approach to enhancing the system throughput and spectrum efficiency of wireless
cellular systems. In contrast to the conventional single-cell beamforming (SBF)
design, MCBF jointly optimizes the beamforming vectors of cooperative base
stations (BSs) (via a central processing unit(CPU)) in order to mitigate the
intercell interference. While most of the existing designs assume that the CPU
has the perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) of mobile
stations (MSs), this paper takes into account the inevitable CSI errors at the
CPU, and study the robust MCBF design problem. Specifically, we consider the
worst-case robust design formulation that minimizes the weighted sum
transmission power of BSs subject to worst-case
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints on MSs. The
associated optimization problem is challenging because it involves infinitely
many nonconvex SINR constraints. In this paper, we show that the worst-case
SINR constraints can be reformulated as linear matrix inequalities, and the
approximation method known as semidefinite relation can be used to efficiently
handle the worst-case robust MCBF problem. Simulation results show that the
proposed robustMCBF design can provide guaranteed SINR performance for the MSs
and outperforms the robust SBF design.
