Density-functional theory based global geometry optimization is used to
scrutinize the possibility of using endohedrally-doped hydrogenated Si clusters
as building blocks for constructing highly magnetic materials. In contrast to
the known clathrate-type facet-sharing, the clusters exhibit a predisposition
to aggregation through double Si-Si bridge bonds. For the prototypical
CrSi$_{20}$H$_{20}$ cluster we show that reducing the degree of hydrogenation
may be used to control the number of reactive sites to which other cages can be
attached, while still preserving the structural integrity of the building block
itself. This leads to a toolbox of CrSi$_{20}$H$_{20-2n}$ monomers with
different number of double "docking sites", that allows building network
architectures of any morphology. For (CrSi$_{20}$H$_{18}$)$_{2}$ dimer and
[CrSi$_{20}$H$_{16}$](CrSi$_{20}$H$_{18}$)$_{2}$ trimer structures we
illustrate that such aggregates conserve the high spin moments of the dopant
atoms and are therefore most attractive candidates for cluster-assembled
materials with unique magnetic properties. The study suggests that the
structural completion of the individual endohedral cages within the
doubly-bridge bonded structures and the high thermodynamic stability of the
obtained aggregates are crucial for potential synthetic polymerization routes
$via$ controlled dehydrogenation.
