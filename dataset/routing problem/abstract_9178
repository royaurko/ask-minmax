In the present study, applications of the SPH method to industrial related
issues are considered by starting from an existing open source 2D SPH code,
namely the SPHYSICS code, which offers an effective ground for numerical
developments, which are performed in order to bring an answer to industrial
problems, such as simulations of solid/fluid coupling in a free surface flow
context. The purpose of the present paper is therefore to expose the numerical
developments which yield an enhanced version (referred to as "SPHYSIC2") of the
initial code. Firstly, the different features added to obtain the operational
code needed for engineering applications are described, and so are the problems
raised on this way, offering a kind of review of SPH methods for engineers.
Secondly, the validation of the proposed code is partially presented with two
well known but difficult test cases, namely the classical "dam break" and
"wedge entry" problems. Thirdly, principles of a method to solve solid/solid
contacts, frequently present in realistic configuration, are exposed and
applied to achieve more complex simulations. Finally, perspectives for new
features of the SPHYSIC2 code are exposed and discussed.
