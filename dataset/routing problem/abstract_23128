The problem of describing isolated rotating bodies in equilibrium in General
Relativity has so far been treated under the assumption of the circularity
condition in the interior of the body. For a fluid without energy flux, this
condition implies that the fluid flow moves only along the angular direction,
i.e. there is no convection. Using this simplification, some recent studies
have provided us with uniqueness and existence results for asymptotically flat
vacuum exterior fields given the interior sources. Here, the generalisation of
the problem to include general sources is studied. It is proven that the
convective motions have no direct influence on the exterior field, and hence,
that the aforementioned results on uniqueness and existence of exterior fields
apply equally in the general case.
