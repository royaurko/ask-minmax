On the basis of the sequence of marginal observables the evolution equations
of the microscopic phase density and its generalizations is discussed. We
introduced dual BBGKY hierarchy for these microscopic observables and their
average values.
  In the space of integrable functions, for initial-value problem of
generalized hydrodynamical equation the existence and uniqueness theorem is
proved.
