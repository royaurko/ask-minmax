We present time-series spectroscopy of two short period cataclysmic
variables, CC Scl and V2051 Oph, to test the efficiency of Doppler
tomography-based methods in constraining orbital parameters of evolved
cataclysmic variables. We find that the Ca~II triplet lines offer superior
diagnostics, revealing emission components from the mass donors and sharp
images of the accretion discs. Furthermore, we use Monte-Carlo methods to
estimate the uncertainties from ensembles of Doppler maps. We compare our new
methods against traditional radial velocity methods and show that they offer a
valid route towards system parameter determination.
  Our analysis of CC Scl suggests a low mass ratio of $q=0.08\pm0.03$ with a
primary velocity of $K_1=37\pm14$ km/s. This mass ratio is in between the pre-
and post-period minimum status, however our $K_1$ solution favours a
post-period minimum system. Our derived parameters for V2051 Oph ($q= 0.16\pm
0.03$, $K_1=97\pm10$ km/s) are in agreement with the eclipse solution
($q=0.19\pm0.03$), offering a direct validation of our methods.
