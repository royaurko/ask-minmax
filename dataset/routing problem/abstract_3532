We present a new Riemann-Hilbert problem formalism for the initial value
problem for the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger (DNLS) equation on the line.
We show that the solution of this initial value problem can be obtained from
the solution of some associated Riemann-Hilbert problem. This new
Riemann-Hilbert problem for the DNLS equation will lead us to use nonlinear
steepest-descent/stationary phase method or Deift-Zhou method to derive the
long-time asymptotic for the DNLS equation on the line.
