We propose a special computational device which uses light rays for solving
the subset-sum problem. The device has a graph-like representation and the
light is traversing it by following the routes given by the connections between
nodes. The nodes are connected by arcs in a special way which lets us to
generate all possible subsets of the given set. To each arc we assign either a
number from the given set or a predefined constant. When the light is passing
through an arc it is delayed by the amount of time indicated by the number
placed in that arc. At the destination node we will check if there is a ray
whose total delay is equal to the target value of the subset sum problem (plus
some constants).
