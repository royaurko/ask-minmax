We present a numerical method for studying the normal modes of accretion
flows around black holes. In this first paper, we focus on two-dimensional,
viscous, hydrodynamic disks, for which the linear modes have been calculated
analytically in previous investigations. We use pseudo-spectral methods and low
storage Runge-Kutta methods to solve the continuity equation, the Navier-Stokes
equation, and the energy equation. We devise a number of test problems to
verify the implementation. These tests demonstrate the ability of spectral
methods to handle accurately advection problems and to reproduce correctly the
stability criteria for differentially rotating hydrodynamic flows. They also
show that our implementation is able to handle sound wave correctly with
non-reflective boundary conditions, to recover the standard solution for a
viscous spreading ring, and produce correctly the Shakura-Sunyaev steady disk
solution. Finally, we have applied our algorithm to the problem of a
non-axisymmetric viscous spreading ring and verify that such configuration is
unstable to non-antisymmetric perturbations.
