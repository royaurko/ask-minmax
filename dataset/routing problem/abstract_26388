The classification of all Hopf algebras of a given finite dimension over an
algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 is a difficult problem. If the
dimension is a prime, then the Hopf algebra is a group algebra. If the
dimension is the square of a prime then the Hopf algebra is a group algebra or
a Taft Hopf algebra. The classification is also complete for dimension 2p or
2p^2, p a prime. Partial results for some other cases are available. For
example, for dimension p^3 the classification of the semisimple Hopf algebras
was done by Masuoka, and the pointed Hopf algebras were classified by
Andruskiewitsch and Schneider, Caenepeel and Dascalescu, and Stefan and van
Oystaeyen independently. Many classification results for the nonsemisimple,
nonpointed, non-copointed case have been proved by the second contributor but the
classification in general for dimension p^3 is still incomplete, up to now even
for dimension 27.
  In this paper we outline some results and techniques which have been useful
in approaching this problem and add a few new ones. We give some further
results on Hopf algebras of dimension p^3 and finish the classification for
dimension 27.
