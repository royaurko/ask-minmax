In this talk I discuss the problems and virtues of SUSY GUTs in four
dimensions. I then show how to solve some of these problems, without foregoing
the virtues, by considering an SO(10) SUSY GUT in five dimensions. I discuss
gauge coupling unification and neutrino masses. In particular, it is shown that
the 5D compactification scale and cutoff scale are determined by fitting the
low energy values of the three standard model gauge couplings. Neutrino masses
can be accommodated.
