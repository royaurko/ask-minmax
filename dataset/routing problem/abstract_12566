We give a new solvability criterion for the boundary
Carath\'{e}odory-Fej\'{e}r problem: given a point $x \in \R$ and, a finite set
of target values $a^0,a^1,...,a^n \in \R$, to construct a function $f$ in the
Pick class such that the limit of $f^{(k)}(z)/k!$ as $z \to x$ nontangentially
in the upper half plane is $a^k$ for $k= 0,1,...,n$. The criterion is in terms
of positivity of an associated Hankel matrix. The proof is based on a reduction
method due to Julia and Nevanlinna.
