We study multiple orthogonal polynomials of type I and type II which have
orthogonality conditions with respect to r measures. These polynomials are
connected by their recurrence relation of order r+1. First we show a relation
with the eigenvalue problem of a banded lower Hessenberg matrix L_n, containing
the recurrence coefficients. As a consequence, we easily find that the multiple
orthogonal polynomials of type I and type II satisfy a generalized
Christoffel-Darboux identity. Furthermore, we explain the notion of multiple
Gaussian quadrature (for proper multi-indices), which is an extension of the
theory of Gaussian quadrature for orthogonal polynomials and was introduced by
C. F. Borges. In particular we show that the quadrature points and quadrature
weights can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalue problem of L_n.
