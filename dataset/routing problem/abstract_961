In this paper, we propose Regional Energy Efficient Cluster Heads based on
Maximum Energy (REECH-ME) Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)
. The main purpose of this protocol is to improve the network lifetime and
particularly the stability period of the network. In REECH-ME, the node with
the maximum energy in a region becomes Cluster Head (CH) of that region for
that particular round and the number of the cluster heads in each round remains
the same. Our technique outperforms LEACH which uses probabilistic approach for
the selection of CHs. We also implement the Uniform Random Distribution Model
to find the packet drop to make this protocol more practical. We also calculate
the confidence interval of all our results which helps us to visualize the
possible deviation of our graphs from the mean value.
