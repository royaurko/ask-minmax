We report an easy and versatile one-step route of synthesis for newly
discovered Fe based superconductor LaFeAsO1-d with d = 0.0 to 0.15. Instead of
widely used high-pressure-high-temperature (HPHT) synthesis, we applied the
normal atmosphere solid-state reaction route. The stoichiometric mixtures of
Fe, La2O3, La and As in ratio LaFeAsO1-d with d = 0.0 to 0.15 are sealed in an
evacuated quartz tube and further heated at 500, 850 and 1100 0C in Ar for 12,
12 and 33 hours respectively in a single step. The resulting compounds are
single phase LaFeAsO crystallized in tetragonal P4/nmm structure. These samples
showed the ground state spin density wave (SDW) like metallic behavior below
around 150 K. In conclusion the ground state of newly discovered Fe based
superconductor is synthesized via an easy one-step solid-state reaction route.
