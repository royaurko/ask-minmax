A general geometrical framework of nonequilibrium thermodynamics is
developed. The notion of macroscopically definable ensembles is developed. The
thesis about macroscopically definable ensembles is suggested. This thesis
should play the same role in the nonequilibrium thermodynamics, as the
Church-Turing thesis in the theory of computability. The primitive
macroscopically definable ensembles are described. These are ensembles with
macroscopically prepared initial states. The method for computing trajectories
of primitive macroscopically definable nonequilibrium ensembles is elaborated.
These trajectories are represented as sequences of deformed equilibrium
ensembles and simple quadratic models between them. The primitive
macroscopically definable ensembles form the manifold in the space of
ensembles. We call this manifold the film of nonequilibrium states. The
equation for the film and the equation for the ensemble motion on the film are
written down. The notion of the invariant film of non-equilibrium states, and
the method of its approximate construction transform the the problem of
nonequilibrium kinetics into a series of problems of equilibrium statistical
physics. The developed methods allow us to solve the problem of macro-kinetics
even when there are no autonomous equations of macro-kinetics.
