We recently proposed two-dimensional coupled photonic crystal microcavity
arrays as a route to achieve a slow-group velocity of light (flat band) in all
crystal directions. In this paper we present the first experimental
demonstration of such structures with a measured group velocity below 0.008c
and discuss the feasibility of applications such as low-threshold photonic
crystal lasers with increased output powers, optical delay components and
sensors.
