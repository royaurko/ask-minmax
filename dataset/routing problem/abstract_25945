The behavior of maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) and the likelihood ratio
statistic in a family of problems involving pointwise nonparametric estimation
of a monotone function is studied. This class of problems differs radically
from the usual parametric or semiparametric situations in that the MLE of the
monotone function at a point converges to the truth at rate $n^{1/3}$ (slower
than the usual $\sqrt{n}$ rate) with a non-Gaussian limit distribution. A
framework for likelihood based estimation of monotone functions is developed
and limit theorems describing the behavior of the MLEs and the likelihood ratio
statistic are established. In particular, the likelihood ratio statistic is
found to be asymptotically pivotal with a limit distribution that is no longer
$\chi^2$ but can be explicitly characterized in terms of a functional of
Brownian motion. Applications of the main results are presented and potential
extensions discussed.
