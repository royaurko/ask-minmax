The reflection of an optical wave from a metal, arising from strong
interactions between the optical electric field and the free carriers of the
metal, is accompanied by a phase reversal of the reflected electric field. A
far less common route to achieve high reflectivity exploits strong interactions
between the material and the optical magnetic field to produce a magnetic
mirror which does not reverse the phase of the reflected electric field. At
optical frequencies, the magnetic properties required for strong interaction
can only be achieved through the use of artificially tailored materials. Here
we experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, the magnetic mirror behavior
of a low-loss, all-dielectric metasurface at infrared optical frequencies
through direct measurements of the phase and amplitude of the reflected optical
wave. The enhanced absorption and emission of transverse electric dipoles
placed very close to magnetic mirrors can lead to exciting new advances in
sensors, photodetectors, and light sources.
