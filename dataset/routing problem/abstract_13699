We propose a new topological charge term in QCD based on flux-tube models. It
couples a superflow of the phase of the quark condensate to the Chern-Simons
current. The usual $\theta$-parameter is replaced by the phase of the quark
condensate, which becomes nontrivial due to the existence of topological
defects such as vortices. This new formulation can address the U(1) problem in
a similar way as in the $\theta$-world and may avoid the strong CP problem as
the new topological charge term is a derivative coupling. Some phenomenological
applications like chiral magnetic effects and possible connections to the
Josephson effect are discussed.
