We demonstrate our simple strategy for renormalization with QED at one-loop
level, basing on an elaboration of the effective field theory philosophy. No
artificial regularization or deformation of the original theory is introduced
here and hence no manipulation of infinities, ambiguities arise instead of
infinities. Ward identities first come to reduce the number of ambiguities, the
residual ones could in principle be removed by imposing physical boundary
conditions. Renormalization group equations arise as "decoupling theorems" in
the underlying theory perspective. In addition, a technical theorem concerning
routing of external momenta is also presented and illustrated with the
self-energy and vertex function as examples.
