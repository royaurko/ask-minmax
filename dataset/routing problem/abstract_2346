We present a simple technique to synthesize ultrafine nanoparticles directly
from bulk multiferroic perovskite powder. The starting materials, which were
ceramic pellets of the nominal compositions of
Bi$_{0.9}$Gd$_{0.1}$Fe$_{1-x}$Ti$_x$O$_3$ (x = 0.00-0.20), were prepared
initially by a solid state reaction technique, then ground into
micrometer-sized powders and mixed with isopropanol or water in an ultrasonic
bath. The particle size was studied as a function of sonication time with
transmission electron microscopic imaging and electron diffraction that
confirmed the formation of a large fraction of single-crystalline nanoparticles
with a mean size of 11-13 nm. A significant improvement in the magnetic
behavior of Bi$_{0.9}$Gd$_{0.1}$Fe$_{1-x}$Ti$_x$O$_3$ nanoparticles compared to
their bulk counterparts was observed at room temperature. This sonication
technique may be considered as a simple and promising route to prepare
ultrafine nanoparticles for functional applications.
