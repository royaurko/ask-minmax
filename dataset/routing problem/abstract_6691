We consider the quasi-linear eigenvalue problem $-\Delta_p u = \lambda g(u)$
subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions on a bounded open set $\Omega$, where
$g$ is a locally Lipschitz continuous functions. Imposing no further conditions
on $\Omega$ or $g$ we show that for small $\lambda$ the problem has a bounded
solution which is unique in the class of all small solutions. Moreover, this
curve of solutions depends continuously on $\lambda$.
