I review the problem of parton saturation and its implications through three
in principal different approaches, but somewhat related: saturation in a
geometrical approach, QCD saturation through the Color Glass Condensate and
perturbative Pomeron approach with initial conditions. I also make some
comments about how that could be related to a Quark Gluon Plasma formation.
