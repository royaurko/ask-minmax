We derive a variational formulation for thin film magnetization problems in
type-II superconductors written in terms of two variables, the electric field
and the magnetization function. A numerical method, based on this formulation,
makes it possible to accurately compute all variables of interest, including
the electric field, for any value of the power in the power law current-voltage
relation characterizing the superconducting material. For high power values we
obtain a good approximation to the critical state model solution. Numerical
simulation results are presented for simply and multiply connected films, and
also for an inhomogeneous film.
