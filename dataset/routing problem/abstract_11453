We discuss the cosmological constant problem in the context of higher
codimension brane world scenarios with infinite-volume extra dimensions. In
particular, by adding higher curvature terms in the bulk action we are able to
find smooth solutions with the property that the 4-dimensional part of the
brane world-volume is flat for a range of positive values of the brane tension.
