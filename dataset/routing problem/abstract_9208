The Cauchy problem for the homogeneous (real and complex) Monge-Ampere
equation (HRMA/HCMA) arises from the initial value problem for geodesics in the
space of Kahler metrics. It is an ill-posed problem. We conjecture that, in its
lifespan, the solution can be obtained by Toeplitz quantizing the Hamiltonian
flow defined by the Cauchy data, analytically continuing the quantization, and
then taking a kind of logarithmic classical limit. In this article, we prove
that in the case of torus invariant metrics (where the HCMA reduces to the
HRMA) this "quantum analytic continuation potential" coincides with the
well-known Legendre transform potential, and hence solves the equation as long
as it is smooth. In the sequel we prove that the Legendre transform potential
ceases to solve the HRMA after that time.
