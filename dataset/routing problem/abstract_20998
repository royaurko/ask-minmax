How can complexity theory and algorithms benefit from practical advances in
computing? We give a short overview of some prior work using practical
computing to attack problems in computational complexity and algorithms,
informally describe how linear program solvers may be used to help prove new
lower bounds for satisfiability, and suggest a research program for developing
new understanding in circuit complexity.
