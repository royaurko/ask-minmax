This paper discusses the problems and possibility of collecting bee dance
data in a linguistic \textit{corpus} and use linguistic instruments such as
Zipf's law and entropy statistics to decide on the question whether the dance
carries information of any kind. We describe this against the historical
background of attempts to analyse non-human communication systems.
