In this article we show that the gravitational field in massive conformal
gravity couples consistently with Dirac spinor fields. We solve the problem of
consistency by considering that the Dirac spinor fields couple with both the
metric field and a scalar field, which are the gravitational field variables of
massive conformal gravity.
