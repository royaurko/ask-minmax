The present paper is the continuity of the previous papers "Non-linear field
theory" I and II. Here on the basis of the electromagnetic representation of
Dirac's electron theory we consider the geometrical distribution of the
electromagnetic fields of the electron-positron. This gives the posibility to
obtain the explanation and solution of many fundamental problems of the QED.
