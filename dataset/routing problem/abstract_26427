The FEAST eigensolver package is a free high-performance numerical library
for solving the Hermitian and non-Hermitian eigenvalue problems, and obtaining
all the eigenvalues and (right/left) eigenvectors within a given search
interval or arbitrary contour in the complex plane. Its originality lies with a
new transformative numerical approach to the traditional eigenvalue algorithm
design - the FEAST algorithm. The FEAST eigensolver combines simplicity and
efficiency and it offers many important capabilities for achieving high
performance, robustness, accuracy, and scalability on parallel architectures.
FEAST is both a comprehensive library package, and an easy to use software. It
includes flexible reverse communication interfaces and ready to use predefined
interfaces for dense, banded and sparse systems. The current version v3.0 of
the FEAST package can address both Hermitian and non-Hermitian eigenvalue
problems (real symmetric, real non-symmetric, complex Hermitian, complex
symmetric, or complex general systems) on both shared-memory and distributed
memory architectures (i.e contains both FEAST-SMP and FEAST-MPI packages). This
User's guide provides instructions for installation setup, a detailed
description of the FEAST interfaces and a large number of examples.
