Index tuning, i.e., selecting the indexes appropriate for a workload, is a
crucial problem in database system tuning. In this paper, we solve index tuning
for large problem instances that are common in practice, e.g., thousands of
queries in the workload, thousands of candidate indexes and several hard and
soft constraints. Our work is the first to reveal that the index tuning problem
has a well structured space of solutions, and this space can be explored
efficiently with well known techniques from linear optimization. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art commercial
and research techniques by a significant margin (up to an order of magnitude).
