The exploration problem in the discrete universe, using identical oblivious
asynchronous robots without direct communication, has been well investigated.
These robots have sensors that allow them to see their environment and move
accordingly. However, the previous work on this problem assume that robots have
an unlimited visibility, that is, they can see the position of all the other
robots. In this paper, we consider deterministic exploration in an anonymous,
unoriented ring using asynchronous, oblivious, and myopic robots. By myopic, we
mean that the robots have only a limited visibility. We study the computational
limits imposed by such robots and we show that under some conditions the
exploration problem can still be solved. We study the cases where the robots
visibility is limited to 1, 2, and 3 neighboring nodes, respectively.
