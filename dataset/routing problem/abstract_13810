Handwritten character recognition is one of the most challenging and ongoing
areas of research in the field of pattern recognition. HCR research is matured
for foreign languages like Chinese and Japanese but the problem is much more
complex for Indian languages. The problem becomes even more complicated for
South Indian languages due to its large character set and the presence of
vowels modifiers and compound characters. This paper provides an overview of
important contributions and advances in offline as well as online handwritten
character recognition of Malayalam scripts.
