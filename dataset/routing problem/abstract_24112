The snags in Nucci(1996)REDUCE algorithm are the intrinsic computational
efforts and the ability to recognize the ignorable variable(s) during the
reduction process of the algorithm. An inappropriate choice of the ignorable
variable(s)may lead to an infinite loop. We construct an isomorphic
transformation which ameliorates these problems, and with which a simple,
definite steps of algebraic process, produced equivalent system of equations to
that of Nucci that are easily solved by Lie point symmetry algorithm.
