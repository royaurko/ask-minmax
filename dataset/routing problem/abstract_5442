We study the computational complexity of basic decision problems for
one-counter simple stochastic games (OC-SSGs), under various objectives.
OC-SSGs are 2-player turn-based stochastic games played on the transition graph
of classic one-counter automata. We study primarily the termination objective,
where the goal of one player is to maximize the probability of reaching counter
value 0, while the other player wishes to avoid this. Partly motivated by the
goal of understanding termination objectives, we also study certain "limit" and
"long run average" reward objectives that are closely related to some
well-studied objectives for stochastic games with rewards. Examples of problems
we address include: does player 1 have a strategy to ensure that the counter
eventually hits 0, i.e., terminates, almost surely, regardless of what player 2
does? Or that the liminf (or limsup) counter value equals infinity with a
desired probability? Or that the long run average reward is >0 with desired
probability? We show that the qualitative termination problem for OC-SSGs is in
NP intersection coNP, and is in P-time for 1-player OC-SSGs, or equivalently
for one-counter Markov Decision Processes (OC-MDPs). Moreover, we show that
quantitative limit problems for OC-SSGs are in NP intersection coNP, and are in
P-time for 1-player OC-MDPs. Both qualitative limit problems and qualitative
termination problems for OC-SSGs are already at least as hard as Condon's
quantitative decision problem for finite-state SSGs.
