The inverse of the star-discrepancy problem asks for point sets $P_{N,s}$ of
size $N$ in the $s$-dimensional unit cube $[0,1]^s$ whose star-discrepancy
$D^\ast(P_{N,s})$ satisfies $$D^\ast(P_{N,s}) \le C \sqrt{s/N},$$ where $C> 0$
is a constant independent of $N$ and $s$. The first existence results in this
direction were shown by Heinrich, Novak, Wasilkowski, and Wo\'{z}niakowski in
2001, and a number of improvements have been shown since then. Until now only
proofs that such point sets exist are known. Since such point sets would be
useful in applications, the big open problem is to find explicit constructions
of suitable point sets $P_{N,s}$.
  We review the current state of the art on this problem and point out some
connections to pseudo-random number generators.
