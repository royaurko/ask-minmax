Considering mean-variance portfolio problems with uncertain model parameters,
we contrast the classical absolute robust optimization approach with the
relative robust approach based on a maximum regret function. Although the
latter problems are NP-hard in general, we show that tractable inner and outer
approximations exist in several cases that are of central interest in asset
management.
