We define the star transform as a generalization of the broken ray transform
introduced by us in previous work. The advantages of using the star transform
include the possibility to reconstruct the absorption and the scattering
coefficients of the medium separately and simultaneously (from the same data)
and the possibility to utilize scattered radiation which, in the case of the
conventional X-ray tomography, is discarded. In this paper, we derive the star
transform from physical principles, discuss its mathematical properties and
analyze numerical stability of inversion. In particular, it is shown that
stable inversion of the star transform can be obtained only for configurations
involving odd number of rays. Several computationally-efficient inversion
algorithms are derived and tested numerically.
