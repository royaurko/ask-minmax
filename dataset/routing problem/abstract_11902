A dressing of a nonspherical potential, which includes $n$ zero range
potentials, is considered. The dressing technique is used to improve ZRP model.
Concepts of the partial waves and partial phases for non-spherical potential
are used in order to perform Darboux transformation. The problem of scattering
on the regular $\hbox{X}_n$ and $\hbox{YX}_n$ structures is studied. The
possibilities of dressed ZRP are illustrated by model calculation of the
low-energy electron-Silane ($\hbox{SiH}_4$) scattering. The results are
discussed. Key words: multiple scattering, silane, zero range potential.
