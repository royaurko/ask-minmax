We consider the inverse problem of determining the highly oscillatory
coefficient $a^\epsilon$ in partial differential equations of the form
$-\nabla\cdot (a^\epsilon\nabla u^\epsilon)+bu^\epsilon = f$ from given
measurements of the solutions. Here, $\epsilon$ indicates the smallest
characteristic wavelength in the problem ($0<\epsilon\ll1$). In addition to the
general difficulty of finding an inverse, the oscillatory nature of the forward
problem creates an additional challenge of multiscale modeling, which is hard
even for forward computations. The inverse problem in its full generality is
typically ill-posed and one common approach is to replace the original problem
with an effective parameter estimation problem. We will here include microscale
features directly in the inverse problem and avoid ill-posedness by assuming
that the microscale can be accurately represented by a low-dimensional
parametrization. The basis for our inversion will be a coupling of the
parametrization to analytic homogenization or a coupling to efficient
multiscale numerical methods when analytic homogenization is not available. We
will analyze the reduced problem, $b = 0$, by proving uniqueness of the inverse
in certain problem classes and by numerical examples and also include numerical
model examples for medical imaging, $b > 0$, and exploration seismology, $b <
0$.
