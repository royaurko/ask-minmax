We consider the problem of constructing semisimple subalgebras of real
(semi-) simple Lie algebras. We develop computational methods that help to deal
with this problem. Our methods boil down to solving a set of polynomial
equations. In many cases the equations turn out to be sufficiently "pleasant"
to be able to solve them. In particular this is the case for S-subalgebras.
