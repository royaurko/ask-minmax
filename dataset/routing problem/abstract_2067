Recently Conlon, Fox, and the contributor gave a new proof of a relative
Szemer\'edi theorem, which was the main novel ingredient in the proof of the
celebrated Green-Tao theorem that the primes contain arbitrarily long
arithmetic progressions. Roughly speaking, a relative Szemer\'edi theorem says
that if S is a set of integers satisfying certain conditions, and A is a subset
of S with positive relative density, then A contains long arithmetic
progressions, and our recent results show that S only needs to satisfy a
so-called linear forms condition.
  This note contains an alternative proof of the new relative Szemer\'edi
theorem, where we directly transfer Szemer\'edi's theorem, instead of going
through the hypergraph removal lemma. This approach provides a somewhat more
direct route to establishing the result, and it gives better quantitative
bounds.
  The proof has three main ingredients: (1) a transference principle/dense
model theorem of Green-Tao and Tao-Ziegler (with simplified proofs given later
by Gowers, and independently, Reingold-Trevisan-Tulsiani-Vadhan) applied with a
discrepancy/cut-type norm (instead of a Gowers uniformity norm as it was
applied in earlier works), (2) a counting lemma established by Conlon, Fox, and
the contributor, and (3) Szemer\'edi's theorem as a black box.
