We provide a characterization of the realisable set covariograms, bringing a
rigorous yet abstract solution to the $S\_2$ problem in materials science. Our
method is based on the covariogram functional for random mesurable sets (RAMS)
and on a result about the representation of positive operators in a locally
compact space. RAMS are an alternative to the classical random closed sets in
stochastic geometry and geostatistics, they provide a weaker framework allowing
to manipulate more irregular functionals, such as the perimeter. We therefore
use the illustration provided by the $S\_{2}$ problem to advocate the use of
RAMS for solving theoretical problems of geometric nature. Along the way, we
extend the theory of random measurable sets, and in particular the local
approximation of the perimeter by local covariograms.
