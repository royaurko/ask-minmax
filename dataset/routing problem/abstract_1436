We derive a generalization of the RKKY interaction to semiconductors using
perturbation theory on a non-degenerated two-impurity Anderson model. In metals
the interaction is mediated by excitations of free carriers over the
Fermi-energy. In semiconductors, where no carriers are present, the only
possible excitations are those of the localized impurity electrons (or holes)
themselves. Thus a possible interaction is closely related to superexchange. We
find an oscillating anti-ferromagnetic spin-spin coupling due to impurity
electron (hole) excitations. By treating the coupling through empty bands
(superexchange) along the same route as carrier mediated interactions (RKKY) it
is easy to compare these two kinds of spin-spin coupling. The interaction
derived here is of special interest for diluted magnetic semiconductors.
