Nanowire arrays exhibit efficient light coupling and strong light trapping,
making them well suited to solar cell applications. The processes that
contribute to their absorption are interrelated and highly dispersive, so the
only current method of optimizing the absorption is by intensive numerical
calculations. We present an efficient alternative which depends solely on the
wavelength-dependent refractive indices of the constituent materials. We choose
each array parameter such that the number of modes propagating away from the
absorber is minimized while the number of resonant modes within the absorber is
maximized. From this we develop a semi-analytic method that quantitatively
identifies the small range of parameters where arrays achieve maximum short
circuit currents. This provides a fast route to optimizing NW array cell
efficiencies by greatly reducing the geometries to study with full device
models. Our approach is general and applies to a variety of materials and to a
large range of array thicknesses.
