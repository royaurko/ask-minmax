We study a class of semi-linear problems involving the fractional Laplacian
under subcritical or critical growth assumptions. We prove that, for the
corresponding functional, local minimizers with respect to a C^0-topology
weighted with a suitable power of the distance from the boundary are actually
local minimizers in the natural H^s-topology.
