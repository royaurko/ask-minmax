This paper concerns the study of the generalized Bolza problem governed by
differential inclusions satisfying the so-called "relaxed one-sided
Lipschitzian" (ROSL) condition with respect to the state variables subject to
various types of nonsmooth endpoint constraints. We construct discrete
approximations of differential inclusions with ROSL right-hand sides by using
the implicit Euler scheme for approximating time derivatives, and then we
justify an appropriate well-posedness of such approximations. Our principal
result establishes the strong approximation (in the sense of the $W^{1,2}$ norm
convergence) of an "intermediate" (between strong and weak minimizers) local
optimal solution of the continuous-time Bolza problem under the ROSL assumption
by optimal solutions of the implicitly discretized finite-difference systems.
Finally, we derive necessary optimality conditions for the discretized Bolza
problems via suitable generalized differential constructions of variational
analysis. The obtained results on the well-posedness of discrete approximations
and necessary optimality conditions allow us to justify a numerical approach to
solve the generalized Bolza problem for one-sided Lipschitzian differential
inclusions by using discrete approximations constructed via the implicit Euler
scheme.
