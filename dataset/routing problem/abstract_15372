When homogenizing elliptic partial differential equations, the so-called
corrector problem is pivotal to compute the macroscale effective coefficients
from the microscale information. To solve this corrector problem in the
periodic setting, Moulinec and Suquet introduced in the mid-nineties a
numerical strategy based on the reformulation of that problem as an integral
equation (known as the Lippmann--Schwinger equation), which is then suitably
discretized. This results in an iterative, matrix-free method, which is of
particular interest for complex microstructures. Since the seminal work of
Moulinec and Suquet, several variants of their scheme have been proposed.
  The aim of this contribution is twofold. First, we provide an overview of
these methods, recast in the language of the applied mathematics community.
These methods are presented as asymptotically consistent Galerkin
discretizations of the Lippmann--Schwinger equation. The bilinear form arising
in the weak form of this integral equation is indeed the sum of a local and a
non-local term. We show that most of the variants proposed in the literature
correspond to alternative approximations of this non-local term. Second, we
propose a mathematical analysis of the discretized problem. In particular, we
prove under mild hypotheses the convergence of these numerical schemes with
respect to the grid-size. We also provide a priori error estimates on the
solution.
  The article closes on a three-dimensional numerical application within the
framework of linear elasticity.
