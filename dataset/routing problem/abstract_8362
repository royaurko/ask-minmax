This paper proposes direct and inverse results for the Dirichlet and
Dirichlet to Neumann problems for complex curves with nodal type singularities.
As an application, we give a method to reconstruct the conformal structure of a
compact surface of the standard three dimensional euclidean space with constant
scalar conductivity from electrical current measurements in a neighborhood of
one of its points.
