Three types of blow-up for a fourth-order degenerate reaction-diffusion
equation are studied by a combination of analytic and numerical methods. At the
critical values of parameters, there occurs a variational problem with a
countable set of solutions obtained by Lysternik--Shnirelman category theory,
which then are extended to neighbouring values of parameters by a homotopy-like
approach.
