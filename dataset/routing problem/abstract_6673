In this paper, an algorithm for determining 3-colorability, i.e. the decision
problem (YES/NO), in planar graphs is presented. The algorithm, although not
exact (it could produce false positives) has two very important features: (i)
it has polynomial complexity and (ii) for every "NO" answer, a "short" proof is
generated, which is of much interest since 3-colorability is a NP-complete
problem and thus its complementary problem is in Co-NP. Hence the algorithm is
exact when it determines that a given planar graph is not 3-colorable since
this is verifiable via an automatic generation of short formal proofs (also
human-readable).
