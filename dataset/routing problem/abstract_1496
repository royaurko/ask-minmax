The Hartree-Fock equations are modified to directly yield Wannier functions
following a proposal of Shukla et al. [Chem. Phys. Lett. 262, 213-218 (1996)].
This approach circumvents the a posteriori application of the Wannier
transformation to Bloch functions. I give a novel and rigorous derivation of
the relevant equations by introducing an orthogonalizing potential to ensure
the orthogonality among the resulting functions. The properties of these,
so-called a priori Wannier functions, are analyzed and the relation of the
modified Hartree-Fock equations to the conventional, Bloch-function-based
equations is elucidated. It is pointed out that the modified equations offer a
different route to maximally localized Wannier functions. Their computational
solution is found to involve an effort that is comparable to the effort for the
solution of the conventional equations. Above all, I show how a priori Wannier
functions can be obtained by a modification of the Kohn-Sham equations of
density-functional theory.
