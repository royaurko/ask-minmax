A greedy omnidirectional relay scheme is developed, and the corresponding
achievable rate region is obtained for the all-source all-cast problem. The
discussions are first based on the general discrete memoryless channel model,
and then applied to the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) models, with both
full-duplex and half-duplex modes.
