The purpose of this paper is to investigate the interplay arising between max
algebra, convexity and scaling problems. The latter, which have been studied in
nonnegative matrix theory, are strongly related to max algebra. One problem is
strict visualisation scaling, which means finding, for a given nonnegative
matrix A, a diagonal matrix X such that all elements of X^{-1}AX are less than
or equal to the maximum cycle geometric mean of A, with strict inequality for
the entries which do not lie on critical cycles. In this paper such scalings
are described by means of the max-algebraic subeigenvectors and Kleene stars of
nonnegative matrices as well as by some concepts of convex geometry.
