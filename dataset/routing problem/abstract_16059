Least squares (LS) fitting is one of the most fundamental techniques in
science and engineering. It is used to estimate parameters from multiple noisy
observations. In many problems the parameters are known a-priori to be bounded
integer valued, or they come from a finite set of values on an arbitrary finite
lattice. In this case finding the closest vector becomes NP-Hard problem. In
this paper we propose a novel algorithm, the Tomographic Least Squares Decoder
(TLSD), that not only solves the ILS problem, better than other sub-optimal
techniques, but also is capable of providing the a-posteriori probability
distribution for each element in the solution vector. The algorithm is based on
reconstruction of the vector from multiple two-dimensional projections. The
projections are carefully chosen to provide low computational complexity.
Unlike other iterative techniques, such as the belief propagation, the proposed
algorithm has ensured convergence. We also provide simulated experiments
comparing the algorithm to other sub-optimal algorithms.
