Matrix coordinate transformations are defined as substitution operators
without requiring an ordering prescription or an inclusion function from the
Abelian coordinate transformations. We construct transforming objects mimicking
most of the properties of tensors. We point out some problems with the matrix
generalization of contravariant vectors. We suggest to use the substitution
operators to search for an inclusion function.
