In this paper, we focus on numerical methods for the genetic drift problems,
which is governed by a degenerated convection-dominated parabolic equation. Due
to the degeneration and convection, Dirac singularities will always be
developed at boundary points as time evolves. In order to find a \emph{complete
solution} which should keep the conservation of total probability and
expectation, three different schemes based on finite volume methods are used to
solve the equation numerically: one is a upwind scheme, the other two are
different central schemes. We observed that all the methods are stable and can
keep the total probability, but have totally different long-time behaviors
concerning with the conservation of expectation. We prove that any extra
infinitesimal diffusion leads to a same artificial steady state. So upwind
scheme does not work due to its intrinsic numerical viscosity. We find one of
the central schemes introduces a numerical viscosity term too, which is beyond
the common understanding in the convection-diffusion community. Careful
analysis is presented to prove that the other central scheme does work. Our
study shows that the numerical methods should be carefully chosen and any
method with intrinsic numerical viscosity must be avoided.
