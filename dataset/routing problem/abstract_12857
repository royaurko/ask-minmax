The Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (MHT) algorithm is known to produce good
results in difficult multi-target tracking situations. However, its
implementation is not trivial, and is associated with a significant programming
effort, code size and long implementation time. We propose a library which
addresses these problems by providing a domain independent implementation of
the most complex MHT operations. We also address the problem of applying
clustering in domain independent manner.
