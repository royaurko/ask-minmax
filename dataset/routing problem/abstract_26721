This paper considers the problem of how to efficiently share a wireless
medium which is subject to harsh external interference or even jamming. While
this problem has already been studied intensively for simplistic single-hop or
unit disk graph models, we make a leap forward and study MAC protocols for the
SINR interference model (a.k.a. the physical model).
  We make two contributions. First, we introduce a new adversarial SINR model
which captures a wide range of interference phenomena. Concretely, we consider
a powerful, adaptive adversary which can jam nodes at arbitrary times and which
is only limited by some energy budget. The second contribution of this paper is
a distributed MAC protocol which provably achieves a constant competitive
throughput in this environment: we show that, with high probability, the
protocol ensures that a constant fraction of the non-blocked time periods is
used for successful transmissions.
