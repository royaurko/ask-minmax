This is a non-standard paper, containing some problems in set theory I have
in various degrees been interested in. Sometimes with a discussion on what I
have to say; sometimes, of what makes them interesting to me, sometimes the
problems are presented with a discussion of how I have tried to solve them, and
sometimes with failed tries, anecdote and opinion. So the discussion is quite
personal, in other words, egocentric and somewhat accidental. As we discuss
many problems, history and side references are erratic, usually kept at a
minimum (``see ... '' means: see the references there and possibly the paper
itself).
  The base were lectures in Rutgers Fall'97 and reflect my knowledge then. The
other half, concentrating on model theory, will subsequently appear.
