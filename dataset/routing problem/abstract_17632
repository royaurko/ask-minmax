Local models are schemes which are intended to model the \'etale-local
structure of p-adic integral models of Shimura varieties. Pappas and Zhu have
recently given a general group-theoretic construction of flat local models with
parahoric level structure for any tamely ramified group, but it remains an
interesting problem to characterize the local models, when possible, in terms
of an explicit moduli problem. In the setting of local models for ramified,
quasi-split GU_n, work towards an explicit moduli description was initiated in
the general framework of Rapoport and Zink's book and was subsequently advanced
by Pappas and Pappas-Rapoport. In this paper we propose a further refinement to
their moduli problem, which we show is both necessary and sufficient to
characterize the (flat) local model in a certain special maximal parahoric case
with signature (n-1,1).
