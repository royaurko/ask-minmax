We address the problem of computing a linear separating form of a system of
two bivariate polynomials with integer coefficients, that is a linear
combination of the variables that takes different values when evaluated at the
distinct solutions of the system. The computation of such linear forms is at
the core of most algorithms that solve algebraic systems by computing rational
parameterizations of the solutions and this is the bottleneck of these
algorithms in terms of worst-case bit complexity. We present for this problem a
new algorithm of worst-case bit complexity $\sOB(d^7+d^6\tau)$ where $d$ and
$\tau$ denote respectively the maximum degree and bitsize of the input (and
where $\sO$ refers to the complexity where polylogarithmic factors are omitted
and $O_B$ refers to the bit complexity). This algorithm simplifies and
decreases by a factor $d$ the worst-case bit complexity presented for this
problem by Bouzidi et al. \cite{bouzidiJSC2014a}. This algorithm also yields,
for this problem, a probabilistic Las-Vegas algorithm of expected bit
complexity $\sOB(d^5+d^4\tau)$.
