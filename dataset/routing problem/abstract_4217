We formulate the Schiffer's conjecture in spectral geometry in the context of
scattering theory. The problem is equivalent to finding a non-trivial solution
in an interior transmission problem. We compare the back-scattering data of the
perturbation along all incident angles. The uniqueness of the inverse
scattering problem along each incident direction proves the Schiffer's
conjecture.
