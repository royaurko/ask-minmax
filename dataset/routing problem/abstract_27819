In this paper we study a singular limit problem for a Navier-Stokes-Korteweg
system with Coriolis force, in the domain $\R^2\times\,]0,1[\,$ and for general
ill-prepared initial data. Taking the Mach and the Rossby numbers to be
proportional to a small parameter $\veps$ going to $0$, we perform the
incompressible and high rotation limits simultaneously. Moreover, we consider
both the constant capillarity and vanishing capillarity regimes. In this last
case, the limit problem is identified as a $2$-D incompressible Navier-Stokes
equation in the variables orthogonal to the rotation axis. If the capillarity
is constant, instead, the limit equation slightly changes, keeping however a
similar structure. Various rates at which the capillarity coefficient can
vanish are also considered: in most cases this will produce an anisotropic
scaling in the system, for which a different analysis is needed. The proof of
the results is based on suitable applications of the RAGE theorem.
