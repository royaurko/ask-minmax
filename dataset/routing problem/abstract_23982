We present a method based on hyperspherical harmonics to solve the nuclear
many-body problem. It is an extension of accurate methods used for studying
few-body systems to many bodies and is based on the assumption that nucleons in
nuclei interact mainly via pairwise forces.This leads to a two-variable
integro-differential equation which is easy to solve. Unlike methods that
utilize effective interactions, the present one employs directly
nucleon-nucleon potentials and therefore nuclear correlations are included in
an unambiguous way. Three body forces can also be included in the formalism.
Details on how to obtain the various ingredients entering into the equation for
the A-body system are given. Employing our formalism we calculated the binding
energies for closed and open shell nuclei with central forces where the bound
states are defined by a single hyperspherical harmonic. The results found are
in agreement with those obtained by other methods.
