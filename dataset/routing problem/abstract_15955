I will review recent progress in our understanding of the nuclear force. In
the course of the 1990's, so-called high-precision, charge-dependent
nucleon-nucleon potentials have been constructed which are, essentially,
phenomenological models. These potentials are now commonly used as input for
exact few-body calculations and microscopic nuclear many-body theory. I will
critically analyses those models and point out their strenghts and weaknesses.
Particular emphasis will be on charge dependence. Other recent research was
conducted on a more basic level: understanding the nuclear force in terms of
the fundamental theory of strong interactions, QCD. Predictions from this
sector are typically qualitative in nature. Thus, the main problem of the
current status in the field is that quantitative models for the nuclear force
have a poor theoretical background, while theory based models yield poor
results. The chief challenge for the new millenium is to overcome this
discrepancy. Chiral effective field theory may be a suitable tool to solve the
problem.
