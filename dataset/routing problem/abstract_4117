Adyan and Rabin showed that most properties of groups cannot be
algorithmically recognized from a finite presentation alone. We prove that, if
one is also given a solution to the word problem, then the class of fundamental
groups of closed, geometric 3-manifolds is algorithmically recognizable. In our
terminology, the class of geometric 3-manifold groups is `recursive modulo the
word problem'.
