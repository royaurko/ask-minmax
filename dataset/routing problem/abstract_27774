Traditionally, numerous simple models such as preferential attachment have
been put forward to reveal the evolution mechanisms of real networks. However,
previous simulations show that real networks usually are driven by various
features instead of single pure mechanism. To solve this problem, some pioneers
proposed a few hybrid models of mixing multiple evolution mechanisms and tried
to uncover the contributions of different mechanisms. In this paper, we
introduce two methods which can tackle this problem: one is based on link
prediction model, and the other is based on likelihood analysis. To examine the
effectiveness, we generate plenty of artificial networks which can be
controlled to follow multiple mechanisms with different weights, so that we can
compare the estimated weights with the true values. The experimental results
show the method based on likelihood analysis performs much better and gives
very accurate estimations. At last, we apply this method to real networks to
see how popularity and clustering co-evolve. We find most of them are affected
by both popularity and clustering, but with quite different weights.
