In the point set embeddability problem, we are given a plane graph $G$ with
$n$ vertices and a point set $S$ with $n$ points. Now the goal is to answer the
question whether there exists a straight-line drawing of $G$ such that each
vertex is represented as a distinct point of $S$ as well as to provide an
embedding if one does exist. Recently, in \cite{DBLP:conf/gd/NishatMR10}, a
complete characterization for this problem on a special class of graphs known
as the plane 3-trees was presented along with an efficient algorithm to solve
the problem. In this paper, we use the same characterization to devise an
improved algorithm for the same problem. Much of the efficiency we achieve
comes from clever uses of the triangular range search technique. We also study
a generalized version of the problem and present improved algorithms for this
version of the problem as well.
