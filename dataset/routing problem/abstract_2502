The hydrogen-based route could be a valuable way to produce steel considering
its low carbon dioxide emissions. In ULCOS, it is regarded as a long-term
option, largely dependent on the emergence of a hydrogen economy. To anticipate
its possible development, it was decided to check the feasibility of using 100%
H2 in a Direct Reduction shaft furnace and to determine the best operating
conditions, through appropriate experimental and modelling work. We developed
from scratch a new model, called REDUCTOR, for simulating this process and
predicting its performance. This sophisticated numerical model is based on the
mathematical description of the detailed physical, chemical and thermal
phenomena occurring. In particular, kinetics were derived from experi-ments.
The current version is suited to the reduction with pure hydrogen, but an
extension of the model to CO is planned so that it will also be adapted to the
simulation and optimisation of the current DR processes. First re-sults have
confirmed that the reduction with hydrogen is much faster than that with CO,
making it possible to design a hydrogen-operated shaft reactor quite smaller
than current MIDREX and HYL.
