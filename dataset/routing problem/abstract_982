The photoelectric properties of complex oxides have prompted interest in
materials with a tunable band gap, because the absorption The substitution of
iron atoms in La-modified bismuth titanate (BLT) can lead to dramatic
improvements in the band gap, however, the substitution of iron atoms in BLT
without forming a BiFeO3 secondary phase is quite challenging. Therefore, a
series of Fe-doped BLT (Fe-BLT) samples were characterized using a solid
reaction at various calcination temperatures (300~900{\deg}C) to remove the
secondary phase. The structural and optical properties were analyzed by X-ray
diffraction and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy. This paper reports
a new route to synthesize a pure Fe-BLT phase with a reduced optical band gap
by high temperature calcination due to the thermal decomposition of BiFeO3
during high temperature calcination. This simple route to reduce the second
phase can be adapted to other complex oxides for use in emerging oxide
optoelectronic devices.
