The problem of clock offset estimation in a two-way timing exchange regime is
considered when the likelihood function of the observation time stamps is
exponentially distributed. In order to capture the imperfections in node
oscillators, which render a time-varying nature to the clock offset, a novel
Bayesian approach to the clock offset estimation is proposed using a factor
graph representation of the posterior density. Message passing using the
max-product algorithm yields a closed form expression for the Bayesian
inference problem.
