The proportionate increase in the size of the data with increase in space
implies that clustering a very large data set becomes difficult and is a time
consuming process.Sampling is one important technique to scale down the size of
dataset and to improve the efficiency of clustering. After sampling allocating
unlabeled objects into proper clusters is impossible in the categorical
domain.To address the problem, Chen employed a method called MAximal
Representative Data Labeling to allocate each unlabeled data point to the
appropriate cluster based on Node Importance Representative and N-Node
Importance Representative algorithms. This paper took off from Chen s
investigation and analyzed and compared the results of NIR and NNIR leading to
the conclusion that the two processes contradict each other when it comes to
finding the resemblance between an unlabeled data point and a cluster.A new and
better way of solving the problem was arrived at that finds resemblance between
unlabeled data point within all clusters, while also providing maximal
resemblance for allocation of data in the required cluster.
