Important advantages of heavy ion beam (HIB) irradiation of matter are
discussed in comparison with traditional sources - laser heating, electron
beam, electrical discharge etc. High penetration length (~ 10 mm) is of primary
importance for investigation of dense matter properties. This gives an
extraordinary chance to reach the uniform heating regime when HIB irradiation
is being used for thermophysical property measurements. Advantages of HIB
heating of highly-dispersive samples are claimed for providing free and
relatively slow quasi-isobaric heating without fast hydrodynamic expansion of
heated sample. Perspective of such HIB application are revised for resolution
of long-time thermophysical problems for uranium and uranium-bearing compounds
(UO2). The priorities in such HIB development are stressed: preferable energy
levels, beam-time duration, beam focusing, deposition of the sample etc.
