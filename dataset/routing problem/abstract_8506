In our work we present two parallel algorithms and their lock-free
implementations using a popular GPU environment Nvidia CUDA. The first
algorithm is the push-relabel method for the flow problem in grid graphs. The
second is the cost scaling algorithm for the assignment problem in complete
bipartite graphs.
