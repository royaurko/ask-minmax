We give a geometric approach to groups defined by automata via the notion of
enriched dual of an inverse transducer. Using this geometric correspondence we
first provide some finiteness results, then we consider groups generated by the
dual of Cayley type of machines. Lastly, we address the problem of the study of
the action of these groups in the boundary. We show that examples of groups
having essentially free actions without critical points lie in the class of
groups defined by the transducers whose enriched dual generate a torsion-free
semigroup. Finally, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions to have
finite Schreier graphs on the boundary yielding to the decidability of the
algorithmic problem of checking the existence of Schreier graphs on the
boundary whose cardinalities are upper bounded by some fixed integer.
