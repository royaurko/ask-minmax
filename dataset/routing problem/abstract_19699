We review some well posed formulations of the evolution part of the Cauchy
problem of General Relativity that we have recently obtained. We include also a
new first order symmetric hyperbolic system based directly on the Riemann
tensor and the full Bianchi identities. It has only physical characteristics
and matter sources can be included. It is completely equivalent to our other
system with these properties.
