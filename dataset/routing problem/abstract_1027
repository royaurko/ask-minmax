In order to find the equilibrium geometries of molecules and solids and to
perform ab initio molecular dynamics, it is necessary to calculate the forces
on the nuclei. We present a correlated sampling method to efficiently calculate
numerical forces and potential energy surfaces in diffusion Monte Carlo. It
employs a novel coordinate transformation, earlier used in variational Monte
Carlo, to greatly reduce the statistical error. Results are presented for
first-row diatomic molecules.
