Abstraction is one of the most important strategies for dealing with the
state space explosion problem in model checking. In the abstract model,
although the state space is largely reduced, however, a counterexample found in
such a model may not be a real counterexample. And the abstract model needs to
be further refined where an NP-hard state separation problem is often involved.
In this paper, a novel method is presented by adding extra variables to the
abstract model for the refinement. With this method, not only the NP-hard state
separation problem is avoided, but also a smaller refined abstract model is
obtained.
