The OPERA collaboration has claimed that muon neutrinos with mean energy of
17.5 GeV travel 730 km from CERN to the Gran Sasso at a speed exceeding that of
light by about 7.5 km/s or 25 ppm. However, we show that such superluminal
neutrinos would lose energy rapidly via the bremsstrahlung of electron-positron
pairs ($\nu\rightarrow \nu+e^-+e^+$). For the claimed superluminal neutrino
velocity and at the stated mean neutrino energy, we find that most of the
neutrinos would have suffered several pair emissions en route, causing the beam
to be depleted of higher energy neutrinos. Thus we refute the superluminal
interpretation of the OPERA result. Furthermore, we appeal to Super-Kamiokande
and IceCube data to establish strong new limits on the superluminal propagation
of high-energy neutrinos.
