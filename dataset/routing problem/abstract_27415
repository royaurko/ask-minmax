We give a characterization for the Alexander Polynomials of closed orientable
3-manifolds M with first Betti number 1, as well as some partial results for
the characterization problem for M having first Betti number > 1. We first
prove an analogue of a theorem of Levine: that the product of an Alexander
polynomial of M with a symmetric polynomial in the same number of variables
having non 0 trace, is again an Alexander polynomial of a closed orientable
3-manifold. Using the fact that there exists M with Alexander polynomial = 1
for M with first Betti number 1, 2 or 3, we conclude that symmetric polynomials
of non 0 trace in 1, 2 or 3 variables are Alexander polynomials of closed
orientable 3-manifolds. When the first Betti number of M is 1 we prove that non
0 trace symmetric polynomials are the only ones that can arise. Finally, for M
with first Betti number > 3 we prove that the Alexander polynomial can not be
1, implying that for such manifolds not all symmetric polynomials having non 0
trace will occur.
