The Randall-Sundrum (RS) framework has a built in protection against flavour
violation, but still generically suffers from little CP problems. The most
stringent bound on flavour violation is due to epsilon_K, which is inversely
proportional to the fundamental Yukawa scale. Hence the RS epsilon_K problem
can be ameliorated by effectively increasing the Yukawa scale with a bulk
Higgs, as was recently observed in arXiv:0810.1016. We point out that
incorporating the constraint from epsilon'/\epsilon_K, which is proportional to
the Yukawa scale, raises the lower bound on the KK scale compared to previous
analyses. The bound is conservatively estimated to be 5.5 TeV, choosing the
most favorable Higgs profile, and 7.5 TeV in the two-site limit. Relaxing this
bound might require some form of RS flavour alignment. As a by-product of our
analysis, we also provide the leading order flavour structure of the theory
with a bulk Higgs.
