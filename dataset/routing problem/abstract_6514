In this paper we consider the problem of simultaneously determining the
time-dependent thermal diffusivity and the temperature distribution in
one-dimensional heat equation in the case of nonlocal boundary and integral
overdetermination conditions. We establish conditions for the existence and
uniqueness of a classical solution of the problem under considerations. We
present some results on the numerical solution with an example.
