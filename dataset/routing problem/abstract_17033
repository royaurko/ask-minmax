The interference imposes a significant negative impact on the performance of
wireless networks. With the continuous deployment of larger and more
sophisticated wireless networks, reducing interference in such networks is
quickly being focused upon as a problem in today's world. In this paper we
analyze the interference reduction problem from a graph theoretical viewpoint.
A graph coloring methods are exploited to model the interference reduction
problem. However, additional constraints to graph coloring scenarios that
account for various networking conditions result in additional complexity to
standard graph coloring. This paper reviews a variety of algorithmic solutions
for specific network topologies.
