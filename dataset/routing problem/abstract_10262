It has been shown in the past that a multistart hillclimbing strategy
compares favourably to a standard genetic algorithm with respect to solving
instances of the multimodal problem generator. We extend that work and verify
if the utilization of diversity preservation techniques in the genetic
algorithm changes the outcome of the comparison. We do so under two scenarios:
(1) when the goal is to find the global optimum, (2) when the goal is to find
all optima.
  A mathematical analysis is performed for the multistart hillclimbing
algorithm and a through empirical study is conducted for solving instances of
the multimodal problem generator with increasing number of optima, both with
the hillclimbing strategy as well as with genetic algorithms with niching.
Although niching improves the performance of the genetic algorithm, it is still
inferior to the multistart hillclimbing strategy on this class of problems.
  An idealized niching strategy is also presented and it is argued that its
performance should be close to a lower bound of what any evolutionary algorithm
can do on this class of problems.
