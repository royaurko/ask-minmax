The Kamioka Liquid-scintillator Anti-Neutrino Detector (KamLAND) has detected
for the first time the disappearance of electron antineutrinos from a
terrestrial source at the 99.95% C.L. Interpreted in terms of neutrino
oscillations, the best fit to the KamLAND data gives a mixing angle 1.0 and a
mass-squared difference 6.9 x 10^-5 eV^2, in excellent agreement with the Large
Mixing Angle solution to the solar neutrino problem. Assuming CPT invariance,
this result excludes other solutions to the solar neutrino problem at > 99.95%
C.L.
