Structured-output learning is a challenging problem; particularly so because
of the difficulty in obtaining large datasets of fully labelled instances for
training. In this paper we try to overcome this difficulty by presenting a
multi-utility learning framework for structured prediction that can learn from
training instances with different forms of supervision. We propose a unified
technique for inferring the loss functions most suitable for quantifying the
consistency of solutions with the given weak annotation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework on the challenging semantic image segmentation
problem for which a wide variety of annotations can be used. For instance, the
popular training datasets for semantic segmentation are composed of images with
hard-to-generate full pixel labellings, as well as images with easy-to-obtain
weak annotations, such as bounding boxes around objects, or image-level labels
that specify which object categories are present in an image. Experimental
evaluation shows that the use of annotation-specific loss functions
dramatically improves segmentation accuracy compared to the baseline system
where only one type of weak annotation is used.
