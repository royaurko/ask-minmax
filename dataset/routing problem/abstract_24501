In this paper, a new transformation is generated from a three variable
Boolean function 3, which is used to produce a self-similar fractal pattern of
dimension 1.58. This very fractal pattern is used to reconstruct the whole
structural position of resources in wireless CDMA network. This reconstruction
minimizes the number of resources in the network and so naturally network
consumption costs are getting reduced. Now -a -days resource controlling and
cost minimization are still a severe problem in wireless CDMA network. To
overcome this problem fractal pattern produced in our research provides a
complete solution of structural position of resources in this Wireless CDMA
Network.
