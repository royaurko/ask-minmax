Here we report on a novel chemical route to synthesize homogenous cobalt
doped titanate nanotubes (CoTNT), using an amorphous Co-doped precursor. The
influence of the synthesis temperature, autoclave dwell time and metal doping
on the structural and microstructural as well as on the optical properties of
the synthesized titanate nanotubes is studied and discussed. The optical band
gaps of the CoTNT samples are red shifted in comparison with the values
determined for the undoped samples, such red shifts bringing the absorption
edge of the CoTNT samples into the visible region. CoTNT materials also
demonstrate particular high adsorption ability for methylene blue, the amount
of the adsorbed dye being higher than the one predictable for a monolayer
formation. This suggests the possibility of intercalation of the dye molecule
between the TiO6 layers of the TNT structure. It is also shown that the
methylene blue sensitized Co-doped nanostructures are highly stable under UV
radiation and present a strong and broad absorption in the visible region.
