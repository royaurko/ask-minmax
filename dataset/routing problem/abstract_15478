In this paper we present an efficient discretization method for the solution
of the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations based on a high order
(Hybrid) Discontinuous Galerkin formulation. The crucial component for the
efficiency of the discretization method is the disctinction between stiff
linear parts and less stiff non-linear parts with respect to their temporal and
spatial treatment. Exploiting the flexibility of operator-splitting time
integration schemes we combine two spatial discretizations which are tailored
for two simpler sub-problems: a corresponding hyperbolic transport problem and
an unsteady Stokes problem. For the hyperbolic transport problem a spatial
discretization with an Upwind Discontinuous Galerkin method and an explicit
treatment in the time integration scheme is rather natural and allows for an
efficient implementation. The treatment of the Stokes part involves the
solution of linear systems. In this case a discretization with Hybrid
Discontinuous Galerkin methods is better suited. We consider such a
discretization for the Stokes part with two important features:
H(div)-conforming finite elements to garantuee exactly divergence-free velocity
solutions and a projection operator which reduces the number of globally
coupled unknowns. We present the method, discuss implementational aspects and
demonstrate the performance on two and three dimensional benchmark problems.
