A very simple nonlinear parallel nonautonomous LCR circuit with Chua's diode
as its only nonlinear element, exhibiting a rich variety of dynamical features,
is proposed as a variant of the simplest nonlinear nonautonomous circuit
introduced by Murali, Lakshmanan and Chua(MLC). By constructing a two-parameter
phase diagram in the $(F-\omega)$ plane, corresponding to the forcing amplitude
(F) and frequency $(\omega)$, we identify, besides the familiar period-doubling
scenario to chaos, intermittent and quasiperiodic routes to chaos as well as
period-adding sequences, Farey sequences, and so on. The chaotic dynamics is
verified by both experimental as well as computer simulation studies including
PSPICE.
