We study linear problems defined on tensor products of Hilbert spaces with an
additional (anti-) symmetry property. We construct a linear algorithm that uses
finitely many continuous linear functionals and show an explicit formula for
its worst case error in terms of the singular values of the univariate problem.
Moreover, we show that this algorithm is optimal with respect to a wide class
of algorithms and investigate its complexity. We clarify the influence of
different (anti-) symmetry conditions on the complexity, compared to the
classical unrestricted problem. In particular, for symmetric problems we give
characterizations for polynomial tractability and strong polynomial
tractability in terms of the amount of the assumed symmetry. Finally, we apply
our results to the approximation problem of solutions of the electronic
Schr\"odinger equation.
