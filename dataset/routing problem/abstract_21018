A topological group G is said to be almost maximally almost-periodic if its
von Neumann radical is non-trivial, but finite. In this paper, we prove that
every abelian group with an infinite torsion subgroup admits a (Hausdorff)
almost maximally almost-periodic group topology. Some open problems are also
formulated.
