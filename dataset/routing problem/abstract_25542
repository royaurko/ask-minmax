The problem of structure formation in relativistic dissipative fluids was
analyzed in a previous work within Eckart's framework, in which the heat flux
is coupled to the hydrodynamic acceleration, additional to the usual
temperature gradient term. It was shown that in such case, the pathological
behavior of fluctuations leads to the disapperance of the gravitational
instability responsible for structure formation. In the present work the
problem is revisited now using a constitutive equation derived from
relativistic kinetic theory. The new relation, in which the heat flux is not
coupled to the hydrodynamic acceleration, leads to a consistent first order in
the gradients formalism. In this case the gravitational instability remains,
and only relativistic corrections to the Jeans wave number are obtained. In the
calculation here shown the non-relativistc limit is recovered, opposite to what
happens in Eckart's case.
