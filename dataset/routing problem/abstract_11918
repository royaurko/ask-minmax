The problem of estimating the spectrum of a density matrix is considered.
Other problems, such as bipartite pure state entanglement, can be reduced to
spectrum estimation. A local operations and classical communication (LOCC)
measurement strategy is shown which is asymptotically optimal. This means that,
for a very large number of copies, it becomes unnecessary to perform collective
measurements which should be more difficult to implement in practice.
