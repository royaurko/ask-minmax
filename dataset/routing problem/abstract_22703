A new category of front propagation problems is proposed in which a spreading
instability evolves through a singular configuration before saturating. We
examine the nature of this front for the viscous Rayleigh instability of a
column of one fluid immersed in another, using the marginal stability criterion
to estimate the front velocity, front width, and the selected wavelength in
terms of the surface tension and viscosity contrast. Experiments are suggested
on systems that may display this phenomenon, including droplets elongated in
extensional flows, capillary bridges, liquid crystal tethers, and viscoelastic
fluids. The related problem of propagation in Rayleigh-like systems that do not
fission is also considered.
