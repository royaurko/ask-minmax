In this paper, we propose variants of Forward-Backward splitting method for
solving the system of splitting inclusion problem. We propose a conceptual
algorithm containing three variant, each of them, have a different projection
steps. The algorithm consist in two parts. The first and main part of our
approach, contains an explicit Armijo-type search in the spirit of the
extragradient-like methods for variational inequalities. The second part of the
scheme consists in special projection steps. The convergence analysis of the
proposed scheme is given assuming monotonicity on both operators, without
Lipschitz continuity assumption on the forward operators. Improving the knows
results in the literature.
