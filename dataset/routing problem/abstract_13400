We consider the small mass asymptotics (Smoluchowski-Kramers approximation)
for the Langevin equation with a variable friction coefficient. The limit of
the solution in the classical sense does not exist in this case. We study a
modification of the Smoluchowski-Kramers approximation. Some applications of
the Smoluchowski-Kramers approximation to problems with fast oscillating or
discontinuous coefficients are considered.
