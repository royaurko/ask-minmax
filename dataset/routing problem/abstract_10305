The development of automated solutions to pattern recognition problems is
important in many areas of scientific research and human endeavour. This paper
describes the implementation of the Pandora Software Development Kit, which
aids the process of designing, implementing and running pattern recognition
algorithms. The Pandora Application Programming Interfaces ensure simple
specification of the building-blocks defining a pattern recognition problem.
The logic required to solve the problem is implemented in algorithms, with all
operations to create or modify event data structures requested by algorithms
and performed by the Pandora framework. This design promotes an approach using
many decoupled algorithms, each addressing specific topologies. Details of
algorithms addressing two pattern recognition problems in High Energy Physics
are presented: reconstruction of events at a high-energy e+e- linear collider
and reconstruction of cosmic ray or neutrino events in a liquid argon time
projection chamber.
