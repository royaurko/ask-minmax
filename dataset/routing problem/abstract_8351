A new approach for the weak noise analysis of exit problems removes an
intrinsic contradiction of an existing method. It applies for both the mean
time and the location of the exits; novel outcomes mainly concern the exits
from entire domains of attraction. Moreover, the involved quasipotential is
obtained without use of a Hamiltonian system in the case of two variables.
