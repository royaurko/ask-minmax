A new test of Lorentz invariance in the weak interactions has been made by
searching for variations in the decay rate of spin-polarized 20Na nuclei. This
test is unique to Gamow-Teller transitions, as was shown in the framework of a
recently developed theory that assumes a Lorentz symmetry breaking background
field of tensor nature. The nuclear spins were polarized in the up and down
direction, putting a limit on the amplitude of sidereal variations of the form
|(\Gamma_{up} - \Gamma_{down})| / (\Gamma_{up} + \Gamma_{down}) < 3 * 10^{-3}.
This measurement shows a possible route toward a more detailed testing of
Lorentz symmetry in weak interactions.
