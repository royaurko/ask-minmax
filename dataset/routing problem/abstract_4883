This paper addresses a problem recently raised by Laurent and Nogueira about
inhomogeneous Diophantine approximation with coprime integers. As a corollary
of our main theorem we obtain an improvement of the best known exponent of
approximation in this problem, from 1/2 to 1-epsilon, for any epsilon>0.
