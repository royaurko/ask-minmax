In [U. Dempwolff: \textit{More Translation Planes and Semifields from
Dembowski-Ostrom Polynomials}, Designs, Codes, Cryptogr. \textbf{68} (1-3)
(2013), 81--103] three classes of rank two presemifields of order $q^{2n}$,
with $q$ and $n$ odd, were exhibited, leaving as an open problem the isotopy
issue. In [M. Lavrauw, G. Marino, O. Polverino, R. Trombetti: \textit{Solution
to an isotopism question concerning rank 2 semifields}, J. Comb. Des., to
appear. DOI: 10.1002/jcd.21382], the contributors faced with this problem answering
the question whether these presemifields are new for $n>3$. In this paper we
complete the study solving the case $n=3$.
