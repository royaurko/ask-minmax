In this paper we propose a new efficient approach for numerical calculation
of equillibriums in multistage transport problems. In the very core of our
approach lies the proper combination of Universal Gradient Method proposed by
Yu. Nesterov (2013) and conception of inexact oracle
(Devolder--Glineur--Nesterov, 2011). In particular our technique allows us to
calculate Wasserstein's Barycenter in a fast manner (this results generalized
M. Cuturi et al. (2014)).
