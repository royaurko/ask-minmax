We prove new global stability estimates for the Gel'fand-Calderon inverse
problem in 3D. For sufficiently regular potentials this result of the present
work is a principal improvement of the result of [G. Alessandrini, Stable
determination of conductivity by boundary measurements, Appl. Anal. 27 (1988),
153-172].
