This is a non-standard paper, containing some problems, mainly in model
theory, which I have, in various degrees, been interested in. Sometimes with a
discussion on what I have to say; sometimes, of what makes them interesting to
me, sometimes the problems are presented with a discussion of how I have tried
to solve them, and sometimes with failed tries, anecdote and opinion. So the
discussion is quite personal, in other words, egocentric and somewhat
accidental. As we discuss many problems, history and side references are
erratic, usually kept at a minimum ("See..." means: see the references there
and possibly the paper itself).
  The base were lectures in Rutgers Fall '97 and reflect my knowledge then. The
other half, math.LO/9906113, concentrating on set theory, is in print, but the
two halves are independent.
  We thank A. Blass, G. Cherlin and R. Grossberg for some corrections.
