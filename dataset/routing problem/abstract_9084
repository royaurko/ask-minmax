A novel view for the emergence of chaos in Lorenz-like systems is presented.
For such purpose, the Lorenz problem is reformulated in a classical mechanical
form and it turns out to be equivalent to the problem of a damped and forced
one dimensional motion of a particle in a two-well potential, with a forcing
term depending on the ``memory'' of the particle past motion. The dynamics of
the original Lorenz system in the new particle phase space can then be
rewritten in terms of an one-dimensional first-exit-time problem. The emergence
of chaos turns out to be due to the discontinuous solutions of the
transcendental equation ruling the time for the particle to cross the
intermediate potential wall. The whole problem is tackled analytically deriving
a piecewise linearized Lorenz-like system which preserves all the essential
properties of the original model.
