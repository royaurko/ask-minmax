In this paper we propose some novel path planning strategies for a double
integrator with bounded velocity and bounded control inputs. First, we study
the following version of the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP): given a set
of points in $\real^d$, find the fastest tour over the point set for a double
integrator. We first give asymptotic bounds on the time taken to complete such
a tour in the worst-case. Then, we study a stochastic version of the TSP for
double integrator where the points are randomly sampled from a uniform
distribution in a compact environment in $\real^2$ and $\real^3$. We propose
novel algorithms that perform within a constant factor of the optimal strategy
with high probability. Lastly, we study a dynamic TSP: given a stochastic
process that generates targets, is there a policy which guarantees that the
number of unvisited targets does not diverge over time? If such stable policies
exist, what is the minimum wait for a target? We propose novel stabilizing
receding-horizon algorithms whose performances are within a constant factor
from the optimum with high probability, in $\real^2$ as well as $\real^3$. We
also argue that these algorithms give identical performances for a particular
nonholonomic vehicle, Dubins vehicle.
