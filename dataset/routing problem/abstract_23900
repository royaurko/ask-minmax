There is a natural action of the braid group on the symmetric matrices with
units on the diagonal, appearing in various fields as Singularity Theory,
Frobenius Manifolds or Isomonodromic deformations of certain classes of linear
differential systems. The problem of finding the finite orbits of this action
for the case of non-degenerate three-dimensional matrices was solved and it was
conjectured that the finite orbits on any non-degenerate matrices correspond to
finite Coxeter groups and conjugacy classes of quasicoxeter elements in them.
In the present work it is considered another extremal case of rank two matrices
of arbitrary dimension. The problem of classification of the orbits in this
case involves an examination of a linear representation of a factor of the
braid group. It is shown that this linear group is a proper subgroup of finite
index in the the symplectic group $Sp(2n,\Z)$ or the semidirect product
$Sp(2n,\Z)\ltimes\Z^{2n}$. The orbits are classified and the indices of these
subgroups are calculated.
