The auxiliary linear problems are presented for all discretization levels of
the Hirota-Ohta system. The structure of these linear problems coincides
essentially with the structure of Nonlinear Schr\"odinger hierarchy. The
squared eigenfunction constraints are found which relate Hirota-Ohta and
Kulish-Sklyanin vectorial NLS hierarchies.
