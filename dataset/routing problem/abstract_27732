Due to the proliferation of applications for the Internet of Things, an
increasing number of machine to machine (M2M) devices are being deployed. In
particular, one of the M2M applications, video surveillance, has been widely
discussed. Long Term Evolution (LTE), which can provide a high rate of data
transmission and wide range of coverage, is a promising standard to serve as an
M2M video surveillance system. In this paper, we studied a performance
maximization problem in an LTE video surveillance system. Given a set of
objects and a set of cameras, each camera has its own performance grade and its
own coverage. The goal is to maximize the performance of the system by
allocating limited resources to cameras while all objects should be monitored
by the selected cameras. We propose a heuristic method to select the cameras
and allocate resources to them to solve the problem. Moreover, to reduce the
load of the LTE system, a dynamic adjustment method is also proposed.
