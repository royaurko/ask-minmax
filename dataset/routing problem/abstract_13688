Dixmier's famous question says the following: Is every algebra endomorphism
of the first Weyl algebra, $A_1(F)$, where $F$ is a zero characteristic field,
an automorphism? Let $\alpha$ be the exchange involution on $A_1(F)$:
$\alpha(x)= y$, $\alpha(y)= x$. An $\alpha$-endomorphism of $A_1(F)$ is an
endomorphism which preserves the involution $\alpha$. Then one may ask the
following question, which may be called the "$\alpha$-Dixmier's problem $1$" or
the "starred Dixmier's problem $1$": Is every $\alpha$-endomorphism of $A_1(F)$
an automorphism?
