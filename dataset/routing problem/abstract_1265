The literature of heavy tails (typically) starts with a random walk and finds
mechanisms that lead to fat tails under aggregation. We follow the inverse
route and show how starting with fat tails we get to thin-tails when deriving
the probability distribution of the response to a random variable. We introduce
a general dose-response curve and argue that the left and right-boundedness or
saturation of the response in natural things leads to thin-tails, even when the
"underlying" random variable at the source of the exposure is fat-tailed.
