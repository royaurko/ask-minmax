In this paper, we consider iterative propositional calculi, which are finite
sets of propositional formulas together with the rules of modus ponens and weak
substitution (when formula being substituted must be already inferred). We
construct an undecidable iterative propositional calculus using axioms in 3
variables. Particulary, we show that the general problem of derivability for
these calculi is undecidable.
