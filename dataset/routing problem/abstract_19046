This article studies a numerical relativity approach to the initial value
problem in Anti-de Sitter spacetime relevant for dual non-equilibrium evolution
of strongly coupled non-Abelian plasma undergoing Bjorken expansion. In order
to use initial conditions for the metric obtained in arXiv:0906.4423 we
introduce new, ADM formalism-based scheme for numerical integration of
Einstein's equations with negative cosmological constant. The key novel element
of this approach is the choice of lapse function vanishing at fixed radial
position, enabling, if needed, efficient horizon excision. Various physical
aspects of the gauge theory thermalization process in this setup have been
outlined in our companion article arXiv:1103.3452. In this work we focus on the
gravitational side of the problem and present full technical details of our
setup. We discuss in particular the ADM formalism, the explicit form of initial
states, the boundary conditions for the metric on the inner and outer edges of
the simulation domain, the relation between boundary and bulk notions of time,
the procedure to extract the gauge theory energy-momentum tensor and
non-equilibrium apparent horizon entropy, as well as the choice of point for
freezing the lapse. Finally, we comment on various features of the initial
profiles we consider.
