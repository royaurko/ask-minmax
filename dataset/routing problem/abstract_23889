We use the Milne phase function in the continuum part of the spectrum of the
particular Coulomb problem that has been employed by Bhaduri, Khare, and Law as
an equivalent physical way for calculating the density of zeros of the
Riemann's function on the critical line. The Milne function seems to be a
promising approximate method to calculate the density of prime numbers
