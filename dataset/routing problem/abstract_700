In this paper, we propose a novel energy efficient environment monitoring
scheme for wireless sensor networks, based on data mining formulation. The
proposed adapting routing scheme for sensors for achieving energy efficiency
from temperature wireless sensor network data set. The experimental validation
of the proposed approach using publicly available Intel Berkeley lab Wireless
Sensor Network dataset shows that it is possible to achieve energy efficient
environment monitoring for wireless sensor networks, with a trade-off between
accuracy and life time extension factor of sensors, using the proposed
approach.
