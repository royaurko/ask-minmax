We consider a secondary user (SU) with energy harvesting capability. We
design access schemes for the SU which incorporate random spectrum sensing and
random access, and which make use of the primary automatic repeat request (ARQ)
feedback. We study two problem-formulations. In the first problem-formulation,
we characterize the stability region of the proposed schemes. The sensing and
access probabilities are obtained such that the secondary throughput is
maximized under the constraints that both the primary and secondary queues are
stable. Whereas in the second problem-formulation, the sensing and access
probabilities are obtained such that the secondary throughput is maximized
under the stability of the primary queue and that the primary queueing delay is
kept lower than a specified value needed to guarantee a certain quality of
service (QoS) for the primary user (PU). We consider spectrum sensing errors
and assume multipacket reception (MPR) capabilities. Numerical results show the
enhanced performance of our proposed systems.
