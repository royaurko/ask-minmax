This paper deals with the problem of adaptive multidimensional/multichannel
signal detection in homogeneous Gaussian disturbance with unknown covariance
matrix and structured (unknown) deterministic interference. The aforementioned
problem extends the well-known Generalized Multivariate Analysis of Variance
(GMANOVA) tackled in the open literature. In a companion paper, we have
obtained the Maximal Invariant Statistic (MIS) for the problem under
consideration, as an enabling tool for the design of suitable detectors which
possess the Constant False-Alarm Rate (CFAR) property. Herein, we focus on the
development of several theoretically-founded detectors for the problem under
consideration. First, all the considered detectors are shown to be function of
the MIS, thus proving their CFARness property. Secondly, coincidence or
statistical equivalence among some of them in such a general signal model is
proved. Thirdly, strong connections to well-known simpler scenarios found in
adaptive detection literature are established. Finally, simulation results are
provided for a comparison of the proposed receivers.
