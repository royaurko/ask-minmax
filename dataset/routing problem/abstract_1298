We propose a mid-infrared device based on thermocouple optical antennas for
light sensing and energy harvesting applications. We numerically demonstrate
that antennas are able to generate low-power dc signals by beneficing of the
thermoelectric properties of the metals that constitute them. We theoretically
evaluate the optical-to-electrical conversion efficiency for harvesting
applications and finally discuss strategies to increase its performance.
Thermocouple optical antennas therefore open the route toward the design of
photovoltaic devices.
