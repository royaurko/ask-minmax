We study the computational complexity of problems that arise in abstract
argumentation in the context of dynamic argumentation, minimal change, and
aggregation. In particular, we consider the following problems where always an
argumentation framework F and a small positive integer k are given.
  - The Repair problem asks whether a given set of arguments can be modified
into an extension by at most k elementary changes (i.e., the extension is of
distance k from the given set).
  - The Adjust problem asks whether a given extension can be modified by at
most k elementary changes into an extension that contains a specified argument.
  - The Center problem asks whether, given two extensions of distance k,
whether there is a "center" extension that is a distance at most (k-1) from
both given extensions.
  We study these problems in the framework of parameterized complexity, and
take the distance k as the parameter. Our results covers several different
semantics, including admissible, complete, preferred, semi-stable and stable
semantics.
