We show that Ma's scotogenic model, which is arguably one of the simplest
settings containing a Dark Matter candidate and generating a naturally
suppressed active neutrino mass at 1-loop level, suffers from a potentially
severe hierarchy-type problem. In case the right-handed neutrinos involved have
sufficiently large masses, they can via loop effects drive the mass parameter
of the inert scalar contained in the model towards negative values. This
behaviour leads to a breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ parity symmetry built into
the model which is paramount to keep the setting consistent at low energies --
without it the model would lose its Dark Matter candidate and the neutrino mass
would not be naturally suppressed. Thus, if the breaking occurs at a
sufficiently low scale, it could potentially spoil the success of the whole
model. Trying to avoid this consistency problem leads to a new constraint on
the model parameter space which has not yet been described in the literature.
