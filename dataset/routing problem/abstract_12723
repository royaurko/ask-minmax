We give a new analysis of the RMix algorithm by Chin et al. for the Buffer
Management with Bounded Delay problem (or online scheduling of unit jobs to
maximise weighted throughput). Unlike the original proof of
e/(e-1)-competitiveness, the new one holds even in adaptive-online adversary
model. In fact, the proof works also for a slightly more general problem
studied by Bie{\'n}kowski et al.
