It is well known, by now, that the three-dimensional non-viscous planetary
geostrophic model, with vertical hydrostatic balance and horizontal Rayleigh
friction, coupled to the heat diffusion and transport, is mathematically
ill-posed. This is because the no-normal flow physical boundary condition
implicitly produces an additional boundary condition for the temperature at the
literal boundary. This additional boundary condition is different, because of
the Coriolis forcing term, than the no heat flux physical boundary condition.
Consequently, the second order parabolic heat equation is over determined with
two different boundary conditions. In a previous work we proposed one remedy to
this problem by introducing a fourth-order artificial hyper-diffusion to the
heat transport equation and proved global regularity for the proposed model.
Another remedy for this problem was suggested by R. Salmon by introducing an
additional Rayleigh-like friction term for the vertical component of the
velocity in the hydrostatic balance equation. In this paper we prove the
global, for all time and all initial data, well-posedness of strong solutions
to the three-dimensional Salmon's planetary geostrophic model of ocean
dynamics. That is, we show global existence, uniqueness and continuous
dependence of the strong solutions on initial data for this model.
