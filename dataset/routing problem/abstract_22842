We present an exact diagrammatic approach for the problem of dimer-dimer
scattering in 3D for dimers being a resonant bound state of two fermions in a
spin-singlet state, with corresponding scattering length $a_F$. Applying this
approach to the calculation of the dimer-dimer scattering length $a_B$, we
recover exactly the already known result $a_B=0.60 a_F$. We use the developed
approach to obtain new results in 2D for fermions as well as for bosons.
Namely, we calculate bound state energies for three $bbb$ and four $bbbb$
resonantly interacting bosons in 2D. For the case of resonant interaction
between fermions and bosons we calculate exactly bound state energies of the
following complexes: two bosons plus one fermion $bbf$, two bosons plus two
fermions $bf_{\uparrow}bf_{\downarrow}$, and three bosons plus one fermion
$bbbf$.
