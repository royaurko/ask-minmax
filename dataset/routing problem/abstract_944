The thermodynamic properties of highly charged colloidal suspensions in
contact with a salt reservoir are investigated in the framework of the
Renormalized Jellium Model (RJM). It is found that the equation of state is
very sensitive to the particular thermodynamic route used to obtain it.
Specifically, the osmotic pressure calculated within the RJM using the contact
value theorem can be very different from the pressure calculated using the
Kirkwood-Buff fluctuation relations. On the other hand, Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations show that both the effective pair potentials and the correlation
functions are accurately predicted by the RJM. It is suggested that the lack of
self-consistency in the thermodynamics of the RJM is a result of neglected
electrostatic correlations between the counterions and coions.
