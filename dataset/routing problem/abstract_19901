We examine the problem of constructing spectral representations for two point
correlation functions, needed to write down the QCD sum rules in the medium. We
suggest constructing them from the Feynman diagrams for the correlation
functions. As an example we use this procedure to write the QCD sum rules for
the nucleon current at finite temperature.
