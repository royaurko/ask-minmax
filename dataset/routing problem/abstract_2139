We report the synthesis and physical property characterization of
PrFe1-xCoxAsO with x = 0.0 to 1.0. The studied samples are synthesized by solid
state reaction route via vacuum encapsulation method. The pristine compound
PrFeAsO does not show superconductivity, but rather exhibits a metallic step
like transition due to spin density wave ordering of Fe moments below 150 K,
followed by another upward step due to anomalous ordering of Pr moments at 12
K. Both the Fe-SDW and Pr-TN temperatures decrease monotonically with Co
substitution at Fe site. Superconductivity appears in a narrow range of x from
0.07 to 0.25 with maximum Tc at 11.12 K for x = 0.15. Samples, with x = 0.25
exhibit metallic behavior right from 300 K down to 2 K, without any Fe-SDW or
Pr-TN steps in resistivity. In fact, though Fe-SDW decreases monotonically, the
Pr-TN is disappeared even with x = 0.02. The magneto transport measurements
below 14 Tesla on superconducting polycrystalline Co doped PrFeAsO lead to
extrapolated values of the upper critical fields [Hc2(0)] of up to 60 Tesla.
