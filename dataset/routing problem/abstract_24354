We propose a novel approach for potential on-line treatment verification
using cine EPID (Electronic Portal Imaging Device) images for hypofractionated
lung radiotherapy based on a machine learning algorithm. Hypofractionated
radiotherapy requires high precision. It is essential to effectively monitor
the target to ensure that the tumor is within the beam aperture. We modeled the
treatment verification problem as a two-class classification problem and
applied an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify the cine EPID images
acquired during the treatment into corresponding classes with the tumor inside
or outside of the beam aperture. Training samples were generated for the ANN
using digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) with artificially added shifts
in tumor location to simulate cine EPID images with different tumor locations.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of the
training samples and cine EPID images acquired during the treatment. The
proposed treatment verification algorithm was tested on five hypofractionated
lung patients in a retrospective fashion. On average, our proposed algorithm
achieved a 98.0% classification accuracy, a 97.6% recall rate, and a 99.7%
precision rate.
