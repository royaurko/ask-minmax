The method of dimensionality reduction (MDR) is extended for the axisymmetric
frictionless unilateral Hertz-type contact problem for a viscoelastic
half-space and an arbitrary axisymmetric rigid indenter under the assumption
that an arbitrarily evolving in time circular contact area remains singly
connected during the whole process of indentation. In particular, the MDR is
applied to study in detail the so-called rebound indentation problem, where the
contact radius has a single maximum. It is shown that the obtained closed-form
analytical solution for the rebound indentation displacement (recorded in the
recovery phase, when the contact force vanishes) does not depend on the
indenter shape.
