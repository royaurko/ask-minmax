Our paper is devoted to several problems from the field of modified divisors:
namely exponential and infinitary divisors. We study the behaviour of modified
divisors, sum-of-divisors and totient functions. Main results concern with the
asymptotic behaviour of mean values and explicit estimates of extremal orders.
