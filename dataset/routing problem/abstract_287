We propose and evaluate a scalable position-publish and an accompanying
routing protocol which is efficient despite operating with imperfect
information regarding the destination's location. The traffic generated by our
position-publish protocol fits within the transport capacity of large mobile ad
hoc networks (MANETs) with constant communication bandwidth allocated for
routing overhead, even as the network size increases. The routing protocol
guarantees, with high probability, routes whose lengths are within a constant
"stretch" factor of the shortest path from source to destination. The key idea
underlying the scalability of the publish protocol is for each potential
destination node to send location updates (with frequency decaying with
distance) to a subset of network nodes, structured as annular regions around it
(the natural approach of updating circular regions in distance-dependent
fashion does not scale). The routing protocol must therefore account for the
fact that the source and/or relay nodes may not have estimates of the
destination's location (or may have stale estimates). Spatial and temporal
scaling of protocol parameters are chosen so as to guarantee scalability, route
reliability and route stretch, and these analytical design prescriptions are
verified using simulations.
