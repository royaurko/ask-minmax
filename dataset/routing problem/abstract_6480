One common type of symmetry is when values are symmetric. For example, if we
are assigning colours (values) to nodes (variables) in a graph colouring
problem then we can uniformly interchange the colours throughout a colouring.
For a problem with value symmetries, all symmetric solutions can be eliminated
in polynomial time. However, as we show here, both static and dynamic methods
to deal with symmetry have computational limitations. With static methods,
pruning all symmetric values is NP-hard in general. With dynamic methods, we
can take exponential time on problems which static methods solve without
search.
