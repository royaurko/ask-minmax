This paper is a contribution to the problem of particle localization in
non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics. Our main results will be (1) to formulate
the problem of localization in terms of invariant subspaces of the Hilbert
space, and (2) to show that the rigged Hilbert space incorporates particle
localization in a natural manner.
