We study a variant of the Alt, Caffarelli, and Friedman free boundary problem
with many phases and a slightly different volume term, which we originally
designed to guess the localization of eigenfunctions of a Schr\"odinger
operator in a domain. We prove Lipschitz bounds for the functions and some
nondegeneracy and regularity properties for the domains.
