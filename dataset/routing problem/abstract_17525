Let $X$, $Y$ be two Banach spaces. Let $\varepsilon\geq 0$. A mapping $f:
X\rightarrow Y$ is said to be a standard $\varepsilon-$ isometry if $f(0)=0$
and $|\|f(x)-f(y)\|-\|x-y\||\leq \varepsilon$. In this paper we first show that
if $Y^*$ has the point of $w^*$-norm continuity property (in short, $w^*$-PCP)
or $Y$ is separable, then for every standard $\varepsilon-$ isometry
$f:X\rightarrow Y$ there exists a $w^*$-dense $G_\delta$ subset $\Omega$ of
$ExtB_{X^*}$ such that there is a bounded linear operator $T: Y\rightarrow
C(\Omega,\tau_{w^*})$ with $\|T\|=1$ such that $Tf-Id$ is uniformly bounded by
$4\varepsilon$ on $X$. As a corollary we obtain quantitative characterizations
of separably injectivity of a Banach space and its dual that turn out to give a
positive answer to Qian's problem of 1995 in the setting of universality. We
also discuss Qian's problem for $\mathcal{L}_{\infty,\lambda}$-spaces and
$C(K)$-spaces. Finally, we prove a sharpen quantitative and generalized Sobczyk
theorem.
