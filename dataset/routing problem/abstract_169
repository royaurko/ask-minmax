We consider a communication network with a single source that has a set of
messages and two terminals where each terminal is interested in an arbitrary
subset of messages at the source. A tight capacity region for this problem is
demonstrated. We show by a simple graph-theoretic procedure that any such
problem can be solved by performing network coding on the subset of messages
that are requested by both the terminals and that routing is sufficient for
transferring the remaining messages.
