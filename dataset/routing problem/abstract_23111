We extend our approach for the exact solution of the Riemann problem in
relativistic hydrodynamics to the case in which the fluid velocity has
components tangential to the initial discontinuity. As in one-dimensional
flows, we here show that the wave-pattern produced in a multidimensional
relativistic Riemann problem can be predicted entirely by examining the initial
conditions. Our method is logically very simple and allows for a numerical
implementation of an exact Riemann solver which is both straightforward and
computationally efficient. The simplicity of the approach is also important for
revealing special relativistic effects responsible for a smooth transition from
one wave-pattern to another when the tangential velocities in the initial
states are suitably varied. While the content of this paper is focussed on a
flat spacetime, the local Lorentz invariance allows its use also in fully
general relativistic calculations.
