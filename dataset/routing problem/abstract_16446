In this paper we analyze the global existence of classical solutions to the
initial boundary-value problem for a nonlinear parabolic equation describing
the collective behavior of an ensemble of neurons. These equations were
obtained as a diffusive approximation of the mean-field limit of a stochastic
differential equation system. The resulting Fokker-Planck equation presents a
nonlinearity in the coefficients depending on the probability flux through the
boundary. We show by an appropriate change of variables that this parabolic
equation with nonlinear boundary conditions can be transformed into a non
standard Stefan-like free boundary problem with a source term given by a delta
function. We prove that there are global classical solutions for inhibitory
neural networks, while for excitatory networks we give local well-posedness of
classical solutions together with a blow up criterium. Finally, we will also
study the spectrum for the linear problem corresponding to uncoupled networks
and its relation to Poincar\'e inequalities for studying their asymptotic
behavior.
