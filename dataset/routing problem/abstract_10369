We develop a full theory for the new class of Optimal Entropy-Transport
problems between nonnegative and finite Radon measures in general topological
spaces.
  They arise quite naturally by relaxing the marginal constraints typical of
Optimal Transport problems: given a couple of finite measures (with possibly
different total mass), one looks for minimizers of the sum of a linear
transport functional and two convex entropy functionals, that quantify in some
way the deviation of the marginals of the transport plan from the assigned
measures.
  As a powerful application of this theory, we study the particular case of
Logarithmic Entropy-Transport problems and introduce the new
Hellinger-Kantorovich distance between measures in metric spaces.
  The striking connection between these two seemingly far topics allows for a
deep analysis of the geometric properties of the new geodesic distance, which
lies somehow between the well-known Hellinger-Kakutani and
Kantorovich-Wasserstein distances.
