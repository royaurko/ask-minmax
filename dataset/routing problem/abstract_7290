In this paper we introduce a polynomial time algorithm that solves both the
conjugacy decision and search problems in free abelian-by-infinite cyclic
groups where the input is elements in normal form. We do this by adapting the
work of Bogopolski, Martino, Maslakova, and Ventura in
\cite{bogopolski2006conjugacy} and Bogopolski, Martino, and Ventura in
\cite{bogopolski2010orbit}, to free abelian-by-infinite cyclic groups, and in
certain cases apply a polynomial time algorithm for the orbit problem over
$\Z^n$ by Kannan and Lipton.
