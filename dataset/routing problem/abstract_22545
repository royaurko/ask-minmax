The tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole is expected to
lead to a short bright flare followed by an extended period of low-level
emission. Existing models of the late-time accretion of the stellar debris via
a thin disk imply that the Galactic Center source Sgr A* should be brighter
than currently observed by several orders of magnitude. A similar problem
exists for M31 and M32. This problem could be avoided if thin disk accretion
transitions to low radiative efficiency accretion (e.g., ADAF, CDAF) at low
accretion rates (via ``evaporation'' of the thin disk). Alternatively, we show
that the outer portions of a thin disk may become neutral and unable to sustain
MHD turbulence on a timescale less than the time between tidal disruption
events; this may dramatically shorten the duration of the late accretion phase.
