A correlation function of the XY spin chain is studied at zero temperature.
This is called the Emptiness Formation Probability (EFP) and is expressed by
the Fredholm determinant in the thermodynamic limit. We formulate the
associated Riemann--Hilbert problem and solve it exactly. The EFP is shown to
decay in Gaussian.
