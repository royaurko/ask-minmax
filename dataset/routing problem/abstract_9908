The restricted (equilateral) four-body problem consists of three bodies of
masses m1, m2 and m3 (called primaries) lying in a Lagrangian config- uration
of the three-body problem, i,e,. they remain fixed at the apices of an
equilateral triangle in a rotating coordinate system. A massless fourth body
moves under the Newtonian gravitation law due to the three pri- maries; as in
the restricted three-body problem the fourth mass does not affect the motion of
the three primaries. In this paper we show a global regularization of binary
collisions of the infinitesimal body with two of the primaries.
