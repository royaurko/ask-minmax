We define the flatness and quasi-flatness problems in cosmological models. We
seek solutions to both problems in homogeneous and isotropic Brans-Dicke
cosmologies with varying speed of light. We formulate this theory and find
perturbative, non-perturbative, and asymptotic solutions using both numerical
and analytical methods. For a particular range of variations of the speed of
light the flatness problem can be solved. Under other conditions there exists a
late-time attractor with a constant value of \Omega that is smaller than, but
of order, unity. Thus these theories may solve the quasi-flatness problem, a
considerably more challenging problem than the flatness problem. We also
discuss the related \Lambda and quasi-\Lambda problem in these theories. We
conclude with an appraisal of the difficulties these theories may face.
