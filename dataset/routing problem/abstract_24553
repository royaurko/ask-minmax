We present a simple and easy to implement method for the numerical solution
of a rather general class of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. In many
cases, the considered problems have only a viscosity solution, to which,
fortunately, many intuitive (e.g. finite difference based) discretisations can
be shown to converge. However, especially when using fully implicit time
stepping schemes with their desirable stability properties, one is still faced
with the considerable task of solving the resulting nonlinear discrete system.
In this paper, we introduce a penalty method which approximates the nonlinear
discrete system to first order in the penalty parameter, and we show that an
iterative scheme can be used to solve the penalised discrete problem in
finitely many steps. We include a number of examples from mathematical finance
for which the described approach yields a rigorous numerical scheme and present
numerical results.
