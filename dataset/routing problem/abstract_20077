We consider a cylindrical film of fluid adhering to a rigid cylinder of
fixed radius. The main result is to give the critical (maximum) length for
which such a film of given thickness can be stable. The problem is considered
both when the cylinder remains stationary and when the fluid and the cylinder
are co-rotating at a fixed angular velocity.
