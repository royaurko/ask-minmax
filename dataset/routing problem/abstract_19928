The axion solution of the strong CP problem is reviewed together with the
other strong CP solutions. We also point out the quintessential
axion(quintaxion) whose potential can be extremely flat due to the tiny ratio
of the hidden sector quark mass and the intermediate hidden sector scale. The
quintaxion candidates are supposed to be the string theory axions, the model
independent or the model dependent axions.
