Non-self-adjoint second-order differential pencils on a finite interval with
non-separated quasi-periodic boundary conditions and jump conditions are
studied. We establish properties of spectral characteristics and investigate
the inverse spectral problem of recovering the operator from its spectral data.
For this inverse problem we prove the corresponding uniqueness theorem and
provide an algorithm for constructing its solution.
