We propose a solution to the hyperelliptic Schottky problem, based on the use
of Jacobian Nullwerte and symmetric models for hyperelliptic curves. Both
ingredients are interesting on its own, since the first provide period matrices
which can be geometrically described, and the second have remarkable arithmetic
properties.
