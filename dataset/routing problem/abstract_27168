All-pairs similarity problem asks to find all vector pairs in a set of
vectors the similarities of which surpass a given similarity threshold, and it
is a computational kernel in data mining and information retrieval for several
tasks. We investigate the parallelization of a recent fast sequential
algorithm. We propose effective 1-D and 2-D data distribution strategies that
preserve the essential optimizations in the fast algorithm. 1-D parallel
algorithms distribute either dimensions or vectors, whereas the 2-D parallel
algorithm distributes data both ways. Additional contributions to the 1-D
vertical distribution include a local pruning strategy to reduce the number of
candidates, a recursive pruning algorithm, and block processing to reduce
imbalance. The parallel algorithms were programmed in OCaml which affords much
convenience. Our experiments indicate that the performance depends on the
dataset, therefore a variety of parallelizations is useful.
