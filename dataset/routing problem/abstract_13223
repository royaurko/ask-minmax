We consider integer programming and the semi-group membership problem. We
provide the following theorem of the alternative: the system Ax=b has no
nonnegative integral solution x if and only if p(b) <0 for some given
polynomial p whose vector of coefficients lies in a convex cone that we
characterize. We also provide a hierarchy of linear programming relaxations,
where the continuous case Ax=b with x real and nonnegative, describes the first
relaxation in the hierarchy.
