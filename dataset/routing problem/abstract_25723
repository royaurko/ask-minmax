Recent development of the resonance scattering theory with a transient from
the regular to chaotic internal dynamics inspires renewed interest to the
problem of the elastic enhancement phenomenon. We reexamine the question what
the experimentally observed value of the elastic enhancement factor can tell us
about the character of dynamics of the intermediate system. Noting first a
remarkable connection of this factor with the time delays variance in the case
of the standard Gaussian ensembles we then prove the universal nature of such a
relation. This reduces our problem to that of calculation of the Dyson's binary
form factor in the whole transition region. By the example of systems with no
time-reversal symmetry we then demonstrate that the enhancement can serve as a
measure of the degree of internal chaos.
