In this paper we introduce an integer-valued degree for second order fully
nonlinear elliptic operators with nonlinear oblique boundary conditions. We
also give some applications to the existence of solutions of certain nonlinear
elliptic equations arising from a Yamabe problem with boundary and reflector
problems.
