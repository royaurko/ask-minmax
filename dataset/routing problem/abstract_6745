This paper concerns continuous dependence estimates for
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs operators (briefly, HJBI). For the parabolic
Cauchy problem, we establish such an estimate in the whole space
$[0,+\infty)\times\Rn$. Moreover, under some periodicity and ellipticity
assumptions, we obtain a similar estimate for the ergodic constant associated
to the HJBI operator. An interesting byproduct of the latter result will be the
local uniform convergence for some classes of singular perturbation problems.
