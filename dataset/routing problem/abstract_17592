Analytical solutions of the Coulomb impurity problem of graphene in the
absence of a magnetic field show that when the dimensionless strength of the
Coulomb potential $g$ reaches a critical value the solutions become
supercritical with imaginary eigenenergies. Application of a magnetic field is
a singular perturbation, and no analytical solutions are known except at a
denumerably infinite set of magnetic fields. We find solutions of this problem
by numerical diagonalization of large Hamiltonian matrices. Solutions are
qualitatively different from those of zero magnetic field. All energies are
discrete and no complex energies allowed. We have computed the finite-size
scaling function of the probability density containing s-wave component of
Dirac wavefunctions. This function depends on the coupling constant,
regularization parameter, and the gap. In the limit of vanishing regularization
parameter our findings are consistent with the expected values exponent $\nu$
which determines of the asymptotic behavior of the wavefunction near $r=0$.
