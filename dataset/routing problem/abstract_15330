Estimation of parameters of a diffusion based on discrete time observations
poses a difficult problem due to the lack of a closed form expression for the
likelihood. From a Bayesian computational perspective it can be casted as a
missing data problem where the diffusion bridges in between discrete-time
observations are missing. Next, the computational problem can be dealt with
using a Markov-chain Monte-Carlo method known as data-augmentation.
  However, if unknown parameters appear in the diffusion coefficient, direct
implementation of data-augmentation results in a Markov chain that is
reducible. Furthermore, data-augmentation requires efficient sampling of
diffusion bridges, which can be difficult, especially in the multidimensional
case.
  We present a general framework to deal with with these problems that does not
rely on discretisation. The construction generalises previous approaches and
sheds light on the assumptions necessary to make these approaches work. We
illustrate our methods using guided proposals for sampling diffusion bridges.
These are Markov processes obtained by adding a guiding term to the drift of
the diffusion. In a number of examples we give general guidelines on the
construction of these proposals. We introduce a time changing and scaling of
the guided proposal process for stable numerical implementation. Two numerical
examples demonstrate the performance of our methods.
