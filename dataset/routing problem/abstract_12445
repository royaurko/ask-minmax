Models predicting the existence of extra spatial dimensions offer compelling
and novel solutions to outstanding problems of the Standard Model. In such
models, our universe exists on a 4 dimensional brane embedded in a larger
dimensional space time. By allowing gravity to propagate in the bulk the
gravitational coupling could be comparable with the other gauge interactions
thus removing the hierarchy problem. The phenomenology of these models could
have dramatic observable effects at the LHC includingthe production and decay
of gravitons and mini black holes. In this note we summarize feasibility
studies for the discovery of strong gravitational interactions at the LHC.
