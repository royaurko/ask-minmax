Local volume-constrained minimizers in anisotropic capillarity problems
develop free boundaries on the walls of their containers. We prove the
regularity of the free boundary outside a closed negligible set, showing in
particular the validity of Young's law at almost every point of the free
boundary. Our regularity results are not specific to capillarity problems, and
actually apply to sets of finite perimeter (and thus to codimension one integer
rectifiable currents) arising as minimizers in other variational problems with
free boundaries.
