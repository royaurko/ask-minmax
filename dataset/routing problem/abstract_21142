We revisit the range minimum query problem and present a new O(n)-space data
structure that supports queries in O(1) time. Although previous data structures
exist whose asymptotic bounds match ours, our goal is to introduce a new
solution that is simple, intuitive, and practical without increasing costs for
query time or space.
