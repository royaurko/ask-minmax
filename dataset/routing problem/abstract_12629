For a given autonomous time-dependent system that generates either a global,
in time, semigroup or else only a local, in time, semigroup, a test involving a
linear eigenvalue problem is given which determines which of 'global' or
'local' holds. Numerical examples are given. A linear transformation A is
defined so that one has 'global' or 'local' depending on whether A does not or
does have a positive eigenvalue. There is a possible application to
Navier-Stokes problems.
