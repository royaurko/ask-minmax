We propose an inexact Uzawa algorithm with two variable relaxation parameters
for solving the generalized saddle-point system. The saddle-point problems can
be found in a wide class of applications, such as the augmented Lagrangian
formulation of the constrained minimization, the mixed finite element method,
the mortar domain decomposition method and the discretization of elliptic and
parabolic interface problems. The two variable parameters can be updated at
each iteration, requiring no a priori estimates on the spectrum of two
preconditioned subsystems involved. The convergence and convergence rate of the
algorithm are analysed. Both symmetric and nonsymmetric saddle-point systems
are discussed, and numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the
robustness and effectiveness of the algorithm.
