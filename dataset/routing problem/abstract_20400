We present some applications of general harmonic/wavelet analysis approach
(generalized coherent states, wavelet packets) to numerical/analytical
calculations in (nonlinear) quasiclassical/quantum beam dynamics problems.
(Naive) deformation quantization, multiresolution representations and Wigner
transform are the key points.
