We give an exact algorithm for the 0-1 Integer Linear Programming problem
with a linear number of constraints that improves over exhaustive search by an
exponential factor. Specifically, our algorithm runs in time
$2^{(1-\text{poly}(1/c))n}$ where n is the number of variables and cn is the
number of constraints. The key idea for the algorithm is a reduction to the
Vector Domination problem and a new algorithm for that subproblem.
