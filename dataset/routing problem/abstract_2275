In cargo logistics, a key performance measure is transport risk, defined as
the deviation of the actual arrival time from the planned arrival time. Neither
earliness nor tardiness is desirable for customer and freight forwarders. In
this paper, we investigate ways to assess and forecast transport risks using a
half-year of air cargo data, provided by a leading forwarder on 1336 routes
served by 20 airlines. Interestingly, our preliminary data analysis shows a
strong multimodal feature in the transport risks, driven by unobserved events,
such as cargo missing flights. To accommodate this feature, we introduce a
Bayesian nonparametric model -- the probit stick-breaking process (PSBP)
mixture model -- for flexible estimation of the conditional (i.e.,
state-dependent) density function of transport risk. We demonstrate that using
simpler methods, such as OLS linear regression, can lead to misleading
inferences. Our model provides a tool for the forwarder to offer customized
price and service quotes. It can also generate baseline airline performance to
enable fair supplier evaluation. Furthermore, the method allows us to separate
recurrent risks from disruption risks. This is important, because hedging
strategies for these two kinds of risks are often drastically different.
