A novel approach to unstructured quadrilateral mesh generation for planar
domains is presented. Away from irregular vertices, the resulting meshes have
the properties of nearly conformal grids. The technique is based on a
theoretical relation between the present problem, and the inverse Poisson (IP)
problem with point sources. An IP algorithm is described, which constructs a
point-source distribution, whose sources correspond to the irregular vertices
of the mesh. Both the background theory and the IP algorithm address the global
nature of the mesh generation problem. The IP algorithm is incorporated in a
complete mesh generation scheme, which also includes an algorithm for creating
the final mesh. Example results are presented and discussed.
