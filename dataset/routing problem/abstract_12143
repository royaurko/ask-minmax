In this paper, we focus our attention on the interval temporal logic of the
Allen's relations "meets", "begins", and "begun by" (ABBar for short),
interpreted over natural numbers. We first introduce the logic and we show that
it is expressive enough to model distinctive interval properties,such as
accomplishment conditions, to capture basic modalities of point-based temporal
logic, such as the until operator, and to encode relevant metric constraints.
Then, we prove that the satisfiability problem for ABBar over natural numbers
is decidable by providing a small model theorem based on an original
contraction method. Finally, we prove the EXPSPACE-completeness of the problem
