We prove several decidability and undecidability results for nu-PN, an
extension of P/T nets with pure name creation and name management. We give a
simple proof of undecidability of reachability, by reducing reachability in
nets with inhibitor arcs to it. Thus, the expressive power of nu-PN strictly
surpasses that of P/T nets. We prove that nu-PN are Well Structured Transition
Systems. In particular, we obtain decidability of coverability and termination,
so that the expressive power of Turing machines is not reached. Moreover, they
are strictly Well Structured, so that the boundedness problem is also
decidable. We consider two properties, width-boundedness and depth-boundedness,
that factorize boundedness. Width-boundedness has already been proven to be
decidable. We prove here undecidability of depth-boundedness. Finally, we
obtain Ackermann-hardness results for all our decidable decision problems.
