We show that there exists an algorithm to decide any single equation in the
Heisenberg group in finite time. The method works for all two-step nilpotent
groups with rank-one commutator, which includes the higher Heisenberg groups.
We also prove that the decision problem for systems of equations is unsolvable
in all non-abelian free nilpotent groups.
