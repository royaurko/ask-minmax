The Gauss-Newton algorithm is a popular and efficient centralized method for
solving non-linear least squares problems. In this paper, we propose a
multi-agent distributed version of this algorithm, named Gossip-based
Gauss-Newton (GGN) algorithm, which can be applied in general problems with
non-convex objectives. Furthermore, we analyze and present sufficient
conditions for its convergence and show numerically that the GGN algorithm
achieves performance comparable to the centralized algorithm, with graceful
degradation in case of network failures. More importantly, the GGN algorithm
provides significant performance gains compared to other distributed first
order methods.
