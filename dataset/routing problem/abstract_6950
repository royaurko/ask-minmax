We prove a uniqueness result of solutions for a system of PDEs of
Monge-Kantorovich type arising in problems of mass transfer theory. The results
are obtained under very mild regularity assumptions both on the reference set
$\Omega\subset\mathbf{R}^n$, and on the (possibly asymmetric) norm defined in
$\Omega$. In the special case when $\Omega$ is endowed with the Euclidean
metric, our results provide a complete description of the stationary solutions
to the tray table problem in granular matter theory.
