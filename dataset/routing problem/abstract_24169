In 1977 Anthony Wickstead raised the question of the conditions for all band
preserving linear operators to be order bounded in a vector lattice. This
article overviews the main ideas and results on the Wickstead problem and its
variations, focusing primarily on the case of band preserving operators in a
universally complete vector lattice.
