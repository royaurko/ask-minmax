We report that ZnO nanostructures synthesized by chemical route undergo a
shape transition at ~ 20 nm from spherical to hexagonal morphology thereby
changing the spectral components of the blue-green emission. Spherically shaped
nanocrystals (size range 11 -18 nm) show emission in the range of 555-564 nm
and the emission shifts to the longer wavelength as the size increases. On the
other hand, rods and hexagonal platelets (size range 20-85 nm), which is the
equilibrium morphology after the shape transition, show emission near 465-500
nm and it shifts to shorter wavelength as the size increases. The shape
transition also leads to relaxation of microstrain in the system. Our analysis
shows that the visible emission originates from a defect layer on the
nanostructure surface which is affected by the shape transition. The change in
the spectral component of the blue green emission on change of shape has been
explained as arising from band bending due to depletion layer in smaller
spherical particles which is absent in the larger particles with flat faces.
