The asymptotic behavior of a one-dimensional spectral problem with periodic
coefficient is addressed for high frequency modes by a method of Bloch wave
homogenization. The analysis leads to a spectral problem including both
microscopic and macroscopic eigenmodes. Numerical simulation results are
provided to corroborate the theory.
