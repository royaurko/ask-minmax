In this work we characterize in detail the bifurcation leading to an
excitable regime mediated by localized structures in a dissipative nonlinear
Kerr cavity with a homogeneous pump. Here we show how the route can be
understood through a planar dynamical system in which a limit cycle becomes the
homoclinic orbit of a saddle point (saddle-loop bifurcation). The whole picture
is unveiled, and the mechanism by which this reduction occurs from the full
infinite-dimensional dynamical system is studied. Finally, it is shown that the
bifurcation leads to an excitability regime, under the application of suitable
perturbations. Excitability is an emergent property for this system, as it
emerges from the spatial dependence since the system does not exhibit any
excitable behavior locally.
