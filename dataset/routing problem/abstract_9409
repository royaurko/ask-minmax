The second gradient model of poromechanics, introduced in Part I, is here
linearized in the neighborhood of a prestressed reference configuration to be
applied to the one-dimensional consolidation problem originally considered by
Terzaghi and Biot. Second gradient models allow for the description of boundary
layer effects both in the vicinity of the external surface and the impermeable
wall. The formulated differential problem involves linear pencils of ordinary
differential operators on a finite interval, with boundary conditions depending
on the spectral parameter. Taking into account the dependence of the
differential problem on initial stresses a linear stability analysis is carried
out. Finally,numerical solutions are compared with the corresponding classical
Terzaghi solutions.
