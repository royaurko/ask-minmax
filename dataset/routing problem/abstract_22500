We present in this paper a brief review of Ground-Based Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) experiments. We first recall the main experimental problems
and adopted solutions. We then review the Tenerife experiments, giving an
update together with some new results. Then results and problems from other
experiments are highlighted including IAC-Bartol, Python, Saskatoon, Mobile
Anisotropy Telecope (MAT) and the Owen Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO)
experiments. We next move on to the future ground experiments, in particular
new interferometers such as the Very Small Array (VSA), the Cosmic Background
Imager (CBI) and the Degree Angular Scale Interferometer (DASI/VCA). To finish,
very recent work is presented on joint likelihood analysis for estimation of
cosmological parameters where both CMB results and Large Scale Structure (LSS)
surveys are considered.
