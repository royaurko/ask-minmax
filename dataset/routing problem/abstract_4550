Let G and H be two cographs. We show that the problem to determine whether H
is a retract of G is NP-complete. We show that this problem is fixed-parameter
tractable when parameterized by the size of H. When restricted to the class of
threshold graphs or to the class of trivially perfect graphs, the problem
becomes tractable in polynomial time. The problem is also soluble when one
cograph is given as an induced subgraph of the other. We characterize absolute
retracts of cographs.
