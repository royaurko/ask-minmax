Given a graph $G = (V,E)$, a \emph{perfect dominating set} is a subset of
vertices $V' \subseteq V(G)$ such that each vertex $v \in V(G)\setminus V'$ is
dominated by exactly one vertex $v' \in V'$. An \emph{efficient dominating set}
is a perfect dominating set $V'$ where $V'$ is also an independent set. These
problems are usually posed in terms of edges instead of vertices. Both
problems, either for the vertex or edge variant, remains NP-Hard, even when
restricted to certain graphs families. We study both variants of the problems
for the circular-arc graphs, and show efficient algorithms for all of them.
