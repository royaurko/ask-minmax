In this paper, we will use the maximum principle to give a new proof of the
gradient estimates for mean curvature equations with some oblique derivative
problems. Specially, we shall give a new proof for the capillary problem with
zero gravity in any dimension $n\geq 2$ and Neumann problem in $n=2, 3$
dimensions.
