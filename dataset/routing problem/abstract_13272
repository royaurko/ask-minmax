One of the interesting features with the ellipsoidal models of anisotropy
presented in this paper is their acceptance of analytical solutions for some of
the basic elasticity problems. It was shown by Pouya (2000) and Pouya and Zaoui
(2006) that many closed-form solutions for basic problems involving linear
isotropic materials could be extended by linear transformation to cover a
variety of "ellipsoidal" materials. This paper will describe two main varieties
of ellipsoidal elastic models and show how well they fit the in situ data for
sedimentary rocks; numerical homogenization results for several varieties of
fractured rock masses will also be provided.
