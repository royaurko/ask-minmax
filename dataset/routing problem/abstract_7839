Novikov's problem of semiclassical orbits of quasi-electrons in a normal
metal leads to a correspondance between 3-ply periodic functions in R and
fractals in R P^2. These fractals are the complement of infinitely many open
sets labeled by integer 2-cycles of T^3. Here we present a characterization of
the fractal points in terms of the open sets labels.
