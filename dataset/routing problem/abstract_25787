In this paper, the problem of secret key agreement in state-dependent
multiple access channels with an eavesdropper is studied. For this model, the
channel state information is non-causally available at the transmitters;
furthermore, a legitimate receiver observes a degraded version of the channel
state information. The transmitters can partially cooperate with each other
using a conferencing link with a limited rate. In addition, a backward public
channel is assumed between the terminals. The problem of secret key sharing
consists of two rounds. In the first round, the transmitters wish to share a
common key with the legitimate receiver. Lower and upper bounds on the common
key capacity are established. In a special case, the capacity of the common key
is obtained. In the second round, the legitimate receiver agrees on two
independent private keys with the corresponding transmitters using the public
channel. Inner and outer bounds on the private key capacity region are
characterized. In a special case, the inner bound coincides with the outer
bound. We provide some examples to illustrate our results.
