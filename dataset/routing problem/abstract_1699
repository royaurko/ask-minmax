The sensitivity of human ear is dependent on frequency which is nonlinearly
resolved across the audio spectrum .Now to improve the recognition performance
in a similar non linear approach requires a front -end design, suggested by
empirical evidences. A popular alternative to linear prediction based analysis
is therefore filter bank analysis since this provides a much more
straightforward route to obtain the desired non-linear frequency resolution.
MEL filter bank and BARK filter bank are two popular filter bank analysis
techniques. This paper presents FPGA based implementation of MEL filter bank
and BARK filter bank with different bandwidths and different signal spectrum
ranges. The designs have been implemented using VHDL, simulated and verified
using Xilinx 11.1.For each filter bank, the basic building block is implemented
in Spartan 3E. A comparative study among these two mentioned filter banks is
also done in this paper.
