It is shown that the non-homogeneous Dirichlet and Neuman problems for the
$2^{nd}$-order Seiberg-Witten equation admit a regular solution once the
$\mathcal{H}$-condition (described in the article) is satisfied. The approach
consist in applying the elliptic techniques to the variational setting of the
Seiberg-Witten equation.
