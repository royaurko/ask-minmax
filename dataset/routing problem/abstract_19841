We give an introduction to the heavy-quark effective theory and the $1/m_Q$
expansion, which provide the modern framework for a systematic,
model-independent description of the properties and decays of hadrons
containing a heavy quark. We discuss the applications of these concepts to
spectroscopy and to the weak decays of $B$ mesons.
