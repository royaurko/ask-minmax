We present Bicoq3, a deep embedding of the B system in Coq, focusing on the
technical aspects of the development. The main subjects discussed are related
to the representation of sets and maps, the use of induction principles, and
the introduction of a new de Bruijn notation providing solutions to various
problems related to the mechanisation of languages and logics.
