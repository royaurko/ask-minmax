In this paper, we propose a novel cross-layer ap-proach for video delivery
over Wireless Video Sensor Networks (WVSN)s. We adopt an energy efficient and
adaptive video compression scheme dedicated to the WVSNs, based on the
H.264/AVC video compression standard. The encoder operates using two modes. In
the first mode, the nodes capture the scene following a low frame rate. When an
event is detected, the encoder switches to the second mode with a higher frame
rate and outputs two different types of macroblocks, referring to the region of
interest and the background respectively. Furthermore, we propose an Energy and
Queue Buffer Size Aware MMSPEED-based protocol for reliably and energy
efficiently routing both regions towards the destination. Simulations results
prove that the proposed approach is energy efficient and delivers good quality
video streams. In addition, the proposed routing protocol EQBSA-MMSPEED
outperforms its predecessors, the QBSA-MMSPEED and the MMSPEED, providing 33%
of lifetime extension and 3 dBs of video quality enhancement.
