Solving an integer least squares (ILS) problem usually consists of two
stages: reduction and search. This thesis is concerned with the reduction
process for the ordinary ILS problem and the ellipsoid-constrained ILS problem.
For the ordinary ILS problem, we dispel common misconceptions on the reduction
stage in the literature and show what is crucial to the efficiency of the
search process. The new understanding allows us to design a new reduction
algorithm which is more efficient than the well-known LLL reduction algorithm.
Numerical stability is taken into account in designing the new reduction
algorithm. For the ellipsoid-constrained ILS problem, we propose a new
reduction algorithm which, unlike existing algorithms, uses all the available
information. Simulation results indicate that new algorithm can greatly reduce
the computational cost of the search process when the measurement noise is
large.
