In this talk we discuss a model of inflation based on a simple variant of the
NMSSM, called $\phi$NMSSM \cite{phiNMSSM}, where the additional singlet $\phi$
plays the role of the inflaton in hybrid (or inverted hybrid) type models. As
in the original NMSSM, the $\phi$NMSSM solves the $\mu$ problem of the MSSM via
the VEV of a gauge singlet $N$, but unlike the NMSSM does not suffer from
domain wall problems since the offending $Z_3$ symmetry is replaced by an
approximate Peccei-Quinn symmetry which also solves the strong CP problem, and
leads to an invisible axion with interesting cosmological consequences. The
model predicts a spectral index $n=1$ to one part in $10^{12}$.
