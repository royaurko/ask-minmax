During the last 15 years a novel decay mechanism of excited atoms has been
discovered and investigated. This so called ''Interatomic Coulombic Decay''
(ICD) involves the chemical environment of the electronically excited atom: the
excitation energy is transferred (in many cases over long distances) to a
neighbor of the initially excited particle usually ionizing that neighbor. It
turned out that ICD is a very common decay route in nature as it occurs across
van-der-Waals and hydrogen bonds. The time evolution of ICD is predicted to be
highly complex, as its efficiency strongly depends on the distance of the atoms
involved and this distance typically changes during the decay. Here we present
the first direct measurement of the temporal evolution of ICD using a novel
experimental approach.
