We show that complex (scale-free) network topologies naturally emerge from
hyperbolic metric spaces. Hyperbolic geometry facilitates maximally efficient
greedy forwarding in these networks. Greedy forwarding is topology-oblivious.
Nevertheless, greedy packets find their destinations with 100% probability
following almost optimal shortest paths. This remarkable efficiency sustains
even in highly dynamic networks. Our findings suggest that forwarding
information through complex networks, such as the Internet, is possible without
the overhead of existing routing protocols, and may also find practical
applications in overlay networks for tasks such as application-level routing,
information sharing, and data distribution.
