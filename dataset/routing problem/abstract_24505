The topological fundamental group $\pi_{1}^{top}$ is a homotopy invariant
finer than the usual fundamental group. It assigns to each space a
quasitopological group and is discrete on spaces which admit universal covers.
For an arbitrary space $X$, we compute the topological fundamental group of the
suspension space $\Sigma(X_+)$ and find that $\pi_{1}^{top}(\Sigma(X_+))$
either fails to be a topological group or is the free topological group on the
path component space of $X$. Using this computation, we provide an abundance of
counterexamples to the assertion that all topological fundamental groups are
topological groups. A relation to free topological groups allows us to reduce
the problem of characterizing Hausdorff spaces $X$ for which
$\pi_{1}^{top}(\Sigma(X_+))$ is a Hausdorff topological group to some well
known classification problems in topology.
