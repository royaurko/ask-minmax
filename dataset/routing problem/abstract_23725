We introduce a class of multidimensional Schr\"odinger operators with
elliptic potential which generalize the classical Lam\'e operator to higher
dimensions. One natural example is the Calogero--Moser operator, others are
related to the root systems and their deformations. We conjecture that these
operators are algebraically integrable, which is a proper generalization of the
finite-gap property of the Lam\'e operator. Using earlier results of Braverman,
Etingof and Gaitsgory, we prove this under additional assumption of the usual,
Liouville integrability. In particular, this proves the Chalykh--Veselov
conjecture for the elliptic Calogero--Moser problem for all root systems. We
also establish algebraic integrability in all known two-dimensional cases. A
general procedure for calculating the Bloch eigenfunctions is explained. It is
worked out in detail for two specific examples: one is related to B_2 case,
another one is a certain deformation of the A_2 case. In these two cases we
also obtain similar results for the discrete versions of these problems,
related to the difference operators of Macdonald--Ruijsenaars type.
