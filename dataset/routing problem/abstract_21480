Using the natural extension for $\theta$-expansions, we give an
infinite-order-chain representation of the sequence of the incomplete quotients
of these expansions. Together with the ergodic behavior of a certain
homogeneous random system with complete connections, this allows us to solve a
variant of Gauss-Kuzmin problem for the above fraction expansion.
