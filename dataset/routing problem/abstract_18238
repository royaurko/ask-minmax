Flutter shutter is a technique in which the exposure is chopped into segments
and light is only integrated part of the time. By carefully selecting the
chopping sequence it is possible to better condition the data for
reconstruction problems such as motion deblurring, focal sweeping, and
compressed sensing. The partial exposure trades better conditioning for less
energy. In problems such as motion deblurring the available energy is what
caused the problem in the first place (as strong illumination allows short
exposure thus eliminates motion blur). It is still beneficial because the
benefit from the better conditioning outweighs the cost in energy.
  This documents is focused on light efficient flutter shutter that provides
better conditioning and better energy utilization than conventional flutter
shutter.
