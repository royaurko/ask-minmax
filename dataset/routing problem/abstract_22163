We show that the size of supercritical oriented bond percolation converges
asymptotically in distribution to the standard normal law when suitably
rescaled. This resolves a withstanding for more than thirty years problem by
means of an elementary proof whilst disproving the conjectured scaling. As
byproduct a random-index central limit theorem for associated random variables
is derived. The proof applies to the continuous-time analog of the process,
viz.\ Harris' basic contact process, equally well.
