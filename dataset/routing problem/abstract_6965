Unlike convex case, a local equilibrium point of a nonconvex Nash-Cournot
oligopolistic equilibrium problem may not be a global one. Finding such a local
equilibrium point or even a stationary point of this problem is not an easy
task. This paper deals with a numerical method for Nash-Cournot equilibrium
models involving nonconvex cost functions. We develop a local method to compute
a stationary point of this class of problems. The convergence of the algorithm
is proved and its complexity is estimated under certain assumptions. Numerical
examples are implemented to illustrate the convergence behavior of the proposed
algorithm.
