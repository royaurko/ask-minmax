A classical result due to Blaschke states that for every analytic self-map
$f$ of the open unit disk of the complex plane there exists a Blaschke product
$B$ such that the zero sets of $f$ and $B$ agree. In this paper we show that
there is an analogue statement for critical sets, i.e. for every analytic
self-map $f$ of the open unit disk there is even an indestructible Blaschke
product $B$ such that the critical sets of $f$ and $B$ coincide. We further
relate the problem of describing the critical sets of bounded analytic
functions to the problem of characterizing the zero sets of some weighted
Bergman space as well as to the Berger-Nirenberg problem from differential
geometry. By solving the Berger-Nirenberg problem for a special case we
identify the critical sets of bounded analytic functions with the zero sets of
the weighted Bergman space ${\cal A}_1^2$.
