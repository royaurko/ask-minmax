The method of obtaining new integrable coupled equations through enlarging
spectral problems of known integrable equations, which was recently proposed by
W.-X. Ma, can produce nonintegrable systems as well. This phenomenon is
demonstrated and explained by the example of the enlarged spectral problem of
the Korteweg - de Vries equation.
