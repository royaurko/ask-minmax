In this paper we discuss numerical methods and algorithms for the solution of
NLTE stellar atmosphere problems involving expanding atmospheres, e.g., found
in novae, supernovae and stellar winds. We show how a scheme of nested
iterations can be used to reduce the high dimension of the problem to a number
of problems with smaller dimensions. As examples of these sub-problems, we
discuss the numerical solution of the radiative transfer equation for
relativistically expanding media with spherical symmetry, the solution of the
multi-level non-LTE statistical equilibrium problem for extremely large model
atoms, and our temperature correction procedure. Although modern iteration
schemes are very efficient, parallel algorithms are essential in making large
scale calculations feasible, therefore we discuss some parallelization schemes
that we have developed.
