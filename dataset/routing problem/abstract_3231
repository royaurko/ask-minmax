We study the relationship between the loop problem of a semigroup, and that
of a Rees matrix construction (with or without zero) over the semigroup. This
allows us to characterize exactly those completely zero-simple semigroups for
which the loop problem is context-free. We also establish some results
concerning loop problems for subsemigroups and Rees quotients.
