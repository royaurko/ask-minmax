In this paper, we present Mie coefficients of double-layered sphere and
consider the scattering problem, including the topics on field distribution,
electromagnetic cross section, extinction spectra as well as some potential
peculiar properties arising from the presence of left-handed media. The
formulation presented here can be easily generalized to cases of
multiple-layered spheres.
