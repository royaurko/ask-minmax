We study the complexity of reasoning in abstracts argumentation frameworks
close to graph classes that allow for efficient reasoning methods, i.e.\ to one
of the classes of acyclic, noeven, biparite and symmetric AFs. In this work we
show that certain reasoning problems on the second level of the polynomial
hierarchy still maintain their full complexity when restricted to instances of
fixed distance to one of the above graph classes.
