In an incomplete market driven by time-changed L\'evy noises we consider the
problem of hedging a financial position coupled with the underlying risk of
model uncertainty. Then we study hedging under worst-case-scenario. The
proposed strategies are not necessarily self-financing and include the
interplay of a cost process to achieve the perfect hedge at the end of the time
horizon. The hedging problem is tackled in the framework of stochastic
differential games and it is treated via backward stochastic differential
equations. Two different information flows are considered and the solutions
compared.
