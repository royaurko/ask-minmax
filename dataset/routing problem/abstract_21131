Explicit formulae for the B\'ezier coefficients of the constrained dual
Bernstein basis polynomials are derived in terms of the Hahn orthogonal
polynomials. Using difference properties of the latter polynomials, efficient
recursive scheme is obtained to compute these coefficients. Applications of
this result to some problems of CAGD is discussed.
