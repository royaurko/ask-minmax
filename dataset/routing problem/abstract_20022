A bicomplex structure is associated to the Leznov-Saveliev equation of
integrable models. The linear problem associated to the zero curvature
condition is derived in terms of the bicomplex linear equation. The explicit
example of a Non-Abelian Conformal Affine Toda model is discussed in detail and
its conservation laws are derived from the zero curvature representation of its
equation of motion.
