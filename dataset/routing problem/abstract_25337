The Hierarchical Heavy Hitters problem extends the notion of frequent items
to data arranged in a hierarchy. This problem has applications to network
traffic monitoring, anomaly detection, and DDoS detection. We present a new
streaming approximation algorithm for computing Hierarchical Heavy Hitters that
has several advantages over previous algorithms. It improves on the worst-case
time and space bounds of earlier algorithms, is conceptually simple and
substantially easier to implement, offers improved accuracy guarantees, is
easily adopted to a distributed or parallel setting, and can be efficiently
implemented in commodity hardware such as ternary content addressable memory
(TCAMs). We present experimental results showing that for parameters of primary
practical interest, our two-dimensional algorithm is superior to existing
algorithms in terms of speed and accuracy, and competitive in terms of space,
while our one-dimensional algorithm is also superior in terms of speed and
accuracy for a more limited range of parameters.
