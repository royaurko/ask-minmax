Decomposable dependency models possess a number of interesting and useful
properties. This paper presents new characterizations of decomposable models in
terms of independence relationships, which are obtained by adding a single
axiom to the well-known set characterizing dependency models that are
isomorphic to undirected graphs. We also briefly discuss a potential
application of our results to the problem of learning graphical models from
data.
