In this work we propose a fully-discrete Semi-Lagrangian scheme for a {\it
first order mean field game system}. We prove that the resulting discretization
admits at least one solution and, in the scalar case, we prove a convergence
result for the scheme. Numerical simulations and examples are also discussed.
