We consider the trapping reaction A + B -> B in space dimension d<=2. By
formally eliminating the B particles from the problem we derive an effective
dynamics for the A particles from which the survival probability of a given A
particle and the statistics of its spatial fluctuations can be calculated in a
rather general way. The method can be extended to the study of
annihilation/coalescence reactions, B + B -> 0 or B, in d=2.
