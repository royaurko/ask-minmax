The properties of the evolution equation have been analyzed. The uniqueness
and the existence of solution for the evolution equation with special value of
parameter characterizing intensity of change of external conditions, of the
corresponding iterated equation have been established. On the base of these
facts taking into account some properties of behavior of solution the
uniqueness of the equation appeared in the theory of homogeneous nucleation has
been established. The equivalence of auxiliary problem and the real problem is
shown.
