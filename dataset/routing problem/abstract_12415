Surrogate models are used for global approximation of responses generated by
expensive computer experiments like CFD applications. In this paper, we make
use of structural similarities which are shared by a class of related problems.
We identify these structures by applying statistical shape models. They are
used to build a generic surrogate model approximation to sample data of a new
problem of the same class. In a variable fidelity framework the generic
surrogate model is combined with the sample data to generate an efficient and
globally accurate interpolation model, which requires less costly sample
evaluations than ordinary response surface methods. We demonstrate our method
with an aerodynamic test case and show that it significantly improves the
approximation quality.
