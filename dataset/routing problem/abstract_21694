We obtain continuity in generalized parabolic Morrey spaces of sublinear
integrals generated by the parabolic Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators and its
commutator with $VMO$ functions. The obtained estimates are used to study
global regularity of the solutions of the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem for linear
uniformly parabolic equations with discontinuous coefficients.
