In this paper, we consider the optimal dividend problem for a company. We
describe the surplus process of the company by a diffusion model with regime
switching. The aim of the company is to choose a dividend policy to maximize
the expected total discounted payments until ruin. In this article, we consider
a hybrid dividend strategy, that is, the company is allowed to conduct
continuous dividend strategy as well as impulsive dividend strategy. In
addition, we consider the change of economy, which is characterized by a
markovian regime-switching, and under the setting of two regimes, we solve the
problem and obtain the analytical solution for the value function.
