The problem of maximizing weighted sum rates in the downlink of a multicell
environment is of considerable interest. Unfortunately, this problem is known
to be NP-hard. For the case of multi-antenna base stations and single antenna
mobile terminals, we devise a low complexity, fast and provably convergent
algorithm that locally optimizes the weighted sum rate in the downlink of the
system. In particular, we derive an iterative second-order cone program
formulation of the weighted sum rate maximization problem. The algorithm
converges to a local optimum within a few iterations. Superior performance of
the proposed approach is established by numerically comparing it to other known
solutions.
