Using the Ginzburg-Landau theory for two-band superconductors, we determine
the surface energy, sigma_s, between coexisting normal and superconducting
states at the thermodynamic critical magnetic field. Close to the transition
temperature, where the Ginzburg-Landau theory is applicable, we demonstrate
that the two-band problem maps onto an effective single band problem. While the
order parameters of the two bands may have different amplitudes in the
homogeneous bulk, near the critical temperature the Josephson-like coupling
between the bands leads to the same spatial dependence of both order parameters
near the interface. This finding puts into question the possibility of
intermediate, so called type-1.5 superconductivity, in the regime where the
Ginzburg-Landau theory applies.
