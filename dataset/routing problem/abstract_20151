Realization theory for operator colligations on Pontryagin spaces is used to
study interpolation and factorization in generalized Schur classes. Several
criteria are derived which imply that a given function is almost the
restriction of a generalized Schur function. The role of realization theory in
coefficient problems is also discussed.
