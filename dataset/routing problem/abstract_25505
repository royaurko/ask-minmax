A uniform inf-sup condition related to a parameter dependent Stokes problem
is established. Such conditions are intimately connected to the construction of
uniform preconditioners for the problem, i.e., preconditioners which behave
uniformly well with respect to variations in the model parameter as well as the
discretization parameter. For the present model, similar results have been
derived before, but only by utilizing extra regularity ensured by convexity of
the domain. The purpose of this paper is to remove this artificial assumption.
As a byproduct of our analysis, in the two dimensional case we also construct a
new projection operator for the Taylor-Hood element which is uniformly bounded
in $L^2$ and commutes with the divergence operator. This construction is based
on a tight connection between a subspace of the Taylor-Hood velocity space and
the lowest order Nedelec edge element.
