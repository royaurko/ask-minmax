We consider a cache-aided communications system in which a transmitter
communicates with many receivers over an erasure broadcast channel. The system
serves as a basic model for communicating on-demand content during periods of
high network congestion, where some content can be pre-placed in local caches
near the receivers. We formulate the cache-aided communications problem as a
joint cache-channel coding problem, and characterise some information-theoretic
tradeoffs between reliable communications rates and cache sizes. We show that
if the receivers experience different channel qualities, then using unequal
cache sizes and joint cache-channel coding improves system efficiency.
