We consider the Dirichlet problem $\lambda U - {\mathcal{L}}U= F$ in
\mathcal{O}, U=0 on $\partial \mathcal{O}$. Here $F\in L^2(\mathcal{O}, \mu)$
where $\mu$ is a nondegenerate centered Gaussian measure in a Hilbert space
$X$, $\mathcal{L}$ is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator, and $\mathcal{O}$ is an
open set in $X$ with good boundary. We address the problem whether the weak
solution $U$ belongs to the Sobolev space $W^{2,2}(\mathcal{O}, \mu)$. It is
well known that the question has positive answer if $\mathcal{O} = X$; if
$\mathcal{O} \neq X$ we give a sufficient condition in terms of geometric
properties of the boundary $\partial \mathcal{O}$. The results are quite
different with respect to the finite dimensional case, for instance if
\mathcal{O} is the ball centered at the origin with radius $r$ we prove that
$U\in W^{2,2}(\mathcal{O}, \mu)$ only for small $r$.
