Case-Bsed Reasoning (CBR) is a recent theory for problem-solving and learning
in computers and people.Broadly construed it is the process of solving new
problems based on the solution of similar past problems. In the present paper
we introduce an absorbing Markov chain on the main steps of the CBR process.In
this way we succeed in obtaining the probabilities for the above process to be
in a certain step at a certain phase of the solution of the corresponding
problem, and a measure for the efficiency of a CBR system. Examples are given
to illustrate our results.
