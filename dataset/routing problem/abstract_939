We present an algorithm which computes a planar 2-spanner from an Unit Disk
Graph when the node density is sufficient. The communication complexity in
terms of number of node's identifier sent by the algorithm is $6n$, while the
computational complexity is $O(n\Delta)$, with $\Delta$ the maximum degree of
the communication graph. Furthermore, we present a simple and efficient routing
algorithm dedicated to the computed graph.
  Last but not least, using traditional Euclidean coordinates, our algorithm
needs the broadcast of as few as $3n$ node's identifiers. Under the hypothesis
of sufficient node density, no broadcast at all is needed, reducing the
previous best known complexity of an algorithm to compute a planar spanner of
an Unit Disk Graph which was of $5n$ broadcasts.
