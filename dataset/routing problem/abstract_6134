Recently a partially solvable many-body problem with nearest and next-nearest
neighbour interactions is proposed [cond-mat/9904121]. We show that by adding a
suitably chosen momentum dependent nearest neighbour interaction, such a model
can be converted into an integrable system with Lax operator formulation and
related conserved quantities. We also solve the eigenvalue problem for the
model exactly and as a byproduct obtain some identities involving associated
Laguerre polynomials.
