The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of certain black holes can be computed
microscopically in string theory by mapping the elusive problem of counting
microstates of a strongly gravitating black hole to the tractable problem of
counting microstates of a weakly coupled D-brane system, which has no event
horizon, and indeed comfortably fits on the head of a pin. We show here that,
contrary to widely held beliefs, the entropy of spherically symmetric black
holes can easily be dwarfed by that of stationary multi-black-hole
``molecules'' of the same total charge and energy. Thus, the corresponding
pin-sized D-brane systems do not even approximately count the microstates of a
single black hole, but rather those of a zoo of entropically dominant
multicentered configurations.
