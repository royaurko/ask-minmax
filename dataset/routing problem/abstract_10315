In this paper we are going to solve an open problem about the game tetris. We
are going to give the first results in the complexity of a variant of offline
tetris introduced by Erik Demaine, Susan Hohenberger and David Liben Nowell in
their paper "Tetris is hard, even to approximate". In this variant, that
follows a model of movements introduced by John Brzustowsky, we can move and
rotate a piece the number of times we want in the first row. But then, when we
left the piece fall, we cannot move it or rotate it anymore. We are going to
demonstrate that the problem of maximizing the number of cleared lines of this
variant on a particular game board, is NP-hard by reducing the 3-partition
problem to the problem of clearing the board in this variant of tetris
