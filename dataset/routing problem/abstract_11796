Based on the correspondence of projection to an eigenvalue problem via the
underlying group structure, we generalize the projection algorithm proposed by
Morrison et al. This algorithm is eligible for large-scale computations,
because we can avoid the accumulation of errors. As an example, we apply it to
the spurious c.m. motion in a multi-$\hbar\omega$ shell-model calculation. In
comparison with Lawson's method, the present method is exact and nevertheless
does not need longer CPU time. It is pointed out that the exact treatment of
the spurious c.m. motion is crucial to some physical quantities.
