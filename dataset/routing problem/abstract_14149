This paper presents a new solution to the containment problem for extended
regular expressions that extends basic regular expressions with intersection
and complement operators and consider regular expressions on infinite alphabets
based on potentially infinite character sets. Standard approaches deciding the
containment do not take extended operators or character sets into account. The
algorithm avoids the translation to an expression-equivalent automaton and
provides a purely symbolic term rewriting systems for solving regular
expressions inequalities.
  We give a new symbolic decision procedure for the containment problem based
on Brzozowski's regular expression derivatives and Antimirov's rewriting
approach to check containment. We generalize Brzozowski's syntactic derivative
operator to two derivative operators that work with respect to (potentially
infinite) representable character sets.
