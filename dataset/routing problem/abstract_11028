In the recent Comment [V. M. Krasnov, Phys. Rev. B vol. 65, 096503 (2002)],
the contributor claims to have ''disproved'' our theoretical conclusion [S. V.
Kuplevakhsky, Phys. Rev. B vol. 60, 7496 (1999); Phys. Rev. B vol. 63, 054508
(2001)] that isolated Josephson vortices in layered superconductors and stacked
junctions are absolutely unstable in the presence of an external field. We show
that this claim has no grounds. Moreover, by solving an appropriate boundary
value problem, we obtain a complete classification of soliton (vortex)
solutions to coupled static sine-Gordon equations. We also discuss the problem
of vortex penetration and analyze available experimental data.
