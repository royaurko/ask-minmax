We prove the birational superrigidity and the nonrationality of a cyclic
triple cover of $\mathbb{P}^{2n}$ branched over a nodal hypersurface of degree
$3n$ for $n\ge 2$. In particular, the obtained result solves the problem of the
birational superrigidity of smooth cyclic triple spaces. We also consider
certain relevant problems.
