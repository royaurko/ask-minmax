We analyze a recent application of homotopy perturbation method to some
heat-like and wave-like models and show that its main results are merely the
Taylor expansions of exponential and hyperbolic functions. Besides, the contributors
require more boundary conditions than those already necessary for the solution
of the problem by means of power series.
