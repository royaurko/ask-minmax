Ordered phases such as charge- and spin-density wave state accompany either
full or partial gapping of Fermi surface (FS) leading a metal-insulator or
metal-metal transition (MMT). However, there are examples of MMT without any
signatures of symmetry breaking. One example is Na$_2$Ti$_2$Sb$_2$O, where a
partial gapping of FS is observed but a density wave ordering has not been
found. Here we propose a microscopic mechanism of such a MMT which occurs due
to a momentum dependent spin-orbit coupled molecular orbital polarization.
Since a molecular $d$ orbital polarization is present due to a small spin-orbit
coupling of Ti, there is no spontaneous symmetry breaking involved. However, a
sharp increase of polarization happens above a critical electron interaction
which gaps out the $d$ orbtial FS and reduces the density of states
significantly, while the rest of FS associated with Sb $p$ orbtials is almost
intact across MMT. Experimental implications to test our proposal and
applications to other systems are also discussed.
