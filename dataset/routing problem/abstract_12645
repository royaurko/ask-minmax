Video OCR is a technique that can greatly help to locate the topics of
interest in video via the automatic extraction and reading of captions and
annotations. Text in video can provide key indexing information. Recognizing
such text for search application is critical. Major difficult problem for
character recognition for videos is degraded and deformated characters, low
resolution characters or very complex background. To tackle the problem
preprocessing on text image plays vital role. Most of the OCR engines are
working on the binary image so to find a better binarization procedure for
image to get a desired result is important.Accurate binarization process
minimizes the error rate of video OCR.
