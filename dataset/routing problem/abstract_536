There are various routes for deriving partial radial distribution functions
of disordered systems from experimental diffraction (and/or EXAFS) data. Due to
limitations and errors of experimental data, as well as to imperfections of the
evaluation procedures, it is of primary importance to confirm that the end
result (partial radial distribution functions) and the primary information
(diffraction data) are consistent with each other. We introduce a simple
approach, based on Reverse Monte Carlo modelling, that is capable of assessing
this dilemma. As a demonstration, we use the most frequently cited set of
"experimental" partial radial distribution functions on liquid water and
investigate whether the 3 partials (O-O, O-H and H-H) are consistent with the
total structure factor of pure liquid D_2O from neutron diffraction and that of
H_2O from X-ray diffraction. We find that while neutron diffraction on heavy
water is in full agreement with all the 3 partials, the addition of X-ray
diffraction data clearly shows problems with the O-O partial radial
distribution function. We suggest that the approach introduced here may also be
used to establish whether partial radial distribution functions obtained from
statistical theories of the liquid state are consistent with the measured
structure factors.
