This talk reports on the status of an approach to the numerical study of
isolated systems with the conformal field equations. We first describe the
algorithms used in a code which has been developed at AEI in the last years,
and discuss a milestone result obtained by Huebner. Then we present more recent
results as examples to sketch the problems we face in the conformal approach to
numerical relativity and outline a possible roadmap toward making this approach
a practical tool.
