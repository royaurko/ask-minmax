We present a dark energy model with a double exponential potential for a
minimally coupled scalar field, which allows general exact integration of the
cosmological equations. The solution can perfectly emulate a $\Lambda$-term
model at low-medium redshift, exhibits tracking behavior, and does not show
eternal acceleration.
