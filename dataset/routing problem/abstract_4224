We prove some existence results for the fractional Yamabe problem in the case
that the boundary manifold is umbilic, thus covering some of the cases not
considered by Gonzalez and Qing. These are inspired by the work of Coda-Marques
on the boundary Yamabe problem but, in addition, a careful understanding of the
behavior at infinity for asymptotically hyperbolic metrics is required.
