The paper consists of two parts. The first part is devoted to logic for
universal algebraic geometry. The second one deals with problems and some
results. It may be regarded as a brief exposition of some ideas from the book
in progress: B.Plotkin, E.Aladova, E.Plotkin, "Algebraic logic and logical
geometry in arbitrary varieties of algebras"
