This work is concerned with the finiteness problem for static, spherically
symmetric perfect fluids in both Newtonian Gravity and General Relativity. We
derive criteria on the barotropic equation of state guaranteeing that the
corresponding perfect fluid solutions possess finite/infinite extent. In the
Newtonian case, for the large class of monotonic equations of state, and in
General Relativity we improve earlier results.
