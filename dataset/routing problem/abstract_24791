An average-time game is played on the infinite graph of configurations of a
finite timed automaton. The two players, Min and Max, construct an infinite run
of the automaton by taking turns to perform a timed transition. Player Min
wants to minimise the average time per transition and player Max wants to
maximise it. A solution of average-time games is presented using a reduction to
average-price game on a finite graph. A direct consequence is an elementary
proof of determinacy for average-time games. This complements our results for
reachability-time games and partially solves a problem posed by Bouyer et al.,
to design an algorithm for solving average-price games on priced timed
automata. The paper also establishes the exact computational complexity of
solving average-time games: the problem is EXPTIME-complete for timed automata
with at least two clocks.
