Hybrid systems, and Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes in particular,
are widely used to model and numerically study systems exhibiting multiple time
scales in biochemical reaction kinetics and related areas. In this paper an
almost sure convergence analysis for numerical simulation algorithms for
Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes is presented. The discussed numerical
methods arise through discretisina a constructive method defining these
processes. The stochastic problem of simulating the random, path-dependent jump
times of such processes is reformulated as a hitting time problem for a system
of ordinary differential equations with random threshold. Then deterministic
continuous methods (methods with dense output) are serially employed to solve
these problems numerically. We show that the almost sure asymptotic convergence
rate of the stochastic algorithm is identical to the order of the embedded
deterministic method. We illustrate our theoretical findings by numerical
examples from mathematical neuroscience were Piecewise Deterministic Markov
Processes are used as biophysically accurate stochastic models of neuronal
membranes.
