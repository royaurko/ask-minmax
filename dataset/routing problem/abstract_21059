We analyze the supports of weighted equilibrium measures in $\mathbb{C}^n$.
We give explicit examples of families of compact sets which arise as the
support of a weighted equilibrium measure for some admissible weight $w$. These
examples also give new constructions of plurisubharmonic functions in the
Lelong class. We also include a list of open problems on the support of
extremal measures which are related to solutions of Monge-{A}mp\`ere equations.
