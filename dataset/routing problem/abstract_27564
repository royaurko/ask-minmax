In this paper, we investigate three problems concerning the toric ideal
associated to a matroid. Firstly, we list all matroids $\mathcal M$ such that
its corresponding toric ideal $I_{\mathcal M}$ is a complete intersection.
Secondly, we handle with the problem of detecting minors of a matroid $\mathcal
M$ from a minimal set of binomial generators of $I_{\mathcal M}$. In
particular, given a minimal set of binomial generators of $I_{\mathcal M}$ we
provide a necessary condition for $\mathcal M$ to have a minor isomorphic to
$\mathcal U_{d,2d}$ for $d \geq 2$. This condition is proved to be sufficient
for $d = 2$ (leading to a criterion for determining whether $\mathcal M$ is
binary) and for $d = 3$. Finally, we characterize all matroids $\mathcal M$
such that $I_{\mathcal M}$ has a unique minimal set of binomial generators.
