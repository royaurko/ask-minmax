Local consistency techniques such as k-consistency are a key component of
specialised solvers for constraint satisfaction problems. In this paper we show
that the power of using k-consistency techniques on a constraint satisfaction
problem is precisely captured by using a particular inference rule, which we
call negative-hyper-resolution, on the standard direct encoding of the problem
into Boolean clauses. We also show that current clause-learning SAT-solvers
will discover in expected polynomial time any inconsistency that can be deduced
from a given set of clauses using negative-hyper-resolvents of a fixed size. We
combine these two results to show that, without being explicitly designed to do
so, current clause-learning SAT-solvers efficiently simulate k-consistency
techniques, for all fixed values of k. We then give some experimental results
to show that this feature allows clause-learning SAT-solvers to efficiently
solve certain families of constraint problems which are challenging for
conventional constraint-programming solvers.
