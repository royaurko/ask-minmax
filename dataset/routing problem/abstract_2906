Shock waves are steep wave fronts that are fundamental in nature, especially
in high-speed fluid flows. When a shock hits an obstacle, or a flying body
meets a shock, shock reflection/diffraction phenomena occur. In this paper, we
show how several longstanding shock reflection/diffraction problems can be
formulated as free boundary problems, discuss some recent progress in
developing mathematical ideas, approaches, and techniques for solving these
problems, and present some further open problems in this direction. In
particular, these shock problems include von Neumann's problem for shock
reflection-diffraction by two-dimensional wedges with concave corner,
Lighthill's problem for shock diffraction by two-dimensional wedges with convex
corner, and Prandtl-Meyer's problem for supersonic flow impinging onto solid
wedges, which are also fundamental in the mathematical theory of
multidimensional conservation laws.
