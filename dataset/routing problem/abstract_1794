We report a chemical free method for the reduction of graphene oxide (GO)
thin films. It was observed how for GO films annealed in air the oxygen species
desorb from the GO surface upon exposure to UV light and how the surface
resistivity of such deoxygenated GO films decreases with increasing the
exposure to the UV light. The obtained results open a clean as well as easy
route for the integration of GO based materials into optoelectronic devices.
