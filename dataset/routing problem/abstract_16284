Selecting important features in non-linear or kernel spaces is a difficult
challenge in both classification and regression problems. When many of the
features are irrelevant, kernel methods such as the support vector machine and
kernel ridge regression can sometimes perform poorly. We propose weighting the
features within a kernel with a sparse set of weights that are estimated in
conjunction with the original classification or regression problem. The
iterative algorithm, KNIFE, alternates between finding the coefficients of the
original problem and finding the feature weights through kernel linearization.
In addition, a slight modification of KNIFE yields an efficient algorithm for
finding feature regularization paths, or the paths of each feature's weight.
Simulation results demonstrate the utility of KNIFE for both kernel regression
and support vector machines with a variety of kernels. Feature path
realizations also reveal important non-linear correlations among features that
prove useful in determining a subset of significant variables. Results on vowel
recognition data, Parkinson's disease data, and microarray data are also given.
