We suggest a simple composite model that induces the large flavor mixing of
neutrino in the supersymmetric theory. This model has only one hyper-color in
addition to the standard gauge group, which makes composite states of preons.
In this model, {\bf 10} and {\bf 1} representations in SU(5) grand unified
theory are composite states and produce the mass hierarchy. This explains why
the large mixing is realized in the lepton sector, while the small mixing is
realized in the quark sector. This model can naturally solve the atmospheric
neutrino problem. We can also solve the solar neutrino problem by improving the
model.
