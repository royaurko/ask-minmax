This work introduces a new inversion formula for analytical functions. It is
simple, generally applicable and straightforward to use both in hand
calculations and for symbolic machine processing. It is easier to apply than
the traditional Lagrange-Burmann formula since no taking limits is required.
This formula is important for inverting functions in physical and mathematical
problems.
