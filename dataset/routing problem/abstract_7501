In this paper, we reduce Prize-Collecting Steiner TSP (PCTSP),
Prize-Collecting Stroll (PCS), Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree (PCST),
Prize-Collecting Steiner Forest (PCSF) and more generally Submodular
Prize-Collecting Steiner Forest (SPCSF) on planar graphs (and more generally
bounded-genus graphs) to the same problems on graphs of bounded treewidth. More
precisely, we show any $\alpha$-approximation algorithm for these problems on
graphs of bounded treewidth gives an $(\alpha + \epsilon)$-approximation
algorithm for these problems on planar graphs (and more generally bounded-genus
graphs), for any constant $\epsilon > 0$. Since PCS, PCTSP, and PCST can be
solved exactly on graphs of bounded treewidth using dynamic programming, we
obtain PTASs for these problems on planar graphs and bounded-genus graphs. In
contrast, we show PCSF is APX-hard to approximate on series-parallel graphs,
which are planar graphs of treewidth at most 2. This result is interesting on
its own because it gives the first provable hardness separation between
prize-collecting and non-prize-collecting (regular) versions of the problems:
regular Steiner Forest is known to be polynomially solvable on series-parallel
graphs and admits a PTAS on graphs of bounded treewidth. An analogous hardness
result can be shown for Euclidian PCSF. This ends the common belief that
prize-collecting variants should not add any new hardness to the problems.
