We prove a generalized implicit function theorem for Banach spaces, without
the usual assumption that the subspaces involved being complemented. Then we
apply it to the problem of parametrization of fibers of differentiable maps,
the Lie subgroup problem for Banach-Lie groups, as well as Weil's local
rigidity for homomorphisms from finitely generated groups to Banach-Lie groups.
