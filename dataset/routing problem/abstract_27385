An alternative numerical method is developed to find stable and unstable
periodic orbits of nonlinear dynamical systems. The method exploits the
high-efficiency of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for medium-sized problems
and has the additional advantage of being relatively simple to implement. It is
also applicable to both autonomous and non-autonomous systems. As an example of
its use, it is employed to find periodic orbits in the R\"ossler system, a
coupled R\"ossler system, as well as an eight-dimensional model of a flexible
rotor-bearing; problems which have been treated previously via two related
methods. The results agree with the previous methods and are seen to be more
accurate in some cases. A simple implementation of the method, written in the
Python programming language, is provided as an Appendix.
