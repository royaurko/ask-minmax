We are given an equal number of mobile robotic agents, and distinct target
locations. Each agent has simple integrator dynamics, a limited communication
range, and knowledge of the position of every target. We address the problem of
designing a distributed algorithm that allows the group of agents to divide the
targets among themselves and, simultaneously, leads each agent to reach its
unique target. We do not require connectivity of the communication graph at any
time. We introduce a novel assignment-based algorithm with the following
features: initial assignments and robot motions follow a greedy rule, and
distributed refinements of the assignment exploit an implicit circular ordering
of the targets. We prove correctness of the algorithm, and give worst-case
asymptotic bounds on the time to complete the assignment as the environment
grows with the number of agents. We show that among a certain class of
distributed algorithms, our algorithm is asymptotically optimal. The analysis
utilizes results on the Euclidean traveling salesperson problem.
