The "reconfiguration problem" for circular colourings asks, given two
$(p,q)$-colourings $f$ and $g$ of a graph $G$, is it possible to transform $f$
into $g$ by changing the colour of one vertex at a time such that every
intermediate mapping is a $(p,q)$-colouring? We show that this problem can be
solved in polynomial time for $2\leq p/q <4$ and is PSPACE-complete for
$p/q\geq 4$. This generalizes a known dichotomy theorem for reconfiguring
classical graph colourings.
