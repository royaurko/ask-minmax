This note gives a preliminary account of the transcoding or rechanneling
problem between different stimuli as it is of interest for the natural
interaction or affective computing fields. By the consideration of a simple
example, namely the color response of an affective lamp to a sensed facial
expression, we frame the problem within an information- theoretic perspective.
A full justification in terms of the Information Bottleneck principle promotes
a latent affective space, hitherto surmised as an appealing and intuitive
solution, as a suitable mediator between the different stimuli.
