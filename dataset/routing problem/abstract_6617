This article describes counter example prepared in order to prove that linear
formulation of TSP problem proposed in [arXiv:0803.4354] is incorrect (it
applies also to QAP problem formulation in [arXiv:0802.4307]). Article refers
not only to model itself, but also to ability of extension of proposed model to
be correct.
