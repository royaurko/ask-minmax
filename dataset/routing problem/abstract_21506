The main purpose of this paper is providing a simple method to generate the
matrices of irreducible representations because it is useful to reduce the
computational time of solving the eigenvalue problems. The only information we
need to provide for this method is the group-multiplication table, and the
proof of validity of this method is also shown in this paper.
