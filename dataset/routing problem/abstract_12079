In this paper, we study a class of stochastic processes, called evolving
network Markov chains, in evolving networks. Our approach is to transform the
degree distribution problem of an evolving network to a corresponding problem
of evolving network Markov chains. We investigate the evolving network Markov
chains, thereby obtaining some exact formulas as well as a precise criterion
for determining whether the steady degree distribution of the evolving network
is a power-law or not. With this new method, we finally obtain a rigorous,
exact and unified solution of the steady degree distribution of the evolving
network.
