We consider the Cauchy problem for semilinear parabolic equation in
divergence form with obstacle. We show that under natural conditions on the
right-hand side of the eqution and mild conditions on the obstacle a unique
continuous solution of the problem admits a stochastic representation in terms
of reflected backward stochastic differential equations. We derive also some
regularity properties of so- lutions and prove useful approximation results.
