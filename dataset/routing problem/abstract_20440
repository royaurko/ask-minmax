The transition wake fields excited by relativistic point charge in
cylindrical resistive round pipe are studied. The problem has been solved for
the infinite pipe with abrupt change of the walls conductivity from perfect
boundary condition to resistive. The analytical presentation of the
longitudinal monopole wake field is given.
