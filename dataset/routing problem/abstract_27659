We consider the detection problem of correlations in a $p$-dimensional
Gaussian vector for $p$ large, when we observe $n$ independent, identically
distributed random vectors. We assume that the covariance matrix vary in some
ellipsoid with parameter $\alpha >1/2$ and total energy bounded by $L>0$. We
prove here both rate and sharp asymptotic results in the minimax setup.
  Our test procedure is a U-statistic of order 2 corrected by weighting with an
optimal sequence, chosen as solution of an extremal problem. This procedure
weights diagonal elements in a polynomial way and truncates the number of
diagonals to take into account. We show that our test statistic has a Gaussian
asymptotic behaviour under the null hypothesis and under the alternatives close
to the detection boundary. Moreover, it attains the sharp asymptotic rate, i.e.
with explicit asymptotic constant, for the maximal type II error and the total
error probabilities, when $n =o(1) p^{2\alpha} $.
  We show that sharp asymptotic lower bounds for the maximal type II error and
total error probabilities under no restriction on $p$ and $n$.
  We deduce rate asymptotic minimax results for testing the inverse of the
covariance matrix.
