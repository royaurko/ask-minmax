In this paper we consider denoising and inpainting problems for higher
dimensional combined cyclic and linear space valued data. These kind of data
appear when dealing with nonlinear color spaces such as HSV, and they can be
obtained by changing the space domain of, e.g., an optical flow field to polar
coordinates. For such nonlinear data spaces, we develop algorithms for the
solution of the corresponding second order total variation (TV) type problems
for denoising, inpainting as well as the combination of both. We provide a
convergence analysis and we apply the algorithms to concrete problems.
