We study the convergence problem in fully asynchronous, uni-dimensional robot
networks that are prone to Byzantine (i.e. malicious) failures. In these
settings, oblivious anonymous robots with arbitrary initial positions are
required to eventually converge to an a apriori unknown position despite a
subset of them exhibiting Byzantine behavior. Our contribution is twofold. We
propose a deterministic algorithm that solves the problem in the most generic
settings: fully asynchronous robots that operate in the non-atomic CORDA model.
Our algorithm provides convergence in 5f+1-sized networks where f is the upper
bound on the number of Byzantine robots. Additionally, we prove that 5f+1 is a
lower bound whenever robot scheduling is fully asynchronous. This constrasts
with previous results in partially synchronous robots networks, where 3f+1
robots are necessary and sufficient.
