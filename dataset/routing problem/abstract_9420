We show that N=(2,2) SU(N) super Yang-Mills theory on lattice does not have
sign problem in the continuum limit, that is, under the phase-quenched
simulation phase of the determinant localizes to 1 and hence the phase-quench
approximation becomes exact. Among several formulations, we study models by
Cohen-Kaplan-Katz-Unsal (CKKU) and by Sugino. We confirm that the sign problem
is absent in both models and that they converge to the identical continuum
limit without fine tuning. We provide a simple explanation why previous works
by other contributors, which claim an existence of the sign problem, do not capture
the continuum physics.
