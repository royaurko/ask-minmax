We experimentally demonstrate the generation of off-axis phase singularities
in a vortex transmutation process induced by the breaking of rotational
symmetry. The process takes place in free space by launching a highly-charged
vortex, owning full rotational symmetry, into a linear thin diffractive element
presenting discrete rotational symmetry. It is shown that off-axis phase
singularities follow straight dark rays bifurcating from the symmetry axis.
This phenomenon may provide new routes towards the spatial control of multiple
phase singularities for applications in atom trapping and particle
manipulation.
