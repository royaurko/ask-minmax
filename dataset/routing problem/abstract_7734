We establish the main features of homogeneous and isotropic dilaton, metric
and Yang-Mills configurations in a cosmological framework. We identify a new
energy exchange term between the dilaton and the Yang-Mills field which may
lead to a possible solution to the Polonyi problem in 4-dimensional string
models.
