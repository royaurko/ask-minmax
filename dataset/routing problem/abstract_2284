Non-Markovian processes are widespread in natural and human-made systems, yet
explicit modelling and analysis of such systems is underdeveloped. In this
letter we consider a dynamic network with random link activation and deletion
(RLAD) with non-exponential inter-event times. We study a semi-Markov random
process when the inter-event times are heavy tailed Mittag-Leffler distributed,
thus considerably slowing down the corresponding Markovian dynamics and study
the system far from equilibrium. We derive an analytically and computationally
tractable system of forward equations utilizing the Caputo derivative for the
probability of having a given number of active links in the network. As an
example showing the effects of non-Markovianity, the dynamic network is coupled
with a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) spreading dynamics leading to
more persistent epidemics. The convergence to equilibrium is discussed in terms
of the mixing time of the embedded chain and the difference with the Markovian
case is highlighted. The novelty of our approach lies in showing a rigorous
route from a non-Markovian model to the corresponding Kolmogorov-like equations
and their analytical treatment.
