A number of physical phenomena are described by nonlinear hyperbolic
equations. Presence of discontinuous solutions motivates the necessity of
development of reliable numerical methods based on the fundamental mathematical
properties of hyperbolic systems. Construction of such methods for systems more
complicated that the Euler gas dynamic systems requires the investigation of
existence and uniqueness of self-similar solution to be used in the development
of discontinuity-capturing high-resolution numerical methods. This frequently
necessitates the study of the behavior of discontinuities under vanishing
viscosity and dispersion. We discuss these problems in the application to the
mahnetohydrodynamic equations, nonlinear waves in elastic media, and
electromagnetic waves in magnetics.
