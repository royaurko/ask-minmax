A matching between two sets A and B assigns some elements of A to some
elements of B. Finding the similarity between two sets of elements by advantage
of the matching is widely used in computational biology. Frequently, the
capacities of the elements are limited. That is, the number of the elements
that can be matched to each element should not exceed a given number. We
describe the first O(n^3) time algorithm for matching two sets of elements with
limited capacities. We use bipartite graphs to model relationships between
pairs of objects. Let G = (A U B;E) denote an undirected bipartite graph with
real edge weights and node capacities b(v). The b-matching of G matches each
vertex v in A (B) to at least 1 and at most b(v) vertices in B (A). In this
paper, we present an O(n^3) time algorithm for finding the maximum weight
b-matching of G, where |A|+|B| = O(n). Our algorithm improves the previous best
time complexity of O(n^3 log n) for this problem.
