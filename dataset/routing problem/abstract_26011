The problem of determining when a (classical) crossed product $T=S^f*G$ of a
finite group $G$ over a discrete valuation ring $S$ is a maximal order, was
answered in the 1960's for the case where $S$ is tamely ramified over the
subring of invariants $S^G$. The answer was given in terms of the conductor
subgroup (with respect to $f$) of the inertia. In this paper we solve this
problem in general when $S/S^G$ is residually separable. We show that the
maximal order property entails a restrictive structure on the sub-crossed
product graded by the inertia subgroup. In particular, the inertia is abelian.
Using this structure, one is able to extend the notion of the conductor. As in
the tame case, the order of the conductor is equal to the number of maximal two
sided ideals of $T$ and hence to the number of maximal orders containing $T$ in
its quotient ring. Consequently, $T$ is a maximal order if and only if the
conductor subgroup is trivial.
