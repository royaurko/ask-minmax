We study the low temperature properties of p-spin glass models with finite
connectivity and of some optimization problems. Using a one-step functional
replica symmetry breaking Ansatz we can solve exactly the saddle-point
equations for graphs with uniform connectivity. The resulting ground state
energy is in perfect agreement with numerical simulations. For fluctuating
connectivity graphs, the same Ansatz can be used in a variational way: For
p-spin models (known as p-XOR-SAT in computer science) it provides the exact
configurational entropy together with the dynamical and static critical
connectivities (for p=3, \gamma_d=0.818 and \gamma_s=0.918 resp.), whereas for
hard optimization problems like 3-SAT or Bicoloring it provides new upper
bounds for their critical thresholds (\gamma_c^{var}=4.396 and
\gamma_c^{var}=2.149 resp.).
