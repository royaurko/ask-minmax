The LPN (Learning Parity with Noise) problem has recently proved to be of
great importance in cryptology. A special and very useful case is the RING-LPN
problem, which typically provides improved efficiency in the constructed
cryptographic primitive. We present a new algorithm for solving the RING-LPN
problem in the case when the polynomial used is reducible. It greatly
outperforms previous algorithms for solving this problem. Using the algorithm,
we can break the Lapin authentication protocol for the proposed instance using
a reducible polynomial, in about 2^70 bit operations.
