We show that the bubbles $S^2\times S^2$can be created from vacuum
fluctuation in certain De Sitter universe, so the space-time foam-like
structure might really be constructed from bubbles of $S^2\times S^2$ in the
very early inflating phase of our universe. But whether such foam-like
structure persisted during the later evolution of the universe is a problem
unsolved now.
