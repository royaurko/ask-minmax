The problem on rolling of a sphere on a plane without slipping or twisting is
considered. One should roll the sphere from one contact configuration to
another so that the length of the curve traced by the contact point in the
plane was the shortest possible. Asymptotics of Maxwell time for rolling of the
sphere along small amplitude sinusoids is studied. Two-sided estimate for this
asymptotics is obtained.
