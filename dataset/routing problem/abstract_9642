In this paper, we consider the problem of energy efficient uplink scheduling
with delay constraint for a multi-user wireless system. We address this problem
within the framework of constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) wherein
one seeks to minimize one cost (average power) subject to a hard constraint on
another (average delay). We do not assume the arrival and channel statistics to
be known. To handle state space explosion and informational constraints, we
split the problem into individual CMDPs for the users, coupled through their
Lagrange multipliers; and a user selection problem at the base station. To
address the issue of unknown channel and arrival statistics, we propose a
reinforcement learning algorithm. The users use this learning algorithm to
determine the rate at which they wish to transmit in a slot and communicate
this to the base station. The base station then schedules the user with the
highest rate in a slot. We analyze convergence, stability and optimality
properties of the algorithm. We also demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm
through simulations within IEEE 802.16 system.
