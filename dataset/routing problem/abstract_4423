In this paper, we study one kind of stochastic recursive optimal control
problem with the obstacle constraints for the cost function where the cost
function is described by the solution of one reflected backward stochastic
differential equations. We will give the dynamic programming principle for this
kind of optimal control problem and show that the value function is the unique
viscosity solution of the obstacle problem for the corresponding
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations.
