An approximate method is proposed for the recovery of a compactly supported
spherically-symmetric potential from the set of fixed-energy phase-shifts known
for all angular momenta. The method reduces the inverse scattering problem to a
moment problem which is solved numerically.
 The above reduction is done approximately and it is more accurate for larger
angular momenta or for smaller potentials.
