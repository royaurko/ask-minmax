Recently, Bagno, Garber and Mansour studied a kind of excedance number on the
complex reflection groups and computed its multidistribution with the number of
fixed points on the set of involutions in these groups. In this note, we
consider the similar problems in more general cases and make a correction of
one result obtained by them.
