We study homogenization problem for the stationary Maxwell system. It is
supposed that the magnetic permeability and the dielectric permittivity locally
close to fast-oscillating (with respect to some small parameter) periodic
functions which can change the form on rather big distances. An asymptotic
behavior to solutions of the Maxwell system outside of its spectrum is
obtained. We also describe asymptotic behavior of resolvent with control of the
remainder in terms of some appropriate operator norms.
