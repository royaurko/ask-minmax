We consider the discrete memoryless degraded broadcast channels with
feedback. We prove that the error probability of decoding tends to one
exponentially for rates outside the capacity region and derive an explicit
lower bound of this exponent function. We shall demonstrate that the
information spectrum approach is quite useful for investigating this problem.
