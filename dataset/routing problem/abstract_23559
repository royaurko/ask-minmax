Decoupling limits of physical interest occur in regions of space--time where
the string coupling diverges. This is illustrated in the celebrated example of
five-branes. There are several ways to overcome this strong-coupling problem.
We review those which are somehow related to two-dimensional conformal field
theories. One method consists of distributing the branes over transverse space,
either on a circle or over a sphere. Those distributions are connected to
conformal field theories by T-dualities or lead to a new kind of sigma model
where the target space is a patchwork of pieces of exact conformal-field-theory
target spaces. An alternative method we discuss is the introduction of diluted
F-strings, which trigger a marginal deformation of an AdS$_3\times S^3\times
T^4$ background with a finite string coupling. Our discussion raises the
question of finding brane configurations, their spectrum, their geometry, and
their interpretation in terms of two-dimensional conformal models.
