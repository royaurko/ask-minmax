We define and investigate real analytic weak Jacobi forms of degree 1 and
arbitrary rank. En route we calculate the Casimir operator associated to the
maximal central extension of the real Jacobi group, which for rank exceeding 1
is of order 4. In ranks exceeding 1, the notions of H-harmonicity and
semi-holomorphicity are the same.
