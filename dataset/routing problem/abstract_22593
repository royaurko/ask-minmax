I review the five years of progress by FUSE on current topics in the
interstellar medium. FUSE's sensitivity and unique access to the far
ultraviolet allow investigators to solve problems in all phases of the
interstellar medium. I describe FUSE's contributions in four major areas: 1)
the Local Interstellar Medium (LISM), 2) the hot phase (O VI), 3) the cold
phase (H_2), and 4) interstellar gas abundances. I devote particular attention
to the common themes of ISM phase interactions and changes with metallicity. As
a whole, these results show that FUSE is the most powerful machine ever to
address problems of the ISM, and that FUSE points vividly to the future of ISM
studies in the Galaxy, Local Group, and beyond.
