The cosmological background of gravitational waves can be tuned by Extended
Theories of Gravity. In particular, it can be shown that assuming a generic
function f(R) of the Ricci scalar R gives a parametric approach to control the
evolution and the production mechanism of gravitational waves in the early
Universe.
