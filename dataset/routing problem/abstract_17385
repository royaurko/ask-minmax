In this paper we consider the problem of Galois descent for suitably
completed algebraic K-theory of fields. One of the main results is a suitable
form of rigidity for Borel-style generalized equivariant cohomology with
respect to certain spectra. In order to apply this to the problem at hand, we
need to invoke a derived Atiyah-Segal completion theorem for pro-groups. In the
present paper, the contributors apply such a derived completion theorem proven by
the first contributor elsewhere. These two results provide a proof of the Galois
descent problem for equivariant algebraic K-theory as formulated by the first
contributor, at least when restricted to the case where the absolute Galois groups
are pro-$l$ groups for some prime $l$ different from the characteristic of the
base field and the K-theory spectrum is completed at the same prime $l$. Work
in progress hopes to remove these restrictions.
