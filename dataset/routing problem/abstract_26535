We discuss the branching problem for generalized Verma modules
$M_\lambda(\mathfrak g, \mathfrak p)$ applied to couples of reductive Lie
algebras $\bar{\mathfrak g}\hookrightarrow \mathfrak g$. The analysis is based
on projecting character formulas to quantify the branching, and on the action
of the center of $U(\bar{\mathfrak g})$ to explicitly construct singular
vectors realizing part of the branching. We demonstrate the results on the pair
$\mathrm{Lie}G_2\hookrightarrow{so(7)}$ for both strongly and weakly compatible
with $i(\mathrm {Lie} G_2)$ parabolic subalgebras and a large class of inducing
representations.
