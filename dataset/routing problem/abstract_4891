We establish multiparameter resolvent trace expansions for elliptic boundary
value problems, polyhomogeneous both in the resolvent and the auxiliary
parameter. The present analysis is rooted in the joint project with Matthias
Lesch on multiparameter resolvent trace expansions on revolution surfaces with
applications to regularized sums of zeta-determinants.
