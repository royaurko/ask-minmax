We propose a new generalisation of general relativity which incorporates a
variation in both the speed of light in vacuum (c) and the gravitational
constant (G) and which is both covariant and Lorentz invariant. We solve the
generalised Einstein equations for Friedmann universes and show that arbitrary
time-variations of c and G never lead to a solution to the flatness, horizon or
$\Lambda$ problems for a theory satisfying the strong energy condition. In
order to do so, one needs to construct a theory which does not reduce to the
standard one for any choice of time, length and energy units. This can be
achieved by breaking a number of invariance principles such as covariance and
Lorentz invariance.
