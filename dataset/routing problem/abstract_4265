We propose an integrable Kondo problem in a one-dimensional (1D) $t-J$ model.
With the open boundary condition of the wave functions at the impurity sites,
the model can be exactly solved via Bethe ansatz for a class of $J_{R,L}$
(Kondo coupling constants) and $V_{L,R}$ (impurity potentials) parametrized by
a single parameter $c$. The integrable value of $J_{L,R}$ runs from negative
infinity to positive infinity, which allows us to study both the ferromagnetic
Kondo problem and antiferromagnetic Kondo problem in a strongly correlated
electron system. Generally, there is a residual entropy for the ground state,
which indicates a typical non-Fermi liquid behavior.
