We prove the existence of a spectral resolution of the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation when the matter field is provided by a massive Yang-Mills field. The
resolution is achieved by first solving the free eigenvalue problem for the
gravitational field and then the constrained eigenvalue problem for the
Yang-Mills field. In the latter case the mass of the Yang-Mills field assumes
the role of the eigenvalue.
