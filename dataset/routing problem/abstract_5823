We propose a numerical method for computing all eigenvalues (and the
corresponding eigenvectors) of a nonlinear holomorphic eigenvalue problem that
lie within a given contour in the complex plane. The method uses complex
integrals of the resolvent operator, applied to at least $k$ column vectors,
where $k$ is the number of eigenvalues inside the contour. The theorem of
Keldysh is employed to show that the original nonlinear eigenvalue problem
reduces to a linear eigenvalue problem of dimension $k$.
  No initial approximations of eigenvalues and eigenvectors are needed. The
method is particularly suitable for moderately large eigenvalue problems where
$k$ is much smaller than the matrix dimension. We also give an extension of the
method to the case where $k$ is larger than the matrix dimension. The
quadrature errors caused by the trapezoid sum are discussed for the case of
analytic closed contours. Using well known techniques it is shown that the
error decays exponentially with an exponent given by the product of the number
of quadrature points and the minimal distance of the eigenvalues to the
contour.
