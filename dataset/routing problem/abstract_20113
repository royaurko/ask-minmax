A famous problem posed by Diophantus was to find sets of distinct positive
rational numbers such that the product of any two is one less than a rational
square. Some sets of six such numbers are presented and the computational
algorithm used to find them is described. A classification of quadruples and
quintuples with examples and statistics is also given.
