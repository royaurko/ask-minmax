A generalization of Faddeev's approach of the 3-body problem to the many-body
problem leads to the method of increments. This method was recently applied to
account for the ground state properties of Hubbard-Peierls chains (JETP Letters
67 (1998) 1052). Here we generalize this approach to two-dimensional square
lattices and explicitely treat the incremental expansion up to third order.
Comparing our numerical results with various other approaches (Monte Carlo,
cumulant approaches) we show that incremental expansions are very efficient
because good accuracy with those approaches is achieved treating lattice
segments composed of 8 sites only.
