Tethered particle motion is an experimental technique to monitor
conformational changes in single molecules of DNA in real time, by observing
the position fluctuations of a micrometer-size particle attached to the DNA.
This article reviews some recent work on theoretical problems inherent in the
interpretation of TPM experiments, both in equilibrium and dynamical aspects.
