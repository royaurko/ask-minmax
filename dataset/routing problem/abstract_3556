In this paper, direct and inverse problems for a space fractional advection
dispersion equation on a finite domain are studied. The inverse problem
consists in determining the source term from a final observation. We first
drive the fundamental solution to the direct problem and we show that the
relation between source and the final observation is linear. Moreover, we study
the well-posedness of both problems: existence, uniqueness and stability.
Finally, we illustrate the results with a numerical example.
