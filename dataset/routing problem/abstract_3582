We study a cell problem arising in homogenization for a Hamilton-Jacobi
equation whose Hamiltonian is not coercive. We introduce a generalized notion
of effective Hamiltonians by approximating the equation and characterize the
solvability of the cell problem in terms of the generalized effective
Hamiltonian. Under some sufficient conditions, the result is applied to the
associated homogenization problem. We also show that homogenization for
non-coercive equations fails in general.
