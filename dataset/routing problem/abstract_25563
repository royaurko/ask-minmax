Contextual bandit learning is a reinforcement learning problem where the
learner repeatedly receives a set of features (context), takes an action and
receives a reward based on the action and context. We consider this problem
under a realizability assumption: there exists a function in a (known) function
class, always capable of predicting the expected reward, given the action and
context. Under this assumption, we show three things. We present a new
algorithm---Regressor Elimination--- with a regret similar to the agnostic
setting (i.e. in the absence of realizability assumption). We prove a new lower
bound showing no algorithm can achieve superior performance in the worst case
even with the realizability assumption. However, we do show that for any set of
policies (mapping contexts to actions), there is a distribution over rewards
(given context) such that our new algorithm has constant regret unlike the
previous approaches.
