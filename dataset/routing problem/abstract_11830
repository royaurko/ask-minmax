It is known that the variational methods are the most powerful tool for
studying the Coulomb three-body bound state problem. However, they often suffer
from loss of stability when the number of basis functions increases. This
problem can be cured by applying the multiprecision package designed by D.H.
Bailey. We consider the variational basis functions of the type exp(-a_n r_1
- b_n r_2 - g_n r_12) with complex exponents. The method yields the best
available energies for the ground states of the helium atom and the positive
hydrogen ion as well as many other known atomic and molecular systems.
