We have considered the problem of protein design based on a model where the
contact energy between amino acid residues is fitted phenomenologically using
the Miyazawa--Jernigan matrix. Due to the simple form of the contact energy
function, an analytical prescription is found which allows us to design
energetically stable sequences for fixed amino acid residues compositions and
target structures. The theoretically obtained sequences are compared with real
proteins and good correspondence is obtained. Finally we discuss the effect of
discrepancies in the procedure used to fit the contact energy on our
theoretical predictions.
