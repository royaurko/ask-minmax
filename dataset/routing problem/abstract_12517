When combined with mirror symmetry, the A-model approach to quantization
leads to a fairly simple and tractable problem. The most interesting part of
the problem then becomes finding the mirror of the coisotropic brane. We
illustrate how it can be addressed in a number of interesting examples related
to representation theory and gauge theory, in which mirror geometry is
naturally associated with the Langlands dual group. Hyperholomorphic sheaves
and (B,B,B) branes play an important role in the B-model approach to
quantization.
