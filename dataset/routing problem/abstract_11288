D-term inflation realized in heterotic string theory has two problems: the
scale of the anomalous D-term is too large for accounting for COBE data and the
coupling constant of the anomalous U(1) is too large for supergravity to be
valid. We show that both of these problems can be easily solved in D-term
inflation based on type I string theory or orientifolds of type IIB strings.
