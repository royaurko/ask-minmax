We have identified the three prominent routes, namely Heagy-Hammel,
fractalization and intermittency routes, and their mechanisms for the birth of
strange nonchaotic attractors (SNAs) in a quasiperiodically forced electronic
system constructed using a negative conductance series LCR circuit with a diode
both numerically and experimentally. The birth of SNAs by these three routes is
verified from both experimental and their corresponding numerical data by
maximal Lyapunov exponents, and their variance, Poincar\'e maps, Fourier
amplitude spectrum, spectral distribution function and finite-time Lyapunov
exponents. Although these three routes have been identified numerically in
different dynamical systems, the experimental observation of all these
mechanisms is reported for the first time to our knowledge and that too in a
single second order electronic circuit.
