Relative worst order analysis is a supplement or alternative to competitive
analysis which has been shown to give results more in accordance with observed
behavior of online algorithms for a range of different online problems. The
contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it adds the static list accessing
problem to the collection of online problems where relative worst order
analysis gives better results. Second, and maybe more interesting, it adds the
non-trivial supplementary proof technique of list factoring to the theoretical
toolbox for relative worst order analysis.
