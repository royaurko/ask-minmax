It is argued that an account for the Veneziano ghost pole, appearing in
resolving the U(1) problem, is necessary for understanding an isospin violation
in the $ \pi - \eta - \eta' $ system. By virtue of a perturbative expansion
around the $ SU(2)_{V} $ ( $ m_{u} = m_{d} $ ) symmetric Veneziano solution, we
find that the ghost considerably suppresses isospin breaking gluon and s-quark
matrix elements. We speculate further on a few cases where the proposed
mechanism can play an essential role. We discuss the isospin violation in
meson-nucleon couplings and its relevance to the problem of charge asymmetric
nuclear forces and possible breaking of the Bjorken sum rule. It is shown that
the ghost pole could yield the isospin violation of order 2 \% for the $ \pi N
$ couplings and 20 \% for the
  Bjorken sum rule.
