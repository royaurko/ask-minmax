The relativistic kinetic equations for the two domains separated by the
hypersurface with both space- and time-like parts are derived. The particle
exchange between the domains separated by the time-like boundaries generates
source terms and modifies the collision term of the kinetic equation. The
correct hydrodynamic equations for the ``hydro+cascade'' models are obtained
and their differences from existing freeze-out models of the hadronic matter
are discussed.
