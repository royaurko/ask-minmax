The simplest unified extension of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
with bi-linear R--Parity violation provides a predictive scheme for neutrino
masses which can account for the observed atmospheric and solar neutrino
anomalies in terms of bi-maximal neutrino mixing. The maximality of the
atmospheric mixing angle arises dynamically, by minimizing the scalar
potential, while the solar neutrino problem can be accounted for either by
large or by small mixing oscillations. One neutrino picks up mass by mixing
with neutralinos, while the degeneracy and masslessness of the other two is
lifted only by loop corrections. Despite the smallness of neutrino masses
R-parity violation is observable at present and future high-energy colliders,
providing an unambiguous cross-check of the model.
