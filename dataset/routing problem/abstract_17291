Given a linear system, we consider the problem of finding a small set of
variables to affect with an input so that the resulting system is controllable.
We show that this problem is NP-hard; indeed, we show that even approximating
the minimum number of variables that need to be affected within a
multiplicative factor of $c \log n$ is NP-hard for some positive $c$. On the
positive side, we show it is possible to find sets of variables matching this
inapproximability barrier in polynomial time. This can be done by a simple
greedy heuristic which sequentially picks variables to maximize the rank
increase of the controllability matrix. Experiments on Erdos-Renyi random
graphs demonstrate this heuristic almost always succeeds at findings the
minimum number of variables.
