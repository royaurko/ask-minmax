In this paper we establish a multivariable noncommutative generalization of
L\"owner's classical theorem from 1934 characterizing operator monotone
functions as real functions admitting analytic continuation mapping the upper
complex half-plane into itself. The several variable theorem proved here
characterizes several variable operator monotone functions, not assumed to be
(free) analytic, as real functions that admit (free) analytic continuation
mapping the upper operator polyhalf-space into the upper operator half-space
over an arbitrary Hilbert space. During the process we establish a new integral
formula for them over the standard simplex based on the Krein-Milman theorem.
The formula represents operator monotone functions as the closure of convex
combinations of weighted harmonic means. We prove that such functions are
completely determined by its values at tuples of positive scalars. The results
then are applied to the theory of multivariable operator means. We extend the
Kubo-Ando theory from 1980 of two-variable operator means to more than two
variables. En route we prove that all the various different geometric means
appearing in the literature are actually identical, contradicting the general
point of view of the last decade based on numerical experiments. As a
consequence we obtain an explicit, closed formula for the Karcher mean of
several positive operators.
