We describe a quantitative construction of almost-normal diffeomorphisms
between embedded orientable manifolds with boundary to be used in the study of
geometric variational problems with stratified singular sets. We then apply
this construction to isoperimetric problems for planar bubble clusters. In this
setting we develop an improved convergence theorem, showing that a sequence of
almost-minimizing planar clusters converging in $L^1$ to a limit cluster has
actually to converge in a strong $C^{1,\alpha}$-sense. Applications of this
improved convergence result to the classification of isoperimetric clusters and
the qualitative description of perturbed isoperimetric clusters are also
discussed. Analogous results for three-dimensional clusters are presented in
part two, while further applications are discussed in some companion papers.
