The distributed representation of correlated multi-view images is an
important problem that arise in vision sensor networks. This paper concentrates
on the joint reconstruction problem where the distributively compressed
correlated images are jointly decoded in order to improve the reconstruction
quality of all the compressed images. We consider a scenario where the images
captured at different viewpoints are encoded independently using common coding
solutions (e.g., JPEG, H.264 intra) with a balanced rate distribution among
different cameras. A central decoder first estimates the underlying correlation
model from the independently compressed images which will be used for the joint
signal recovery. The joint reconstruction is then cast as a constrained convex
optimization problem that reconstructs total-variation (TV) smooth images that
comply with the estimated correlation model. At the same time, we add
constraints that force the reconstructed images to be consistent with their
compressed versions. We show by experiments that the proposed joint
reconstruction scheme outperforms independent reconstruction in terms of image
quality, for a given target bit rate. In addition, the decoding performance of
our proposed algorithm compares advantageously to state-of-the-art distributed
coding schemes based on disparity learning and on the DISCOVER.
