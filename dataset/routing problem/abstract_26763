The problem of robustly, asymptotically stabilizing a point (or a set) with
two output-feedback hybrid controllers is considered. These control laws may
have different objectives, e.g., the closed-loop systems resulting with each
controller may have different attractors. We provide a control algorithm that
combines the two hybrid controllers to accomplish the stabilization task. The
algorithm consists of a hybrid supervisor that, based on the values of plant's
outputs and (norm) state estimates, selects the hybrid controller that should
be applied to the plant. The accomplishment of the stabilization task relies on
an output-to-state stability property induced by the controllers, which enables
the construction of an estimator for the norm of the plant's state. The
algorithm is motivated by and applied to robust, semi-global stabilization
problems uniting two controllers.
