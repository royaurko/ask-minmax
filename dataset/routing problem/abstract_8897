We discuss the problem of whether a given problem in enumerative geometry can
have all of its solutions be real. In particular, we describe an approach to
problems of this type, and show how this can be used to show some enumerative
problems involving the Schubert calculus on Grassmannians may have all of their
solutions be real. We conclude by describing the work of Fulton and
Ronga-Tognoli-Vust, who (independently) showed that there are 5 real plane
conics such that each of the 3264 conics tangent to all five are real.
