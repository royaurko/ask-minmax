We have used Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM) for obtaining the eigenvalues
of the Schrodinger's equation for a deformed well problem representing
trigonometric functions. By solving the problem, we have found that the
Schrodinger's equation for the considered potential has quasi-exact solutions.
Additionally, we have also calculated the perturbation expansion of energy
eigenvalues and found very simple analytical expression of the energy. Finally,
we have considered more general cases and obtained energy eigenvalues for
arbitrary potential parameters.
