In this short note, we observe that the problem of computing the strong
metric dimension of a graph can be reduced to the problem of computing a
minimum node cover of a transformed graph within an additive logarithmic
factor. This implies both a 2-approximation algorithm and a
(2-\epsilon)-inapproximability for the problem of computing the strong metric
dimension of a graph.
