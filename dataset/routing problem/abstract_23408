Propagation of gluons in the confining vacuum is studied in the framework of
the background perturbation theory, where nonperturbative background contains
confining correlators. Two settings of the problem are considered. In the first
the confined gluon is evolving in time together with static quark and antiquark
forming the one-gluon static hybrid. The hybrid spectrum is calculated in terms
of string tension and is in agreement with earlier analytic and lattice
calculations. In the second setting the confined gluon is exchanged between
quarks and the gluon Green's function is calculated, giving rise to the Coulomb
potential modified at large distances. The resulting screening radius of 0.5 fm
presents a serious problem when confronting with lattice and experimental data.
A possible solution of this discrepancy is discussed.
