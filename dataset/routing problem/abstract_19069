We study the chiral two-matrix model with polynomial potential functions $V$
and $W$, which was introduced by Akemann, Damgaard, Osborn and Splittorff. We
show that the squared singular values of each of the individual matrices in
this model form a determinantal point process with correlation kernel
determined by a matrix-valued Riemann-Hilbert problem. The size of the
Riemann-Hilbert matrix depends on the degree of the potential function $W$ (or
$V$ respectively). In this way we obtain the chiral analogue of a result of
Kuijlaars-McLaughlin for the non-chiral two-matrix model. The Gaussian case
corresponds to $V,W$ being linear. For the case where $W(y)=y^2/2+\alpha y$ is
quadratic, we derive the large $n$-asymptotics of the Riemann-Hilbert problem
by means of the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method. This proves universality in
this case. An important ingredient in the analysis is a third-order
differential equation. Finally we show that if also $V(x)=x$ is linear, then a
multi-critical limit of the kernel exists which is described by a $4\times 4$
matrix-valued Riemann-Hilbert problem associated to the Painlev\'e II equation
$q"(x) = xq(x)+2q^3(x)-\nu-1/2$. In this way we obtain the chiral analogue of a
recent result by Duits and the second contributor.
