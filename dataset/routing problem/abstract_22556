Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models of galaxy formation had been remarkably
successful to explain a number of observations in the past decade. However,
with both the theoretical modeling and the observations being improved, CDM
models have been very recently shown to have excessive clustering on the
sub-galactic scale. Here I discuss a solution, based on our high-resolution
numerical simulations, to this outstanding problem by considering Warm Dark
Matter (WDM). Our results show that the over-clustering problem on sub-galactic
scales can be overcome by WDM models, and all the advantages of CDM models are
preserved by WDM models. Therefore, the WDM model will become an interesting
alternative to the well-studied CDM models.
