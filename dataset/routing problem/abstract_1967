We observe an insulator-to-metal (I-M) transition in crystalline silicon
doped with sulfur to non- equilibrium concentrations using ion implantation
followed by pulsed laser melting and rapid resolidification. This I-M
transition is due to a dopant known to produce only deep levels at equilibrium
concentrations. Temperature-dependent conductivity and Hall effect measurements
for temperatures T > 1.7 K both indicate that a transition from insulating to
metallic conduction occurs at a sulfur concentration between 1.8 and 4.3 x
10^20 cm-3. Conduction in insulating samples is consistent with variable range
hopping with a Coulomb gap. The capacity for deep states to effect metallic
conduction by delocalization is the only known route to bulk intermediate band
photovoltaics in silicon.
