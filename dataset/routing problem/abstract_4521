We study a new variant of the string matching problem called cross-document
string matching, which is the problem of indexing a collection of documents to
support an efficient search for a pattern in a selected document, where the
pattern itself is a substring of another document. Several variants of this
problem are considered, and efficient linear-space solutions are proposed with
query time bounds that either do not depend at all on the pattern size or
depend on it in a very limited way (doubly logarithmic). As a side result, we
propose an improved solution to the weighted level ancestor problem.
