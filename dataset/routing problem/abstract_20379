Starting from the QCD Hamiltonian, we derive a schematic Hamiltonian for low
energy quark dynamics with quarks restricted to the lowest s-level. The
resulting eigenvalue problem can be solved analytically. Even though the
Hamiltonian exhibits explicit chiral symmetry the severe restriction of the
number of degrees of freedom breaks the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking for
finite quark masses.
