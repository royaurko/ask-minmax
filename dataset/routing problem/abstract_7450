We study the classical Kimura diffusion operator defined on the n-simplex,
$$L^{Kim}=\sum_{1\leq i,j\leq n+1}x_ix_j\partial_{x_i}\partial_{x_j}$$ We give
novel constructions for the basis of eigenpolynomials, and the solution to the
inhomogeneous Dirichlet problem, which are well adapted to numerical
applications. Our solution of the Dirichlet problem is quite explicit and
provides a precise description of the singularities that arise along the
boundary.
