In this paper we study the continuous dependence with respect to obstacles
for obstacle problems with measure data. This is deeply investigated
introducing a suitable type of convergence, which gives stability under very
general hypotheses. Moreover stability with respect to H^1 and uniform
convergent obstacles is proved.
