Consider the problem of partitioning an arbitrary metric space into pieces of
diameter at most \Delta, such every pair of points is separated with relatively
low probability. We propose a rate-based algorithm inspired by
multiplicatively-weighted Voronoi diagrams, and prove it has optimal
trade-offs. This also gives us another logarithmic approximation algorithm for
the 0-extension problem.
