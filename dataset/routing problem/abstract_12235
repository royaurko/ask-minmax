Preconditioning is at the core of modern many-fermion Monte Carlo algorithms,
such as Hybrid Monte Carlo, where the repeated solution of a linear problem
involving an ill-conditioned matrix is needed. We report on a performance
comparison of three preconditioning strategies, namely Chebyshev polynomials,
strong-coupling approximation and weak-coupling expansion. We use conjugate
gradient (CG) on the normal equations as well as stabilized biconjugate
gradient (BiCGStab) as solvers and focus on the fermion matrix of the unitary
Fermi gas. Our results indicate that BiCGStab is by far the most efficient
strategy, both in terms of the number of iterations and matrix-vector
operations.
