In the paper we consider the theory of elliptic operators acting in subspaces
defined by pseudodifferential projections. This theory on closed manifolds is
connected with the theory of boundary value problems for operators violating
Atiyah-Bott condition. We prove an index formula for elliptic operators in
subspaces defined by even projections on odd-dimensional manifolds and for
boundary value problems, generalizing the classical result of Atiyah-Bott.
Besides a topological contribution of Atiyah-Singer type, the index formulas
contain an invariant of subspaces defined by even projections. This homotopy
invariant can be expressed in terms of the eta-invariant. The results also shed
new light on P.Gilkey's work on eta-invariants of even-order operators.
