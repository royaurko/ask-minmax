We consider the equivariant Yamabe problem, i.e. the Yamabe problem on the
space of G-invariant metrics for a compact Lie group G. The G-Yamabe invariant
is analogously defined as the supremum of the constant scalar curvatures of
unit volume G-invariant metrics minimizing the total scalar curvature
functional in their G-invariant conformal subclasses. We prove a formula about
how the G-Yamabe invariant changes under the surgery of codimension 3 or more,
and compute some G-Yamabe invariants.
