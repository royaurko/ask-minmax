Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are employed to sample from a given
distribution of interest, whenever either the distribution does not exist in
closed form, or, if it does, no efficient method to simulate an independent
sample from it is available. Although a wealth of diagnostic tools for
convergence assessment of MCMC methods have been proposed in the last two
decades, the search for a dependable and easy to implement tool is ongoing. We
present in this article a criterion based on the principle of detailed balance
which provides a qualitative assessment of the convergence of a given chain.
The criterion is based on the behaviour of a one-dimensional statistic, whose
asymptotic distribution under the assumption of stationarity is derived; our
results apply under weak conditions and have the advantage of being completely
intuitive. We implement this criterion as a stopping rule for simulated
annealing in the problem of finding maximum likelihood estimators for
parameters of a 20-component mixture model. We also apply it to the problem of
sampling from a 10-dimensional funnel distribution via slice sampling and the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Furthermore, based on this convergence criterion
we define a measure of efficiency of one algorithm versus another.
