Problems in applying random-matrix theory (RMT) to nuclear reactions arise in
two domains. To justify the approach, statistical properties of isolated
resonances observed experimentally must agree with RMT predictions. That
agreement is less striking than would be desirable. In the implementation of
the approach, the range of theoretically predicted observables is too narrow.
