The Jacobi matrices with bounded elements whose spectrum of multiplicity 2 is
separated from its simple spectrum and contains an interval of absolutely
continuous spectrum are considered. A new type of spectral data, which are
analogous for scattering data, is introduced for this matrix. An integral
equation that allows us to reconstruct the matrix from this spectral data is
obtained. We use this equation to solve the Cauchy problem for the Toda lattice
with the initial data that are not stabilized.
