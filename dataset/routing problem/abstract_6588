We consider singular perturbation elliptic problems depending on a parameter
? such that, for ? = 0 the boundary conditions are not adapted to the equation
(they do not satisfy the Shapiro - Lopatinskii condition). The limit only holds
in very abstract spaces out of distribution theory involving complexi?cation
and non-local phenomena. We give a very elementary model problem showing the
main features of the limit process, as well as a heuristic integral procedure
for obtain- ing a description of the solutions for small ?. Such kind of
problems appear in thin shell theory when the middle surface is elliptic and
the shell is ?xed by a part of the boundary and free by the rest.
