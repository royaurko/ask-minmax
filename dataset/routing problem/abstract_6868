We are interested in the problem of transition reduction of nondeterministic
automata. We present some results on the reduction of the automata recognizing
the language $L(E_n)$ denoted by the regular expression $E_n=(1+\varepsilon)...
(2+\varepsilon)... (3+\varepsilon)... (n+\varepsilon)$. These results can be
used in the general case of the transition reduction problem.
