In this paper, we consider an equivalence problem of second order partially
differential equations (PDE) and a duality of the flat differential equation.
For the equivalence problem, explicit form of invariants (curvatures) are
given. We also investigate a duality associated with the flat equation using
double fibrations. These double fibrations are described in terms of
transformation groups.
