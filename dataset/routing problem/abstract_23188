We propose a new non-perturbative method to compute derivatives of gauge
coupling constants with respect to anisotropic lattice spacings (anisotropy
coefficients), which are required in an evaluation of thermodynamic quantities
from numerical simulations on the lattice. Our method is based on a precise
measurement of the finite temperature deconfining transition curve in the
lattice coupling parameter space extended to anisotropic lattices by applying
the spectral density method. We test the method for the cases of SU(2) and
SU(3) gauge theories at the deconfining transition point on lattices with the
lattice size in the time direction $N_t=4$ -- 6. In both cases, there is a
clear discrepancy between our results and perturbative values. A longstanding
problem, when one uses the perturbative anisotropy coefficients, is a
non-vanishing pressure gap at the deconfining transition point in the SU(3)
gauge theory. Using our non-perturbative anisotropy coefficients, we find that
this problem is completely resolved: we obtain $\Delta p/T^4 = 0.001(15)$ and
$-0.003(17)$ on $N_t=4$ and 6 lattices, respectively.
