Employing the duality between the momentum distribution $n(p)$ and density
distribution $\rho(r)$, problems of theory of systems with flat bands, pinned
to the Fermi surface, are discussed. We propose that the Lifshitz topological
phase transition associated with the formation of additional pockets of the
Fermi surface is the precursor of fermion condensation.
