Recall that a rng is a ring which is possibly non-unital. In this note, we
address the problem whether every finitely generated idempotent rng
(abbreviated as irng) is singly generated as an ideal. It is well-known that it
is the case for a commutative irng. We prove here it is also the case for a
free rng on finitely many idempotents and for a finite irng. A relation to the
Wiegold problem for perfect groups is discussed.
