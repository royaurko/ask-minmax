Multi-adaptive Galerkin methods are extensions of the standard continuous and
discontinuous Galerkin methods for the numerical solution of initial value
problems for ordinary or partial differential equations. In particular, the
multi-adaptive methods allow individual and adaptive time steps to be used for
different components or in different regions of space. We present algorithms
for efficient multi-adaptive time-stepping, including the recursive
construction of time slabs and adaptive time step selection. We also present
data structures for efficient storage and interpolation of the multi-adaptive
solution. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms and data structures is
demonstrated for a series of benchmark problems.
