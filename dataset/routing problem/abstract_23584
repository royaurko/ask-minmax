The solution of dark energy problem in the models without scalars is
presented. It is shown that late-time accelerating cosmology may be generated
by the ideal fluid with some implicit equation of state. The universe evolution
within modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity is considered. It is demonstrated that
such gravitational approach may predict the (quintessential, cosmological
constant or transient phantom) acceleration of the late-time universe with
natural transiton from deceleration to acceleration (or from non-phantom to
phantom era in the last case).
