Automatic speaker naming is the problem of localizing as well as identifying
each speaking character in a TV/movie/live show video. This is a challenging
problem mainly attributes to its multimodal nature, namely face cue alone is
insufficient to achieve good performance. Previous multimodal approaches to
this problem usually process the data of different modalities individually and
merge them using handcrafted heuristics. Such approaches work well for simple
scenes, but fail to achieve high performance for speakers with large appearance
variations. In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional neural networks
(CNN) based learning framework to automatically learn the fusion function of
both face and audio cues. We show that without using face tracking, facial
landmark localization or subtitle/transcript, our system with robust multimodal
feature extraction is able to achieve state-of-the-art speaker naming
performance evaluated on two diverse TV series. The dataset and implementation
of our algorithm are publicly available online.
