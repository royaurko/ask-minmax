In the paper we numerically study positions of high spots (extrema) of the
fundamental sloshing mode of liquid in an axisymmetric tank. Our approach is
based on a linear model reducing the problem to appropriate Steklov eigenvalue
problem. We propose a numerical scheme for calculating sloshing modes and a
novel method of making images of oscillating fluid. We also describe the
relation of the high spot problem to the celebrated hot spots conjecture.
