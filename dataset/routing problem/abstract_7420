This article is concerned with the numerical solution of convex variational
problems. More precisely, we develop an iterative minimisation technique which
allows for the successive enrichment of an underlying discrete approximation
space in an adaptive manner. Specifically, we outline a new approach in the
context of $hp$-adaptive finite element methods employed for the efficient
numerical solution of linear and nonlinear second-order boundary value
problems. Numerical experiments are presented which highlight the practical
performance of this new $hp$-refinement technique for both one- and
two-dimensional problems.
