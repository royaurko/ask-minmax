ECML PKDD is the main European conference on machine learning and data
mining. Since its foundation it implemented the publication model common in
computer science: there was one conference deadline; conference submissions
were reviewed by a program committee; papers were accepted with a low
acceptance rate. Proceedings were published in several Springer Lecture Notes
in Artificial (LNAI) volumes, while selected papers were invited to special
issues of the Machine Learning and Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery
journals. In recent years, this model has however come under stress. Problems
include: reviews are of highly variable quality; the purpose of bringing the
community together is lost; reviewing workloads are high; the information
content of conferences and journals decreases; there is confusion among
scientists in interdisciplinary contexts. In this paper, we present a new
publication model, which will be adopted for the ECML PKDD 2013 conference, and
aims to solve some of the problems of the traditional model. The key feature of
this model is the creation of a journal track, which is open to submissions all
year long and allows for revision cycles.
