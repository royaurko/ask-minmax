An asymptotic theory is developed for a moving drop driven by a wettability
gradient. We distinguish the mesoscale where an exact solution is known for the
properly simplified problem. This solution is matched at both -- the advancing
and the receding side -- to respective solutions of the problem on the
microscale. On the microscale the velocity of movement is used as the small
parameter of an asymptotic expansion. Matching gives the droplet shape,
velocity of movement as a function of the imposed wettability gradient and
droplet volume.
