In this paper, a novel method to adaptively approximate the solution to
stochastic differential equations, which is based on compressive sampling and
sparse recovery, is introduced. The proposed method consider the problem of
sparse recovery with respect to multi-wavelet basis (MWB) from a small number
of random samples to approximate the solution to problems. To illustrate the
robustness of developed method, three benchmark problems are studied and main
statistical features of solutions such as the variance and the mean of
solutions obtained by proposed method are compared with the ones obtained from
Monte Carlo simulations.
