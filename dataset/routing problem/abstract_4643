The paper provides an exact analytical solution for equilibrium
configurations of cantilever rod subject to inclined force and torque acting on
its free end. The solution is given in terms of Jacobi elliptical functions and
illustrated by several numerical examples and several graphical presentations
of shapes of deformed cantilever. Possible forms of cantilever underlying
elastica are discussed in details and various simple formulas are given for
calculation of characteristic dimensions of elastica. For the case when
cantilever is subject only to applied force four load conditions are discussed:
follower load problem, load determination problem, conservative load problem
and rotational load problem. For all the cases the formulas or effective
procedure for solution is given.
