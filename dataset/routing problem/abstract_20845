The gravitational instability of a fully ionized gas is analyzed within the
framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. In particular, the presence of
a heat flux corresponding to generalized thermodynamic forces is shown to
affect the properties of the dispersion relation governing the stability of
this kind of system in certain problems of interest.
