An automorphism group G of a 1-factorization of the complete multipartite
graph $K_{m\times n}$ consists in permutations of the vertices of the graph
mapping factors to factors. In this paper, we give a complete answer to the
existence or non-existence problem of a 1-factorization of $K_{m\times n}$
admitting an abelian group acting sharply transitively on the vertices of the
graph.
