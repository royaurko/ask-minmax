The regularisation of the $\lambda\phi^4_4$-model on noncommutative Moyal
space gives rise to a solvable QFT model in which all correlation functions are
expressed in terms of the solution of a fixed point problem. We prove that the
non-linear operator for the logarithm of the original problem satisfies the
assumptions of the Schauder fixed point theorem, thereby completing the
solution of the QFT model.
