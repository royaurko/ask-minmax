We consider distillation of entanglement from two qubit states which are
mixtures of three mutually orthogonal states: two pure entangled states and one
pure product state. We distill entanglement from such states by projecting n
copies of the state on permutationally invariant subspace and then applying
one-way hashing protocol. We find analytical expressions for the rate of the
protocol. We also generalize this method to higher dimensional systems. To get
analytical expression for two qubit case, we faced a mathematical problem of
diagonalizing a family of matrices enjoying some symmetries w.r.t. to symmetric
group. We have solved this problem in two ways: (i) directly, by use of
Schur-Weyl decomposition and Young symmetrizers (ii) showing that the problem
is equivalent to a problem of diagonalizing adjacency matrices in a particular
instance of a so called algebraic association scheme.
