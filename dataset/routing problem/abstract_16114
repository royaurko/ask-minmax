Symplectic invariants introduced in math-ph/0702045 can be computed for an
arbitrary spectral curve. For some examples of spectral curves, those
invariants can solve loop equations of matrix integrals, and many problems of
enumerative geometry like maps, partitions, Hurwitz numbers, intersection
numbers, Gromov-Witten invariants... The problem is thus to understand what
they count, or in other words, given a spectral curve, construct an enumerative
geometry problem. This is what we do in a semi-heuristic approach in this
article. Starting from a spectral curve, i.e. an integrable system, we use its
flat connection and flat coordinates, to define a family of worldsheets, whose
enumeration is indeed solved by the topological recursion and symplectic
invariants. In other words, for any spectral curve, we construct a
corresponding string theory, whose target space is a submanifold of the
Jacobian.
