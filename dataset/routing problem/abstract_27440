In this paper we propose and analyze a preconditioner for a system arising
from a finite element approximation of second order elliptic problems
describing processes in highly het- erogeneous media. Our approach uses the
technique of multilevel methods and the recently proposed preconditioner based
on additive Schur complement approximation by J. Kraus (see [8]). The main
results are the design and a theoretical and numerical justification of an
iterative method for such problems that is robust with respect to the contrast
of the media, defined as the ratio between the maximum and minimum values of
the coefficient (related to the permeability/conductivity).
