We examine questions involving nondeterministic finite automata where all
states are final, initial, or both initial and final. First, we prove hardness
results for the nonuniversality and inequivalence problems for these NFAs.
Next, we characterize the languages accepted. Finally, we discuss some state
complexity problems involving such automata.
