Ray intersection graphs are intersection graphs of rays, or halflines, in the
plane. We show that any planar graph has an even subdivision whose complement
is a ray intersection graph. The construction can be done in polynomial time
and implies that finding a maximum clique in a segment intersection graph is
NP-hard. This solves a 21-year old open problem posed by Kratochv\'il and
Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il.
