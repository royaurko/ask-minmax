In the framework of Einstein's General Relativity Theory and of the
Relativistic Theory of Gravitation, the equations governing the trajectories of
charged particles in the field created by a charged mass point are given. An
analysis of the shape of the trajectories in both theories is presented. The
first and the second order approximate solutions of the electrogravitational
Kepler problem are found in the two theories and the results are compared with
each other. I have pointed out the differences between the predictions in the
two theories.
