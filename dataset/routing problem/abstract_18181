Our work considers the optimization of the sum of a non-smooth convex
function and a finite family of composite convex functions, each one of which
is composed of a convex function and a bounded linear operator. This type of
problem is associated with many interesting challenges encountered in the image
restoration and image reconstruction fields. We developed a splitting
primal-dual proximity algorithm to solve this problem. Further, we propose a
preconditioned method, of which the iterative parameters are obtained without
the need to know some particular operator norm in advance. Theoretical
convergence theorems are presented. We then apply the proposed methods to solve
a total variation regularization model, in which the L2 data error function is
added to the L1 data error function. The main advantageous feature of this
model is its capability to combine different loss functions. The numerical
results obtained for computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction demonstrated
the ability of the proposed algorithm to reconstruct an image with few and
sparse projection views while maintaining the image quality.
