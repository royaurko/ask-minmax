Spacecraft investigations during the last ten years have vastly improved our
knowledge about dust in the Jovian system. All Galilean satellites, and
probably all smaller satellites as well, are sources of dust in the Jovian
system. In-situ measurements with the dust detectors on board the Ulysses and
Galileo spacecraft have for the first time demonstrated the electromagnetic
interaction of charged dust grains with the interplanetary magnetic field and
with a planetary magnetosphere. Jupiter's magnetosphere acts as a giant
mass-velocity spectrometer for charged 10-nanometer dust grains. These dust
grains are released from Jupiter's moon Io with typical rate of 1 kg s^1. The
dust streams probe the plasma conditions in the Io plasma torus and can be used
as a potential monitor of Io's volcanic plume activity. The other Galilean
satellites are surrounded by tenuous impact-generated clouds of mostly
sub-micrometer ejecta grains. Galileo measurements have demonstrated that
impact-ejecta derived from hypervelocity impacts onto satellites are the major
-- if not the only -- constituent of dusty planetary rings. We review the
in-situ dust measurements at Jupiter and give an update of most recent results.
