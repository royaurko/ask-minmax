We introduce a new Petrov-Galerkin multiscale method for the numerical
approximation of the Helmholtz equation with large wave number $\kappa$ in
bounded domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The discrete trial and test spaces are
generated from standard mesh-based finite elements by local subscale
corrections in the spirit of numerical homogenization. The precomputation of
the corrections involves the solution of coercive cell problems on localized
subdomains of size $\ell H$; $H$ being the mesh size and $\ell$ being the
oversampling parameter. If the mesh size and the oversampling parameter are
such that $H\kappa$ and $\log(\kappa)/\ell$ fall below some generic constants,
the method is stable and its error is proportional to $H$; pollution effects
are eliminated in this regime.
