We present some interesting observations on the 3x+1 problem. We propose a
new algorithm which eliminates certain steps while we check the action of 3x+1
procedure on a number. Also, we propose a reason why many numbers follow a
similar pattern during execution of 3x+1 algorithm. We advocate towards the end
(a heuristic argument) that the 3x+1 conjecture is more likely to be true than
false.
