Four integrable symplectic maps approximating two Hamiltonian flows from the
relativistic Toda hierarchy are introduced. They are demostrated to belong to
the same hierarchy and to examplify the general scheme for symplectic maps on
groups equiped with quadratic Poisson brackets. The initial value problem for
the difference equations is solved in terms of a factorization problem in a
group. Interpolating Hamiltonian flows are found for all the maps.
