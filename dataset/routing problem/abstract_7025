In this note we discuss an abstract framework for standard boundary value
problems in divergence form with maximal monotone relations as "coefficients".
A reformulation of the respective problems is constructed such that they turn
out to be unitary equivalent to inverting a maximal monotone relation in a
Hilbert space. The method is based on the idea of "tailor-made" distributions
as provided by the construction of extrapolation spaces, see e.g. [Picard,
McGhee: Partial Differential Equations: A unified Hilbert Space Approach.
DeGruyter, 2011]. The abstract framework is illustrated by various examples.
