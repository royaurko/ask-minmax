Scheduling control problems for a family of unitary networks under heavy
traffic with general interarrival and service times, probabilistic routing and
an infinite horizon discounted linear holding cost are studied. Diffusion
control problems, that have been proposed as approximate models for the study
of these critically loaded controlled stochastic networks, can be regarded as
formal scaling limits of such stochastic systems. However, to date, a rigorous
limit theory that justifies the use of such approximations for a general family
of controlled networks has been lacking. It is shown that, under broad
conditions, the value function of the suitably scaled network control problem
converges to that of the associated diffusion control problem. This scaling
limit result, in addition to giving a precise mathematical basis for the above
approximation approach, suggests a general strategy for constructing near
optimal controls for the physical stochastic networks by solving the associated
diffusion control problem.
