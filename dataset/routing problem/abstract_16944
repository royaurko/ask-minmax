Graded modal logic is the formal language obtained from ordinary
(propositional) modal logic by endowing its modal operators with cardinality
constraints. Under the familiar possible-worlds semantics, these augmented
modal operators receive interpretations such as "It is true at no fewer than 15
accessible worlds that...", or "It is true at no more than 2 accessible worlds
that...". We investigate the complexity of satisfiability for this language
over some familiar classes of frames. This problem is more challenging than its
ordinary modal logic counterpart--especially in the case of transitive frames,
where graded modal logic lacks the tree-model property. We obtain tight
complexity bounds for the problem of determining the satisfiability of a given
graded modal logic formula over the classes of frames characterized by any
combination of reflexivity, seriality, symmetry, transitivity and the Euclidean
property.
