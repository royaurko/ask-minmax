We consider the problem of discretization for the U(1)-invariant nonlinear
wave equations in any dimension. We show that the classical finite-difference
scheme used by Strauss and Vazquez \cite{MR0503140} conserves the
positive-definite discrete analog of the energy if the grid ratio is $dt/dx\le
1/\sqrt{n}$, where $dt$ and $dx$ are the mesh sizes of the time and space
variables and $n$ is the spatial dimension. We also show that if the grid ratio
is $dt/dx=1/\sqrt{n}$, then there is the discrete analog of the charge which is
conserved.
  We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the discrete Cauchy
problem. We use the energy conservation to obtain the a priori bounds for
finite energy solutions, thus showing that the Strauss -- Vazquez
finite-difference scheme for the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation with positive
nonlinear term in the Hamiltonian is conditionally stable.
