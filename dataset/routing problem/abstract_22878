The assessment of bidirectional heuristic search has been incorrect since it
was first published more than a quarter of a century ago. For quite a long
time, this search strategy did not achieve the expected results, and there was
a major misunderstanding about the reasons behind it. Although there is still
wide-spread belief that bidirectional heuristic search is afflicted by the
problem of search frontiers passing each other, we demonstrate that this
conjecture is wrong. Based on this finding, we present both a new generic
approach to bidirectional heuristic search and a new approach to dynamically
improving heuristic values that is feasible in bidirectional search only. These
approaches are put into perspective with both the traditional and more recently
proposed approaches in order to facilitate a better overall understanding.
Empirical results of experiments with our new approaches show that
bidirectional heuristic search can be performed very efficiently and also with
limited memory. These results suggest that bidirectional heuristic search
appears to be better for solving certain difficult problems than corresponding
unidirectional search. This provides some evidence for the usefulness of a
search strategy that was long neglected. In summary, we show that bidirectional
heuristic search is viable and consequently propose that it be reconsidered.
