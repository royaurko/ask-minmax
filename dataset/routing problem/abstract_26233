We argue that some of the difficulties in constructing realistic models of
low-scale gauge mediation are artifacts of the narrow set of models that have
been studied. In particular, much attention has been payed to the scenario in
which the Goldstino superfield in an O'Raifeartaigh model is responsible for
both supersymmetry breaking and R-symmetry breaking. In such models, the
competing problems of generating sufficiently massive gauginos while preserving
an acceptably light gravitino can be quite challenging. We show that by sharing
the burdens of breaking supersymmetry and R-symmetry with a second field, these
problems are easily solved even within the O'Raifeartaigh framework. We present
explicit models realizing minimal gauge mediation with a gravitino mass in the
eV range that are both calculable and falsifiable.
