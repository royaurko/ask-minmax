We develop a rigorously controlled multi-time scale averaging technique; the
averaging is done on a finite time interval, properly chosen, and then, via
iterations and normal form transformations, the time intervals are scaled to
arbitrary order. Here, we consider as an example the problem of finite
dimensional conservative dynamical system, which is quasiperiodic and dominated
by slow frequencies, leading to small divisor problems in perturbative schemes.
