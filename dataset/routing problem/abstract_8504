In the present article, we study the numerical approximation of a system of
Hamilton-Jacobi and transport equations arising in geometrical optics. We
consider a semi-Lagrangian scheme. We prove the well posedness of the discrete
problem and the convergence of the approximated solution toward the
viscosity-measure valued solution of the exact problem.
