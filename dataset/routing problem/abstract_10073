We provide a formula for the lower bound in the form of $|F| \ge K$, in such
a way that the decision version of unweighted non-bipartite matching can be
solved in polynomial time. ~The parameter $K$ can vary from instance to
instance. We assume that the domains, the set of vertices and the set of edges,
are ordered. To our knowledge, no polynomially solvable satisfiability
expression has been developed for this problem so far, or for that matter, for
any decision problem derived from optimization. Hence for such problems, this
opens up a new approach to solving them.
