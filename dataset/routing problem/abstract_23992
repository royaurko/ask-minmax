The newest progress on the study of the strangeness in the proton and in the
lowest negative parity nucleon excited state $N^*(1535)$ is reviewed.
Implications on the internal quark structure of the proton, $N^*(1535)$ and
other baryons are discussed. The diquark cluster picture for the 5-quark
components in baryons gives a natural explanation not only to the empirical
indications for a positive strangeness magnetic moment $\mu_s$ and positive
strangeness radius of the proton but also the longstanding mass-reverse problem
of $N^*(1535)$, $N^*(1440)$ and $\Lambda^*(1405)$ resonances as well as the
unusual decay pattern of the $N^*(1535)$ resonance. Evidence for possible
existence of $N^*(1535)$'s ${1/2}^-$ SU(3) nonet partners in this picture is
pointed out, and suggestion is made to search for these $1/2^-$ hyperon excited
states under the well known $\Sigma^*(1385)$, $\Lambda^*(1520)$ and
$\Xi^*(1530)$ peaks in various reactions.
