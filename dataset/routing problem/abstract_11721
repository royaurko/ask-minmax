The magnetization for electrons on a two-dimensional sphere, under a
spherically symmetrical normal magnetic field has been studied in the large
field limit. This allows us to use an Euclidean approximation for low energies
electron states getting an analytical solution for the problem and avoiding the
difficulties of quantization on a curved manifold. At low temperatures our
results are exact and allow direct comparisson with the planar Landau case. In
this temperature limit we compute the magnetization and show it exhibit an
oscillatory de Hass-Van Alphen type of behaviour.
