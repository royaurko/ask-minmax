This study deals with the missing link prediction problem: the problem of
predicting the existence of missing connections between entities of interest.
We address link prediction using coupled analysis of relational datasets
represented as heterogeneous data, i.e., datasets in the form of matrices and
higher-order tensors. We propose to use an approach based on probabilistic
interpretation of tensor factorisation models, i.e., Generalised Coupled Tensor
Factorisation, which can simultaneously fit a large class of tensor models to
higher-order tensors/matrices with com- mon latent factors using different loss
functions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that joint analysis of data from
multiple sources via coupled factorisation improves the link prediction
performance and the selection of right loss function and tensor model is
crucial for accurately predicting missing links.
