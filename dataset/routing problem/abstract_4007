In this paper we give a meaning to the nonlinear characteristic Cauchy
problem for the Wave Equation in base form by replacing it by a family of
non-characteristic problems in an appropriate algebra of generalized functions.
We prove existence of a solution and we precise how it depends on the choice
made. We also check that in the classical case (non-characteristic) our new
solution coincides with the classical one.
