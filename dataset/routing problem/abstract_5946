For Boolean satisfiability problems, the structure of the solution space is
characterized by the solution graph, where the vertices are the solutions, and
two solutions are connected iff they differ in exactly one variable. Motivated
by research on heuristics and the satisfiability threshold, in 2006, Gopalan et
al. studied connectivity properties of the solution graph and related
complexity issues for CSPs. They found dichotomies for the diameter of
connected components and for the complexity of the stconnectivity question, and
conjectured a trichotomy for the connectivity question. Their results were
refined by Makino et al. Recently, we were able to establish the trichotomy.
Here, we consider connectivity issues of satisfiability problems defined by
Boolean circuits and propositional formulas that use gates, resp. connectives,
from a fixed set of Boolean functions. We obtain dichotomies for the diameter
and the connectivity problems: on one side, the diameter is linear, and both
problems are in P, while on the other, the diameter can be exponential, and the
problems are PSPACE-complete.
