We compare here the relative strength of four widely used procedures on
finite strategic games: iterated elimination of weakly/strictly dominated
strategies by a pure/mixed strategy. A complication is that none of these
procedures is based on a monotonic operator. To deal with this problem we use
'global' versions of these operators.
