A formalism capable of handling the first step of hierarchical replica
symmetry breaking in finite-connectivity models is introduced. The emerging
order parameter is claimed to be a probability distribution over the space of
field distributions (or, equivalently magnetisation distributions) inside the
cluster of states. The approach is shown to coincide with the previous works in
the replica symmetric case and in the two limit cases m=0,1 where m is Parisi's
break-point. As an application to the study of optimization problems, the
ground-state properties of the random 3-Satisfiability problem are investigated
and we present a first RSB solution improving replica symmetric results.
