We study the fundamental algorithmic rigidity problems for generic frameworks
periodic with respect to a fixed lattice or a finite-order rotation in the
plane. For fixed-lattice frameworks we give an $O(n^2)$ algorithm for deciding
generic rigidity and an O(n^3) algorithm for computing rigid components. If the
order of rotation is part of the input, we give an O(n^4) algorithm for
deciding rigidity; in the case where the rotation's order is 3, a more
specialized algorithm solves all the fundamental algorithmic rigidity problems
in O(n^2) time.
