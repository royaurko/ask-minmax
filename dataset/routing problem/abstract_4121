Given two pushdown systems, the bisimilarity problem asks whether they are
bisimilar. While this problem is known to be decidable our main result states
that it is nonelementary, improving EXPTIME-hardness, which was the previously
best known lower bound for this problem. Our lower bound result holds for
normed pushdown systems as well.
