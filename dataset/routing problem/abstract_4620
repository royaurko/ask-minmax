We investigate the Cartan and Finsler geometry of the rotating Kepler
problem, a limit case of the restricted three body problem that arises if the
mass of the one of the primaries goes to zero. We show that the Hamiltonian for
the rotating Kepler problem can be regarded as the Legendre transform of a
certain family of Finsler metrics on the two-sphere. For very negative energy
levels, these Finsler metrics are close to the round metric, and the associated
flag curvature is hence positive. On the other hand, we show that the flag
curvature can become negative once the energy level becomes sufficiently high.
