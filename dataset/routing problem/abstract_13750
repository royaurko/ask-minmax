Significant uncertainty of our present knowledge for uranium critical point
parameters is under consideration. Present paper is devoted to comparative
analysis of possible resolutions for the problem of uranium critical point
location, as well as to discussion of plausible scheme of decisive experiment,
which could resolve existing uncertainty. New calculations of gas-liquid
coexistence in uranium by modern thermodynamic code are included in the
analysis.
