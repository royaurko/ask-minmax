Based on the fact that the scalar curvature of the internal space determines
the mass of the dilaton in higher-dimensional unified theories, we show how the
dilaton mass can explain the origin of mass and resolve the hierarchy problem.
Moreover, we show that cosmology puts a strong constraint on dilaton mass, and
requires the scale of the internal space to be larger than $10^{-9} m$.
