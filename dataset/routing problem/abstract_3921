We give in this paper a convergence result concerning parallel synchronous
algorithm for nonlinear fixed point problems with respect to the euclidian norm
in $\Rn$. We then apply this result to some problems related to convex analysis
like minimization of functionals, calculus of saddle point, convex
programming...
