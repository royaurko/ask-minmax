Cold Dark Matter (CDM) has become the standard modern theory of cosmological
structure formation. Its predictions appear to be in good agreement with data
on large scales, and it naturally accounts for many properties of galaxies. But
despite its many successes, there has been concern about CDM on small scales
because of the possible contradiction between the linearly rising rotation
curves observed in some dark-matter-dominated galaxies vs. the $1/r$ density
cusps at the centers of simulated CDM halos. Other CDM issues on small scales
include the very large number of small satellite halos in simulations, far more
than the number of small galaxies observed locally, and problems concerning the
angular momentum of the baryons in dark matter halos. The latest data and
simulations have lessened, although not entirely resolved, these concerns.
Meanwhile, the main alternatives to CDM that have been considered to solve
these problems, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) and warm dark matter (WDM),
have been found to have serious drawbacks.
