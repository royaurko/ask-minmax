We consider a quantitative form of the quasi-isometry problem. We discuss
several arguments which lead us to different results and bounds of
quasi-isometric distortion: comparison of volumes, connectivity etc. Then we
study the transport of Poincar\'e constants by quasi-isometries and we give
sharp lower and upper bounds for the homotopy distortion growth for an
interesting class of hyperbolic metric spaces.
