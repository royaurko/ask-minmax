Let G=(A,B,E) be a bipartite graph with color classes A and B. The graph G is
chordal bipartite if G has no induced cycle of length more than four. Let
G=(V,E) be a graph. A feedback vertex set F is a set of vertices F subset V
such that G-F is a forest. The feedback vertex set problem asks for a feedback
vertex set of minimal cardinality. We show that the feedback vertex set problem
can be solved in polynomial time on chordal bipartite graphs.
