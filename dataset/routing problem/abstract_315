Efficient path planning and navigation is critical for animals, robotics,
logistics and transportation. We study a model in which spatial navigation
problems can rapidly be solved in the brain by parallel mental exploration of
alternative routes using propagating waves of neural activity. A wave of
spiking activity propagates through a hippocampus-like network, altering the
synaptic connectivity. The resulting vector field of synaptic change then
guides a simulated animal to the appropriate selected target locations. We
demonstrate that the navigation problem can be solved using realistic, local
synaptic plasticity rules during a single passage of a wavefront. Our model can
find optimal solutions for competing possible targets or learn and navigate in
multiple environments. The model provides a hypothesis on the possible
computational mechanisms for optimal path planning in the brain, at the same
time it is useful for neuromorphic implementations, where the parallelism of
information processing proposed here can fully be harnessed in hardware.
