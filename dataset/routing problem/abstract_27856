The transition from quarks to hadrons in a heavy-ion collision at high energy
is usually studied in two different contexts that involve very different
transverse scales: local and non-local. Models that are concerned with the
$p_T$ spectra and azimuthal anisotropy belong to the former, i.e.,
hadronization at a local point in $(\eta,\phi)$ space, such as the
recombination model. The non-local problem has to do with quark-hadron phase
transition where collective behavior through near-neighbor interaction can
generate patterns of varying sizes in the $(\eta,\phi)$ space. The two types of
problems are put together in this paper both as brief reviews separately and to
discuss how they are related to each other. In particular, we ask how minijets
produced at LHC can affect the investigation of multiplicity fluctuations as
signals of critical behavior. It is suggested that the existing data from LHC
have sufficient multiplicities in small $p_T$ intervals to make feasible the
observation of distinctive features of clustering of soft particles, as well as
voids, that characterize the critical behavior at phase transition from quarks
to hadrons, without any ambiguity posed by the clustering of jet particles.
