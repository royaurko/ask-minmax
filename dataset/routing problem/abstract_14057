Mobile guards on the vertices of a graph are used to defend it against
attacks on either its vertices or its edges. Various models for this problem
have been proposed. In this survey we describe a number of these models with
particular attention to the case when the attack sequence is infinitely long
and the guards must induce some particular configuration before each attack,
such as a dominating set or a vertex cover. Results from the literature
concerning the number of guards needed to successfully defend a graph in each
of these problems are surveyed.
