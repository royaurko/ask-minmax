We propose a coordinate-space regularization of the three-body problem with
zero-range potentials. We include the effective range and the shape parameter
in the boundary condition of the zero-range potential. The proposed extended
zero-range model is tested against atomic helium trimers and is shown to
provide an adequate quantitative description of these systems.
