In the present paper we introduce a new concept of Hardy type space naturally
defined on the Klein-Dirac quadric. We study different properties of the
functions belonging to these spaces, in particular boundary value problems. We
apply these new spaces to polyharmonic interpolation and to interpolatory
cubature formulas.
