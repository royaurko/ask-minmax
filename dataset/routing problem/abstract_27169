The Logic of Proofs, LP, and its successor, Justification Logic, is a
refinement of the modal logic approach to epistemology in which
proofs/justifications are taken into account. In 2000 Kuznets showed that
satisfiability for LP is in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, a
result which has been successfully repeated for all other one-agent
justification logics whose complexity is known.
  We introduce a family of multi-agent justification logics with interactions
between the agents' justifications, by extending and generalizing the two-agent
versions of the Logic of Proofs introduced by Yavorskaya in 2008. Known
concepts and tools from the single-agent justification setting are adjusted for
this multiple agent case. We present tableau rules and some preliminary
complexity results. In several cases the satisfiability problem for these
logics remains in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, while for
others it is PSPACE or EXP-hard. Furthermore, this problem becomes PSPACE-hard
even for certain two-agent logics, while there are EXP-hard logics of three
agents.
