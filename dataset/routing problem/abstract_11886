In this paper we consider the problem of RNA folding with pseudoknots. We use
a graphical representation in which the secondary structures are described by
planar diagrams. Pseudoknots are identified as non-planar diagrams. We analyze
the non-planar topologies of RNA structures and propose a classification of RNA
pseudoknots according to the minimal genus of the surface on which the RNA
structure can be embedded. This classification provides a simple and natural
way to tackle the problem of RNA folding prediction in presence of pseudoknots.
Based on that approach, we describe a Monte Carlo algorithm for the prediction
of pseudoknots in an RNA molecule.
