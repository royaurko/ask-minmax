The concept of universal designated verifier signatures was introduced by
Steinfeld, Bull, Wang and Pieprzyk at Asiacrypt 2003. These signatures can be
used as standard publicly verifiable digital signatures but have an additional
functionality which allows any holder of a signature to designate the signature
to any desired verifier. This designated verifier can check that the message
was indeed signed, but is unable to convince anyone else of this fact. We
propose new efficient constructions for pairing-based short signatures. Our
first scheme is based on Boneh-Boyen signatures and its security can be
analyzed in the standard security model. We prove its resistance to forgery
assuming the hardness of the so-called strong Diffie-Hellman problem, under the
knowledge-of-exponent assumption. The second scheme is compatible with the
Boneh-Lynn-Shacham signatures and is proven unforgeable, in the random oracle
model, under the assumption that the computational bilinear Diffie-Hellman
problem is untractable. Both schemes are designed for devices with constrained
computation capabilities since the signing and the designation procedure are
pairing-free. Finally, we present extensions of these schemes in the multi-user
setting proposed by Desmedt in 2003.
