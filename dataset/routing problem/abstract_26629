The widely-accepted theoretical treatment of the electromagnetic boundary
problem of evanescent wave transfer at an interface between a normal medium of
n=1 and an ideal negative index medium of n=-1 neglects the non-zero induced
surface current and charge densities at the interface and is self-inconsistent.
We re-solve the electromagnetic boundary problem by taking into account the
non-zero induced surface current and charge densities that have been neglected
so far by others. We give the exact induced surface current and charge
distributions for this special case and solve the refracted and reflected
fields analytically using Green's function method. The self-consistent solution
yields a transmission coefficient of 1 and reflection coefficient of 0 for all
evanescent waves. Accordingly, we found that, on the contrary to the popular
belief, negative index of refraction does not make perfect lenses.
