We suggest a model which addresses both the fermion mass hierarchy problem
and the family problem in two-layer warped extra dimensions. In this model, 3
family fermions in 4 dimensions (4D) generate from 1 family in two-layer warped
6D by two step Kluza-Klein decompositions. The mass hierarchies are produced by
the exponential behavior of 4D fermion zero mode profiles. The mixings and
masses of fermions are closely related to the family problem. By adjusting
parameters in this model, the numerical results can be very close to the
experimental data both in the quark sector and in the lepton sector. In the
lepton sector, we suppose neutrinos to be Dirac ones. The neutrino masses of
sub-$\mathrm{eV}$ scale are obtained, and also CP violation emerges in the
lepton sector.
