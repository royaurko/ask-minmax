Let $\Omega$ be a Lipschitz domain in $\mathbb R^n$ $n\geq 2,$ and $L=\divt
A\nabla$ be a second order elliptic operator in divergence form. We establish
solvability of the Dirichlet regularity problem with boundary data in
$H^{1,p}(\dom)$ and of the Neumann problem with $L^p(\partial\Omega)$ data for
the operator $L$ on Lipschitz domains with small Lipschitz constant. We allow
the coefficients of the operator $L$ to be rough obeying a certain Carleson
condition with small norm. These results complete the results of [5] where
$L^p(\dom)$ Dirichlet problem was considered under the same assumptions and [6]
where the regularity and Neumann problems were considered on two dimensional
domains.
