We settle the equivalence between the problem of hitting a polyhedral set by
the orbit of a linear map and the intersection of a regular language and a
language of permutations of binary words (the permutation filter realizability
problem). The decidability of the both problems is presently unknown and the
first one is a straightforward generalization of the famous Skolem problem and
the nonnegativity problem in the theory of linear recurrent sequences. To show
a `borderline' status of the permutation filter realizability problem with
respect to computability we present some decidable and undecidable problems
closely related to it.
