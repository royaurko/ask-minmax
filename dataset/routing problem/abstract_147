We consider the problem of designing an overlay network and routing mechanism
that permits finding resources efficiently in a peer-to-peer system. We argue
that many existing approaches to this problem can be modeled as the
construction of a random graph embedded in a metric space whose points
represent resource identifiers, where the probability of a connection between
two nodes depends only on the distance between them in the metric space. We
study the performance of a peer-to-peer system where nodes are embedded at grid
points in a simple metric space: a one-dimensional real line. We prove upper
and lower bounds on the message complexity of locating particular resources in
such a system, under a variety of assumptions about failures of either nodes or
the connections between them. Our lower bounds in particular show that the use
of inverse power-law distributions in routing, as suggested by Kleinberg
(1999), is close to optimal. We also give efficient heuristics to dynamically
maintain such a system as new nodes arrive and old nodes depart. Finally, we
give experimental results that suggest promising directions for future work.
