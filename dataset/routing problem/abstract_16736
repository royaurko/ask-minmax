We present a general framework to study stability of the synchronous solution
for a hypernetwork of coupled dynamical systems. We are able to reduce the
dimensionality of the problem by using simultaneous block-diagonalization of
matrices. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for stability of the
synchronous solution in terms of a set of lower-dimensional problems and test
the predictions of our low-dimensional analysis through numerical simulations.
Under certain conditions, this technique may yield a substantial reduction of
the dimensionality of the problem. For example, for a class of dynamical
hypernetworks analyzed in the paper, we discover that arbitrarily large
networks can be reduced to a collection of subsystems of dimensionality no more
than 2. We apply our reduction techique to a number of different examples,
including a class of undirected unweighted hypermotifs of three nodes.
