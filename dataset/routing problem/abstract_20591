We consider a simple model of the dynamics of a single electron in a crystal
lattice. Although this is a standard problem in condensed matter physics,
alternative ways of evaluating a partition function for such a system lead to
equalities, that may be interesting from the point of view of mathematical
analysis, combinatorics and graph theory.
