A simple extension of the standard model is proposed in which all the three
generations of neutrinos are Dirac particles and are naturally light. We then
assume that the neutrino mass matrix is diagonal and degenerate, with a few eV
mass to solve the dark matter problem. The self energy radiative corrections,
however, remove this degeneracy and allow mixing of these neutrinos. The
electroweak radiative corrections then predict a lower bound on the $\nu_\mu -
\nu_e$ mass difference which solves the solar neutrino problem through MSW
mechanism and also predict a lower bound on the $\nu_\tau - \nu_\mu$ mass
difference which is just enough to explain the atmospheric neutrino problem as
reported by super Kamiokande.
