Rapid growth of constraints is often observed in free evolutions of highly
gravitating systems. To alleviate this problem we investigate the effect of
adding spatial derivatives of the constraints to the right hand side of the
evolution equations, and we look at how this affects the character of the
system and the treatment of boundaries. We apply this technique to two
formulations of Maxwell's equations, the so-called fat Maxwell and the
Knapp-Walker-Baumgarte systems, and obtain mixed hyperbolic-parabolic problems
in which high frequency constraint violations are damped. Constraint-preserving
boundary conditions amount to imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions on
constraint variables, which translate into Neumann-like boundary conditions for
the main variables. The success of the numerical tests presented in this work
suggests that this remedy may bring benefits to fully nonlinear simulations of
General Relativity.
