In this study, the inverse problem of the scattering theory on the half line
for a piecewise continuous Sturm-Liouville equation with boundary condition
depending quadratic on the spectral parameter is considered. The scattering
data of the problem is defined, some properties of the scattering data are
investigated. The main equation is derived and uniqueness algorithm to the
potential with given scattering data is studied.
