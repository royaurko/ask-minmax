In this paper, we first prove Riemann Hypothesis and General Riemann
Hypothesis. Then, we improve the result of prime number theorems for arithmetic
progression. Finally, we provide a proof that Goldbach Conjecture and Twin
Prime Conjecture are true. Thus, we have resolved the Hilbert's Eighth Problem.
