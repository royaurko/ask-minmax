In this article, we show some new second main theorems for the mappings and
moving hyperplanes of $\P^n(\C)$ with truncated counting functions. Our results
are improvements of recent previous second main theorems for moving hyperplanes
with the truncated (to level $n$) counting functions. As their application, we
prove a unicity theorem for meromorphic mappings sharing moving hyperplanes.
