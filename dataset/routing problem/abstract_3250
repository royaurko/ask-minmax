In this paper, we will introduce an exact algorithm with a time complexity of
$O^*(1.299^m)$ for the {\sc weighted mutually exclusive set cover} problem,
where $m$ is the number of subsets in the problem. This problem has important
applications in recognizing mutation genes that cause different cancer
diseases.
