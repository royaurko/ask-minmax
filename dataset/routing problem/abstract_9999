We study the problem of approximate social welfare maximization (without
money) in one-sided matching problems when agents have unrestricted cardinal
preferences over a finite set of items. Random priority is a very well-known
truthful-in-expectation mechanism for the problem. We prove that the
approximation ratio of random priority is Theta(n^{-1/2}) while no
truthful-in-expectation mechanism can achieve an approximation ratio better
than O(n^{-1/2}), where n is the number of agents and items. Furthermore, we
prove that the approximation ratio of all ordinal (not necessarily
truthful-in-expectation) mechanisms is upper bounded by O(n^{-1/2}), indicating
that random priority is asymptotically the best truthful-in-expectation
mechanism and the best ordinal mechanism for the problem.
