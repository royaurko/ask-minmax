The problem of estimating a spiked covariance matrix in high dimensions under
Frobenius loss, and the parallel problem of estimating the noise in spiked PCA
is investigated. We propose an estimator of the noise parameter by minimizing
an unbiased estimator of the invariant Frobenius risk using calculus of
variations. The resulting estimator is shown, using random matrix theory, to be
strongly consistent and essentially asymptotically normal and minimax for the
noise estimation problem. We apply the construction to construct a robust
spiked covariance matrix estimator with consistent eigenvalues.
