Horizontal flavor symmetries can drastically suppress Dirac neutrino masses
well below those of the corresponding charged leptons. We show that models can
be constructed where the light neutrino mass eigenvalues are small enough to
give the MSW solution to the solar neutrino problem, with a right-handed
neutrino scale no larger than a TeV. We present a model of this type where the
right-handed neutrino scale is generated by the spontaneous breakdown of gauged
U(1)$_{B-L}$, in a radiative breaking scenario driven by the right-handed
neutrino Yukawa couplings. The model allows for a solution to the $\mu$
problem, and predicts the existence of a $Z'$ boson within the reach of the LHC
or the Tevatron.
