We propose in this paper a multilevel correction method to solve optimal
control problems constrained by elliptic equations with the finite element
method. In this scheme, solving optimization problem on the finest finite
element space is transformed to a series of solutions of linear boundary value
problems by the multigrid method on multilevel meshes and a series of solutions
of optimization problems on the coarsest finite element space. Our proposed
scheme, instead of solving a large scale optimization problem in the finest
finite element space, solves only a series of linear boundary value problems
and the optimization problems in a very low dimensional finite element space,
and thus can improve the overall efficiency for the solution of optimal control
problems governed by PDEs.
