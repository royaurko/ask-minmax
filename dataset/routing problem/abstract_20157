We consider the problem of Arnold's diffusion for nearly integrable
isochronous Hamiltonian systems. We prove a shadowing theorem which improves
the known estimates for the diffusion time. We also develop a new method for
measuring the splitting of the separatrices. As an application we justify, for
three time scales systems, that the splitting is correctly predicted by the
Poincar\'e-Melnikov function.
