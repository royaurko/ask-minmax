Using the framework for solving the spherically symmetric field equations in
observational coordinates given in Araujo and Stoeger (1999), their formulation
and solution in the perturbed FLRW sperically symmetric case with observational
data representing galaxy redshifts, number counts and observer area distances,
both as functions of redshift on our past light cone, are presented. The
importance of the central conditions, those which must hold on our world line
C, is emphasized. In detailing the solution for these perturbations, we discuss
the gauge problem and its resolution in this context, as well as how errors and
gaps in the data are propagated together with the genuine perturbations. This
will provide guidance for solving, and interpreting the solutions of the more
complicated general perturbation problem with observational data on our past
light cone.
