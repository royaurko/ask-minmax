A large number of essays address the Sleeping Beauty problem, which
undermines the validity of Bayesian inference and Bas Van Fraassen's
'Reflection Principle'. In this study a straightforward analysis of the problem
based on probability theory is presented. The key difference from previous
works is that apart from the random experiment imposed by the problem's
description, a different one is also considered, in order to negate the
confusion on the involved conditional probabilities. The results of the
analysis indicate that no inconsistency takes place, whereas both Bayesian
inference and 'Reflection Principle' are valid.
