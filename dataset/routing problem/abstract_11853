We discuss a method to transform the covariant Fokker action into an implicit
two-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian for the electromagnetic two-body problem with
arbitrary masses. This dynamical system appeared 100 years ago and it was
popularized in the 1940's by the still incomplete Wheeler and Feynman program
to quantize it as a means to overcome the divergencies of perturbative QED. Our
finite-dimensional implicit Hamiltonian is closed and involves no series
expansions. The Hamiltonian formalism is then used to motivate an EBK
quantization based on the classical trajectories with a non-perturbative
formula that predicts energies free of infinities.
