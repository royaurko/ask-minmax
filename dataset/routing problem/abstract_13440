Motivated by a problem in simulated tempering (a form of Markov chain Monte
Carlo), we seek to minimise, in a suitable sense, the time it takes a (regular)
diffusion with instantaneous reflection at 0 and 1 to travel from the origin to
1 and then return. The control mechanism is that we are allowed to chose the
diffusion's drift at each point in [0,1]. We consider the static and dynamic
versions of this problem, where, in the dynamic version, we are only able to
choose the drift at each point at the time of first visiting that point.
