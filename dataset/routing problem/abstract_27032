The task of detecting the interest points in 3D meshes has typically been
handled by geometric methods. These methods, while greatly describing human
preference, can be ill-equipped for handling the variety and subjectivity in
human responses. Different tasks have different requirements for interest point
detection; some tasks may necessitate high precision while other tasks may
require high recall. Sometimes points with high curvature may be desirable,
while in other cases high curvature may be an indication of noise. Geometric
methods lack the required flexibility to adapt to such changes. As a
consequence, interest point detection seems to be well suited for machine
learning methods that can be trained to match the criteria applied on the
annotated training data. In this paper, we formulate interest point detection
as a supervised binary classification problem using a random forest as our
classifier. Among other challenges, we are faced with an imbalanced learning
problem due to the substantial difference in the priors between interest and
non-interest points. We address this by re-sampling the training set. We
validate the accuracy of our method and compare our results to those of five
state of the art methods on a new, standard benchmark.
