This paper is concerned with the final value problem for a system of
nonlinear wave equations. The main issue is to solve the problem for the case
where the nonlinearity is of a long range type. By assuming that the solution
is spherically symmetric, we shall show global solvability of the final value
problem around a suitable final state, and hence the generalized wave operator
and long range scattering operator can be constructed.
