In the Hospitals/Residents (HR) problem, agents are partitioned into
hospitals and residents. Each agent wishes to be matched to an agent in the
other set and has a strict preference over these potential matches. A matching
is stable if there are no blocking pairs, i.e., no pair of agents that prefer
each other to their assigned matches. Such a situation is undesirable as it
could lead to a deviation in which the blocking pair form a private arrangement
outside the matching. This however assumes that the blocking pair have social
ties or communication channels to facilitate the deviation. Relaxing the
stability definition to take account of the potential lack of social ties
between agents can yield larger stable matchings.
  In this paper, we define the Hospitals/Residents problem under Social
Stability (HRSS) which takes into account social ties between agents by
introducing a social network graph to the HR problem. Edges in the social
network graph correspond to resident-hospital pairs in the HR instance that
know one another. Pairs that do not have corresponding edges in the social
network graph can belong to a matching M but they can never block M. Relative
to a relaxed stability definition for HRSS, called social stability, we show
that socially stable matchings can have different sizes and the problem of
finding a maximum socially stable matching is NP-hard, though approximable
within 3/2. Furthermore we give polynomial time algorithms for three special
cases of the problem.
