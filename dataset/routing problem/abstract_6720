In the Collatz 3x+1 problem, there are 3 possibilities: Starting from any
positive number, we either reach the trivial loop (1,4,2), end up in a
non-trivial loop, or go until infinity. In this paper, we shall show that if a
non-trivial loop with m odd numbers exists, then its minimum odd number is
bounded above by a function of m. We shall also use that bound to calculate the
least number of odd elements required for a non-trivial loop to exist. Also,
the generalized bounds for the px+q problem are given.
