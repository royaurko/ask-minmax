As previously observed the massless limit of massive gravity leads to a
modification of general relativity. Here we study spherically symmetric
solutions of the modified field equations which contain normal matter together
with a dark energy density. If the dark density profile is assumed to be known,
the whole problem is reduced to a linear first order differential equation
which can be solved by quadratures.
