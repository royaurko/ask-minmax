We present two different methods for estimating the cost of solving SAT
problems. The methods focus on the online behaviour of the backtracking solver,
as well as the structure of the problem. Modern SAT solvers present several
challenges to estimate search cost including coping with nonchronological
backtracking, learning and restarts. Our first method adapt an existing
algorithm for estimating the size of a search tree to deal with these
challenges. We then suggest a second method that uses a linear model trained on
data gathered online at the start of search. We compare the effectiveness of
these two methods using random and structured problems. We also demonstrate
that predictions made in early restarts can be used to improve later
predictions. We conclude by showing that the cost of solving a set of problems
can be reduced by selecting a solver from a portfolio based on such cost
estimations.
