We consider the classical Merton problem of lifetime consumption-portfolio
optimization problem with small proportional transaction costs. The first order
term in the asymptotic expansion is explicitly calculated through a singular
ergodic control problem which can be solved in closed form in the
one-dimensional case. Unlike the existing literature, we consider a general
utility function and general dynamics for the underlying assets. Our arguments
are based on ideas from the homogenization theory and use the convergence tools
from the theory of viscosity solutions. The multidimensional case is studied in
our accompanying paper using the same approach.
