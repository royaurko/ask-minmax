The pole placement problem belongs to the classical problems of linear
systems theory. It is often assumed that the ground field is the real numbers R
or the complex numbers C. The major result over the complex numbers derived in
1981 by Brockett and Byrnes states that arbitrary static pole placement is
possible for a generic set of m-inputs, p-outputs and McMillan degree n system
as soon as mp>=n. Moreover the number of solutions in the situation mp=n is an
intersection number first computed by Hermann Schubert in the 19th century. In
this paper we show that the same result with slightly different proofs holds
over any algebraically closed field.
