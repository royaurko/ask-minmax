The time dependent Dirac-Maxwell's Equations in presence of electric and
magnetic sources are written in chiral media and the solutions for the
classical problem are obtained in unique simple and consistent manner. The
quaternion reformulation of generalized electromagnetic fields in chiral media
has also been developed in compact, simple and consistent manner.
