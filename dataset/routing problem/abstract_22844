I construct a two-dimensional lattice on which the inhomogeneous site
percolation threshold is exactly calculable and use this result to find two
more lattices on which the site thresholds can be determined. The primary
lattice studied here, the ``martini lattice'', is a hexagonal lattice with
every second site transformed into a triangle. The site threshold of this
lattice is found to be $0.764826...$, while the others have $0.618034...$ and
$1/\sqrt{2}$. This last solution suggests a possible approach to establishing
the bound for the hexagonal site threshold, $p_c<1/\sqrt{2}$. To derive these
results, I solve a correlated bond problem on the hexagonal lattice by use of
the star-triangle transformation and then, by a particular choice of
correlations, solve the site problem on the martini lattice.
