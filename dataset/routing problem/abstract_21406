We introduce a proximal version of dual coordinate ascent method. We
demonstrate how the derived algorithmic framework can be used for numerous
regularized loss minimization problems, including $\ell_1$ regularization and
structured output SVM. The convergence rates we obtain match, and sometimes
improve, state-of-the-art results.
