In this work we collect and compare to each other many different numerical
methods for regularized regression problem and for the problem of projection on
a hyperplane. Such problems arise, for example, as a subproblem of demand
matrix estimation in IP- networks. In this special case matrix of affine
constraints has special structure: all elements are 0 or 1 and this matrix is
sparse enough. We have to deal with huge-scale convex optimization problem of
special type. Using the properties of the problem we try "to look inside the
black-box" and to see how the best modern methods work being applied to this
problem.
