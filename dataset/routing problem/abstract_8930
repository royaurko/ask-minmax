We use a conformal mapping method introduced in a companion paper to study
the properties of bi-harmonic fields in the vicinity of rough boundaries. We
focus our analysis on two different situations where such bi-harmonic problems
are encountered: a Stokes flow near a rough wall and the stress distribution on
the rough interface of a material in uni-axial tension. We perform a complete
numerical solution of these two-dimensional problems for any univalued rough
surfaces. We present results for sinusoidal and self-affine surface whose slope
can locally reach 2.5. Beyond the numerical solution we present perturbative
solutions of these problems. We show in particular that at first order in
roughness amplitude, the surface stress of a material in uni-axial tension can
be directly obtained from the Hilbert transform of the local slope. In case of
self-affine surfaces, we show that the stress distribution presents, for large
stresses, a power law tail whose exponent continuously depends on the roughness
amplitude.
