The Aharonov--Bohm (AB) problem for vector bosons by the
Duffin--Kemmer--Petiau (DKP) formalism is analyzed. The relevant eigenvalue
equation coming from the DKP formalism reveals an equivalence to the
spin--$1/2$ AB problem. By using the self--adjoint extension approach, we
examine the bound state scenario. The energy spectra are explicitly computed as
well as their dependencies on the magnetic flux parameter and also the
conditions for the occurrence of bound states.
