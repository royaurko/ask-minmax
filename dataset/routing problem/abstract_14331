We present a semidefinite programming approach to bound the measures of
cross-independent pairs in a bipartite graph. This can be viewed as a
far-reaching extension of Hoffman's ratio bound on the independence number of a
graph. As an application, we solve a problem on the maximum measures of
cross-intersecting families of subsets with two different product measures,
which is a generalized measure version of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem for
cross-intersecting families with different uniformities.
