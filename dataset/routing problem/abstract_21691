We prove some semipositivity theorems for singular varieties coming from
graded polarizable admissible variations of mixed Hodge structure. As an
application, we obtain that the moduli functor of stable varieties is
semipositive in the sense of Koll\'ar. This completes Koll\'ar's projectivity
criterion for the moduli spaces of higher-dimensional stable varieties.
