This paper extends the work of Clarke [1] on the Bayesian foundations of the
biomagnetic inverse problem. It derives expressions for the expectation and
variance of the a posteriori source current probability distribution given a
prior source current probability distribution, a source space weight function
and a data set. The calculation of the variance enables the construction of a
Bayesian test for the appropriateness of any source model that is chosen as the
a priori infomation. The test is illustrated using both simulated
(multi-dipole) data and the results of a study of early latency processing of
images of human faces.
