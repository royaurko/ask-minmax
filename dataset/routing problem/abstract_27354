This project presents decentralized control scheme for Load-Frequency Control
in power System. In this era renewable energy is most promising solution to
man's ever increasing energy needs. But the power production by these resources
cannot be controlled unlike in thermal plants. A number of optimal control
techniques are adopted to implement a reliable stabilizing controller. It is
necessary to interconnect more distributed generation in power systems because
of environmental concerns. Primary concern includes global environmental and
energy depletion problem. A serious attempt has been undertaken aiming a
investigating the load frequency control problem in a power system consisting
of two power generation unit and multiple variable load units. The robustness
and reliability of the various control schemes is examined through simulations.
A system involving thermal plants and a hydro plant is modeled using MAT LAB
2011b.
