We investigate experimentally the route to quasiperiodicity in a driven
ratchet for cold atoms, and examine the relationship between symmetries and
transport while approaching the quasiperiodic limit. Depending on the specific
form of driving, quasiperiodicity results in the complete suppression of
transport, or into the restoration of the symmetries which hold for a periodic
driving.
