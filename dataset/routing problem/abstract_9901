In this paper, we investigate combining blocking and collapsing -- two widely
used strategies for improving the accuracy of Gibbs sampling -- in the context
of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). We show that combining them is not
straight-forward because collapsing (or eliminating variables) introduces new
dependencies in the PGM and in computation-limited settings, this may adversely
affect blocking. We therefore propose a principled approach for tackling this
problem. Specifically, we develop two scoring functions, one each for blocking
and collapsing, and formulate the problem of partitioning the variables in the
PGM into blocked and collapsed subsets as simultaneously maximizing both
scoring functions (i.e., a multi-objective optimization problem). We propose a
dynamic, greedy algorithm for approximately solving this intractable
optimization problem. Our dynamic algorithm periodically updates the
partitioning into blocked and collapsed variables by leveraging correlation
statistics gathered from the generated samples and enables rapid mixing by
blocking together and collapsing highly correlated variables. We demonstrate
experimentally the clear benefit of our dynamic approach: as more samples are
drawn, our dynamic approach significantly outperforms static graph-based
approaches by an order of magnitude in terms of accuracy.
