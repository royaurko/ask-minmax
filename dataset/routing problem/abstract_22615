Recently a lot of attention has been given to building dark energy models in
which the equation-of-state parameter $w$ can cross the phantom divide $w=-1$.
However, to our knowledge, these models with crossing the phantom divide only
provide the possibility that $w$ can cross -1. They do not answer another
question: {\em why crossing phantom divide occurs recently?} Since in many
existing models whose equation-of-state parameter can cross the phantom divide,
$w$ undulates around -1 randomly, {\em why are we living in an epoch $w<-1$?}
This can be regarded as the second cosmological coincidence problem. In this
note, we propose a possible approach to alleviate this problem within a hybrid
dark energy model.
