We discuss the current status of the resonant spin-flavor precession (RSFP)
solution to the solar neutrino problem. We perform a fit to all the latest
solar neutrino data for various assumed magnetic field profiles in the sun. We
show that the RSFP can account for all the solar neutrino experiments, giving
as good fit as other alternative solutions such as MSW or Just so, and
therefore can be a viable solution to the solar neutrino problem
