A method is developed for expressing limits of terms involving powers of an
arbitrary integer order by means of H-measures. It is applied to the small
amplitude homogenisation problem for a stationary diffusion equation, in which
coefficients are assumed to be analytic perturbations of a constant, enabling
formulae for higher order correction terms. Explicit expressions in terms of
Fourier coefficients are obtained under periodicity assumption.
