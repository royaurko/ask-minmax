We consider the 1D periodic Jacobi matrices. The spectrum of this operator is
purely absolutely continuous and consists of intervals separated by gaps. We
solve the inverse problem (including characterization) in terms of vertical
slits on the quasimomentum domain . Furthermore, we obtain a priori two-sided
estimates for vertical slits in terms of Jacoby matrices.
