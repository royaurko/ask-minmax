Growth codes are a subclass of Rateless codes that have found interesting
applications in data dissemination problems. Compared to other Rateless and
conventional channel codes, Growth codes show improved intermediate performance
which is particularly useful in applications where performance increases with
the number of decoded data units. In this paper, we provide a generic
analytical framework for studying the asymptotic performance of Growth codes in
different settings. Our analysis based on Wormald method applies to any class
of Rateless codes that does not include a precoding step. We evaluate the
decoding probability model for short codeblocks and validate our findings by
experiments. We then exploit the decoding probability model in an illustrative
application of Growth codes to error resilient video transmission. The video
transmission problem is cast as a joint source and channel rate allocation
problem that is shown to be convex with respect to the channel rate. This
application permits to highlight the main advantage of Growth codes that is
improved performance (hence distortion in video) in the intermediate loss
region.
