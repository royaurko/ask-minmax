Coalition logic is one of the most popular logics for multi-agent systems.
While epistemic extensions of coalition logic have received much attention,
existence of their complete axiomatisations has so far been an open problem. In
this paper we settle several of those problems. We prove completeness for
epistemic coalition logic with common knowledge, with distributed knowledge,
and with both common and distributed knowledge, respectively.
