Phase field equations describe the novel approach to the Stefan problems. We
calculate these equations numerically performed in two-dimensions. We take full
advantage of the phase field parameter $\varphi$ to track the interface on
which complicated movements or changes are needed. More precisely, we analyze
the dissolution and/or precipitation without the unknown velocity functions
like the Navier-Stokes equations numerically.
