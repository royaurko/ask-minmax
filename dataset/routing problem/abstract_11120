Bossa is a framework to develop new processes schedulers in commodity
operating systems. Although Bossa enables fine-grained management of the
processor through new scheduling policies, deploying an application with its
own scheduler raises some problems. In this paper we study the problems caused
when deploying an application and its scheduler and to adresse these, we
propose to establish Quality of Service contracts and mechanisms to reconfigure
the scheduler hierarchy.
