We describe some (countably many) classes K^{n,e} of finite graphs and prove
that if lambda^{aleph_0}= lambda then every lambda^+-chromatic graph of
cardinal lambda^+ contains, for some n, e, all members of K^{n,e} as
subgraphs. On the other hand, it is consistent for every regular infinite
cardinal kappa that there is a kappa^+-chromatic graph on kappa^+ that
contains finite subgraphs only from K^{n,e} .
