A new approach to the problem of group classification is applied to the class
of first-order non-linear equations of the form $u_a u_a=F(t,u,u_t)$. It
allowed complete solution of the group classification problem for a class of
equations for functions depending on multiple independent variables, where
highest derivatives enter nonlinearly. Equivalence groups of the class under
consideration and algebraic properties of the symmetry algebra are studied. The
class of equations considered presents generalisation of the eikonal and
Hamilton-Jacobi equations. The paper contains the list of all non-equivalent
equations from this class with symmetry extensions, and proofs of such non-
equivalence. New first order non-linear equations possessing wide symmetry
groups were constructed.
