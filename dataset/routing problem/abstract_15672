The supersymmetric left-right (SUSYLR) models solve several of the
unnaturalness problems of the MSSM such as the R-parity and SUSY CP problems.
If further the $W_R$ mass is in the TeV range, then it also provides a solution
to the strong CP problem without the need for an axion. A crucial prediction of
this model is the electric dipole moment of the neutron $\simeq
10^{-25}-10^{-26}$ ecm arising from the one loop contribution to the strong CP
parameter $\bar{theta}$. Other predictions of the model are a light doubly
charged Higgs boson and its fermionic partner with masses in the several
hundred GeV range. We then show this model can be extended to include the
leptoquarks that can explain the HERA high $Q^2$ anomaly without giving up
R-parity conservation.
