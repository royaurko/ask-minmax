The paper deals with the basic integral equation of random field estimation
theory by the criterion of minimum of variance of the error estimate. This
integral equation is of the first kind. The corresponding integra$ operator
over a bounded domain $\Omega $ in ${\Bbb R}^{n}$ is weakly singular. This
operator is an isomorphism between appropriate Sobolev spaces. This is proved
by a reduction of the integral equ$ an elliptic boundary value problem in the
domain exterior to $\Omega .$ Extra difficulties arise due to the fact that the
exterior boundary value problem should be solved in the Sobolev spaces of
negative order.
