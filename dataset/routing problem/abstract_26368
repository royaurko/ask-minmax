This book has four chapters. In the first chapter interval bistructures
(biinterval structures) such as interval bisemigroup, interval bigroupoid,
interval bigroup and interval biloops are introduced. Throughout this book we
work only with the intervals of the form [0, a] where a \in Zn or Z+ \cup {0}
or R+ \cup {0} or Q+ \cup {0} unless otherwise specified. Also interval
bistructures of the form interval loop-group, interval groupgroupoid so on are
introduced and studied. In chapter two n-interval structures are introduced.
n-interval groupoids, n-interval semigroups, n-interval loops and so on are
introduced and analysed. Using these notions n-interval mixed algebraic
structure are defined and described. Some probable applications are discussed.
Only in due course of time several applications would be evolved by researchers
as per their need. The final chapter suggests around 295 problems of which some
are simple exercises, some are difficult and some of them are research
problems.
