During the last few years, interest has arisen in using light-front
Tamm-Dancoff field theory to describe relativistic bound states for theories
such as QCD. Unfortunately, difficult renormalization problems stand in the
way. We introduce a general, non-perturbative approach to renormalization that
is well suited for the ultraviolet and, presumably, the infrared divergences
found in these systems. We reexpress the renormalization problem in terms of a
set of coupled inhomogeneous integral equations, the ``counterterm equation.''
The solution of this equation provides a kernel for the Tamm-Dancoff integral
equations which generates states that are independent of any cutoffs. We also
introduce a Rayleigh-Ritz approach to numerical solution of the counterterm
equation. Using our approach to renormalization, we examine several ultraviolet
divergent models. Finally, we use the Rayleigh-Ritz approach to find the
counterterms in terms of allowed operators of a theory.
