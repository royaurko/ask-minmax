For a graph $G$, let $Z(G,\lambda)$ be the partition function of the
monomer-dimer system defined by $\sum_k m_k(G)\lambda^k$, where $m_k(G)$ is the
number of matchings of size $k$ in $G$. We consider graphs of bounded degree
and develop a sublinear-time algorithm for estimating $\log Z(G,\lambda)$ at an
arbitrary value $\lambda>0$ within additive error $\epsilon n$ with high
probability. The query complexity of our algorithm does not depend on the size
of $G$ and is polynomial in $1/\epsilon$, and we also provide a lower bound
quadratic in $1/\epsilon$ for this problem. This is the first analysis of a
sublinear-time approximation algorithm for a $# P$-complete problem. Our
approach is based on the correlation decay of the Gibbs distribution associated
with $Z(G,\lambda)$. We show that our algorithm approximates the probability
for a vertex to be covered by a matching, sampled according to this Gibbs
distribution, in a near-optimal sublinear time. We extend our results to
approximate the average size and the entropy of such a matching within an
additive error with high probability, where again the query complexity is
polynomial in $1/\epsilon$ and the lower bound is quadratic in $1/\epsilon$.
Our algorithms are simple to implement and of practical use when dealing with
massive datasets. Our results extend to other systems where the correlation
decay is known to hold as for the independent set problem up to the critical
activity.
