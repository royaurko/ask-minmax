Subspace identification is a classical and very well studied problem in
system identification. The problem was recently posed as a convex optimization
problem via the nuclear norm relaxation. Inspired by robust PCA, we extend this
framework to handle outliers. The proposed framework takes the form of a convex
optimization problem with an objective that trades off fit, rank and sparsity.
As in robust PCA, it can be problematic to find a suitable regularization
parameter. We show how the space in which a suitable parameter should be sought
can be limited to a bounded open set of the two dimensional parameter space. In
practice, this is very useful since it restricts the parameter space that is
needed to be surveyed.
