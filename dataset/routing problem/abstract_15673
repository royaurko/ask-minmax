The importance of Yukawa contributions to the renormalization of the spectrum
in non-minimal supersymmetric models is illustrated in the cases of explicit
lepton number violation (leading to the possibility of singly produced
sneutrinos at LEP energies), an intermediate scale singlet neutrino and
negative mass squared parameters (possibly modifying fine-tuning
considerations), and a grand-unified sector. The relevance of model-dependent
renormalization to the supersymmetric flavor problem is emphasized. Sources of
the flavor problem, some of which are newly identified, as well as possible
solutions, are discussed and classified. It is then shown that gravitational
interactions could lead (via a quadratically divergent singlet) to simple
realizations of some of the low-energy frameworks that attempt to resolve the
flavor problem.
