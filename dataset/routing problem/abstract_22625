Extension of particle symmetry implies new conserved charges and the lightest
particles, possessing such charges, should be stable. Created in early
Universe, stable charged heavy leptons and quarks can exist and, hidden in
elusive atoms bound by Coulomb attraction, can play the role of dark matter.
The problem of this scenario is that in the expanding Universe it is not
possible to recombine all the charged particles into elusive "atoms", and
positively charged particles, which escape such recombination, bind with
electrons in atoms of anomalous isotopes with pregalactic abundance, generally
exceeding terrestrial upper limits. Realistic scenarios of composite dark
matter, avoiding this problem of anomalous isotope over-production, inevitably
predict the existence of primordial "atoms", in which primordial helium traps
all the free negatively charged heavy constituents with charge -2. Study of the
possibility for such primordial heavy alpha-particle with compensated charge to
exist as well as the search for the stable charged constituents in cosmic rays
and accelerators provide crucial test for the new forms of stable matter.
