Vickers and Wilson (see Ref. 25) have shown global hyperbolicity of the
conical spacetime in the sense of well-posedness of the initial value problem
for the wave equation in generalized functions. We add the aspect of metric
splitting and preliminary thoughts on Cauchy hypersurfaces and causal curves.
