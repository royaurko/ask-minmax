For an accurate description of the polarized deep inelastic scattering at low
$x$ including the logarithmic corrections, $\ln^2(1/x)$, is required. These
corrections resummed strongly influence the behaviour of the spin structure
functions and their moments. Results of the work of J. Kwiecinski and myself on
this problem are reviewed.}
