This paper is concerned with the study of a model case of first order
Hamilton-Jacobi equations posed on a "junction", that is to say the union of a
finite number of half-lines with a unique common point. The main result is a
comparison principle. We also prove existence and stability of solutions. The
two challenging difficulties are the singular geometry of the domain and the
discontinuity of the Hamiltonian. As far as discontinuous Hamiltonians are
concerned, these results seem to be new. They are applied to the study of some
models arising in traffic flows. The techniques developed in the present
article provide new powerful tools for the analysis of such problems.
