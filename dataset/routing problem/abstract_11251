We perform the careful study of the Gribov copies problem in SU(2) lattice
gauge theory for maximal direct and maximal indirect center projections. We
find that this problem is much more severe than it was thought before. The
projected string tension is not in agreement with the physical string tension.
We also show that the particle--like objects, nexuses, might be important for
the confinement dynamics.
