The inverse problem of finding the coefficient $\g$ in the equation
$\dot{u}=A(t)u+\g(t)u+f(t)$ from the extra data of the form $\phi(t)=u(t),w$ is
studied. The problem is reduced to a Volterra equation of the second kind.
Applications are given to parabolic equations with second order differential
operators.
