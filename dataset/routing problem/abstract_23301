We address the problem of the large initial field values in chaotic inflation
and propose a remedy in the framework of the so-called assisted inflation. We
demonstrate that a 4-dimensional theory of multiple, scalar fields with initial
field values considerably below the Planck scale, can give rise to inflation
even though none of the individual scalar fields are capable of driving
inflation. The problems arising from the presence of possible
non-renormalizable interactions is therefore removed. As a concrete example of
a theory with multiple scalar fields, we consider a (4+d)-dimensional field
theory of a single, non-interacting massive scalar field whose KK modes play
the role of the assisted sector. For the KK modes to assist inflation, the
extra dimensions must have a size larger than the inverse (4D) Planck scale.
