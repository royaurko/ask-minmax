We consider solutions of some nonlinear parabolic boundary value problems in
radial bounded domains whose initial profile satisfy a reflection inequality
with respect to a hyperplane containing the origin. We show that, under rather
general assumptions, these solutions are asymptotically (in time) foliated
Schwarz symmetric, i.e., all elements in the associated omega limit set are
axially symmetric with respect to a common axis passing through the origin and
nonincreasing in the polar angle from this axis. In this form, the result is
new even for equilibria (i.e. solutions of the corresponding elliptic problem)
and time periodic solutions.
