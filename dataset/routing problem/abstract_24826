This paper proposes a new signature scheme based on two hard problems : the
cube root extraction modulo a composite moduli (which is equivalent to the
factorisation of the moduli, IFP) and the discrete logarithm problem(DLP). By
combining these two cryptographic assumptions, we introduce an efficient and
strongly secure signature scheme. We show that if an adversary can break the
new scheme with an algorithm $\mathcal{A},$ then $\mathcal{A}$ can be used to
sove both the DLP and the IFP. The key generation is a simple operation based
on the discrete logarithm modulo a composite moduli. The signature phase is
based both on the cube root computation and the DLP. These operations are
computationally efficient.
