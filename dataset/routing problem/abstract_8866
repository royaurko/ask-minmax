In this work we establish existence and multiplicity of solutions for
elliptic problem with nonlinear boundary conditions under strong resonance
conditions at infinity. The nonlinearity is resonance at infinity and the reso-
nance phenomena occurs precisely in the first Steklov eigenvalue problem. In
all results we use Variational Methods, Critical Groups and the Morse Theory.
