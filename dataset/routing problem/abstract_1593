We have investigated epitaxial graphene films grown on SiC(0001) by annealing
in an atmosphere of Ar instead of vacuum. Using AFM and LEEM we observe a
significantly improved surface morphology and graphene domain size. Hall
measurements on monolayer graphene films show a carrier mobility of around 1000
cm^2/Vs at room temperature and 2000 cm^2/Vs at 27K. The growth process
introduced here establishes the synthesis of graphene films on a
technologically viable basis.
