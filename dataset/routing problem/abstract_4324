A structure called a decision making problem is considered. The set of
outcomes (consequences) is partially ordered according to the decision maker's
preferences. The problem is how these preferences affect a decision maker to
prefer one of his strategies (or acts) to another, i.e. it is to describe so
called derived preference relations. This problem is formalized by using
category theory approach and reduced to a pure algebraical question. An
effective method is suggested to build all reasonable derived preferences
relations and to compare them with each other.
