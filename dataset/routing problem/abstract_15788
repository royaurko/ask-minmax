The Deligne-Simpson problem in the multiplicative version is formulated like
this: {\em give necessary and sufficient conditions for the choice of the
conjugacy classes $C_j\in SL(n,{\bf C})$ so that there exist irreducible
$(p+1)$-tuples of matrices $M_j\in C_j$ satisfying the equality $M_1...
M_{p+1}=I$}. We solve the problem for generic eigenvalues in the case when all
the numbers $\Sigma_{j,m}(\sigma)$ of Jordan blocks of a given matrix $M_j$,
with a given eigenvalue $\sigma$ and of a given size $m$ (taken over all $j$,
$\sigma$, $m$) are divisible by $d>1$. Generic eigenvalues are defined by
explicit algebraic inequalities of the form $a\neq 0$. For such eigenvalues
there exist no reducible $(p+1)$-tuples. The matrices $M_j$ are interpreted as
monodromy operators of regular linear systems on Riemann's sphere.
