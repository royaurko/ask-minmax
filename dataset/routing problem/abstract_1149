We investigate the spin transport through strongly anisotropic noncollinear
magnetic molecules and find that the noncollinear magnetization acts as a
spin-switching device for the current. Moreover, spin currents are shown to
offer a viable route to selectively prepare the molecular device in one of two
degenerate noncollinear magnetic states. Spin-currents can be also used to
create a non-zero density of toroidal magnetization in a recently characterized
Dy_3 noncollinear magnet.
