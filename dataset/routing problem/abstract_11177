The higher dimensional spherical symmetric scalar field collapse problem is
studied in the light of the critical behavior in black hole formation. To make
the analysis tractable, the self similarity is also imposed. By giving a new
view to the self-similar scalar field collapse problem, we give the general
formula for the critical exponents in higher dimensions. In the process, the
explanation of the universality of the critical phenomena is given within the
self-similar context.
