This paper is concerned with the direct and inverse acoustic or
electromagnetic scattering problems by a locally perturbed, perfectly
reflecting, infinite plane (which is called a locally rough surface in this
paper). We propose a novel integral equation formulation for the direct
scattering problem which is defined on a bounded curve (consisting of a bounded
part of the infinite plane containing the local perturbation and the lower part
of a circle) with two corners. This novel integral equation can be solved
efficiently by using the Nystrom method with a graded mesh introduced
previously by Kress and is capable of dealing with large wavenumber cases. For
the inverse problem, we propose a Newton iteration method to reconstruct the
local perturbation of the plane from multiple frequency far-field data, based
on the novel integral equation formulation. Numerical examples are carried out
to demonstrate that our reconstruction method is stable and accurate even for
the case of multiple-scale profiles.
