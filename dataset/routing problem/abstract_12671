We consider the mass-subcritical Hartree equation with a homogeneous kernel,
in the space of square integrable functions whose Fourier transform is
integrable. We prove a global well-posedness result in this space. On the other
hand, we show that the Cauchy problem is not even locally well-posed if we
simply work in the space of functions whose Fourier transform is integrable.
Similar results are proven when the kernel is not homogeneous, and is such that
its Fourier transform belongs to some Lebesgue space.
