This article is concerned with the incompressible, irrotational infinite
depth water wave equation in two space dimensions, without gravity but with
surface tension. We consider this problem expressed in position-velocity
potential holomorphic coordinates,and prove that small data solutions have at
least cubic lifespan while small localized data leads to global solutions.
