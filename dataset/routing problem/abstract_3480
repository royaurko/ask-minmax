It is found that the problem of existence of bound entangled states with
non-positive partial transpose (NPPT) has the intriguing relation to the
Hilbert's 17th problem. More precisely, we compute the expectation value of the
partially transposed Werner states by Schmidt rank-2 vectors for NPPT and
1-copy undistillable region. It is the positive polynomial but shown not to be
expressed as the sum of squares of polynomials. A remedy for such pathological
behavior as well as a similar but different approach to the problem is also
mentioned.
