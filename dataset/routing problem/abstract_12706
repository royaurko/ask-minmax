We describe an extention of the Standard Model (the $\nu$MSM) by three light
singlet Majorana fermions -- sterile neutrinos, which allows to address
simultaneously the problem of neutrino oscillations and the problems of dark
matter and baryon asymmetry of the Universe. We discuss the ways these new
particles can be searched for in astrophysical, laboratory, and accelerator
experiments.
