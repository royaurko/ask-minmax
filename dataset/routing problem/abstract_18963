We study the fundamental network capacity of a multi-user wireless downlink
under two assumptions: (1) Channels are not explicitly measured and thus
instantaneous states are unknown, (2) Channels are modeled as ON/OFF Markov
chains. This is an important network model to explore because channel probing
may be costly or infeasible in some contexts. In this case, we can use channel
memory with ACK/NACK feedback from previous transmissions to improve network
throughput. Computing in closed form the capacity region of this network is
difficult because it involves solving a high dimension partially observed
Markov decision problem. Instead, in this paper we construct an inner and outer
bound on the capacity region, showing that the bound is tight when the number
of users is large and the traffic is symmetric. For the case of heterogeneous
traffic and any number of users, we propose a simple queue-dependent policy
that can stabilize the network with any data rates strictly within the inner
capacity bound. The stability analysis uses a novel frame-based Lyapunov drift
argument. The outer-bound analysis uses stochastic coupling and state
aggregation to bound the performance of a restless bandit problem using a
related multi-armed bandit system. Our results are useful in cognitive radio
networks, opportunistic scheduling with delayed/uncertain channel state
information, and restless bandit problems.
