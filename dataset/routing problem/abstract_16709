We study the problem of finding a small sparse cut in an undirected graph.
Given an undirected graph G=(V,E) and a parameter k <= |E|, the small sparsest
cut problem is to find a subset of vertices S with minimum conductance among
all sets with volume at most k. Using ideas developed in local graph
partitioning algorithms, we obtain the following bicriteria approximation
algorithms for the small sparsest cut problem:
  - If there is a subset U with conductance \phi and vol(U) <= k, then there is
a polynomial time algorithm to find a set S with conductance
O(\sqrt{\phi/\epsilon}) and vol(S) <= k^{1+\epsilon} for any \epsilon > 1/k.
  - If there is a subset U with conductance \phi and vol(U) <= k, then there is
a polynomial time algorithm to find a set S with conductance O(\sqrt{\phi
ln(k)/\epsilon}) and vol(S) <= (1+\epsilon)k for any \epsilon > 2ln(k)/k.
  These algorithms can be implemented locally using truncated random walk, with
running time almost linear to the output size. This provides a local graph
partitioning algorithm with a better conductance guarantee when k is sublinear.
