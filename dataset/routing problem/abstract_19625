We show that when the magnetizations on opposite sides of a junction are not
collinear, the magnetization current is not conserved as the junction is
crossed. Thus the usual treatment of this problem needs to be modified. We
argue that this is due to an implicit assumption of an external torque that is
required to clamp the magnetization in place. The physical consequence of this
is explored.
