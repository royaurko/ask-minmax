We calculate explicitly solutions to the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value
problems in the upper half plane, for a family of divergence form equations
with non symmetric coefficients with a jump discontinuity. It is shown that the
boundary equation method and the Lax--Milgram method for constructing solutions
may give two different solutions when the coefficients are sufficiently non
symmetric.
