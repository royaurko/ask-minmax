A field deterministic model of the vehicular dynamics in a generic urban
street canyon with two neighboring canyons is considered. The assumed
hydrodynamical model of vehicular movement is coupled to the gasdynamical model
of the air and emitted pollutants. The vehicles are assumed to move on distinct
left lanes and right ones. At the upstream and downstream ends there are
coordinated traffic lights which introduce control parameters to the field
model. The model of optimal control of street canyon dynamics is based on the
two optimal multi-criteria control problems. The problems consist of
minimization of the dimensionless functionals of the cumulative total travel
time, global emissions of pollutants, and global concentrations of pollutants,
both in the studied street canyon, as well as together with the two nearest
neighbor substitute canyons, respectively.
