The common method to estimate an unknown integer parameter vector in a linear
model is to solve an integer least squares (ILS) problem. A typical approach to
solving an ILS problem is sphere decoding. To make a sphere decoder faster, the
well-known LLL reduction is often used as preprocessing. The Babai point
produced by the Babai nearest plan algorithm is a suboptimal solution of the
ILS problem. First we prove that the success probability of the Babai point as
a lower bound on the success probability of the ILS estimator is sharper than
the lower bound given by Hassibi and Boyd [1]. Then we show rigorously that
applying the LLL reduction algorithm will increase the success probability of
the Babai point. Finally we show rigorously that applying the LLL reduction
algorithm will also reduce the computational complexity of sphere decoders,
which is measured approximately by the number of nodes in the search tree in
the literature
