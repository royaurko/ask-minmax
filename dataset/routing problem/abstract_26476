We present a stochastic description of multiple scattering of polarized waves
in the regime of forward scattering. In this regime, if the source is
polarized, polarization survives along a few transport mean free paths, making
it possible to measure an outgoing polarization distribution. We solve the
direct problem using compound Poisson processes on the rotation group SO(3) and
non-commutative harmonic analysis. The obtained solution generalizes previous
works in multiple scattering theory and is used to design an algorithm solving
the inverse problem of estimating the scattering properties of the medium from
the observations. This technique applies to thin disordered layers, spatially
fluctuating media and multiple scattering systems and is based on the
polarization but not on the signal amplitude. We suggest that it can be used as
a non invasive testing method.
