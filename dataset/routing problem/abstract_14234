We introduce Bayesian multi-tensor factorization, a model that is the first
Bayesian formulation for joint factorization of multiple matrices and tensors.
The research problem generalizes the joint matrix-tensor factorization problem
to arbitrary sets of tensors of any depth, including matrices, can be
interpreted as unsupervised multi-view learning from multiple tensors, and can
be generalized to relax the usual trilinear tensor factorization assumptions.
The result is a factorization of the set of tensors into factors shared by any
subsets of the tensors, and factors private to individual tensors. We
demonstrate the performance against existing baselines in multiple tensor
factorization tasks in structural toxicogenomics and functional neuroimaging.
