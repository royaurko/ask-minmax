A new route to coherent destruction of tunneling is established by
considering a monochromatic fast modulation of the self-interaction strength of
a many-boson system. The modulation can be tuned such that only an arbitrarily,
a priori prescribed number of particles are allowed to tunnel. The associated
tunneling dynamics is sensitive to the odd or even nature of the number of
bosons.
