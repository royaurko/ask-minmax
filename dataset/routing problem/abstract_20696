In this paper, we establish the well-posedness of the generalized moment
problems recently studied by Byrnes-Georgiou-Lindquist and coworkers, and by
Ferrante-Pavon-Ramponi. We then apply these continuity results to prove almost
sure convergence of a sequence of high-resolution spectral estimators indexed
by the sample size.
