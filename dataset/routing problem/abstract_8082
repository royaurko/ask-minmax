In this paper we describe the asymptotic behavior, in the exponential time
scale, of solutions to quasi-linear parabolic equations with a small parameter
at the second order term and the long time behavior of corresponding diffusion
processes. In particular, we discuss the exit problem and metastability for the
processes corresponding to quasi-linear initial-boundary value problems.
