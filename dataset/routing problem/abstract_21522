It is shown that the bona fide generalization of the Vitali-Hahn-Saks Theorem
to von Neumann algebras is possible if, and only if, the algebra is finite.
This settles the problem on the noncommutative Vitali-Hahn-Saks Theorem
completely and provides new means of characterizing finite von Neumann
algebras.
