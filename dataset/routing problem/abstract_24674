We consider 5 dimensional gauge theories where the 5th direction is
compactified on an interval. The Chern-Simons (CS) terms (favored by naive
dimensional analysis) are discussed. A simple scenario with an extra U(1)_X
gauge field that couples to SU(3)_{color} through a CS term in the bulk is
constructed. The extra component of the Abelian gauge field plays a role of the
axion, which in the standard manner solves the strong CP problem easily
avoiding most of experimental constraints.
  This version has an expanded discussion of the phenomenology of the model and
various clarifications in the estimation of the operator coefficients in the
appendix.
