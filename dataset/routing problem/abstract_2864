The abstract first order Cauchy problem is solved in terms of Taylor's series
leading to a series of operators which is a propagator. It is found that higher
order Cauchy problems can be solved in the same way. Since derivatives of order
lower than the Cauchy problem are built-in to the problem, it suffices to solve
the higher order derivatives in terms of the lower order ones, in a simple way.
