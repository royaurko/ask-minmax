The early promises of DNA computing to deliver a massively parallel
architecture well-suited to computationally hard problems have so far been
largely unkept. Indeed, it is probably fair to say that only toy problems have
been addressed experimentally. Recent experimental development on algorithmic
self-assembly using DNA tiles seem to offer the most promising path toward a
potentially useful application of the DNA computing concept. In this paper, we
explore new geometries for algorithmic self-assembly, departing from those
previously described in the literature. This enables us to carry out
mathematical operations like binary multiplication or cyclic convolution
product. We then show how to use the latter operation to implement an attack
against the well-known public-key crypto system NTRU.
