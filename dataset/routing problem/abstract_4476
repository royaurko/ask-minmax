In this paper we study extensively the discrete logarithm problem in the
group of non-singular circulant matrices. The emphasis of this study was to
find the exact parameters for the group of circulant matrices for a secure
implementation. We tabulate these parameters. We also compare the discrete
logarithm problem in the group of circulant matrices with the discrete
logarithm problem in finite fields and with the discrete logarithm problem in
the group of rational points of an elliptic curve.
