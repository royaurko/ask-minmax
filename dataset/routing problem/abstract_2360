Graphene revealed a number of unique properties beneficial for electronics,
including exceptionally high electron mobility and widely tunable Fermi level.
However, graphene does not have an electron energy band gap, which presents a
serious hurdle for its applications in digital electronics. A possible route
for practical use of graphene in electronics is utilization of its
exceptionally high thermal conductivity and electron current conducting
properties. This invited review outlines the thermal properties of graphene and
describes prospective graphene technologies that are not affected by the
absence of the energy band gap. Specific examples include heat spreaders,
thermal coatings, high-current density electrodes and interconnects. Our
results suggest that thermal management of advanced electronic devices can
become the first industry-scale application of graphene.
