In this paper we consider the following two-phase obstacle-problem-like
equation in the unit half-ball $\Delta u =
\lambda_{+}\chi_{\{u>0\}}-\lambda_{-}\chi_{\{u<0\}}, \lambda_\pm>0$. We prove
that the free boundary touches the fixed one in (uniformly) tangential fashion
if the boundary data $f$ and its first and second derivatives vanish at the
touch-point.
