Unit disk graphs are intersection graphs of circles of unit radius in the
plane. We present simple and provably good heuristics for a number of
classical NP-hard optimization problems on unit disk graphs. The problems
considered include maximum independent set, minimum vertex cover, minimum
coloring and minimum dominating set. We also present an on-line coloring
heuristic which achieves a competitive ratio of 6 for unit disk graphs. Our
heuristics do not need a geometric representation of unit disk graphs.
Geometric representations are used only in establishing the performance
guarantees of the heuristics. Several of our approximation algorithms can be
extended to intersection graphs of circles of arbitrary radii in the plane,
intersection graphs of regular polygons, and to intersection graphs of higher
dimensional regular objects.
