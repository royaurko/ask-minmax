The problem of existence of spacelike hypersurfaces with constant mean
curvature in asymptotically flat spacetimes is considered for a class of
asymptotically Schwarzschild spacetimes satisfying an interior condition. Using
a barrier construction, a proof is given of the existence of complete
hypersurfaces with constant mean cuvature which intersect null infinity in a
regular cut.
