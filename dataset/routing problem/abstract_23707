This paper studies the formation of logical operations from pre-logical
processes. We are concerned with the reasons for certain mental processes
taking form of logical reasoning and the underlying drives for consolidation of
logical operations in human mind. Starting from Piaget's approach to Logic
(Piaget, 1956) we discuss whether the evolutionary adaptation can be such a
driving force and whether the limits of human mind can result in the standard
system of logical operations. The paper demonstrates that the classical
two-valued propositional logic can begin from a method of successive
approximations applied to a decision-making problem within a framework of
Subject-in-an-environment survival. The presented results shed a new light on
the known model of human choice by Lefebvre (Lefebvre, 1991, 1995).
