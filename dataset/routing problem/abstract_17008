In Newtonian gravity, a stationary axisymmetric system admits a third,
Carter-like constant of motion if its mass multipole moments are related to
each other in exactly the same manner as for the Kerr black-hole spacetime. The
Newtonian source with this property consists of two point masses at rest a
fixed distance apart. The integrability of motion about this source was first
studied in the 1760s by Euler. We show that the general relativistic analogue
of the Euler problem, the Bach-Weyl solution, does not admit a Carter-like
constant of motion, first, by showing that it does not possess a non-trivial
Killing tensor, and secondly, by showing that the existence of a Carter-like
constant for the two-center problem fails at the first post-Newtonian order.
