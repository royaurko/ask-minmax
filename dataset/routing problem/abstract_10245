Under the paradigm of caching, partial data is delivered before the actual
requests of the users are known. In this paper, this problem is modeled as a
canonical distributed source coding problem with side information, where the
side information represents the users' requests. For the single-user case, a
single-letter characterization of the optimal rate region is established, and
for several important special cases, closed-form solutions are given, including
the scenario of uniformly distributed user requests. In this case, it is shown
that the optimal caching strategy is closely related to total correlation and
Wyner's common information. For the two-user case, five representative
subproblems are considered, which draw connections to existing source coding
problems in the literature: the Gray--Wyner system, distributed successive
refinement, and the Kaspi/Heegard--Berger problem.
