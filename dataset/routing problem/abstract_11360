It is shown that the coherent field oscillation of moduli fields with weak or
TeV scale masses can dissipate its energy efficiently if they have a derivative
coupling to standard bosonic fields in a thermal state. This mechanism may
provide a new solution to the cosmological moduli problem in some special
situations.
