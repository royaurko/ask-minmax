The dynamical properties of hole motion in an antiferromagnetic background
are determined in one dimensional models in zero magnetic field, where spin
isotropy holds, as well as in an external magnetic field. The latter case is
also relevant, via particle-hole transformation, to the problem of hole
propagation in one dimensional "superconductors". The singularities in the
spectral function are investigated by means of bosonization techniques and
perturbation theories. Results are then compared with Bethe ansatz solutions
and Lanczos diagonalizations. The formalism also leads to interesting
connections to the single impurity problem in Luttinger liquids. A rich
structure is found in the spectral function whenever spin isotropy is broken,
suggesting the presence of exotic momentum dependence in photoemission spectra
of (quasi) one dimensional materials.
