In the path integral approach to false vacuum decay with the effect of
gravity, there is an unsolved problem, called the negative mode problem. We
show that the appearance of a supercritical supercurvature mode in the
one-bubble open inflation scenario is equivalent to the existence of a negative
mode around the Euclidean bounce solution. Supercritical supercurvature modes
are those whose mode functions diverge exponentially for large spatial radius
on the time constant hypersurface of the open universe. Then we propose a
conjecture that there should be ``no supercritical supercurvature mode''. For a
class of models that contains a wide variety of tunneling potentials, this
conjecture is shown to be correct.
