This work investigates the parameterized complexity of three related graph
modification problems. Given a directed graph, a distinguished vertex, and a
positive integer k, Minimum Indegree Deletion asks for a vertex subset of size
at most k whose removal makes the distinguished vertex the only vertex with
minimum indegree. Minimum Degree Deletion is analogously defined, but deals
with undirected graphs. Bounded Degree Deletion is also defined on undirected
graphs, but has a positive integer d instead of a distinguished vertex as part
of the input. It asks for a vertex subset of size at most k whose removal
results in a graph in which every vertex has degree at most d. The first two
problems have applications in computational social choice whereas the third
problem is used in computational biology. We investigate the parameterized
complexity with respect to the parameters "treewidth", "size of a feedback
vertex set" and "size of a feedback edge set" respectively "size of a feedback
arc set". Each of these parameters measures the "degree of acyclicity" in
different ways.
