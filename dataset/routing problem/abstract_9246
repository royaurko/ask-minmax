We study the program complexity of datalog on both finite and infinite linear
orders. Our main result states that on all linear orders with at least two
elements, the nonemptiness problem for datalog is EXPTIME-complete. While
containment of the nonemptiness problem in EXPTIME is known for finite linear
orders and actually for arbitrary finite structures, it is not obvious for
infinite linear orders. It sharply contrasts the situation on other infinite
structures; for example, the datalog nonemptiness problem on an infinite
successor structure is undecidable. We extend our upper bound results to
infinite linear orders with constants.
  As an application, we show that the datalog nonemptiness problem on Allen's
interval algebra is EXPTIME-complete.
