This paper addresses the problem of summarizing the posterior distributions
that typically arise, in a Bayesian framework, when dealing with signal
decomposition problems with unknown number of components. Such posterior
distributions are defined over union of subspaces of differing dimensionality
and can be sampled from using modern Monte Carlo techniques, for instance the
increasingly popular RJ-MCMC method. No generic approach is available, however,
to summarize the resulting variable-dimensional samples and extract from them
component-specific parameters.
  We propose a novel approach to this problem, which consists in approximating
the complex posterior of interest by a "simple"---but still
variable-dimensional---parametric distribution. The distance between the two
distributions is measured using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and a
Stochastic EM-type algorithm, driven by the RJ-MCMC sampler, is proposed to
estimate the parameters. The proposed algorithm is illustrated on the
fundamental signal processing example of joint detection and estimation of
sinusoids in white Gaussian noise.
