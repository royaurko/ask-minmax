Exact-sparsity inducing prior distributions in high-dimensional Bayesian
analysis typically lead to posterior distributions that are very challenging to
handle by standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. We propose a methodology
to derive a smooth approximation of such posterior distributions. The
approximation is obtained from the forward-backward approximation of the
Moreau-Yosida regularization of the negative log-density. We show that the
derived approximation is within a factor $O(\sqrt{\gamma})$ of the true
posterior distribution, where $\gamma>0$ is a user-controlled parameter that
defines the approximation. We illustrate the method with a variable selection
problem in linear regression models, and with a Gaussian graphical model
selection problem.
