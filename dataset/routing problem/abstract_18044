Three classes of models of QHC, the joint logic of problems and propositions,
are constructed and analyzed, including a class of sheaf models that is closely
related to solutions of some actual mathematical problems (such as solutions of
algebraic equations) and combines the familiar Leibniz-Euler-Venn semantics of
classical logic with a BHK-type semantics of intuitionistic logic.
  We also describe a first-order theory T over QHC intended to capture the
spirit of the ancient Greek tradition of geometry, as presented in Euclid's
"Elements". The ancients observed, in what was presumably a consensus view
emerging from an earlier debate, a distinction between problems and postulates
vs. theorems and axioms (which can also be inferred from the grammar of
Euclid's text) and the logical interdependence between the two realms. T
formalizes this in terms of the connectives ! and ? of QHC. The purely
classical fragment of T is shown to coincide with Tarski's weak elementary
geometry, and the purely intuitionistic one with Beeson's "intuitionistic
Tarski geometry".
