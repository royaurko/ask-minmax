We provide a characterisation of $\mathcal{A}$-annihilated generators in the
homology ring $H_*(QX;\mathbb{Z}/2)$ and $H_*(Q(X_+);\mathbb{Z}/2)$ when $X$ is
some path connected space. We also introduce a method to construct such
classes. We comment on the application of this result to illustrate how to use
the infinite loop space structure on $\mathbb{Z}\times BO$, provided by the
Bott periodicity can be used to obtain some information on the (stable)
symmetric hit problem of Wood and Janfada. Our methods seem to allow much
straightforward calculations. The numerical conditions of our Theorem 3 look
very similar to the `spikes' considered by Wood \cite{Wood-Ioa} and
Janfada-Wood \cite{JanfadaWood} as well as Janfada \cite{Janfada-P(3)}.
