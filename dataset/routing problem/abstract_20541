We develop a new density functional theory (DFT) and formalism for correlated
electron systems by taking as reference an interacting electron system that has
a ground state wavefunction which obeys exactly the Gutzwiller approximation
for all one particle operators. The solution of the many electron problem is
mapped onto the self-consistent solution of a set of single particle
Schroedinger equations analogous to standard DFT-LDA calculations.
