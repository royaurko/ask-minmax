In this paper, the familiar problems of free-fall motion and simple harmonic
motion (SHM) are combined. The novel composite system passes from regular to
chaotic behavior for increasing values of energy $E$. This system is a suitable
example to introduce undergraduates to some of the concepts of dynamical chaos
theory.
