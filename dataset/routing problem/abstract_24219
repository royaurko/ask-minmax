The Fokker-Planck equation with diffusion coefficient quadratic in space
variable, linear drift coefficient, and nonlocal nonlinearity term is
considered in the framework of a model of analysis of asset returns at
financial markets. For special cases of such a Fokker-Planck equation we
describe a construction of exact solution of the Cauchy problem. In the general
case, we construct the leading term of the Cauchy problem solution asymptotic
in a formal small parameter in semiclassical approximation following the
complex WKB-Maslov method in the class of trajectory concentrated functions.
