In this paper, a novel reconfigurable architecture is proposed for
multifunctional image signal processing systems. A circuit-switched NoC is used
to provide interconnection because the non-TMD links ensure fixed throughput,
which is a desirable behavior for computational intensive image processing
algorithms compared with packet-switched NoC. Image processing algorithms are
modeled as synchronous dataflow graphs which provide a unified model for
general computing procedure. An image processing system is considered as
several temporally mutually exclusive algorithms. Thus, their dataflow graph
representations could be considered as a group and a merging algorithm could be
applied to generate a union graph while eliminating spatial redundancy for area
consumption optimization. After the union graph have been mapped and routed on
the NoC, the reconfigurable system could be configured to any of its target
image processing algorithms by properly setting the NoC topology. Experiments
show the demo reconfigurable system with two image processing applications cost
26.4% less hardware resource, compared with the non-reconfigurable
implementations.
