This paper is an introduction to mould calculus as introduced by Jean Ecalle.
We give a precise definition of moulds and describe there main properties. We
translate mould symmetries (alterna(e)l and symetra(e)l) using non commutative
formal power series in two given bialgebras. We apply this formalism to the
problem of normal forms for vector fields and diffeomrophisms.
