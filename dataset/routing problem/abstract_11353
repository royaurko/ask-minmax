Due to asymptotic freedom, QCD is guaranteed to be accessible to perturbative
methods at asymptotically high temperatures. However, in 1979 Linde has pointed
out the existence of an "infrared wall", beyond which an infinite number of
Feynman diagrams contribute. Following a proposal by Braaten and Nieto, it is
shown explicitly how the limits to computability that this infrared problem
poses can be overcome in the framework of dimensionally reduced effective
theories.
