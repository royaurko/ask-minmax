Wireless sensor nodes along with Base Station (BS) constitute a Wireless
Sensor Network (WSN). Nodes comprise of tiny power battery. Nodes sense the
data and send it to BS. WSNs need protocol for efficient energy consumption of
the network. In direct transmission and minimum transmission energy routing
protocols, energy consumption is not well distributed. However, LEACH
(Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) is a clustering protocol; randomly
selects the Cluster Heads (CHs) in each round. However, random selection of CHs
does not guarantee efficient energy consumption of the network. Therefore, we
proposed new clustering techniques in routing protocols, Location-aware
Permanent CH (LPCH) and User Defined Location-aware Permanent CH (UDLPCH). In
both protocols, network field is physically divided in to two regions, equal
number of nodes are randomly deployed in each region. In LPCH, number of CHs
are selected by LEACH algorithm in first round. However in UDLPCH, equal and
optimum number of CHs are selected in each region, throughout the network life
time number of CHs are remain same. Simulation results show that stability
period and throughput of LPCH is greater than LEACH, stability period and
throughput of UDLPCH is greater than LPCH.
