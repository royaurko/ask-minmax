The parabolic Anderson problem with a random potential obtained by attaching
a long tailed potential around a randomly perturbed lattice is studied. The
moment asymptotics of the total mass of the solution is derived.The results
show that the total mass of the solution concentrates on a small set in the
space of configuration.
