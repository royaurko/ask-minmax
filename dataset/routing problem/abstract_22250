In this paper, we establish the second order estimates of solutions to the
first initial-boundary value problem for general Hessian type fully nonlinear
parabolic equations on Riemannian manifolds. The techniques used in this
article can work for a wide range of fully nonlinear PDEs under very general
conditions.
