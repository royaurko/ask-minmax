In this short note, the dual problem for the traveling salesman problem is
constructed through the classic Lagrangian. The existence of optimality
conditions is expressed as a corresponding inverse problem. A general 4-cities
instance is given, and the numerical experiment shows that the classic
Lagrangian may not be applicable to the traveling salesman problem.
