We found the analytical solution to the problem of the skin effect for
Maxwell plasma with the use of the kinetic equation, where the frequency of
electron collisions is constant. We use the specular reflection of electrons
from the surface as a boundary condition. The behavior of an impedance near to
a plasma resonance is considered. We consider limiting cases of skin effect.
