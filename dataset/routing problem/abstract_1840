Here we present the magnetic properties and upper critical field (BC2) of
polycrystalline Y(Ba1-xSrx)2Cu3O7-{\delta} superconductors, which are being
determined through detailed ac/dc susceptibility and resistivity under magnetic
field (RTH) study. All the samples are synthesized through solid state reaction
route. Reduction in Meissner fraction (the ratio of field cooled to zero field
cooled magnetization) is observed with increasing Sr content, suggesting
occurrence of flux pining in the doped samples. The ac susceptibility and
resistivity measurements reveal improved grain couplings in Sr substituted
samples. Consequently the inter-grain critical current density (Jc), upturn
curvature near the Tc in temperature dependence of upper critical field
[BC2(T)], and BC2 are enhanced. Both Jc and BC2 increase in lower Sr
substitution (up to x = 0.10) samples followed by decrease in higher doping due
to degradation in effective pining and grain coupling.
