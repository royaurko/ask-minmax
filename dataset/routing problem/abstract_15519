We present benchmark problems and solutions for the continuum radiative
transfer (RT) in a 2D disk configuration. The reliability of three Monte-Carlo
and two grid-based codes is tested by comparing their results for a set of
well-defined cases which differ for optical depth and viewing angle. For all
the configurations, the overall shape of the resulting temperature and spectral
energy distribution is well reproduced. The solutions we provide can be used
for the verification of other RT codes.We also point out the advantages and
disadvantages of the various numerical techniques applied to solve the RT
problem.
