The purpose of this article is to survey the developments on the Kakeya
problem in recent years, concentrating on the period after the excellent 1999
survey of Wolff, and including some recent work by the contributors. We will focus
on the standard Kakeya problem for line segments and not discuss other
important variants (such as Kakeya estimates for circles, light rays, or
$k$-planes).
