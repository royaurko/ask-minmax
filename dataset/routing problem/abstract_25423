In SuperCool Inflation (SCI), a technically natural and thermal effect gives
a graceful exit to old inflation. The Universe starts off hot and trapped in a
false vacuum. The Universe supercools and inflates solving the horizon and
flatness problems. The inflaton couples to a set of QCD like fermions. When the
fermions' non-Abelian gauge group freezes, the Yukawa terms generate a tadpole
for the inflaton, which removes the barrier. Inflation ends, and the Universe
rapidly reheats. The thermal effect is technically natural in the same way that
the QCD scale is technically natural. In fact, Witten used a similar mechanism
to drive the Electro-Weak (EW) phase transition; critically, no scalar field
drives inflation, which allows SCI to avoid eternal inflation and the measure
problem. SCI also works at scales, which can be probed in the lab, and could be
connected to EW symmetry breaking. Finally, we introduce a light spectator
field to generate density perturbations, which match the CMB. The light field
does not affect the inflationary dynamics and can potentially generate
non-Gaussianities and isocurvature perturbations observable with Planck.
