We study the problem of sparse recovery from compressed measurements. This
problem has generated a great deal of interest in recent years. To recover the
sparse signal, we propose a new method called multiple orthogonal least squares
(MOLS), which extends the well-known orthogonal least squares (OLS) algorithm
by choosing multiple $L$ indices per iteration. Due to the inclusion of
multiple support indices in each selection, the MOLS algorithm converges in
much fewer iterations and hence improves the computational efficiency over the
OLS algorithm. Theoretical analysis shows that MOLS performs the exact recovery
of any $K$-sparse signal within $K$ iterations if the measurement matrix
satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP) with isometry constant
$\delta_{LK} \leq \frac{\sqrt{L}}{\sqrt{K} + \sqrt{5 L}}.$ Empirical
experiments demonstrate that MOLS is very competitive in recovering sparse
signals compared to the state of the art recovery algorithms.
