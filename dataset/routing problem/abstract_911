Gossip and in particular network coded algebraic gossip have recently
attracted attention as a fast, bandwidth-efficient, reliable and distributed
way to broadcast or multicast multiple messages. While the algorithms are
simple, involved queuing approaches are used to study their performance. The
most recent result in this direction shows that uniform algebraic gossip
disseminates k messages in O({\Delta}(D + k + log n)) rounds where D is the
diameter, n the size of the network and {\Delta} the maximum degree.
  In this paper we give a simpler, short and self-contained proof for this
worst-case guarantee. Our approach also allows to reduce the quadratic
{\Delta}D term to min{3n, {\Delta}D}. We furthermore show that a simple round
robin routing scheme also achieves min{3n, {\Delta}D} + {\Delta}k rounds,
eliminating both randomization and coding. Lastly, we combine a recent
non-uniform gossip algorithm with a simple routing scheme to get a O(D + k +
log^{O(1)}) gossip information dissemination algorithm. This is order optimal
as long as D and k are not both polylogarithmically small.
