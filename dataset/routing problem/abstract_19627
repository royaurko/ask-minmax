We consider directed percolation processes for particle types A and B coupled
unidirectionally by a transmutation reaction A -> B. It is shown that the
strong coupling regime of this recently introduced problem defines a
universality class with upper critical dimension d=6. Exact expressions are
derived for the scaling dimensions in the inactive phase above d=4. Below d=4
the interactions of the normal directed percolation also get relevant.
