We consider the wrong-Higgs interactions such as type-III two Higgs doublet
models. Generally, such interactions cause flavor problems. However, if new
Yukawa interactions have the same flavor structure as that of the standard
model(SM), we do not have any flavor problems. In this work we propose a
microscopic model for the wrong-Higgs interactions aligned with SM ones in the
context of supersymmetry(SUSY) and show their phenomenological implications.
Low energy contraints from muon g-2 and rare B decays can be relieved and it
can be viable to have low mass superparticle spectra with light dark matter
which is preferred by recent experiments such as DAMA/LIBRA, CDMS-II and
CoGeNT. We also briefly discuss modification of Higgs decay in colliders.
