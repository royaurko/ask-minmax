The contributor (physicist)has observed the very strange,beautiful and frightening
Lightning Ball (LB). He has never forgotten this phenomenon. During his working
life he could not devote himself to the problem of LB-formation.Only two years
ago as he has been reading different unbelievable models of LB-formation, he
decided to work on this problem. By studying the literature and the crucial
points of his observation the contributor succeeded in creating a completely new
model of Lightning Ball(LB) and Ball Lightning(BL)-formation based on the
symmetry breaking of the hydrodynamic vortex ring.This agrees fully with the
observation and overcomes the shortcomings of current models of LB formation.
This model provides answers to the questions: Why are LBs so rarely
observed,why do BLs in rare cases have such a high energy and how can we
generate LB in the laboratory? Moreover the contributor differentiates between LB
and BL, the latter having a high energy and occuring in 5 % of the
observations. Keywords: ball lightning, hydrodynamic vortex ring, symmetry
breaking, electroluminescence, triboelectrification.
