We study the performance of stochastic local search algorithms for random
instances of the $K$-satisfiability ($K$-SAT) problem. We introduce a new
stochastic local search algorithm, ChainSAT, which moves in the energy
landscape of a problem instance by {\em never going upwards} in energy.
ChainSAT is a \emph{focused} algorithm in the sense that it considers only
variables occurring in unsatisfied clauses. We show by extensive numerical
investigations that ChainSAT and other focused algorithms solve large $K$-SAT
instances almost surely in linear time, up to high clause-to-variable ratios
$\alpha$; for example, for K=4 we observe linear-time performance well beyond
the recently postulated clustering and condensation transitions in the solution
space. The performance of ChainSAT is a surprise given that by design the
algorithm gets trapped into the first local energy minimum it encounters, yet
no such minima are encountered. We also study the geometry of the solution
space as accessed by stochastic local search algorithms.
