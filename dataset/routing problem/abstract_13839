Timed pushdown automata are pushdown automata extended with a finite set of
real-valued clocks. Additionaly, each symbol in the stack is equipped with a
value representing its age. The enabledness of a transition may depend on the
values of the clocks and the age of the topmost symbol. Therefore, dense-timed
pushdown automata subsume both pushdown automata and timed automata. We have
previously shown that the reachability problem for this model is decidable. In
this paper, we study the zenoness problem and show that it is EXPTIME-complete.
