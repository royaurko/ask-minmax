We calculate certain estimates for the solution of the characteristic problem
of the wave equation reduced to first order, in terms of the free data
prescribed on two transverse surfaces, one of which is characteristic.
Estimates of such kind ensure the stability of the solutions under small
variations of the data. Similar estimates exist for the derivatives of the
solution as well.
