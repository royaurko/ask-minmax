Optical trapping is a widely used technique, with many important applications
in biology and metrology. Complete modelling of trapping requires calculation
of optical forces, primarily a scattering problem, and non-optical forces. The
T-matrix method is used to calculate forces acting on spheroidal and
cylindrical particles.
