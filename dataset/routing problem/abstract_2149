The advancement of mobile and wireless communication technologies in recent
years introduced various adaptive protocols to adapt the need for secured
communications. Security is a crucial success factor for any communication
protocols, especially in mobile environment due to its ad hoc behavior. Formal
verification plays an important role in development and application of safety
critical systems. Formalized exhausted verification techniques to analyze the
security and the safety properties of communications protocols increase and
confirm the protocol confidence. SPIN is a powerful model checker that verifies
the correctness of distributed communication models in a rigorous and automated
fashion. This short paper proposes a SPIN based formal verification approach of
a security adaptive protocol suite. The protocol suite includes a neighbor
discovery mechanism and routing protocol. Both parts of the protocol suite are
modeled into SPIN and exhaustively checked various temporal properties which
ensure the applicability of the protocol suite in real-life applications.
