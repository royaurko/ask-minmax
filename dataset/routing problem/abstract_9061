The Rayleigh conjecture about convergence up to the boundary of the series
representing the scattered field in the exterior of an obstacle $D$ is widely
used by engineers in applications. However this conjecture is false for some
obstacles. AGR introduced the Modified Rayleigh Conjecture (MRC), which is an
exact mathematical result. In this paper we review the theoretical basis for
the MRC method for 2D and 3D obstacle scattering problems, for static problems,
and for scattering by periodic structures. We also present successful numerical
algorithms based on the MRC for various scattering problems. The MRC method is
easy to implement for both simple and complex geometries. It is shown to be a
viable alternative for other obstacle scattering methods. Various direct and
inverse scattering problems require finding global minima of functions of
several variables. The Stability Index Method (SIM) combines stochastic and
deterministic method to accomplish such a minimization.
