The article addresses the possibility of robust detection of geometrically
small, low emission sources on a significantly stronger background. This
problem is important for homeland security. A technique of detecting such
sources using Compton type cameras is developed, which is shown on numerical
examples to have high sensitivity and specificity and also allows to assign
confidence probabilities of the detection. 2D case is considered in detail.
