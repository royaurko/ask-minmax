A Path Relinking algorithm is proposed for the Bandwidth Coloring problem and
the Bandwidth MultiColoring problem. It combines a population based relinking
method and a tabu search based local search procedure. The proposed algorithm
is assessed on two sets of 66 benchmark instances commonly used in the
literature. Computational results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is
highly competitive in terms of both solution quality and efficiency compared to
the best performing algorithms in the literature. Specifically, it improves the
previous best known results for 15 out of 66 instances, while matching the
previous best known results for 47 cases. Some key elements of the proposed
algorithm are investigated.
