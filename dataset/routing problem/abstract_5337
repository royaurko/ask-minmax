Second order buckling theory involves a one-way coupled coupled problem where
the stress tensor from a plane stress problem appears in an eigenvalue problem
for the fourth order Kirchhoff plate. In this paper we present an a posteriori
error estimate for the critical buckling load and mode corresponding to the
smallest eigenvalue and associated eigenvector. A particular feature of the
analysis is that we take the effect of approximate computation of the stress
tensor and also provide an error indicator for the plane stress problem. The
Kirchhoff plate is discretized using a continuous/discontinuous finite element
method which uses standard continuous piecewise polynomial finite element
spaces which can also be used to solve the plane stress problem.
