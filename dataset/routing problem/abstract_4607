Solutions of boundary value problems for a diffusion equation of fractional
and variable order in differential and difference settings are studied. It is
shown that the method of energy inequalities is applicable to obtaining a
priori estimates for these problems exactly as in the classical case. The
credibility of the obtained results is verified by performing numerical
calculations for a test problem.
