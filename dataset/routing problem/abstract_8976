In the first paper of this two part communication, we solved in a unified
framework a variety of two terminal source coding problems with noncooperative
encoders, thereby consolidating works of Shannon, Slepian-Wolf, Wyner,
Ahlswede-K\"{o}rner, Wyner-Ziv, Berger {\em et al.} and Berger-Yeung. To
achieve such unification we made use of a fundamental principle that
dissociates bulk of the analysis from the distortion criterion at hand (if any)
and extends the typicality arguments of Shannon and Wyner-Ziv. In this second
paper, we generalize the fundamental principle for any number of sources and on
its basis exhaustively solve all multiterminal source coding problems with
noncooperative encoders and one decoder. The distortion criteria, when
applicable, are required to apply to single letters and be bounded. Our
analysis includes cases where side information is, respectively, partially
available, completely available and altogether unavailable at the decoder. As
seen in our first paper, the achievable regions permit infinite order
information-theoretic descriptions. We also show that the entropy-constrained
multiterminal estimation problem can be solved as a special case of our theory.
