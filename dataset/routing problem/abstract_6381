We discuss an elementary problem in electrostatics: What does the charge
distribution look like for a free charge on a strictly one-dimensional wire of
finite length? To the best of our knowledge this question has so far not been
discussed anywhere. One notices that a solution of this problem is not as
simple as it might appear at first sight.
