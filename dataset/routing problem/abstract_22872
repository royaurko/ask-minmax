We study biased, diffusive transport of Brownian particles through narrow,
spatially periodic structures in which the motion is constrained in lateral
directions. The problem is analyzed under the perspective of the Fick-Jacobs
equation which accounts for the effect of the lateral confinement by
introducing an entropic barrier in a one dimensional diffusion. The validity of
this approximation, being based on the assumption of an instantaneous
equilibration of the particle distribution in the cross-section of the
structure, is analyzed by comparing the different time scales that characterize
the problem. A validity criterion is established in terms of the shape of the
structure and of the applied force. It is analytically corroborated and
verified by numerical simulations that the critical value of the force up to
which this description holds true scales as the square of the periodicity of
the structure. The criterion can be visualized by means of a diagram
representing the regions where the Fick-Jacobs description becomes inaccurate
in terms of the scaled force versus the periodicity of the structure.
