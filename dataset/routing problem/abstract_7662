This paper is concerned with two-block separable convex minimization problems
with linear constraints, for which it is either impossible or too expensive to
obtain the exact solutions of the subproblems involved in the proximal ADMM
(alternating direction method of multipliers). Such structured convex
minimization problems often arise from the two-block regroup settlement of
three or four-block separable convex optimization problems with linear
constraints, or from the constrained total-variation superresolution image
reconstruction problems in image processing. For them, we propose an inexact
indefinite proximal ADMM of step-size $\tau\in\!(0,\frac{\sqrt{5}+1}{2})$ with
two easily implementable inexactness criteria to control the solution accuracy
of subproblems, and establish the convergence under a mild assumption on
indefinite proximal terms. We apply the proposed inexact indefinite proximal
ADMMs to the three or four-block separable convex minimization problems with
linear constraints, which are from the duality of the important class of doubly
nonnegative semidefinite programming (DNNSDP) problems with many linear
equality and/or inequality constraints. Numerical results indicate that the
inexact indefinite proximal ADMM with the absolute error criterion has a
comparable performance with the directly extended multi-block ADMM of step-size
$\tau=1.618$ without convergence guarantee, whether in terms of the number of
iterations or the computation time.
