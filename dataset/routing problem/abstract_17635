The field of Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) has gained
momentum, thanks to its suitability in capturing complex problems (e.g.,
multi-agent coordination and resource allocation problems) that are naturally
distributed and cannot be realistically addressed in a centralized manner. The
state of the art in solving DCOPs relies on the use of ad-hoc infrastructures
and ad-hoc constraint solving procedures. This paper investigates an
infrastructure for solving DCOPs that is completely built on logic programming
technologies. In particular, the paper explores the use of a general constraint
solver (a constraint logic programming system in this context) to handle the
agent-level constraint solving. The preliminary experiments show that logic
programming provides benefits over a state-of-the-art DCOP system, in terms of
performance and scalability, opening the doors to the use of more advanced
technology (e.g., search strategies and complex constraints) for solving DCOPs.
