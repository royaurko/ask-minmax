The Prony system of equations and its higher-order (confluent)
generalizations appear prominently in many theoretical and applied problems.
For instance, in signal processing these systems arise in recovery of sums of
Diracs from a finite number of their Fourier measurements. The accurate and
robust numerical solution of Prony type systems is considered to be a
challenging problem, in particular reconstructing closely spaced nonlinear
parameters (``nodes'', e.g. the support of the Diracs) in the presence of
perturbed data.
  Our first contribution is providing component-wise asymptotic estimates for
the numerical condition of the high-order Prony system, when the number of
equations can in general be greater than the number of unknowns. These results
provide, in particular, an absolute resolution limit for any method whatsoever.
Our second contribution is proposing a technique for the overdetermined Prony
problem with closely spaced nodes by ``decimation'', i.e. taking subsets of the
equations with indices belonging to arithmetic progressions, and subsequently
solving the resulting square systems. We show that solution of a decimated
system is as accurate as the solution to the full overdetermined problem. Thus,
decimation provides a tool to achieve near-optimal super-resolution.
