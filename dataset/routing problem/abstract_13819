The complete classification of all 6x6 complex Hadamard matrices is an open
problem. The 3-parameter Karlsson family encapsulates all Hadamards that have
been parametrised explicitly. We prove that such matrices satisfy a non-trivial
constraint conjectured to hold for (almost) all 6x6 Hadamard matrices. Our
result imposes additional conditions in the linear programming approach to the
mutually unbiased bases problem recently proposed by Matolcsi et al.
Unfortunately running the linear programs we were unable to conclude that a
complete set of mutually unbiased bases cannot be constructed from Karlsson
Hadamards alone.
