A new simulation method for solving fluid-structure coupling problems has
been developed. All the basic equations are numerically solved on a fixed
Cartesian grid using a finite difference scheme. A volume-of-fluid formulation
(Hirt and Nichols (1981, J. Comput. Phys., 39, 201)), which has been widely
used for multiphase flow simulations, is applied to describing the
multi-component geometry. The temporal change in the solid deformation is
described in the Eulerian frame by updating a left Cauchy-Green deformation
tensor, which is used to express constitutive equations for nonlinear
Mooney-Rivlin materials. In this paper, various verifications and validations
of the present full Eulerian method, which solves the fluid and solid motions
on a fixed grid, are demonstrated, and the numerical accuracy involved in the
fluid-structure coupling problems is examined.
