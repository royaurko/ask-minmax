We investigate the problem of when $\leq\lambda$--support iterations of
$<\lambda$--complete notions of forcing preserve $\lambda^+$. We isolate a
property -- {\em properness over diamonds} -- that implies $\lambda^+$ is
preserved and show that this property is preserved by $\lambda$--support
iterations. We close with an application of our technology by presenting a
consistency result on uniformizing colorings of ladder systems on
$\{\delta<\lambda^+:\cf(\delta)=\lambda\}$ that complements a theorem of
Shelah.
