In this paper, we show that for almost all linear recurrence sequences of
algebraic numbers with integer coefficients (or rational coefficients), the
Skolem Problem is decidable by only testing finitely many terms, whose amount
is bounded explicitly by using the initial data. The same is also true for both
the Positivity Problem and the Ultimate Positivity Problem of real linear
recurrence sequences of algebraic numbers with integer coefficients (or
rational coefficients).
