In this paper we consider the eigenvalue problem consisting of the equation
-u" = \la r u, \quad \text{on $(-1,1)$}, where $r \in C^1[-1,1], \ r>0$ and
$\la \in \R$, together with the multi-point boundary conditions u(\pm 1) =
\sum^{m^\pm}_{i=1} \al^\pm_i u(\eta^\pm_i), where $m^\pm \ge 1$ are integers,
and, for $i = 1,...,m^\pm$, $\al_i^\pm \in \R$, $\eta_i^\pm \in [-1,1]$, with
$\eta_i^+ \ne 1$, $\eta_i^- \ne -1$. We show that if the coefficients
$\al_i^\pm \in \R$ are sufficiently small (depending on $r$) then the spectral
properties of this problem are similar to those of the usual separated problem,
but if the coefficients $\al_i^\pm$ are not sufficiently small then these
standard spectral properties need not hold. The spectral properties of such
multi-point problems have been obtained before for the constant coefficient
case ($r \equiv 1$), but the variable coefficient case has not been considered
previously (apart from the existence of `principal' eigenvalues).
  Some nonlinear multi-point problems are also considered. We obtain a
(partial) Rabinowitz-type result on global bifurcation from the eigenvalues,
and various nonresonance conditions for existence of general solutions and also
of nodal solutions --- these results rely on the spectral properties of the
linear problem.
