In this paper we study a nonlinear transmission problem for a plate which
consists of thermoelastic and isothermal parts. The problem generates a
dynamical system in a suitable Hilbert space. Main result is the proof of the
asymptotic smoothness of this dynamical system. Also we prove the existence of
a compact global attractor in particular cases when the nonlinearity is of
Berger type or scalar.
