Early string theory described Bosonic particles at the real life Compton
scale. Later developments to include Fermions initiated by Ramond and others
have lead through Quantum Super Strings to M-theory operating at the as yet
experimentally unattainable Planck scale. We describe an alternative route from
Bosonic Strings to Fermions, by directly invoking a non commutative geometry,
an approach which is closer to experiment.
