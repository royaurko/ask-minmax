Varying physical constant cosmologies were claimed to solve standard
cosmological problems such as the horizon, the flatness and the
$\Lambda$-problem. In this paper, we suggest yet another possible application
of these theories: solving the singularity problem. By specifying some examples
we show that various cosmological singularities may be regularized provided the
physical constants evolve in time in an appropriate way.
