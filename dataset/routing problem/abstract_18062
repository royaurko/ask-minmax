The hydrodynamics of an incompressible fluid can be approximated as a finite
dimensional Hamiltonian system by a truncation introduced by Zeitlin. With
periodic boundary conditions, there exists a family of stationary solutions
with vorticity $\Omega^*=2\Gamma\cos (\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x} )$. Zeitlin's
truncation is used to analyse the linear stability of these solutions and
compare this with a Galerkin truncation. Following Li's method the problem is
divided into subsystems and we prove that most subsystems are linearly stable.
We derive a sufficient condition for a subsystem to be linearly unstable and
derive an explicit lower bound for the associated real eigenvalues independent
of the truncation size $N$. This together with known stability results for the
2D periodic Euler equations allows us to show that most of these stationary
solutions are nonlinearly unstable. We confirm our results this with numerical
computation of the spectrum for a finite truncation. Finally we discuss the
essential spectrum of the full problem as the limit of the truncated problem.
