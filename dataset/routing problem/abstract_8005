In this note devoted to some aspects of the inverse problem of representation
theory the attention is concentrated on the interrelations between various
algebraic structures (algebras with operators) unraveled by different solutions
of the same inverse problem. The Lie algebras and Jordan triple systems with
operators are considered.
