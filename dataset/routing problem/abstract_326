Nowadays swarm intelligence-based algorithms are being used widely to
optimize the dynamic traveling salesman problem (DTSP). In this paper, we have
used mixed method of Ant Colony Optimization (AOC)and gradient descent to
optimize DTSP which differs with ACO algorithm in evaporation rate and
innovative data. This approach prevents premature convergence and scape from
local optimum spots and also makes it possible to find better solutions for
algorithm. In this paper, we are going to offer gradient descent and ACO
algorithm which in comparison to some former methods it shows that algorithm
has significantly improved routes optimization.
