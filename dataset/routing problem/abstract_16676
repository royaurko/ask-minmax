Recent interest on permutation rank modulation shows the Kendall tau metric
as an important distance metric. This note documents our first efforts to
obtain upper bounds on optimal code sizes (for said metric) ala Delsarte's
approach. For the Hamming metric, Delsarte's seminal work on powerful linear
programming (LP) bounds have been extended to permutation codes, via
association scheme theory. For the Kendall tau metric, the same extension needs
the more general theory of coherent configurations, whereby the optimal code
size problem can be formulated as an extremely huge semidefinite programming
(SDP) problem. Inspired by recent algebraic techniques for solving SDP's, we
consider the dual problem, and propose an LP to search over a subset of dual
feasible solutions. We obtain modest improvement over a recent Singleton bound
due to Barg and Mazumdar. We regard this work as a starting point, towards
fully exploiting the power of Delsarte's method, which are known to give some
of the best bounds in the context of binary codes.
