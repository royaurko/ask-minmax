In order to get accurate information about complex systems depending on a lot
of parameters, frequently different experimental methods and/or different
experimental conditions are used. The evaluation of these data sets is quite
often a problem. The correct approach is the simultaneous fitting, which is
rarely used, because only a very few programs are using it and even those cover
usually a narrow field of physics. FitSuite was written to tackle this problem,
by providing a general and extendable environment for simultaneous fitting and
simulation. Currently it is used for M\"{o}ssbauer spectroscopy, grazing
incidence neutron and (non)resonant X-ray reflectometry, but in principle other
experimental methods can also be added.
