The following inverse problem is discussed. A static electromagnetic field
generated by a limited system of charges and currents is supposed to be known
with its first derivatives at a point somewhere far from the system. This
allows to reconstruct the position of the system, its net charge, and the
electric and magnetic moments of the system.
