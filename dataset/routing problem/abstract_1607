The transition of a fluid to a rigid glass upon cooling is a common route of
transformation from liquid to solid that embodies the most poorly understood
features of both phases1,2,3. From the liquid perspective, the puzzle is to
understand stress relaxation in the disordered state. From the perspective of
solids, the challenge is to extend our description of structure and its
mechanical consequences to materials without long range order. Using computer
simulations, we show that the localized low frequency normal modes of a
configuration in a supercooled liquid are causally correlated to the
irreversible structural reorganization of the particles within that
configuration. We also demonstrate that the spatial distribution of these soft
local modes can persist in spite of significant particle reorganization. The
consequence of these two results is that it is now feasible to construct a
theory of relaxation length scales in glass-forming liquids without recourse to
dynamics and to explicitly relate molecular properties to their collective
relaxation.
