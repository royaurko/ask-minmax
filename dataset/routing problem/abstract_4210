The main purpose of this note is to investigate some kinds of nonlinear
complementarity problems (NCP). For the structured tensors, such as, symmetric
positive definite tensors and copositive tensors, we derive the existence
theorems on a solution of these kinds of nonlinear complementarity problems. We
prove that a unique solution of the NCP exists under the condition of
diagonalizable tensors.
