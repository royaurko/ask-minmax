  Bulatov et al. [1] defined the operation of (efficient)
pps_\omega-definability in order to study the computational complexity of
certain approximate counting problems. They asked whether all log-supermodular
functions can be defined by binary implication and unary functions in this
sense. We give a negative answer to this question.
