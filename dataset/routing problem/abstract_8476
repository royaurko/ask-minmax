The paper considers the problem of estimating a $p\geq2$\ dimensional mean
vector of a multivariate conditionally normal distribution under quadratic
loss. The problem of this type arises when estimating the parameters in a
continuous time regression model with a non-Gaussian Ornstein--Uhlenbeck
process driven by the mixture of a Brownian motion and a compound Poisson
process.
