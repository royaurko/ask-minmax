We introduce a new unified framework for modelling both decision problems and
finite games based on quantifiers and selection functions. We show that the
canonical utility maximisation is one special case of a quantifier and that our
more abstract framework provides several additional degrees of freedom in
modelling. In particular, incomplete preferences, non-maximising heuristics,
and context-dependent motives can be taken into account when describing an
agent's goal. We introduce a suitable generalisation of Nash equilibrium for
games in terms of quantifiers and selection functions. Moreover, we introduce a
refinement of Nash that captures context-dependency of goals. Modelling in our
framework is compositional as the parts of the game are modular and can be
easily exchanged. We provide an extended example where we illustrate concepts
and highlight the benefits of our alternative modelling approach.
