In order to prove that the P of problems is different to the NP class, we
consider the satisfability problem of propositional calculus formulae, which is
an NP-complete problem. It is shown that, for every search algorithm A, there
is a set E(A) containing propositional calculus formulae, each of which
requires the algorithm A to take non-polynomial time to find the truth-values
of its propositional letters satisfying it. Moreover, E(A)'s size is an
exponential function of n, which makes it impossible to detect such formulae in
a polynomial time. Hence, the satisfability problem does not have a polynomial
complexity
