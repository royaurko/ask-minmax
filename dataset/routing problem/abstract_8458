In this work, we study the dissipation-modified Kadomtsev-Petviashvili
equation in two space-dimensional case. We establish that the Cauchy problem
for this equation is locally well-posed in anisotropic Sobolev spaces. We show
in some sense that our result is sharp. We also prove the global well-posedness
for this equation under suitable conditions.
