We propose a new adiabatic algorithm for the unsorted database search
problem. This algorithm saves two thirds of qubits than Grover's algorithm in
realizations. Meanwhile, we analyze the time complexity of the algorithm by
both perturbative method and numerical simulation. The results show it provides
a better speedup than the previous adiabatic search algorithm.
