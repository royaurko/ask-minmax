We consider performing Markov Chain Monte Carlo in parallel. We present an
algorithm for sampling random variables which allows us to divide the
sampling-process into sub- problems by dividing the sample space into
overlapping parts. The sub-problems can be solved independently of each other
and are thus well suited for parallelization. Further, on each of these
sub-problems we can use distinct and independent sampling methods. In other
words, we can design specific samplers for specific parts of the sample space.
Moreover we present an algorithm which parallelizes the Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm up to the point where it is as fast as it would be with
100%-acceptance rate. The algorithms are demonstrated on a particle marginal
Metropolis-Hastings-sampler applied to calibration of a volatility model.
