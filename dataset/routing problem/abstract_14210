The Lorentz contracted form of the static wave functions is used to calculate
the scaled parton distributions for mesons and baryons, boosting the rest frame
solutions of the path integral Hamiltonian. Both unpolarized and polarized
parton distributions are derived, and the proton spin problem is solved in the
new setting. It is argued, that the DIS parton densities are not related to the
ground state nucleon.
