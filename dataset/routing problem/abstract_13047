Automated synthesis from behavioural specifications is an attractive and
powerful way of constructing concurrent systems. Here we focus on the problem
of synthesising a membrane system from a behavioural specification given in the
form of a transition system which specifies the desired state space of the
system to be constructed. We demonstrate how a Petri net solution to this
problem, based on the notion of region of a transition system, yields a method
of automated synthesis of membrane systems from state spaces.
