In a 2001 article, Fetecau and Zierep [1] considered Stokes' first problem
for a second grade (SG) fluid, unaware that it had already been solved
(correctly) by Puri [2] in 1984. These contributors used the Fourier sine transform
to obtain, what they believed to be, the exact solution of the resulting
initial-boundary-value problem (IBVP). Unfortunately, due to their incorrect
computation of the distributional derivative of the Heaviside function, an
omission of a critical term in the subsidiary equation occurred, an elementary
mistake (gracefully explained in [3]) apparently not uncommon in the
literature. Therefore, the solution given in [1] is, generally speaking,
incorrect.
