Self-adjoint boundary problems for the equation $y^{(4)}-\lambda\rho y=0$
with generalized derivative $\rho\in W_2^{-1}[0,1]$ of self-similar Cantor type
function as a weight are considered. Using the oscillating properties of the
eigenfunctions, the spectral asymptotics are made more precise then in previous
papers.
