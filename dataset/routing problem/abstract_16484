Open data platforms such as data.gov or opendata.socrata. com provide a huge
amount of valuable information. Their free-for-all nature, the lack of
publishing standards and the multitude of domains and contributors represented on
these platforms lead to new integration and standardization problems. At the
same time, crowd-based data integration techniques are emerging as new way of
dealing with these problems. However, these methods still require input in form
of specific questions or tasks that can be passed to the crowd. This paper
discusses integration problems on Open Data Platforms, and proposes a method
for identifying and ranking integration hypotheses in this context. We will
evaluate our findings by conducting a comprehensive evaluation using on one of
the largest Open Data platforms.
