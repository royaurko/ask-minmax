A spherical wrist of the serial type is said to be isotropic if it can attain
a posture whereby the singular values of its Jacobian matrix are all identical
and nonzero. What isotropy brings about is robustness to manufacturing,
assembly, and measurement errors, thereby guaranteeing a maximum orientation
accuracy. In this paper we investigate the existence of redundant isotropic
architectures, which should add to the dexterity of the wrist under design by
virtue of its extra degree of freedom. The problem formulation leads to a
system of eight quadratic equations with eight unknowns. The Bezout number of
this system is thus 2^8 = 256, its BKK bound being 192. However, the actual
number of solutions is shown to be 32. We list all solutions of the foregoing
algebraic problem. All these solutions are real, but distinct solutions do not
necessarily lead to distinct manipulators. Upon discarding those algebraic
solutions that yield no new wrists, we end up with exactly eight distinct
architectures, the eight corresponding manipulators being displayed at their
isotropic posture.
