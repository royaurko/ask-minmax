This paper demonstrates fundamental limits of sensor networks for detection
problems where the number of hypotheses is exponentially large. Such problems
characterize many important applications including detection and classification
of targets in a geographical area using a network of sensors, and detecting
complex substances with a chemical sensor array. We refer to such applications
as largescale detection problems. Using the insight that these problems share
fundamental similarities with the problem of communicating over a noisy
channel, we define a quantity called the sensing capacity and lower bound it
for a number of sensor network models. The sensing capacity expression differs
significantly from the channel capacity due to the fact that a fixed sensor
configuration encodes all states of the environment. As a result, codewords are
dependent and non-identically distributed. The sensing capacity provides a
bound on the minimal number of sensors required to detect the state of an
environment to within a desired accuracy. The results differ significantly from
classical detection theory, and provide an ntriguing connection between sensor
networks and communications. In addition, we discuss the insight that sensing
capacity provides for the problem of sensor selection.
