We consider the inverse problem of the determining the potential in the
dynamical Schr\"odinger equation on the interval by the measurement on the
whole boundary. Provided that source is \emph{generic} using the Boundary
Control method we recover the spectrum of the problem from the observation at
either left or right end points. Using the specificity of the one-dimensional
situation we recover the spectral function, reducing the problem to the
classical one which could be treated by known methods. We adapt the algorithm
to the situation when only the finite number of eigenvalues are known and
provide the result on the convergence of the method.
