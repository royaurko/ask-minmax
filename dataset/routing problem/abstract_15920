We show that the minimization of the Lagrangian action functional on suitable
classes of symmetric loops yields collisionless periodic orbits of the n-body
problem, provided that some simple conditions on the symmetry group are
satisfied. More precisely, we give a fairly general condition on symmetry
groups G of the loop space for the n-body problem (with potential of
homogeneous degree alpha, with alpha>0) which ensures that the restriction of
the Lagrangian action to the space of G-equivariant loops is coercive and its
minimizers are collisionless, without any strong force assumption. Many of the
already known periodic orbits can be proved to exist by this result, and
several new orbits are found with some appropriate choice of G.
