Delsarte's method and its extensions allow to consider the upper bound
problem for codes in 2-point-homogeneous spaces as a linear programming problem
with perhaps infinitely many variables, which are the distance distribution. We
show that using as variables power sums of distances this problem can be
considered as a finite semidefinite programming problem. This method allows to
improve some linear programming upper bounds. In particular we obtain new
bounds of one-sided kissing numbers.
