We consider the problem of rescaling the lengths of a finite frame thereby
transforming it into a tight one. Such frames are called scalable and have
received a lot of attention in recent years. In this note we investigate the
question in terms of probabilistic frames and give conditions under which a
(discrete) probabilistic frame is scalable.
