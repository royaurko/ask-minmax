Let R be a subring of the rationals. We want to investigate self splitting
R-modules G that is Ext_R(G,G)=0 holds and follow Schultz to call such modules
splitters. Free modules and torsion-free cotorsion modules are classical
examples for splitters. Are there others? Answering an open problem by Schultz
we will show that there are more splitters, in fact we are able to prescribe
their endomorphism R-algebras with a free R-module structure. As a byproduct we
are able to answer a problem of Salce showing that all rational cotorsion
theories have enough injectives and enough projectives.
