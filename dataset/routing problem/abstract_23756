This paper presents a general method for combining uncertain and paradoxical
source of evidences for a wide class of fusion problems. From the foundations
of the Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT) we show how the DSm rule of combination
can be adapted to take into account all possible integrity constraints (if any)
of the problem under consideration due to the true nature of elements/concepts
involved into it. We show how the Shafer's model can be considered as a
specific DSm hybrid model and be easily handled by our approach and a new
efficient rule of combination different from the Dempster's rule is obtained.
Several simple examples are also provided to show the efficiency and the
generality of the approach proposed in this work.
