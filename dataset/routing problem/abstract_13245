This paper addresses the problem of infants' cry fundamental frequency
estimation. The fundamental frequency is estimated using a modified simple
inverse filtering tracking (SIFT) algorithm. The performance of the modified
SIFT is studied using a real database of infants' cry. It is shown that the
algorithm is capable of overcoming the problem of under-estimation and
over-estimation of the cry fundamental frequency, with an estimation accuracy
of 6.15% and 3.75%, for hyperphonated and phonated cry segments, respectively.
Some typical examples of the fundamental frequency contour in typical cases of
pathological and healthy cry signals are presented and discussed.
