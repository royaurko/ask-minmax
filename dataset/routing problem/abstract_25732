We present the Unified Form Language (UFL), which is a domain-specific
language for representing weak formulations of partial differential equations
with a view to numerical approximation. Features of UFL include support for
variational forms and functionals, automatic differentiation of forms and
expressions, arbitrary function space hierarchies for multi-field problems,
general differential operators and flexible tensor algebra. With these
features, UFL has been used to effortlessly express finite element methods for
complex systems of partial differential equations in near-mathematical
notation, resulting in compact, intuitive and readable programs. We present in
this work the language and its construction. An implementation of UFL is freely
available as an open-source software library. The library generates abstract
syntax tree representations of variational problems, which are used by other
software libraries to generate concrete low-level implementations. Some
application examples are presented and libraries that support UFL are
highlighted.
