A functional distance ${\mathbb H}$, based on the Hausdorff metric between
the function hypographs, is proposed for the space ${\mathcal E}$ of
non-negative real upper semicontinuous functions on a compact interval. The
main goal of the paper is to show that the space $({\mathcal E},{\mathbb H})$
is particularly suitable in some statistical problems with functional data
which involve functions with very wiggly graphs and narrow, sharp peaks. A
typical example is given by spectrograms, either obtained by magnetic resonance
or by mass spectrometry. On the theoretical side we show that $({\mathcal
E},{\mathbb H})$ is a complete, separable locally compact space and that the
${\mathbb H}$-convergence implies the convergence of the respective maximum
values. The probabilistic and statistical implications of these results are
discussed in particular, regarding the consistency of $k$-NN classifiers for
supervised classification problems with functional data in ${\mathbb H}$. On
the practical side, we consider three real data problems of supervised
classification with functional data corresponding to mass or magnetic resonance
spectra. The results suggest a good behaviour of the $k$-NN functional
classifiers based on the distance ${\mathbb H}$ when compared with those based
on the $L^\infty$ or the $L^2$-metric.
