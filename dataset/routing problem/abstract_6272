The present paper studies a feedback regulation problem, which may be
interpreted as an adaptive control problem, but has not yet been studied in the
control literature. The problem, which arises in at least two different
biological applications (Hopf bifurcations in the auditory system, and neural
integrators used to maintain persistent neural activity), is that of tuning a
parameter so as to bring it to a value at which a bifurcation takes place.
