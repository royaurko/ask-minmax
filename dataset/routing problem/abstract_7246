We address the problem of angular momentum decomposition of a free photon. We
propose a natural and physical scheme for separating the total angular momentum
operator for a free photon into an orbital part and a spin part with the hope
that it solves this long-standing problem and it could provide a natural basis
for further study of the problem of angular momentum decomposition of a gauge
field system.
