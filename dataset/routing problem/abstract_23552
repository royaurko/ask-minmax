We shall discuss issues of duality and topological mass generation in diverse
dimensions. Particular emphasis will be given to the mass generation mechanism
from interference between self and anti self-dual components, as disclosed by
the soldering formalism. This is a gauge embedding procedure derived from an
old algorithm of second-class constraint conversion used by the contributor to
approach anomalous gauge theories. The problem of classification of the
electromagnetic duality groups, both massless and massive, that is closely
related will be discussed. Particular attention will be paid to a new approach
to duality based on the soldering embedding to tackle the problem of mass
generation by topological mechanisms in arbitrary dimensions including the
couplings to dynamical matter, nonlinear cases and nonabelian symmetries.
