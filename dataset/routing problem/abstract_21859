The paper is an extended version of the talk which I gave at the XIX
Congresso dell'UMI in Bologna in September 2011. The aim of this paper is
twofold: first, to give an overview on the recent development in the
classification of surfaces of general type with $p_g=q=2$; second, to point out
some of the problems that are still open.
