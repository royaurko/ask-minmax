The condition number of solutions to full rank linear least-squares problem
are shown to be given by an optimization problem that involves nuclear norms of
rank 2 matrices. The condition number is with respect to the least-squares
coefficient matrix and 2-norms. It depends on three quantities each of which
can contribute ill-conditioning. The literature presents several estimates for
this condition number with varying results; even standard reference texts
contain serious overestimates. The use of the nuclear norm affords a single
derivation of the best known lower and upper bounds on the condition number and
shows why there is unlikely to be a closed formula.
