First we prove some elementary but useful identities in the group ring of
Q/Z. Our identities have potential applications to several unsolved problems
which involve sums of Farey fractions. In this paper we use these identities,
together with some analytic number theory and results about divisors in short
intervals, to estimate the cardinality of a class of sets of fundamental
interest.
