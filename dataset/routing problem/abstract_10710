We propose a conceptually new method for solving nonlinear inverse scattering
problems (ISPs). The method is inspired by the theory of nonlocality of
physical interactions and utilizes the relevant mathematical formalism. We
formulate the ISP as a problem whose goal is to determine an unknown and,
generally, nonlocal interaction potential $V$ from external scattering data. We
then utilize the one-to-one correspondence between $V$ and the T-matrix of the
problem, $T$. An iterative algorithm is proposed in which we seek $T$ that is
(i) compatible with the data and (ii) corresponds to an interaction potential
$V$ that is as diagonally-dominated as possible. We refer to this algorithm as
to the data-compatible T-matrix completion (DCTMC). This paper is Part I in a
two-part series and contains theory only. Numerical examples are given in Part
II (arXiv:1505.06777).
