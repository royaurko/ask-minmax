The birthday problem states that there is at least half a chance that some
two out of twenty-three randomly chosen people will share the same birth date.
The calculation for this problem assumes that all birth dates are equally
likely. We consider the following two modifications of this question. What if
the distribution of birth dates is non-uniform and possibly even unknown?
Further, what if we focus on birthdays shared by two friends rather than any
two people? In this paper we present some of our results and conjectures in
this generalized setting. We will also show how these results are related to
the Stanley-Stembridge poset chain chromatic conjecture and the `shameful
conjecture', two famous conjectures in combinatorics.
