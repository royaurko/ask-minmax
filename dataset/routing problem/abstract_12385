Model checking is an automatic verification technique to verify hardware and
software systems. However it suffers from state-space explosion problem. In
this paper we address this problem in the context of cryptographic protocols by
proposing a security property-dependent heuristic. The heuristic weights the
state space by exploiting the security formulae; the weights may then be used
to explore the state space when searching for attacks.
