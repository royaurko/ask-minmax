It is a famous open question whether every integrally closed reflexive
polytope has a unimodal Ehrhart delta-vector. We generalize this question to
arbitrary integrally closed lattice polytopes and we prove unimodality for the
delta-vector of lattice parallelepipeds. This is the first nontrivial class of
integrally closed polytopes. Moreover, we suggest a new approach to the problem
for reflexive polytopes via triangulations.
