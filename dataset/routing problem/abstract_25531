We solve problem x proposed by O. Oloa, AMM xxx 2012 {\bf 119?} (to appear),
p. yyy for certain definite logarithmic integrals. A number of generating
functions are developed with certain coefficients $p_n$, and some extensions
are presented. The explicit relation of $p_n$ to N\"{o}rlund numbers
$B_n^{(n)}$ is discussed. Certain inequalities are conjectured for the
$\{p_n\}$ sequence of coefficients, including its convexity, and an upper bound
is demonstrated. It is shown that $p_n$ values may be used to express the
Stieltjes constants for the Hurwitz and Riemann zeta functions, as well as
values of these zeta functions at integer argument. Other summations with the
$p_n$ coefficients are presented.
