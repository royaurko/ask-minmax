The adsorption of a single multi-block $AB$-copolymer on a solid planar
substrate is investigated by means of computer simulations and scaling
analysis. It is shown that the problem can be mapped onto an effective
homopolymer adsorption problem. In particular we discuss how the critical
adsorption energy and the fraction of adsorbed monomers depend on the block
length $M$ of sticking monomers $A$, and on the total length $N$ of the polymer
chains. Also the adsorption of the random copolymers is considered and found to
be well described within the framework of the annealed approximation. For a
better test of our theoretical prediction, two different Monte Carlo (MC)
simulation methods were employed: a) off-lattice dynamic bead-spring model,
based on the standard Metropolis algorithm (MA), and b) coarse-grained lattice
model using the Pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM) which enables tests
for very long chains. The findings of both methods are fully consistent and in
good agreement with theoretical predictions.
