In this paper we establish a comparison result through symmetrization for
solutions to some boundary value problems involving the fractional Laplacian.
This allows to get sharp estimates for the solutions, obtained by comparing
them with solutions of suitable radial problems. Furthermore, we use such
result to prove a priori estimates for solutions in terms of the data,
providing several regularity results which extend the well known ones for the
classical Laplacian.
