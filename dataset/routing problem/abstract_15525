A Hamiltonian that approaches the study of the three-body problem in general
relativity is obtained. We use it to study the relativistic version of the
circular restricted three-body problem in which the first body is the heaviest
and the third body is a test-particle. We focus on the orbits around the 3:2
resonance. We show that, in spite of the notable difference between the
relativistic and Newtonian orbits, most of the resonant region is preserved.
Nevertheless, differently from the Newtonian case, the frequencies between the
second and the third body are no longer commensurable.
