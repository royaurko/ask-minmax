In this paper, we consider the design of robust linear precoders for MU-MISO
systems where users have perfect Channel State Information (CSI) while the BS
has partial CSI. In particular, the BS has access to imperfect estimates of the
channel vectors, in addition to the covariance matrices of the estimation error
vectors. A closed-form expression for the Average Minimum Mean Square Error
(AMMSE) is obtained using the second order Taylor Expansion. This approximation
is used to formulate two fairness-based robust design problems: a maximum
AMMSE-constrained problem and a power-constrained problem. We propose an
algorithm based on convex optimization techniques to address the first problem,
while the second problem is tackled by exploiting the close relationship
between the two problems, in addition to their monotonic natures.
