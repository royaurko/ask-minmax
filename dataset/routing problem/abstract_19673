The technical challenges of scaling websites with large and growing member
bases, like social networking sites, are numerous. One of these challenges is
how to evenly distribute the growing member base across all available
resources. This paper will explore various methods that address this issue. The
techniques used in this paper can be generalized and applied to various other
problems that need to distribute data evenly amongst a finite amount of
resources.
