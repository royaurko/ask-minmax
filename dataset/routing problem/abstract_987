We present the circuit board integration of a self-healing mechanism to
repair open faults. The electric field driven mechanism physically restores
fractured interconnects in electronic circuits and has the ability to solve
mazes. The repair is performed by conductive particles dispersed in an
insulating fluid. We demonstrate the integration of the healing module onto
printed circuit boards and the ability of maze solving. We model and perform
experiments on the influence of the geometry of the conductive particles as
well as the terminal impedances of the route on the healing efficiency. The
typical heal rate is 10 $\mu$m/s with healed route having resistance of 100
$\Omega$ to 20 k$\Omega$ depending on the materials and concentrations used.
