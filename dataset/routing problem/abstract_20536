We consider here the problem of extrema for the Kac functional with long
range, ferromagnetic interaction, and vorticity conditions at infinity which
make it not weakly closed. Using a gradient-flow dynamics, we investigate local
minima, showing strong analogies with the Ginzburg-Landau functional in
infinite volume.
