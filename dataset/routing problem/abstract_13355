In a recent result of Gerard-Varet and Dormy [5], they established
ill-posedness for the Cauchy problem of the linearized Prandtl equation around
non-monotic special solution which is independent of x and satis?es the heat
equation. In [6] and [7], some nonlinear ill-posedness were established with
this counterexample. Then it is natural to consider the problem that does this
linear ill-posedness happen whenever the non-degenerate critical points appear.
In this paper, we concern the linearized Prandtl equation around general
stationary solutions with non-degenerate critical points depending on x which
could be considered as the time-periodic solutions and show some ill-posdness.
