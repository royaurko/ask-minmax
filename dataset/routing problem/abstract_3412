A problem of a wave identification is formulated. An example is considered in
conditions of one-dimensional Cauchy problem for conventional string equation
in matrix form and its inhomogeneous two-component version. The acoustic and
electromagnetic problems are discussed within the restrictions outlined. The
projecting operator technique is used to split the solution space and analyze
input of a wave monitoring in vicinity of an observation point. The solution
space is supplied by $L_2$ norm via the problem conservation law; its
finite-dimensional analog is used as a measure of a given mode presence and
information about form. The algorithm of the problem solution is presented in
terms of appropriate regularization to reconstruct an incoming pulses origin.
The dissipation and entropy mode account in the problem of acoustic waves
extraction is also discussed in terms of correspondent projecting technique.
