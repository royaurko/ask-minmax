In this paper we consider generalized eigenvalue problems for a family of
operators with a polynomial dependence on a complex parameter. This problem is
equivalent to a genuine non self-adjoint operator. We discuss here existence of
non trivial eigenstates for models coming from analytic theory of smoothness
for P.D.E. We shall review some old results and present recent improvements on
this subject.
