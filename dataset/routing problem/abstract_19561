In gravitostatics, the minimally generalized Newtonian theory, the simplest
cosmological model implies a cosmological redshift with acceleration parameter
-1. If the gravitational potential satisfies a wave equation, the total mass
density (visible plus dark) is one third of the critical density, in good
agreement with observation. There is no horizon problem and no need to invoke
dark energy.
