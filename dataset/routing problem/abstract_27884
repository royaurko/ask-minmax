Motivated by the recent applications of game-theoretical learning techniques
to the design of distributed control systems, we study a class of control
problems that can be formulated as potential games with continuous action sets,
and we propose an actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm that provably
converges to equilibrium in this class of problems. The method employed is to
analyse the learning process under study through a mean-field dynamical system
that evolves in an infinite-dimensional function space (the space of
probability distributions over the players' continuous controls). To do so, we
extend the theory of finite-dimensional two-timescale stochastic approximation
to an infinite-dimensional, Banach space setting, and we prove that the
continuous dynamics of the process converge to equilibrium in the case of
potential games. These results combine to give a provably-convergent learning
algorithm in which players do not need to keep track of the controls selected
by the other agents.
