We report an inter-comparison of some popular algorithms within the
artificial neural network domain (viz., Local search algorithms, global search
algorithms, higher order algorithms and the hybrid algorithms) by applying them
to the standard benchmarking problems like the IRIS data, XOR/N-Bit parity and
Two Spiral. Apart from giving a brief description of these algorithms, the
results obtained for the above benchmark problems are presented in the paper.
The results suggest that while Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm yields the lowest
RMS error for the N-bit Parity and the Two Spiral problems, Higher Order
Neurons algorithm gives the best results for the IRIS data problem. The best
results for the XOR problem are obtained with the Neuro Fuzzy algorithm. The
above algorithms were also applied for solving several regression problems such
as cos(x) and a few special functions like the Gamma function, the
complimentary Error function and the upper tail cumulative
$\chi^2$-distribution function. The results of these regression problems
indicate that, among all the ANN algorithms used in the present study,
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm yields the best results. Keeping in view the
highly non-linear behaviour and the wide dynamic range of these functions, it
is suggested that these functions can be also considered as standard benchmark
problems for function approximation using artificial neural networks.
