In this three-sections lecture cavity method is introduced as heuristic
framework from a Physics perspective to solve probabilistic graphical models
and it is presented both at the replica symmetric (RS) and 1-step replica
symmetry breaking (1RSB) level. This technique has been applied with success on
a wide range of models and problems such as spin glasses, random constrain
satisfaction problems (rCSP), error correcting codes etc. Firstly, the RS
cavity solution for Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model---a fully connected spin
glass model---is derived and its equivalence to the RS solution obtained using
replicas is discussed. Then, the general cavity method for diluted graphs is
illustrated both at RS and 1RSB level. The latter was a significant
breakthrough in the last decade and has direct applications to rCSP. Finally,
as example of an actual problem, K-SAT is investigated using belief and survey
propagation.
