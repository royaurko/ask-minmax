Cut-set bounds on achievable rates for network communication protocols are
not in general tight. In this paper we introduce a new technique for proving
converses for the problem of transmission of correlated sources in networks,
that results in bounds that are tighter than the corresponding cut-set bounds.
We also define the concept of "uncertainty region" which might be of
independent interest. We provide a full characterization of this region for the
case of two correlated random variables. The bounding technique works as
follows: on one hand we show that if the communication problem is solvable, the
uncertainty of certain random variables in the network with respect to
imaginary parties that have partial knowledge of the sources must satisfy some
constraints that depend on the network architecture. On the other hand, the
same uncertainties have to satisfy constraints that only depend on the joint
distribution of the sources. Matching these two leads to restrictions on the
statistical joint distribution of the sources in communication problems that
are solvable over a given network architecture.
