This Letter provides the solution to a yet unsolved basic problem of Solid
State Physics: the ground state energy of an arbitrary number of Cooper pairs
interacting via the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer potential. We here break a 50
year old math problem by analytically solving Richardson-Gaudin equations which
give the exact energy of these $N$ pairs via $N$ parameters coupled through $N$
non-linear equations. Our result fully supports the standard BCS result
obtained for a pair number equal to half the number of states feeling the
potential. More importantly, it shows that the interaction part of the $N$-pair
energy depends on $N$ as $N(N-1)$ only from N=1 to the dense regime, a result
which evidences that Cooper pairs interact via Pauli blocking only.
