Consider the problem \begin{eqnarray*} -\Delta u_\e &=& v_\e^p \quad
v_\e>0\quad {in}\quad \Omega, -\Delta v_\e &=& u_\e^{q_\e}\quad u_\e>0\quad
{in}\quad \Omega, u_\e&=&v_\e\:\:=\:\:0 \quad {on}\quad \partial \Omega,
\end{eqnarray*} where $\Omega$ is a bounded convex domain in $\R^N,$ $N>2,$
with smooth boundary $\partial \Omega.$ Here $p,q_\e>0,$ and \begin{equation*}
\epsilon:=\frac{N}{p+1}+\frac{N}{q_\e+1}-(N-2). \end{equation*} This problem
has positive solutions for $\e>0$ (with $pq_\e>1$) and no non-trivial solution
for $\e\leq 0.$ We study the asymptotic behaviour of \emph{least energy}
solutions as $\e\to 0^+.$ These solutions are shown to blow-up at exactly one
point, and the location of this point is characterized. In addition, the shape
and exact rates for blowing up are given.
