We study certificates in static data structures. In the cell-probe model,
certificates are the cell probes which can uniquely identify the answer to the
query. As a natural notion of nondeterministic cell probes, lower bounds for
certificates in data structures immediately imply deterministic cell-probe
lower bounds. In spite of this extra power brought by nondeterminism, we prove
that two widely used tools for cell-probe lower bounds: richness lemma of
Miltersen et al. and direct-sum richness lemma of Patrascu and Thorup, both
hold for certificates in data structures with even better parameters. Applying
these lemmas and adopting existing reductions, we obtain certificate lower
bounds for a variety of static data structure problems. These certificate lower
bounds are at least as good as the highest known cell-probe lower bounds for
the respective problems. In particular, for approximate near neighbor (ANN)
problem in Hamming distance, our lower bound improves the state of the art.
When the space is strictly linear, our lower bound for ANN in d-dimensional
Hamming space becomes t=Omega(d), which along with the recent breakthrough for
polynomial evaluation of Larsen, are the only two t=Omega(d) lower bounds ever
proved for any problems in the cell-probe model.
