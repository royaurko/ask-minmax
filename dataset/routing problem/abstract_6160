The principal innovative idea in this paper is to transform the original
complex nonlinear modeling problem into a combination of linear problem and
very simple nonlinear problems. The key step is the generalized linearization
of nonlinear terms. This paper only presents the introductory strategy of this
methodology. The practical numerical experiments will be provided subsequently.
