We study the inverse scattering problem for electric potentials and magnetic
fields in $\ere^d, d\geq 3$, that are asymptotic sums of homogeneous terms at
infinity. The main result is that all these terms can be uniquely reconstructed
from the singularities in the forward direction of the scattering amplitude at
some positive energy.
