Bulk samples of $(Sn_{1-x}Sb_{x}O_{2-\delta})$ with x = 0.00, 0.10, 0.20,
0.30 are synthesized by solid-state reaction route. Samples were characterized
by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The x-ray
diffraction patterns indicate that the gross structure/phase of $(Sn_{1-x}$
$Sb_{x}O_{2-\delta})$ do not change with the substitution of antimony (Sb) up
to x = 0.30. The surface morphological examination with SEM revealed the fact
that the grain size in the antimony doped sample is larger than that of undoped
one and hence pores/voids between the grains increase with Sb concentration up
to 0.30. TEM image of undoped sample indicates that the $SnO_{2}$ grains have
diameters ranging from 25 to 120 nm and most grains are in cubic or spherical
shape. As antimony content increases, the nanocubes/spheres are converted into
microcubes/spheres. The reflectance of $Sn_{1-x}Sb_{x}O_{2-\delta}$ samples
increases whereas absorbance of these samples decreases with the increased
concentration of antimony (Sb) for the wavelength range 360 - 800 nm. The
energy bandgap of Sb doped - $SnO_{2}$ samples were obtained from optical
absorption spectra by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. Upon increasing the Sb
concentration the bandgap of the samples was found to increase from 3.367 eV to
3.558 eV.
