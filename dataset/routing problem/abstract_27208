Given $(n,r,b)$, a triple of integers with $0<r\leq n$ and $1\leq
b\leq\binom{n}{r}$, does there exist a matroid of size $n$, rank $r$, with $b$
bases? Such a matroid is called an $(n,r,b)$-matroid. This problem was raised
by Dominic Welsh and is studied in this paper. We prove that when corank
$n-r\leq3$, $(n,r,b)$-matroids exist for all such triples except
$(n,r,b)=(6,3,11)$, which is the counterexample found by Mayhew and Royle.
Furthermore, we show that $(n,r,b)$-matroids exist for all $r$ large relative
to the corank $n-r$.
