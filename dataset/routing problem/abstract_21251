Recent developments in holography have provided a new vista to the nucleon
composition. A strongly coupled core nucleon tied with vector mesons emerge in
line with the Cheshire cat principle. The cat is found to hide in the
holographic direction. We discuss the one, two and many baryon problem in this
context and point at the striking similarities between the holographic results
and recent lattice simulations at strong coupling.
