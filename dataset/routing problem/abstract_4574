In this paper we give a more geometrical formulation of the main theorem in
[E1] on the inverse problem for the second order hyperbolic equation of general
form with coefficients independent of the time variable. We apply this theorem
to the inverse problem for the equation of the propagation of light in a moving
medium (the Gordon equation). Then we study the existence of black and white
holes for the general hyperbolic and for the Gordon equation and we discuss the
impact of this phenomenon on the inverse problems.
