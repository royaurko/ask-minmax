In the present work the problem of the motion of the classical particle in
the field of harmonic oscillator in the hyperbolic space $H_2^2: \,
z_0^2+z_1^2-z_2^2-z_3^2=R^2$ has been solved. We have shown that all the finite
classical trajectories are closed and periodic. The orbits of motion are
ellipses or circles for bounded motion and parabolas and hyperbolas for
infinite.
