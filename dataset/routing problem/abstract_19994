We review some basic notions on anomalies in field theories and superstring
theories, with particular emphasis on the concept of locality. The aim is to
prepare the ground for a discussion on anomalies in theories with branes. In
this light we review the problem of chiral anomaly cancellation in M-theory
with a 5-brane.
