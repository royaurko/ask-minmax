Wireless surveillance in cellular networks has become increasingly important,
while commercial LTE surveillance cameras are also available nowadays.
Nevertheless, most scheduling algorithms in the literature are throughput,
fairness, or profit-based approaches, which are not suitable for wireless
surveillance. In this paper, therefore, we explore the resource allocation
problem for a multi-camera surveillance system in 3GPP Long Term Evolution
(LTE) uplink (UL) networks. We minimize the number of allocated resource blocks
(RBs) while guaranteeing the coverage requirement for surveillance systems in
LTE UL networks. Specifically, we formulate the Camera Set Resource Allocation
Problem (CSRAP) and prove that the problem is NP-Hard. We then propose an
Integer Linear Programming formulation for general cases to find the optimal
solution. Moreover, we present a baseline algorithm and devise an approximation
algorithm to solve the problem. Simulation results based on a real surveillance
map and synthetic datasets manifest that the number of allocated RBs can be
effectively reduced compared to the existing approach for LTE networks.
