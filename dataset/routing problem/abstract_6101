We have asked a number of researchers to compile their lists of the top 10
problems in the field of massive stars. This paper is a compilation of these
lists. We attempted to survey observers and theorists and those studying all
evolutionary stages in the lives of massive stars. Each list reflects the
proposer's personal point of view, but hopefully, this compilation will
motivate new young astronomers and begin a new series of discussion.
