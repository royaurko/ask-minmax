A fundamental problem in wireless communication is the time-frequency shift
(TFS) problem: Find the time-frequency shift of a signal in a noisy
environment. The shift is the result of time asynchronization of a sender with
a receiver, and of non-zero speed of a sender with respect to a receiver. A
classical solution of a discrete analog of the TFS problem is called the
matched filter algorithm. It uses a pseudo-random waveform S(t) of the length
p, and its arithmetic complexity is O(p^{2} \cdot log (p)), using fast Fourier
transform. In these notes we introduce a novel approach of designing new
waveforms that allow faster matched filter algorithm. We use techniques from
group representation theory to design waveforms S(t), which enable us to
introduce two fast matched filter (FMF) algorithms, called the flag algorithm,
and the cross algorithm. These methods solve the TFS problem in O(p\cdot log
(p)) operations. We discuss applications of the algorithms to mobile
communication, GPS, and radar.
