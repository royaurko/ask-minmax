The so-called indentation stiffness tomography technique for detecting the
interior mechanical properties of an elastic sample with an inhomogeneity is
analyzed in the framework of the asymptotic modeling approach under the
assumption of small size of the inhomogeneity. In particular, it is assumed
that the inhomogeneity size and the size of contact area under the indenter are
small compared with the distance between them. By the method of matched
asymptotic expansions, the first-order asymptotic solution to the corresponding
frictionless unilateral contact problem is obtained. The case of an elastic
half-space containing a small spherical inhomogeneity has been studied in
detail. Based on the grid indentation technique, a procedure for solving the
inverse problem of extracting the inhomogeneity parameters is proposed.
