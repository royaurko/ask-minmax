The Pareto dominance relation of a preference profile is (the asymmetric part
of) a partial order. For any integer n, the problem of the existence of an
n-agent preference profile that generates the given Pareto dominance relation
is to investigate the dimension of the partial order. We provide a
characterization of a partial order having dimension n in general.
