In this paper, we develop a new formulation of changeover constraints for
mixed integer programming problem (MIP) that emerges in solving a short-term
production scheduling problem. The new model requires fewer constraints than
the original formulation and this often leads to shorter computation time of a
MIP solver. Besides that, the new formulation is more flexible if the time
windows for changeover tasks are given.
