We continue the analysis of models of spontaneous wave function collapse with
stochastic dynamics driven by non-white Gaussian noise. We specialize to a
model in which a classical "noise" field, with specified autocorrelator, is
coupled to a local nonrelativistic particle density. We derive general results
in this model for the rates of density matrix diagonalization and of state
vector reduction, and show that (in the absence of decoherence) both processes
are governed by essentially the same rate parameters. As an alternative route
to our reduction results, we also derive the Fokker-Planck equations that
correspond to the initial stochastic Schr\"odinger equation. For specific
models of the noise autocorrelator, including ones motivated by the structure
of thermal Green's functions, we discuss the qualitative and qantitative
dependence on model parameters, with particular emphasis on possible
cosmological sources of the noise field.
