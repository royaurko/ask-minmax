Using the shape space of codons and tRNAs we give a physical description of
the genetic code evolution on the basis of the codon capture and ambiguous
intermediate scenarios in a consistent manner. In the lowest dimensional
version of our description, a physical quantity, codon level is introduced. In
terms of the codon levels two scenarios are typically classified into two
different routes of the evolutional process. In the case of the ambiguous
intermediate scenario we perform an evolutional simulation implemented cost
selection of amino acids and confirm a rapid transition of the code change.
Such rapidness reduces uncomfortableness of the non-unique translation of the
code at intermediate state that is the weakness of the scenario. In the case of
the codon capture scenario the survival against mutations under the mutational
pressure minimizing GC content in genomes is simulated and it is demonstrated
that cells which experience only neutral mutations survive.
