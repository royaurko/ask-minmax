We show that all cosmological models with an accelerated stationary global
attractor reduce asymptotically to a dark energy field with an exponential
potential coupled linearly to a perfect fluid dark matter. In such models the
abundance of the dark components reaches a stationary value and therefore the
problem of their present coincidence is solved. The requirement of a vanishing
coupling of the baryons in order to pass local gravity experiments induces the
existence of an intermediate baryon-dominated era. We discuss in detail the
properties of these models and show that to accomodate standard nucleosynthesis
they cannot produce a microwave background consistent with observations. We
conclude that, among stationary models, only a time-dependent coupling or
equation of state might provide a realistic cosmology.
