In this paper, we study the existence of least energy nodal solutions for
some class of Kirchhoff type problems. Since Kirchhoff equation is a nonlocal
one, the variational setting to look for sign-changing solutions is different
from the local cases. By using constrained minimization on the sign-changing
Nehari manifold, we prove the Kirchhoff problem has a least energy nodal
solution with its energy exceeding twice the least energy. As a co-product of
our approaches, we obtain the existence of least energy sign-changing solution
for Choquard equations and show that the sign-changing solution has an energy
strictly larger than the least energy and less than twice the least energy.
