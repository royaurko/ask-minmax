We use a systolic N-body algorithm to evaluate the linear stability of the
gravitational N-body problem for N up to 1.3 x 10^5, two orders of magnitude
greater than in previous experiments. For the first time, a clear ~ln
N-dependence of the perturbation growth rate is seen. The e-folding time for N
= 10^5 is roughly 1/20 of a crossing time.
