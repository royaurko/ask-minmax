Radiative Transfer (RT) effects play a crucial role in the thermal history of
the intergalactic medium. Here I discuss recent advances in the development of
numerical methods that introduce RT to cosmological hydrodynamics. These
methods can also readily be applied to time dependent problems on interstellar
and galactic scales.
