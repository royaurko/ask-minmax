In this paper we introduce a Bayesian framework for solving a class of
problems termed Multi-agent Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MIRL). Compared to
the well-known Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) problem, MIRL is formalized
in the context of a stochastic game rather than a Markov decision process
(MDP). Games bring two primary challenges: First, the concept of optimality,
central to MDPs, loses its meaning and must be replaced with a more general
solution concept, such as the Nash equilibrium. Second, the non-uniqueness of
equilibria means that in MIRL, in addition to multiple reasonable solutions for
a given inversion model, there may be multiple inversion models that are all
equally sensible approaches to solving the problem. We establish a theoretical
foundation for competitive two-agent MIRL problems and propose a Bayesian
optimization algorithm to solve the problem. We focus on the case of two-person
zero-sum stochastic games, developing a generative model for the likelihood of
unknown rewards of agents given observed game play assuming that the two agents
follow a minimax bipolicy. As a numerical illustration, we apply our method in
the context of an abstract soccer game. For the soccer game, we investigate
relationships between the extent of prior information and the quality of
learned rewards. Results suggest that covariance structure is more important
than mean value in reward priors.
