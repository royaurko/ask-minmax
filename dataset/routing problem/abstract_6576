We consider a family of multi-phase Stefan problems for a certain 1-d model
of cell-to-cell adhesion and diffusion, which takes the form of a nonlinear
forward-backward parabolic equation. In each material phase the cell density
stays either high or low, and phases are connected by jumps across an
`unstable' interval. We develop an existence theory for such problems which
allows for the annihilation of phases and the subsequent continuation of
solutions. Stability results for the long-time behaviour of solutions are also
obtained, and, where necessary, the analysis is complemented by numerical
simulations.
