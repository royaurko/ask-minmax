We formulate a momentum-shell renormalization group (RG) procedure that can
be used in theories containing both bosons and fermions with a Fermi surface.
We focus on boson-fermion couplings that are nearly forward-scattering, {\it
i.e.} involving small momentum transfer ($\vec{q} \approx 0$) for the fermions.
Special consideration is given to phase space constraints that result from the
conservation of momentum and the imposition of ultraviolet cutoffs. For
problems where the energy and momentum scale similarly (dynamic exponent $z =
1$), we show that more than one formalism can be used and they give equivalent
results. When the energy and momentum must scale differently ($z \neq 1$), the
procedures available are more limited but a consistent RG scheme can still be
formulated. Our approach is applicable to a variety of problems in condensed
matter physics, such as itinerant-electron magnets and gauge fields interacting
with fermions.
