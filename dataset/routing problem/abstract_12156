More than ten years ago Ikehata discovered two mathematical methods for the
purpose of extracting information about the location and shape of unknown
discontinuity embedded in a known background medium from observation data. The
methods are called the probe and enclosure methods. This paper presents their
past and recent applications to inverse obstacle scattering problems of
acoustic wave.
