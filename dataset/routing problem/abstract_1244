We present an electrochemical route for the integration of graphene with
light sensitive copper-based alloys used in optoelectronic applications.
Graphene grown using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) transferred to glass is
found to be a robust substrate on which photoconductive Cu_{x}S films of 1-2 um
thickness can be deposited. The effect of growth parameters on the morphology
and photoconductivity of Cu_{x}S films is presented. Current-voltage
characterization and photoconductivity decay experiments are performed with
graphene as one contact and silver epoxy as the other.
