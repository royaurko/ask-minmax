In this paper, we propose the mobility of a sink in improved energy efficient
PEGASIS-based protocol (IEEPB) to advance the network lifetime of Wireless
Sensor Networks (WSNs). The multi-head chain, multi-chain concept and the sink
mobility affects largely in enhancing the network lifetime of wireless sensors.
Thus, we recommend Mobile sink improved energy-efficient PEGASIS-based routing
protocol (MIEEPB); a multi-chain model having a sink mobility, to achieve
proficient energy utilization of wireless sensors. As the motorized movement of
mobile sink is steered by petrol or current, there is a need to confine this
movement within boundaries and the trajectory of mobile sink should be fixed.
In our technique, the mobile sink moves along its trajectory and stays for a
sojourn time at sojourn location to guarantee complete data collection. We
develop an algorithm for trajectory of mobile sink. We ultimately perform
wide-ranging experiments to assess the performance of the proposed method. The
results reveal that the proposed way out is nearly optimal and also better than
IEEPB in terms of network lifetime.
