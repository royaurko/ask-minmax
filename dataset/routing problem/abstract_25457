We establish the local uniqueness of steady transonic shock solutions with
spherical symmetry for the three-dimensional full Euler equations. These
transonic shock-fronts are important for understanding transonic shock
phenomena in divergent nozzles. From mathematical point of view, we show the
uniqueness of solutions of a free boundary problem for a multidimensional
quasilinear system of mixed-composite elliptic--hyperbolic type. To this end,
we develop a decomposition of the Euler system which works in a general
Riemannian manifold, a method to study a Venttsel problem of nonclassical
nonlocal elliptic operators, and an iteration mapping which possesses locally a
unique fixed point. The approach reveals an intrinsic structure of the steady
Euler system and subtle interactions of its elliptic and hyperbolic part.
