We deal with a boundary detection problem arising in nondestructive testing
of materials. The problem consists in recovering an unknown portion of the
boundary, where a Robin condition is satisfied, with the use of a Cauchy data
pair collected on the accessible part of the boundary. We combine a
linearization argument with a Tikhonov regularization approach for the local
reconstruction of the unknown defect. Moreover, we discuss the regularization
parameter choice by means of the so called balancing principle and we present
some numerical tests that show the efficiency of our method.
