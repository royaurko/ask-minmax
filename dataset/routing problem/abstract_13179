In this paper we prove that, given a compact four dimensional smooth
Riemannian manifold (M,g) with smooth boundary there exists a metric conformal
to g with constant T-curvature, zero Q-curvature and zero mean curvature under
generic and conformally invariant assumptions. The problem amounts to solving a
fourth order nonlinear elliptic boundary value problem (BVP) with boundary
conditions given by a third-order pseudodifferential operator, and homogeneous
Neumann one. It has a variational structure, but since the corresponding
Euler-Lagrange functional is in general unbounded from below, we look for
saddle points. In order to do this, we use topological arguments and min-max
methods combined with a compactness result for the corresponding BVP.
