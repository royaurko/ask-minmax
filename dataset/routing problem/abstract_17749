Understanding the physical conditions of dark molecular clouds and star
forming regions is an inverse problem subject to complicated chemistry that
varies non-linearly with time and the physical environment. In this paper we
apply a Bayesian approach based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for
solving the non-linear inverse problems encountered in astrochemical modelling.
We use observations for ice and gas species in dark molecular clouds and a time
dependent, gas grain chemical model to infer the values of the physical and
chemical parameters that characterize quiescent regions of molecular clouds. We
show evidence that in high dimensional problems, MCMC algorithms provide a more
efficient and complete solution than more classical strategies. The results of
our MCMC method enable us to derive statistical estimates and uncertainties for
the physical parameters of interest as a result of the Bayesian treatment.
