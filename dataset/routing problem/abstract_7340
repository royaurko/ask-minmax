This paper is a continuation of [{\em Solving Dirichlet boundary-value
problems on curved domains by extensions from subdomains}, SIAM J. Sci. Comput.
34, pp. A497--A519 (2012)]. We generalize this technique of high order
approximation of boundary value problems in curved domains with Dirichlet
boundary data to the case of mixed boundary conditions. The treatment to
Neumann boundary data is novel. We provide numerical results showing that, in
order to obtain optimal high order convergence in this generalized setting, it
is desirable to construct the computational domain by interpolating the
boundary using piecewise linear segment. In this case the distance from the
computational domain to the exact boundary is only $O(h^2)$.
