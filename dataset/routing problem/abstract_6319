The multivariate analogue of Dalamber's equation in the space of generalized
functions is considered. The method of generalized functions for the building
of solutions of nonstationary boundary value problems for wave equations in
spaces of different dimensions is elaborated. Dynamic analogues of Green and
Gauss formulas for solutions of wave equation in the space of generalized
functions are built. Their regular integral representations and singular
boundary integral equations for solving the nonstationary problems are
constructed for the spaces of the dimensions 1,2,3. The method of obtaining of
conditions on fronts of shock waves is stated.
