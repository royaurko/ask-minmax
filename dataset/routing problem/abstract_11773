This paper studies the 1D pressureless turbulence (the Burgers equation). It
shows that reliable numerics in this problem is very easy to produce if one
properly discretizes the Burgers equation. The numerics it presents confirms
the 7/2 power law proposed for probability of observing large negative velocity
gradients in this problem. It also suggests that the entire probability
function for the velocity gradients could be universal, perhaps in some
approximate sense. In particular, the probability that the velocity gradient is
negative appears to be $p \approx 0.21 \pm 0.01$ irrespective of the details of
the random force. Finally, I speculate that the theory initially proposed by
Polyakov, with a particular value of the "anomaly" parameter, may indeed be
exact, at least as far as velocity gradients are concerned.
