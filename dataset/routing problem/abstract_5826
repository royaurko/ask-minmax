Because of an old quasar APM 08279+5255 at $z=3.91$, some dark energy models
face the challenge of the cosmic age problem. It has been shown by Wei and
Zhang [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 76}, 063003 (2007)] that the holographic dark energy
model is also troubled with such a cosmic age problem. In order to accommodate
this old quasar and solve the age problem, we propose in this Letter to
consider the interacting holographic dark energy in a non-flat universe. We
show that the cosmic age problem can be eliminated when the interaction and
spatial curvature are both involved in the holographic dark energy model.
