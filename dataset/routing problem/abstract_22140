In this paper we discuss energy conservation issues related to the numerical
solution of the nonlinear wave equation, when a Fourier expansion is considered
for the space discretization. The obtained semi-discrete problem is then solved
in time by means of energy-conserving Runge-Kutta methods in the HBVMs class.
