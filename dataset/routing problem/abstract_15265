We investigate unification problems related to the Cipher Block Chaining
(CBC) mode of encryption. We first model chaining in terms of a simple,
convergent, rewrite system over a signature with two disjoint sorts: list and
element. By interpreting a particular symbol of this signature suitably, the
rewrite system can model several practical situations of interest. An inference
procedure is presented for deciding the unification problem modulo this rewrite
system. The procedure is modular in the following sense: any given problem is
handled by a system of `list-inferences', and the set of equations thus derived
between the element-terms of the problem is then handed over to any
(`black-box') procedure which is complete for solving these element-equations.
An example of application of this unification procedure is given, as attack
detection on a Needham-Schroeder like protocol, employing the CBC encryption
mode based on the associative-commutative (AC) operator XOR. The 2-sorted
convergent rewrite system is then extended into one that fully captures a block
chaining encryption-decryption mode at an abstract level, using no AC-symbols;
and unification modulo this extended system is also shown to be decidable.
