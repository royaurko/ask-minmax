We obtain bounds on the distribution of the maximum of a continuous
martingale with fixed marginals at finitely many intermediate times. The bounds
are sharp and attained by a solution to n-marginal Skorokhod embedding problem
in Obloj and Spoida (2013). It follows that their embedding maximises the
maximum among all other embeddings. Our motivating problem is superhedging
lookback options under volatility uncertainty for an investor allowed to
dynamically trade the underlying asset and statically trade European call
options for all possible strikes and finitely-many maturities. We derive a
pathwise inequality which induces the cheapest superhedging value, which
extends the two-marginals pathwise inequality of Brown, Hobson and Rogers
(1998). This inequality, proved by elementary arguments, is obtained by
following the stochastic control approach of Galichon, Henry-Labordere and
Touzi (2011).
