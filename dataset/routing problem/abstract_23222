We propose a K\"ahler potential in supergravity which successfully
accommodates chaotic inflation. This model can have a large gravitino mass
without giving a large mass to squarks and sleptons, and thus is free from both
the gravitino problem and entropy crisis. In this model baryogenesis takes
place naturally, identifying the inflaton with a right-handed sneutrino with
its mass $M \simeq 10^{13}$GeV, which is consistent with the COBE data and the
Mikheyev--Smirnov--Wolfenstein solution to the solar neutrino problem. The
model can also accommodate the matter content appropriate for the mixed dark
matter scenario.
