In this work we provide a method for building up a strictly positive
supersolution for the steady state of a degenerated logistic equation type,
i.e., when the weight function vanishes on the boundary of the domain. This
degenerated system is related in obtaining the so-called large solutions.
Previously, this problem was handled as the limit case of non degenerated
approaching problems. Our method can be adapted straightforwardly to
degenerated boundary value problems.
