In this paper we discuss several results about the structure of the
configuration space of two-dimensional tensegrities with a small number of
points. We briefly describe the technique of surgeries that is used to find
geometric conditions for tensegrities. Further we introduce a new surgery for
three-dimensional tensegrities. Within this paper we formulate additional open
problems related to the stratification space of tensegrities.
