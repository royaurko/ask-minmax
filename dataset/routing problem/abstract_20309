We show how to extend some holomorphic bundles with fifer C^2 and base an
open set in C, to bundles on the Riemann Sphere, by an extremely simple
technique. In particular, it applies to examples of non-Stein bundles
constructed by Skoda and Demailly. It gives an example on C, with polynomial
transition automorphisms.
