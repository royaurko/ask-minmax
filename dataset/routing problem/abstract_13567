The paper is concerned with solution in H\"older spaces of the Cauchy problem
for linear and semi-linear backward stochastic partial differential equations
(BSPDEs) of super-parabolic type. The pair of unknown functional variables are
viewed as deterministic time-space functionals, but take values in Banach
spaces of random (vector) variables or processes. We define suitable functional
H\"older spaces for them and give some inequalities among these H\"older norms.
The existence, uniqueness as well as the regularity of solutions are proved for
BSPDEs, which contain new assertions even on deterministic PDEs.
