The Dirichlet problem for complex Monge-Amp\'ere equations with continuous
data is considered. In particular, a notion of viscosity solutions is
introduced; a comparison principle and a solvability theorem are proved; the
equivalence between viscosity and pluripotential solutions is established; and
an ABP-type of $L^{\infty}$-estimate is achieved.
