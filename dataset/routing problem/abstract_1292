We prescribe a novel approach for continuously tailoring the local phase of
the nonlinear polarizability which can lead to an arbitrary phase profile for
harmonic generations. The introduced phase of the nonlinear polarizability is
inherently a geometric Berry phase arising from the spin rotation coupling of
light in the nonlinear regime. This approach provides new routes for
controlling the optical nonlinear processes.
