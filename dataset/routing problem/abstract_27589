Let $k$ be a field with char $k \not= 2$, $X$ be an affine surface defined by
the equation $z^2=P(x)Y^2+Q(x)$ where $P(x), Q(x) \in k[x]$ are separable
polynomials. We will investigate the rationality problem of $X$ in terms of the
polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$. The necessary and sufficient condition is $s
\leq 3$ with minor exceptions, where $s=s_1+s_2+s_3+s_4$, $s_1$ (resp. $s_2$,
resp. $s_3$) being the number of $c \in \overline{k}$ such that $P(c)=0$ and
$Q(c) \not\in k(c)^2$ (resp. $Q(c)=0$ and $P(c) \not\in k(c)^2$, resp.
$P(c)=Q(c)=0$ and $-\frac{Q}{P}(c) \not\in k(c)^2$). $s_4=0$ or $1$ according
to the behavior at $x=\infty$. $X$ is a conic bundle over $\mathbb{P}_k^1$,
whose rationality was studied by Iskovskikh. Iskovskikh formulated his results
in geometric language. This paper aims to give an algebraic counterpart.
