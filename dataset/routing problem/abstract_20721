Recent studies by the NPLQCD collaboration of hadronic interactions using
lattice QCD are reviewed, with an emphasis on a recent calculation of
meson-baryon scattering lengths. Ongoing high-statistics calculations of baryon
interactions are also reviewed. In particular, new insights into the
signal/noise problems that plague correlation functions involving baryons are
discussed.
