Internet of Things (IoT) will connect billions of sensors deployed around the
world together. This will create an ideal opportunity to build a
sensing-as-a-service platform. Due to large number of sensor deployments, there
would be number of sensors that can be used to sense and collect similar
information. Further, due to advances in sensor hardware technology, new
methods and measurements will be introduced continuously. In the IoT paradigm,
selecting the most appropriate sensors which can provide relevant sensor data
to address the problems at hand among billions of possibilities would be a
challenge for both technical and non-technical users. In this paper, we propose
the Context Awareness for Internet of Things (CA4IOT) architecture to help
users by automating the task of selecting the sensors according to the
problems/tasks at hand. We focus on automated configuration of filtering,
fusion and reasoning mechanisms that can be applied to the collected sensor
data streams using selected sensors. Our objective is to allow the users to
submit their problems, so our proposed architecture understands them and
produces more comprehensive and meaningful information than the raw sensor data
streams generated by individual sensors.
