Here, we introduce a new class of computer which does not use any circuit or
logic gate. In fact, no program needs to be written: it learns by itself and
writes its own program to solve a problem. Godels incompleteness argument is
explored here to devise an engine where an astronomically large number of
IfThen arguments are allowed to grow by self assembly, based on the basic set
of arguments written in the system, thus, we explore the beyond Turing path of
computing but following a fundamentally different route adopted in the last
half a century old non Turing adventures. Our hardware is a multilayered seed
structure. If we open the largest seed, which is the final hardware, we find
several computing seed structures inside, if we take any of them and open,
there are several computing seeds inside. We design and synthesize the smallest
seed, the entire multilayered architecture grows by itself. The electromagnetic
resonance band of each seed looks similar, but the seeds of any layer shares a
common region in its resonance band with inner and upper layer, hence a chain
of resonance bands is formed (frequency fractal) connecting the smallest to the
largest seed (hence the name invincible rhythm or Ajeya Chhandam in Sanskrit).
