In this paper we will prove that the vorticity belongs to $L^{\infty}(0, T;
L^2(R^3))$ for the Cauchy problem of 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation,
then the exis- tence of a global smooth solution is obtained. Our approach is
to construct a set of auxiliary problems to approximate the original one for
vorticity equation.
