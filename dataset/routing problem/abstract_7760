We show that spontaneous breaking of discrete or continuous symmetries does
not necessarily imply either symmetry restoration or the thermal production of
defects at high temperature (at least up to $T \sim M_{Planck}$). This may
imply that there is no domain wall problem. As an example we show how this
applies to the Peccei-Quinn scenario.
