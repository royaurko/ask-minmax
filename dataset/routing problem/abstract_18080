Massive gravity theories have been developed as viable IR modifications of
gravity motivated by dark energy and the problem of the cosmological constant.
On the other hand, modified gravity and modified dark matter theories were
developed with the aim of solving the problems of standard cold dark matter at
galactic scales. Here we propose to adapt the framework of ghost-free massive
bigravity theories to reformulate the problem of dark matter at galactic
scales. We investigate a promising alternative to dark matter called dipolar
dark matter (DDM) in which two different species of dark matter are separately
coupled to the two metrics of bigravity and are linked together by an internal
vector field. We show that this model successfully reproduces the phenomenology
of dark matter at galactic scales (i.e. MOND) as a result of a mechanism of
gravitational polarisation. The model is safe in the gravitational sector, but
because the two types of dark matter interact through the vector field, a
ghostly degree of freedom in the decoupling limit is reintroduced in the dark
matter sector. Crucial questions to address in future work is whether the
polarisation mechanism can be realized in absence of ghosts, and what are the
cosmological implications of the model.
