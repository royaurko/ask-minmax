d-hop dominating set problem was introduced for cluster formation in wireless
ad-hoc networks and is proved to be NP-complete. Dominating set problem for
directed graph with indegree of at most 1 can be solved polynomially. In this
article we perform an analysis of d-hop dominating set problem for directed
graph with indegree 1. We show that the problem can be solved polynomially by
exploiting certain properties of the graph under consideration.
