In this paper, we consider estimating sparse inverse covariance of a Gaussian
graphical model whose conditional independence is assumed to be partially
known. Similarly as in [5], we formulate it as an $l_1$-norm penalized maximum
likelihood estimation problem. Further, we propose an algorithm framework, and
develop two first-order methods, that is, the adaptive spectral projected
gradient (ASPG) method and the adaptive Nesterov's smooth (ANS) method, for
solving this estimation problem. Finally, we compare the performance of these
two methods on a set of randomly generated instances. Our computational results
demonstrate that both methods are able to solve problems of size at least a
thousand and number of constraints of nearly a half million within a reasonable
amount of time, and the ASPG method generally outperforms the ANS method.
