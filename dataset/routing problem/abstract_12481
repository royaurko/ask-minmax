Scalar-tensor theories are studied in the context of cosmological evolution,
where the expansion history of the Universe is reconstructed. It is considered
quintessence/phantom models, where inflation and cosmic acceleration are
reproduced. Also, the non-minimally coupling regime between the scalar field
and the Ricci scalar is studied and cosmological solutions are obtained. The
Chamaleon mechanism is shown as a solution of the local gravity tests problems
presented in this kind of theories.
