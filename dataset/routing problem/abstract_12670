We study the Stokes and Poisson problem in the context of variable exponent
spaces. We prove the existence of strong and weak solutions for bounded domains
with C^{1,1} boundary with inhomogenous boundary values. The result is based on
generalizations of the classical theories of Calderon-Zygmund and
Agmon-Douglis-Nirenberg to variable exponent spaces.
