Nurse rostering is a complex scheduling problem that affects hospital
personnel on a daily basis all over the world. This paper presents a new
component-based approach with adaptive perturbations, for a nurse scheduling
problem arising at a major UK hospital. The main idea behind this technique is
to decompose a schedule into its components (i.e. the allocated shift pattern
of each nurse), and then mimic a natural evolutionary process on these
components to iteratively deliver better schedules. The worthiness of all
components in the schedule has to be continuously demonstrated in order for
them to remain there. This demonstration employs a dynamic evaluation function
which evaluates how well each component contributes towards the final
objective. Two perturbation steps are then applied: the first perturbation
eliminates a number of components that are deemed not worthy to stay in the
current schedule; the second perturbation may also throw out, with a low level
of probability, some worthy components. The eliminated components are
replenished with new ones using a set of constructive heuristics using local
optimality criteria. Computational results using 52 data instances demonstrate
the applicability of the proposed approach in solving real-world problems.
