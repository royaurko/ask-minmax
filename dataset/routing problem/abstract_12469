We study large deviations for some non-local parabolic type equations. We
show that, under some assumptions on the non-local term, problems defined in a
bounded domain converge with an exponential rate to the solution of the problem
defined in the whole space. We compute this rate in different examples, with
different kernels defining the non-local term, and it turns out that the
estimate of convergence depends strongly on the decay at infinity of that
kernel.
