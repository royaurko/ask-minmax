We show that a temperature gradient induces an ac electric current in
multiferroic insulators when the sample is embedded in a circuit. We also show
that a thermal gradient can be used to move magnetic skyrmions in insulating
chiral magnets: the induced magnon flow from the hot to the cold region drives
the skyrmions in the opposite direction via a magnonic spin transfer torque.
Both results are combined to compute the effect of skyrmion motion on the ac
current generation and demonstrate that skyrmions in insulators are a promising
route for spin caloritronics applications.
