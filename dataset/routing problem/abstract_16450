The NP-complete Permutation Pattern Matching problem asks whether a
permutation P (the pattern) can be matched into a permutation T (the text). A
matching is an order-preserving embedding of P into T. In the Generalized
Permutation Pattern Matching problem one can additionally enforce that certain
adjacent elements in the pattern must be mapped to adjacent elements in the
text. This paper studies the parameterized complexity of this more general
problem. We show W[1]-completeness with respect to the length of the pattern P.
Under standard complexity theoretic assumptions this implies that no
fixed-parameter tractable algorithm can be found for any parameter depending
solely on P.
