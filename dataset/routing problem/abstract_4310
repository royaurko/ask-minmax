We give a construction that connects the Cauchy problem for Liouville
elliptic equation with a certain initial value problem for mean curvature one
surfaces in hyperbolic 3-space H3, and solve both of them. We construct the
only mean curvature one surface in H3 that passes through a given curve with
given unit normal along it, and provide diverse applications. In particular,
topics like period problems, symmetries, finite total curvature, planar
geodesics, rigidity, etc. of surfaces are treated.
