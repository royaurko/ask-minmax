We consider the problem of private computation of approximate Heavy Hitters.
Alice and Bob each hold a vector and, in the vector sum, they want to find the
B largest values along with their indices. While the exact problem requires
linear communication, protocols in the literature solve this problem
approximately using polynomial computation time, polylogarithmic communication,
and constantly many rounds. We show how to solve the problem privately with
comparable cost, in the sense that nothing is learned by Alice and Bob beyond
what is implied by their input, the ideal top-B output, and goodness of
approximation (equivalently, the Euclidean norm of the vector sum). We give
lower bounds showing that the Euclidean norm must leak by any efficient
algorithm.
