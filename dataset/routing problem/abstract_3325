The article is devoted to investigation of the classes of functions belonging
to the gaps between classes $P_{n+1}(I)$ and $P_{n}(I)$ of matrix monotone
functions for full matrix algebras of successive dimensions. In this paper we
address the problem of characterizing polynomials belonging to the gaps
$P_{n}(I) \setminus P_{n+1}(I)$ for bounded intervals $I$. We show that
solution of this problem is closely linked to solution of truncated moment
problems, Hankel matrices and Hankel extensions. Namely, we show that using the
solutions to truncated moment problems we can construct continuum many
polynomials in the gaps. We also provide via several examples some first
insights into the further problem of description of polynomials in the gaps
that are not coming from the truncated moment problem. Also, in this article,
we deepen further in another way into the structure of the classes of matrix
monotone functions and of the gaps between them by considering the problem of
position in the gaps of certain interesting subclasses of matrix monotone
functions that appeared in connection to interpolation of spaces and in a prove
of the L{\"o}wner theorem on integral representation of operator monotone
functions.
