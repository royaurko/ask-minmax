We consider the inverse Landau-Zener problem which consists in finding the
energy-sweep functions W(t)=E1(t)-E2(t) resulting in the required time
dependences of the level populations for a two-level system crossing the
resonance one or more times during the sweep. We find sweep functions of
particular forms that let manipulate the system in a required way, including
complete switching from the state 1 to the state 2 and preparing the system at
the exact ground and excited states at resonance.
