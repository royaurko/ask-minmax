Single impurity problem in iron-pnictide superconductors is investigated by
solving Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equation in the five-orbital model, which
enables us to distinguish s$_{+-}$ and s$_{++}$ superconducting states. We
construct a five-orbital model suitable to BdG analysis. This model reproduces
the results of random phase approximation in the uniform case. Using this
model, we study the local density of states around a non-magnetic impurity and
discuss the bound-state peak structure, which can be used for distinguishing
s$_{+-}$ and s$_{++}$ states. A bound state with nearly zero-energy is found
for the impurity potential $I\sim 1.0$ eV, while the bound state peaks stick to
the gap edge in the unitary limit. Novel multiple peak structure originated
from the multi-orbital nature of the iron pnictides is also found.
