In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions of the covariance kernel (i.e., the functional principal
components) from sparse and irregularly observed longitudinal data. We approach
this problem through a maximum likelihood method assuming that the covariance
kernel is smooth and finite dimensional. We exploit the smoothness of the
eigenfunctions to reduce dimensionality by restricting them to a lower
dimensional space of smooth functions. The estimation scheme is developed based
on a Newton-Raphson procedure using the fact that the basis coefficients
representing the eigenfunctions lie on a Stiefel manifold. We also address the
selection of the right number of basis functions, as well as that of the
dimension of the covariance kernel by a second order approximation to the
leave-one-curve-out cross-validation score that is computationally very
efficient. The effectiveness of our procedure is demonstrated by simulation
studies and an application to a CD4 counts data set. In the simulation studies,
our method performs well on both estimation and model selection. It also
outperforms two existing approaches: one based on a local polynomial smoothing
of the empirical covariances, and another using an EM algorithm.
