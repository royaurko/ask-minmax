A redundant generating function is a generating function having terms which
are not part of the solution of the original problem. We use redundant
generating functions to study two path problems. In the first application we
explain a surprising occurrence of Catalan numbers in counting paths that stay
below the line y = 2x. In the second application we prove a conjecture of
Niederhausen and Sullivan.
