Correlated proportions arise in longitudinal (panel) studies. A typical
example is the ``opinion swing'' problem: ``Has the proportion of people
favoring a politician changed after his recent speech to the nation on TV?''.
Since the same group of individuals is interviewed before and after the speech,
the two proportions are correlated. A natural null hypothesis to be tested is
whether the corresponding population proportions are equal. A standard Bayesian
approach to this problem has already been considered in the literature, based
on a Dirichlet prior for the cell-probabilities of the underlying two-by-two
table under the alternative hypothesis, together with an induced prior under
the null. In lack of specific prior information, a diffuse (e.g. uniform)
distribution may be used. We claim that this approach is not satisfactory,
since in a testing problem one should make sure that the prior under the
alternative be adequately centered around the region specified by the null, in
order to obtain a fair comparison between the two hypotheses. Following an
intrinsic prior methodology, we develop two strategies for the construction of
a collection of objective priors increasingly peaked around the null. We
provide a simple interpretation of their structure in terms of weighted
imaginary sample scenarios. We illustrate our method by means of three
examples, carrying out sensitivity analysis and providing comparison with
existing results.
