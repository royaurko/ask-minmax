Large scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is considered one of
promising technologies for realizing next-generation wireless communication
system (5G) to increasing the degrees of freedom in space and enhancing the
link reliability while considerably reducing the transmit power. However, large
scale MIMO system design also poses a big challenge to traditional
one-dimensional channel estimation techniques due to high complexity and curse
of dimensionality problems which are caused by long delay spread as well as
large number antenna. Since large scale MIMO channels often exhibit sparse
or/and cluster-sparse structure, in this paper, we propose a simple affine
combination of adaptive sparse channel estimation method for reducing
complexity and exploiting channel sparsity in the large scale MIMO system.
First, problem formulation and standard affine combination of adaptive least
mean square (LMS) algorithm are introduced. Then we proposed an effective
affine combination method with two sparse LMS filters and designed an
approximate optimum affine combiner according to stochastic gradient search
method as well. Later, to validate the proposed algorithm for estimating large
scale MIMO channel, computer simulations are provided to confirm effectiveness
of the proposed algorithm which can achieve better estimation performance than
the conventional one as well as traditional method.
