We show in a rigorous way that Crum's result on equal eigenvalue spectrum of
Sturm-Liouville problems can be obtained iteratively by successive Darboux
transformations. It can be shown that all neighbouring Darboux-transformed
potentials of higher order, u_{k} and u_{k+1}, satisfy the condition of shape
invariance provided the original potential u does. We use this result to proof
that under the condition of shape invariance the n-th iteration of the original
Sturm-Liouville problem defined through shape invariance is equal to the n-th
Crum transformation
