A construction of relativistic wave equations on the homogeneous spaces of
the Poincar\'{e} group is given for arbitrary spin chains. Parametrizations of
the field functions and harmonic analysis on the homogeneous spaces are
studied. It is shown that a direct product of Minkowski spacetime and
two-dimensional complex sphere is the most suitable homogeneous space for the
physical applications. The Lagrangian formalism and field equations on the
Poincar\'{e} and Lorentz groups are considered. A boundary value problem for
the relativistically invariant system is defined. General solutions of this
problem are expressed via an expansion in hyperspherical functions defined on
the complex two-sphere.
