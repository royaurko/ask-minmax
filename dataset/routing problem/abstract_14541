We introduce the novel problem of identifying the photographer behind the
photograph. To explore the feasibility of current computer vision techniques to
address the problem, we created a new publicly downloadable dataset of over
100,000 images taken by 25 well-known photographers. Using this dataset, we
examined the effectiveness of a variety of features (low and high-level,
including CNN features) at classifying the photographs. Our quantitative and
qualitative results illustrate that high-level features significantly
outperform low-level features at this task. We also provide additional
qualitative results demonstrating how these learned models can be used to draw
interesting conclusions about what specific photographers tend to shoot.
