In limited data computerized tomography, the 2D or 3D problem can be reduced
to a family of 1D problems using the differentiated backprojection (DBP)
method. Each 1D problem consists of recovering a compactly supported function
$f \in L^2(\mathcal F)$, where $\mathcal F$ is a finite interval, from its
partial Hilbert transform data. When the Hilbert transform is measured on a
finite interval $\mathcal G$ that only overlaps but does not cover $\mathcal F$
this inversion problem is known to be severely ill-posed [1].
  In this paper, we study the reconstruction of $f$ restricted to the overlap
region $\mathcal F \cap \mathcal G$. We show that with this restriction and by
assuming prior knowledge on the $L^2$ norm or on the variation of $f$, better
stability with H\"older continuity (typical for mildly ill-posed problems) can
be obtained.
