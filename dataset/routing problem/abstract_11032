Within the Grassmannian $U(2N) / U(N) \times U(N)$ non-linear $\sigma $ model
representation of localization one can study the low energy dynamics of both
the free and interacting electron gas. We study the cross-over between these
two fundamentally different physical problems. We show how the topological
arguments for the exact quantization of the Hall conductance are extended to
include the Coulomb interaction problem. We discuss dynamical scaling and make
contact with the theory of variable range hopping.
