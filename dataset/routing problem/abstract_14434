Sphere fitting is a common problem in almost all science and engineering
disciplines. Most of methods available are iterative in behavior. This involves
fitting of the parameters in a least square sense or in a geometric sense. Here
we extend the methods of Thomas Chan and Landau who fitted the 2D data using
circle. This work closely resemble their work in redefining the error estimate
and solving the sphere fitting problem exactly. The solutions for center and
radius of the sphere can be found exactly and the equations can be hard coded
for high performance. We have also shown some comparison with other popular
methods and how this method behaves.
