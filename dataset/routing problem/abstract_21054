In this Note, we present a Calder\'on-type uniqueness theorem on the Cauchy
problem of stochastic partial differential equations. To this aim, we introduce
the concept of stochastic pseudo-differential operators, and establish their
boundedness and other fundamental properties. The proof of our uniqueness
theorem is based on a new Carleman-type estimate.
