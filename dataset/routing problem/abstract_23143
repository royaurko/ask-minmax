We study thick brane world models as Z_2-symmetric domain walls supported by
a scalar field with an arbitrary potential V(\phi) in 5D general relativity.
Under the global regularity requirement, such configurations (i) have always an
AdS asymptotic far from the brane, (ii) are only possible if V(\phi) has an
alternating sign and (iii) V(\phi) should satisfy a certain fine-tuning type
equality. Thus a thick brane with any admissible V(\phi) is a regularized
version of the RS2 brane immersed in the AdS_5 bulk. The thin brane limit is
realized in a universal manner by including an arbitrary thick brane model in a
one-parameter family, where the parameter "a" is associated with brane
thickness; the asymptotic value of V(\phi) (related to \Lambda_5, the effective
cosmological constant) remains a-independent. The problem of ordinary matter
confinement on the brane is discussed for a test scalar field. Its
stress-energy tensor is found to diverge at the AdS horizon for both thin and
thick branes, making a serious problem for this class of brane world models.
