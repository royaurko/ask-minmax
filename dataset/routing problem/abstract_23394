As is well known, electroweak breaking in the MSSM requires substantial
fine-tuning, mainly due to the smallness of the tree-level Higgs quartic
coupling, lambda_tree. Hence the fine tuning is efficiently reduced in
supersymmetric models with larger lambda_tree, as happens naturally when the
breaking of SUSY occurs at a low scale (not far from the TeV). We show, in
general and with specific examples, that a dramatic improvement of the fine
tuning (so that there is virtually no fine-tuning) is indeed a very common
feature of these scenarios for wide ranges of tan(beta) and the Higgs mass
(which can be as large as several hundred GeV if desired, but this is not
necessary). The supersymmetric flavour problems are also drastically improved
due to the absence of RG cross-talk between soft mass parameters.
