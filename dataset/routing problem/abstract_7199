We investigate a class of quasi-linear nonlocal problems, including as a
particular case semi-linear problems involving the fractional Laplacian and
arising in the framework of continuum mechanics, phase transition phenomena,
population dynamics and game theory. Under different growth assumptions on the
reaction term, we obtain various existence as well as finite multiplicity
results by means of variational and topological methods and, in particular,
arguments from Morse theory.
