The strong maximum principle is a remarkable characterization of parabolic
equations, which is expected to be partly inherited by fractional diffusion
equations. Based on the corresponding weak maximum principle, in this paper we
establish a strong maximum principle for time-fractional diffusion equations
with Caputo derivatives, which is slightly weaker than that for the parabolic
case. As a direct application, we give a uniqueness result for a related
inverse source problem on the determination of the temporal component of the
inhomogeneous term.
