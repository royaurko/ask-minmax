New index transforms are investigated, which contain as the kernel products
of the Bessel and modified Bessel functions. Mapping properties and
invertibility in Lebesgue spaces are studied for these operators. Relationships
with the Kontorovich-Lebedev and Fourier cosine transforms are established.
Inversion theorems are proved. As an application, a solution of the initial
value problem for the fourth order partial differential equation, involving the
Laplacian is presented.
