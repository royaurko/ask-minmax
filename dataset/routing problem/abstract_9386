We consider semi-classical black holes and related re-scalings with N
massless fields. For a given semi-classical solution of an N = 1 universe, we
can find other solution of a large N universe by the re-scaling. After the
re-scaling, any curvature quantity takes a sufficiently small value without
changing its causal structure. Via the re-scaling, we argue that black hole
complementarity for semi-classical black holes cannot provide a fundamental
resolution of the information loss problem, and the violation of black hole
complementarity requires sufficiently reasonable amounts of N. Such N might be
realized from some string inspired models. Finally, we claim that any
fundamental resolution of the information loss problem should resolve the
problem of the singularity.
