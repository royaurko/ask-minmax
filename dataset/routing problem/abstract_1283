A multiplierless pruned approximate 8-point discrete cosine transform (DCT)
requiring only 10 additions is introduced. The proposed algorithm was assessed
in image and video compression, showing competitive performance with
state-of-the-art methods. Digital implementation in 45 nm CMOS technology up to
place-and-route level indicates clock speed of 255 MHz at a 1.1 V supply. The
8x8 block rate is 31.875 MHz.The DCT approximation was embedded into HEVC
reference software; resulting video frames, at up to 327 Hz for 8-bit RGB HEVC,
presented negligible image degradation.
