The Dirichlet boundary value problem for the Stokes operator with $L^p$ data
in any dimension on domains with conical singularity (not necessary a Lipschitz
graph) is considered. We establish the solvability of the problem for all $p\in
(2-\varepsilon,\infty]$ and also its solvability in $C(\overline{D})$ for the
data in $C(\partial D)$
