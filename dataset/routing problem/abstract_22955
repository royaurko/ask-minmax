We present a family of spatio-temporal theories suitable for continuous
spatial change in general, and for continuous motion of spatial scenes in
particular. The family is obtained by spatio-temporalising the well-known
ALC(D) family of Description Logics (DLs) with a concrete domain D, as follows,
where TCSPs denotes "Temporal Constraint Satisfaction Problems", a well-known
constraint-based framework:
 (1) temporalisation of the roles, so that they consist of TCSP constraints
(specifically, of an adaptation of TCSP constraints to interval variables); and
 (2) spatialisation of the concrete domain D: the concrete domain is now $D_x$,
and is generated by a spatial Relation Algebra (RA) $x$, in the style of the
Region-Connection Calculus RCC8.
  We assume durative truth (i.e., holding during a durative interval). We also
assume the homogeneity property (if a truth holds during a given interval, it
holds during all of its subintervals). Among other things, these assumptions
raise the "conflicting" problem of overlapping truths, which the work solves
with the use of a specific partition of the 13 atomic relations of Allen's
interval algebra.
