Cloud computing is a revolutionary computing paradigm which enables flexible,
on-demand and low-cost usage of computing resources. However, those advantages,
ironically, are the causes of security and privacy problems, which emerge
because the data owned by different users are stored in some cloud servers
instead of under their own control. To deal with security problems, various
schemes based on the Attribute- Based Encryption (ABE) have been proposed
recently. However, the privacy problem of cloud computing is yet to be solved.
This paper presents an anonymous privilege control scheme AnonyControl to
address the user and data privacy problem in a cloud. By using multiple
contributorities in cloud computing system, our proposed scheme achieves anonymous
cloud data access, finegrained privilege control, and more importantly,
tolerance to up to (N -2) contributority compromise. Our security and performance
analysis show that AnonyControl is both secure and efficient for cloud
computing environment.
