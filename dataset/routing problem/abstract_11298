The supersymmetric flavor problem is elegantly solved by the decoupling
scenario, where the first-two generation sfermions are much heavier than the
third generation ones. However, such a mass spectrum is not stable against
renormalization group evolution and causes extreme fine-tuning of the
electroweak symmetry breaking. We present a mechanism which stabilizes the mass
spectrum with such a large splitting, by introducing extra vector-like chiral
multiplets of masses comparable to the first-two generation sfermions. The
explicit models are constructed in a framework of the anomalous U(1)
SUSY-breaking model.
