In this paper, a method of local perturbations, previously successfully
applied to decompose the problem of elasticity in the system of connected thin
rods and beams [Kolpakov and Andrianov, 2013], is used to study the asymptotic
behaviour of the elasticity problem in connected thin plates. A complete
decomposition of the problem, i.e. the separation of the original problem in to
the two-dimensional problem of the theory of plates and local problems is
proposed. The local problems describe the three-dimensional stress-strain state
in the connected plates and can be solved by numerical methods.
