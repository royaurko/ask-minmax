The existence and uniqueness in H\"older spaces of solutions of the Cauchy
problem to parabolic integro-differential equation of the order
{\alpha}\in(0,2) is investigated. The principal part of the operator has kernel
m(t,x,y)/|y|^{d+{\alpha}} with a bounded nondegenerate m, H\"older in x and
measurable in y. The result is applied to prove the uniqueness of the
corresponding martingale problem.
