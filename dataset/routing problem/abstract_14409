We consider a singularly perturbed Dirichlet spectral problem for an elliptic
operator of second order. The coefficients of the operator are assumed to be
locally periodic and oscillating in the scale $\varepsilon$. We describe the
asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions to the problem,
as the parameter $\varepsilon$ tends to zero, under structural assumptions on
the potential. More precisely, we assume that the local average of the
potential has a unique global minimum point in the interior of the domain and
its Hessian is non-degenerate at this point.
