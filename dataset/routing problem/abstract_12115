We study and develop a robust control framework for malware filtering and
network security. We investigate the malware filtering problem by capturing the
tradeoff between increased security on one hand and continued usability of the
network on the other. We analyze the problem using a linear control system
model with a quadratic cost structure and develop algorithms based on H
infinity-optimal control theory. A dynamic feedback filter is derived and shown
via numerical analysis to be an improvement over various heuristic approaches
to malware filtering. The results are verified and demonstrated with packet
level simulations on the Ns-2 network simulator.
