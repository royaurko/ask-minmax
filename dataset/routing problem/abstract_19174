Recent work by Rauhut and Ward developed a notion of weighted sparsity and a
corresponding notion of Restricted Isometry Property for the space of weighted
sparse signals. Using these notions, we pose a best weighted sparse
approximation problem, i.e. we seek structured sparse solutions to
underdetermined systems of linear equations. Many computationally efficient
greedy algorithms have been developed to solve the problem of best $s$-sparse
approximation. The design of all of these algorithms employ a similar template
of exploiting the RIP and computing projections onto the space of sparse
vectors. We present an extension of the Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT)
algorithm to solve the weighted sparse approximation problem. This IHT
extension employs a weighted analogue of the template employed by all greedy
sparse approximation algorithms. Theoretical guarantees are presented and much
of the original analysis remains unchanged and extends quite naturally.
However, not all the theoretical analysis extends. To this end, we identify and
discuss the barrier to extension. Much like IHT, our IHT extension requires
computing a projection onto a non-convex space. However unlike IHT and other
greedy methods which deal with the classical notion of sparsity, no simple
method is known for computing projections onto these weighted sparse spaces.
Therefore we employ a surrogate for the projection and analyze its empirical
performance.
