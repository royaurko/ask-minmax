We prove that if for relative equilibrium solutions of a generalisation of
the $n$-body problem of celestial mechanics the masses and rotation are given,
then the minimum distance between the point masses of such a relative
equilibrium has a universal lower bound that is not equal to zero. We
furthermore prove that the set of such relative equilibria is compact.
