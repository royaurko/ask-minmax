We analytically study the photorefractive Gunn effect in n-GaAs subjected to
two external laser beams which form a moving interference pattern (MIP) in the
semiconductor. When the intensity of the spatially independent part of the MIP,
denoted by $I_0$, is small, the system has a periodic domain train (PDT),
consistent with the results of linear stability analysis. When $I_0$ is large,
the space-charge field induced by the MIP will compete with the PDT and result
in complex dynamics, including driven chaos via quasiperiodic route.
