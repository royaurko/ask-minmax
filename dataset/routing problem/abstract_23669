The following questions are often encountered in system and control theory.
Given an algebraic model of a physical process, which variables can be, in
theory, deduced from the input-output behavior of an experiment? How many of
the remaining variables should we assume to be known in order to determine all
the others? These questions are parts of the \emph{local algebraic
observability} problem which is concerned with the existence of a non trivial
Lie subalgebra of the symmetries of the model letting the inputs and the
outputs invariant. We present a \emph{probabilistic seminumerical} algorithm
that proposes a solution to this problem in \emph{polynomial time}. A bound for
the necessary number of arithmetic operations on the rational field is
presented. This bound is polynomial in the \emph{complexity of evaluation} of
the model and in the number of variables. Furthermore, we show that the
\emph{size} of the integers involved in the computations is polynomial in the
number of variables and in the degree of the differential system. Last, we
estimate the probability of success of our algorithm and we present some
benchmarks from our Maple implementation.
