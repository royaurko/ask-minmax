We consider the single channel Kondo problem with the Kondo coupling between
a spin $S$ impurity and conduction electrons with spin $j$. These problems
arise as multicritical points in the parameter spaces of two- and higher-level
tunneling systems, and some impurity models of heavy fermion compounds. In
contrast to the previous Bethe-anstaz conjectures, it turns out that the
dynamics of the spin sector is the same as that of a spin $S$ impurity coupled
to $k(j)$ channels of spin $1/2$ electrons with $k(j) = 2j(j+1)(2j+1)/3$. As a
result, for $2S < k(j)$, the system shows non-Fermi liquid behavior with the
same exponents for the thermodynamic quantities as those of $k(j)$ channel
Kondo problem. However, both the finite-size spectrum and the operator content
are different due to the presence of the other sectors and can be obtained by
conformal field theory techniques.
