The compound, LaMn2Ge2, crystallizing in ThCr2Si2-type tetragonal crystal
structure, has been known to undergo ferromagnetic order below (T_C=) 326 K. In
this article, we report the magnetic behavior of nanocrystalline form of this
compound, obtained by high-energy ball-milling. T_C of this compound is reduced
maginally for the nanoform, whereas there is a significant reduction of the
magnitude of the saturation magnetic moment with increasing milling time. The
coercive field however increases with decreasing particle size. Thus, this work
provides a route to tune these parameters by reducing the particle size in this
ternary family.
