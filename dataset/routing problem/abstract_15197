Max-product `belief propagation' (BP) is a popular distributed heuristic for
finding the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) assignment in a joint probability
distribution represented by a Graphical Model (GM). It was recently shown that
BP converges to the correct MAP assignment for a class of loopy GMs with the
following common feature: the Linear Programming (LP) relaxation to the MAP
problem is tight (has no integrality gap). Unfortunately, tightness of the LP
relaxation does not, in general, guarantee convergence and correctness of the
BP algorithm. The failure of BP in such cases motivates reverse engineering a
solution -- namely, given a tight LP, can we design a `good' BP algorithm.
  In this paper, we design a BP algorithm for the Maximum Weight Matching (MWM)
problem over general graphs. We prove that the algorithm converges to the
correct optimum if the respective LP relaxation, which may include inequalities
associated with non-intersecting odd-sized cycles, is tight. The most
significant part of our approach is the introduction of a novel graph
transformation designed to force convergence of BP. Our theoretical result
suggests an efficient BP-based heuristic for the MWM problem, which consists of
making sequential, ``cutting plane'', modifications to the underlying GM. Our
experiments show that this heuristic performs as well as traditional
cutting-plane algorithms using LP solvers on MWM problems.
