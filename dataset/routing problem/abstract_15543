This paper addresses two central problems for probabilistic processing
models: parameter estimation from incomplete data and efficient retrieval of
most probable analyses. These questions have been answered satisfactorily only
for probabilistic regular and context-free models. We address these problems
for a more expressive probabilistic constraint logic programming model. We
present a log-linear probability model for probabilistic constraint logic
programming. On top of this model we define an algorithm to estimate the
parameters and to select the properties of log-linear models from incomplete
data. This algorithm is an extension of the improved iterative scaling
algorithm of Della-Pietra, Della-Pietra, and Lafferty (1995). Our algorithm
applies to log-linear models in general and is accompanied with suitable
approximation methods when applied to large data spaces. Furthermore, we
present an approach for searching for most probable analyses of the
probabilistic constraint logic programming model. This method can be applied to
the ambiguity resolution problem in natural language processing applications.
