The concept of the "modulus" in the CAD system drawings is characterized,
being a base of developing of the problem-oriented extensions. The modulus
consists of visible geometric elements of the drawing and invisible parametric
representation of the modelling object. The technological advantages of
moduluss in a complex CAD system developing are described.
