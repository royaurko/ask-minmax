A theoretical analysis of Pancharatnam and Berry phases is made for biphoton
three-level systems, which are produced via frequency degenerate co-linear
spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC). The general theory of
Pancharatnam phases is discussed with a special emphasis on geodesic 'curves'in
Hilbert space. Explicit expressions for Pancharatnam, dynamical and geometrical
phases are derived for the transformations produced by linear phase-converters.
The problem of gauge invariance is treated along all the article.
