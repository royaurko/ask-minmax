This article describes a bridge between POD-based model order reduction
techniques and the classical Newton/Krylov solvers. This bridge is used to
derive an efficient algorithm to correct, "on-the-fly", the reduced order
modelling of highly nonlinear problems undergoing strong topological changes.
Damage initiation problems are addressed and tackle via a corrected
hyperreduction method. It is shown that the relevancy of reduced order model
can be significantly improved with reasonable additional costs when using this
algorithm, even when strong topological changes are involved.
