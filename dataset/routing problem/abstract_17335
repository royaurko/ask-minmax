We present a scalable and effective classification model to train multi-class
boosting for multi-class classification problems. Shen and Hao introduced a
direct formulation of multi- class boosting in the sense that it directly
maximizes the multi- class margin [C. Shen and Z. Hao, "A direct formulation
for totally-corrective multi- class boosting", in Proc. IEEE Conf. Comp. Vis.
Patt. Recogn., 2011]. The major problem of their approach is its high
computational complexity for training, which hampers its application on
real-world problems. In this work, we propose a scalable and simple stage-wise
multi-class boosting method, which also directly maximizes the multi-class
margin. Our approach of- fers a few advantages: 1) it is simple and
computationally efficient to train. The approach can speed up the training time
by more than two orders of magnitude without sacrificing the classification
accuracy. 2) Like traditional AdaBoost, it is less sensitive to the choice of
parameters and empirically demonstrates excellent generalization performance.
Experimental results on challenging multi-class machine learning and vision
tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially improves the
convergence rate and accuracy of the final visual detector at no additional
computational cost compared to existing multi-class boosting.
