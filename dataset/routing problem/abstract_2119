We report the production of ultracold 7Li85Rb molecules by photoassociation
(PA) below the Li (2s 2S1/2) + Rb (5p 2P1/2) asymptote. We perform PA
spectroscopy in a dual-species 7Li-85Rb magneto-optical trap (MOT) and detect
the PA resonances using trap loss spectroscopy. We observe several strong PA
resonances corresponding to the last few bound states, assign the lines and
derive the long range C6 dispersion coefficients for the Li (2s 2S1/2) + Rb (5p
2P1/2) asymptote. We also report an excited-state molecule formation rate
(P_LiRb) of ~10^7 s^-1 and a PA rate coefficient (K_PA) of ~4x10^-11 cm^3/s,
which are both among the highest observed for heteronuclear bi-alkali
molecules. These suggest that PA is a promising route for the creation of
ultracold ground state LiRb molecules.
