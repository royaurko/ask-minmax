In this paper, we study equations driven by a non-local integrodifferential
operator $\mathcal{L}_K$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. More
precisely, we study the problem \[ \begin{aligned}
  &- \mathcal{L}_K u + V(x)u = |u|^{p-2}u, &&\text{in } \Omega, \newline
  &u=0, &&\text{in } \mathbb{R}^N \setminus \Omega, \end{aligned} \] where $2 <
p < 2^{*}_s = \frac{2N}{N-2s}$, $\Omega$ is an open bounded domain in
$\mathbb{R}^{N}$ for $N\ge 2$ and $V$ is a $L^\infty$ potential such that
$-\mathcal{L}_K + V$ is positive definite. As a particular case, we study the
problem \[ \begin{aligned}
  &(- \Delta)^s u + V(x)u = |u|^{p-2}u, &&\text{in } \Omega, \newline
  &u=0, &&\text{in } \mathbb{R}^N \setminus \Omega, \end{aligned} \] where
$(-\Delta)^s$ denotes the fractional Laplacian (with $0<s<1$). We give
assumptions on $V$, $\Omega$ and $K$ such that ground state solutions (resp.
least energy nodal solutions) respect the symmetries of some first (resp.
second) eigenfunctions of $-\mathcal{L}_K + V$, at least for $p$ close to $2$.
We study the uniqueness, up to a multiplicative factor, of those types of
solutions. The results extend those obtained for the local case.
