The global boundness, existence and uniqueness are presented for the kind of
Rosseland equation with a small parameter. This problem comes from
conduction-radiation coupled heat transfer in the composites; it's with
coefficients of high order growth and mixed boundary conditions.
  A linearized map is constructed by fixing the function variables in the
coefficients and the right-hand side. The solution to the linearized problem is
uniformly bounded based on De Giorgi iteration; it is bounded in the H\"older
space from a Sobolev-Campanato estimate.
  This linearized map is compact and continuous so that there exists a fixed
point.
  All of these estimates are independent of the small parameter.
  At the end, the uniqueness of the solution holds if there is a big zero-order
term and the solution's gradient is bounded.
  This existence theorem can be extended to the nonlinear parabolic problem.
