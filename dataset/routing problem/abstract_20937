We consider quasilinear parabolic evolution equations in the situation where
the set of equilibria forms a finite-dimensional C^1-manifold which is normally
hyperbolic. The existence of foliations of the stable and unstable manifolds is
shown assuming merely C^1-regularity of the underlying equation.
