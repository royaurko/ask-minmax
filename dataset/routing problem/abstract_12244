We introduce connections between the Cuntz relations and the Hardy space H_2
of the open unit disk . We then use them to solve a new kind of multipoint
interpolation problem in H_2, where for instance, only a linear combination of
the values of a function at given points is preassigned, rather than the values
at the points themselves. We also consider the case of de Branges-Rovnyak
spaces.
