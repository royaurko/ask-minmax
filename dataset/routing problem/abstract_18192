We present a method to compute the inverse scattering transform (IST) for the
famed Toda lattice by solving the associated Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problem
numerically. Deformations for the RH problem are incorporated so that the IST
can be evaulated in $\mathcal O(1)$ operations for arbitrarily points in the
$(n,t)$-domain, including short- and long-time regimes. No time-stepping is
required to compute the solution because $(n,t)$ appear as parameters in the
associated RH problem. The solution of the Toda lattice is computed in
long-time asymptotic regions where the asymptotics are not known rigorously. We
introduce two new asymptotic regions, in addition to the existing three
regions, so that all values of $(n,t)$ for $t$ large are contained in a region.
Furthermore, we define clear boundaries for all regions and develop
deformations in the new regions that should be of use in future asymptotic
analysis of the Toda lattice.
