We prove that an arbitrary Banach couple is uniquely determined by the
collection of intermediate spaces that are interpolation spaces for the
operators of rank one. From this we deduce a confirmation to the conjecture by
Yu. A. Brudnyi and N.Ya. Kruglyak that a Banach couple is uniquely determined
by the collection of all its interpolation spaces. Some relevant problems are
also analized.
