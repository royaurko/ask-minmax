The Travelling Salesman Problem is one the most fundamental and most studied
problems in approximation algorithms. For more than 30 years, the best
algorithm known for general metrics has been Christofides's algorithm with
approximation factor of 3/2, even though the so-called Held-Karp LP relaxation
of the problem is conjectured to have the integrality gap of only 4/3. Very
recently, significant progress has been made for the important special case of
graphic metrics, first by Oveis Gharan et al., and then by Momke and Svensson.
In this paper, we provide an improved analysis for the approach introduced by
Momke and Svensson yielding a bound of 13/9 on the approximation factor, as
well as a bound of 19/12+epsilon for any epsilon>0 for a more general
Travelling Salesman Path Problem in graphic metrics.
