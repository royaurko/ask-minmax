We consider the corresponding Christoffel-Minkowski problem for curvature
measures. The existence of star-shaped $(n-k)$-convex bodies with prescribed
$k$-th curvature measures ($k>0$) has been a longstanding problem. This is
settled in this paper through the establishment of a crucial $C^2$ a priori
estimate for the corresponding curvature equation on $\mathbb S^n$.
