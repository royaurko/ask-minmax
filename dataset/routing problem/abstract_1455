The equilibrium and fluctuation methods for determining the surface tension,
$\sigma$, and bending modulus, $\kappa$, of a bilayer membrane with a fixed
projected area are discussed. In the fluctuation method the elastic
coefficients $\sigma$ and $\kappa$ are measured from the amplitude of thermal
fluctuations of the planar membrane, while in the equilibrium method the free
energy required to deform the membrane is considered. The latter approach is
used to derive new expressions for $\sigma$ and $\kappa$ (as well as for the
saddle-splay modulus), which relate them to the pair-interactions between the
amphiphiles forming the membrane. We use linear response theory to argue that
the two routes lead to similar values for $\sigma$ and $\kappa$. This argument
is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations of a model membrane whose elastic
coefficients are calculated using both methods.
