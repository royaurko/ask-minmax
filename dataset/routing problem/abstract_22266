We consider some possible approaches to the fractional-order generalization
of definition of variation (functional) derivative. Some problems of
formulation of a fractional-order variational derivative are discussed. To give
a consistent definition of the fractional-order variations, we use a fractional
generalization of Gateaux differential.
