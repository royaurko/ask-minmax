In this work we present an approach which can be systematically used to
construct nonlinear systems possessing analytical multi-kink profile
configurations. In contrast with previous approaches to the problem, we are
able to do it by using field potentials which are considerably smoother than
the ones of Doubly Quadratic family of potentials. This is done without losing
the capacity of writing exact analytical solutions. The resulting field
configurations can be applied to the study of problems from condensed matter to
brane world scenarios.
