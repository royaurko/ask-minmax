The Consensus Clustering problem has been introduced as an effective way to
analyze the results of different microarray experiments. The problem consists
of looking for a partition that best summarizes a set of input partitions (each
corresponding to a different microarray experiment) under a simple and
intuitive cost function. The problem admits polynomial time algorithms on two
input partitions, but is APX-hard on three input partitions. We investigate the
restriction of Consensus Clustering when the output partition is required to
contain at most k sets, giving a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS)
while proving the NP-hardness of this restriction.
