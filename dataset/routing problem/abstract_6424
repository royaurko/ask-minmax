We describe the general setting for the optical Aharonov-Bohm effect based on
the inverse problem of the identification of the coefficients of the governing
hyperbolic equation by the boundary measurements. We interpret the inverse
problem result as a possibility in principle to detect the optical
Aharonov-Bohm effect by the boundary measurements.
