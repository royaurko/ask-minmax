We present a consistent derivation of the recently proposed 5D anisotropic
standing wave braneworld generated by gravity coupled to a phantom-like scalar
field. We explicitly solve the corresponding junction conditions, a fact that
enables us to give a physical interpretation to the anisotropic energy-momentum
tensor components on the brane. So matter on the brane represents an
oscillating fluid which emits anisotropic waves into the bulk. We also analyze
the Sturm-Liouville problem associated to the correct localization condition of
the transverse to the brane metric and scalar fields. It is shown that this
condition restricts the physically meaningful space of solutions for the
localization of the fluctuations of the model.
