In this note we investigate the behavior of the volume that the convex hull
of two congruent and intersecting simplices in Euclidean $n$-space can have. We
prove some useful equalities and inequalities on this volume. For the regular
simplex we determine the maximal possible volume for the case when the two
simplices are related to each other via reflection at a hyperplane intersecting
them.
