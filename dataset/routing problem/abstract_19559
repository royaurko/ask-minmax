I describe recent challenges in hierarchical galaxy formation theory,
including the formation of disk galaxies and of ellipticals. Problems with cold
dark matter are summarized, and possible solutions are presented. I conclude
with a description of the prospects for observing one of the most important
ingredients in galaxy formation theory, namely cold dark matter.
