We prove quasi-monotonicity formulas for classical obstacle-type problems
with energies being the sum of a quadratic form with Lipschitz coefficients,
and a H\"older continuous linear term. With the help of those formulas we are
able to carry out the full analysis of the regularity of free-boundary points
following the approaches by Caffarelli, Weiss and Monneau.
