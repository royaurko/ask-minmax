The focus of the article is on the analysis of a semi-infinite crack at the
interface between two dissimilar anisotropic elastic materials, loaded by a
general asymmetrical system of forces acting on the crack faces. Recently
derived symmetric and skew-symmetric weight function matrices are introduced
for both plane strain and antiplane shear cracks, and used together with the
fundamental reciprocal identity (Betti formula) in order to formulate the
elastic fracture problem in terms of singular integral equations relating the
applied loading and the resulting crack opening. The proposed compact
formulation can be used to solve many problems in linear elastic fracture
mechanics (for example various classic crack problems in homogeneous and
heterogeneous anisotropic media, as piezoceramics or composite materials). This
formulation is also fundamental in many multifield theories, where the elastic
problem is coupled with other concurrent physical phenomena.
