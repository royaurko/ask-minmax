The basic work of Zaslavskii et al showed that the classical non-relativistic
electromagnetically kicked oscillator can be cast into the form of an iterative
map on the phase space; the resulting evolution contains a stochastic flow to
unbounded energy. Subsequent studies have formulated the problem in terms of a
relativistic charged particle in interaction with the electromagnetic field. We
review the structure of the covariant Lorentz force used to study this problem.
We show that the Lorentz force equation can be derived as well from the
manifestly covariant mechanics of Stueckelberg in the presence of a standard
Maxwell field, establishing a connection between these equations and mass shell
constraints. We argue that these relativistic generalizations of the problem
are intrinsically inaccurate due to an inconsistency in the structure of the
relativistic Lorentz force, and show that a reformulation of the relativistic
problem, permitting variations (classically) in both the particle mass and the
effective ``mass'' of the interacting electromagnetic field, provides a
consistent system of classical equations for describing such processes.
