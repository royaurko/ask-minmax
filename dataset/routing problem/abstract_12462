We present a systematic small-correlation expansion to solve the inverse
Ising problem: find a set of couplings and fields corresponding to a given set
of correlations and magnetizations. Couplings are calculated up to the third
order in the correlations for generic magnetizations, and to the seventh order
in the case of zero magnetizations; in addition we show how to sum some useful
classes of diagrams exactly. The resulting expansion outperforms existing
algorithms on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass model.
