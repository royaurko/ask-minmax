We consider driven systems where the driving induces jumps in energy space:
(1) particles pulsed by a step potential; (2) particles in a box with a moving
wall; (3) particles in a ring driven by an electro-motive-force. In all these
cases the route towards quantum-classical correspondence is highly non-trivial.
Some insight is gained by observing that the dynamics in energy space, where
$n$ is the level index, is essentially the same as that of Bloch electrons in a
tight binding model, where $n$ is the site index. The mean level spacing is
like a constant electric field and the driving induces long range hopping
1/(n-m).
