In this paper, we considered the problem of finding the upper bound Hausdorff
matrix operator from sequence spaces $l_p(v)$ (or $d(v,p)$) into $l_p(w)$ (or
$d(w,p)$). Also we considered the upper bound problem for matrix operators from
$d(v,1)$ into $d(w,1)$, and matrix operators from $e(w,\infty)$ into
$e(v,\infty)$, and deduce upper bound for Cesaro, Copson and Hilbert matrix
operators, which are recently considered in \cite{5} and \cite{6} and similar
to that in \cite{10}.
