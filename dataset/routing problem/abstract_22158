The beam of an $e^+e^-$ Linear Collider after a collision at the main
interaction point can be utilized to construct the neutrino factory with
exceptional parameters. We also discuss briefly possible applications of some
elements of the proposed scheme to standard fixed target experiments and new
experiments with $\nu_\mu N$ interactions.
