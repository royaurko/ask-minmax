It is argued why, contrary to expectations, steep brane-inflation cannot
really help in overcoming the eta-problem of quintessential inflation
model-building. In contrast it is shown that the problem is substantially
ameliorated under the curvaton hypothesis. This is quantified by considering
possible modular quintessential inflationary models in the context of both
standard and brane cosmology.
