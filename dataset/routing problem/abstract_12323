For materials of varying band gap, we compare energy levels of atomically
localized defects calculated within a semilocal and a hybrid density-functional
scheme. Since the latter scheme partially relieves the band gap problem, our
study describes how calculated defect levels shift when the band gap approaches
the experimental value. When suitably aligned, defect levels obtained from
total-energy differences correspond closely, showing average shifts of at most
0.2 eV irrespective of band gap. Systematic deviations from ideal alignment
increase with the extent of the defect wave function. A guideline for comparing
calculated and experimental defect levels is provided.
