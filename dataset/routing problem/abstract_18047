Exploring Bass' Triangulability Problem on unipotent algebraic subgroups of
the affine Cremona groups, we prove a triangulability criterion, the existence
of nontriangulable connected solvable affine algebraic subgroups of the Cremona
groups, and stable triangulability of such subgroups; in particular, in the
stable range we answer Bass' Triangulability Problem is the affirmative. To
this end we prove a theorem on invariant subfields of $1$-extensions. We also
obtain a general construction of all rationally triangulable subgroups of the
Cremona groups and, as an application, classify rationally triangulable
connected one-dimensional unipotent affine algebraic subgroups of the Cremona
groups up to conjugacy.
