This paper studies a multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink
system for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), in
which a set of single-antenna mobile stations (MSs) receive information and
energy simultaneously via power splitting (PS) from the signal sent by a
multi-antenna base station (BS). We aim to minimize the total transmission
power at BS by jointly designing transmit beamforming vectors and receive PS
ratios for all MSs under their given signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) constraints for information decoding and harvested power constraints for
energy harvesting. First, we derive the sufficient and necessary condition for
the feasibility of our formulated problem. Next, we solve this non-convex
problem by applying the technique of semidefinite relaxation (SDR). We prove
that SDR is indeed tight for our problem and thus achieves its global optimum.
Finally, we propose two suboptimal solutions of lower complexity than the
optimal solution based on the principle of separating the optimization of
transmit beamforming and receive PS, where the zero-forcing (ZF) and the
SINR-optimal based transmit beamforming schemes are applied, respectively.
