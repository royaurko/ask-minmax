Some new global results are given about solutions to the boundary value
problem for the Euler-Lagrange equations for the Ginzburg-Landau model of a
one-dimensional superconductor. The main advance is a proof that in some
parameter range there is a branch of asymmetric solutions connecting the branch
of symmetric solutions to the normal state. Also, simplified proofs are
presented for some local bifurcation results of Bolley and Helffer. These
proofs require no detailed asymptotics for the solutions of the linear
equations. Finally, an error in Odeh's work on this problem is discussed.
