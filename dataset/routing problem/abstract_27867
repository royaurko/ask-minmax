We consider $m$ integral vectors $X_1,...,X_m \in \mathbb{Z}^s$ located in a
half-space of $\mathbb{R}^s$ ($m\ge s\geq 1$) and study the structure of the
additive semi-group $X_1 \mathbb{N} +... + X_m \mathbb{N}$. We introduce and
study maximal saturated cone and directional growth function which describe
some aspects of the structure of the semi-group. When the vectors $X_1, ...,
X_m$ are located in a fixed hyperplane, we obtain an explicit formula for the
directional growth function and we show that this function completely
characterizes the defining data $(X_1, ..., X_m)$ of the semi-group. The last
result will be applied to the study of Lipschitz equivalence of Cantor sets
(see [H. Rao and Y. Zhang, Higher dimensional Frobenius problem and Lipschitz
equivalence of Cantor sets, Preprint 2014]).
