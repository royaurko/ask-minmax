A fundamental theorem of Buchi and Landweber shows that the Church synthesis
problem is computable. Buchi and Landweber reduced the Church Problem to
problems about &#969;-games and used the determinacy of such games as one of
the main tools to show its computability. We consider a natural generalization
of the Church problem to countable ordinals and investigate games of arbitrary
countable length. We prove that determinacy and decidability parts of the
Bu}chi and Landweber theorem hold for all countable ordinals and that its full
extension holds for all ordinals < \omega\^\omega.
