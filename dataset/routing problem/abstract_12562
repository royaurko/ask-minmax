A phase-space noncommutativity in the context of a Kantowski-Sachs
cosmological model is considered to study the interior of a Schwarzschild black
hole. Due to the divergence of the probability of finding the black hole at the
singularity from a canonical noncommutativity, one considers a non-canonical
noncommutativity. It is shown that this more involved type of noncommutativity
removes the problem of the singularity in a Schwarzschild black hole.
