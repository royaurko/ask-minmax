We review the Airy processes; their formulation and how they are conjectured
to govern the large time, large distance spatial fluctuations of one
dimensional random growth models. We also describe formulas which express the
probabilities that they lie below a given curve as Fredholm determinants of
certain boundary value operators, and the several applications of these
formulas to variational problems involving Airy processes that arise in
physical problems, as well as to their local behaviour.
