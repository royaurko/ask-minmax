We solve the Gardner deformation problem for the N=2 supersymmetric a=4
Korteweg-de Vries equation (P. Mathieu, 1988). We show that a known
zero-curvature representation for this superequation yields the system of new
nonlocal variables such that their derivatives contain the Gardner deformation
for the classical KdV equation.
