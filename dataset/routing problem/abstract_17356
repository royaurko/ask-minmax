In this paper we derive the equations of motion for two-layer point vortex
motion on the upper half plane. We study the invariants using symmetry,
including the Hamiltonian and show that the two vortex problem is integrable.
We characterize all two vortex motions for the cases where the vortex strengths
are both equal, $\Gamma_{1}=\Gamma_{2}=1$ and when they are opposite
$\Gamma_{1}=-\Gamma_{2}=1$. We also prove that there are no equilibria for the
two vortex problem when $\Gamma_{1}=-\Gamma_{2}=1$.\ We show that there is only
one relative equilibrium configuration when $\Gamma_{1}=\Gamma_{2}=1$ and the
vortices are in different layers. We also make observations concerning the
finite-time collapse of two vortices in the half plane. We then compare the
regimes of motion for both cases (motion on the half plane) with the case of
the two-layer vortex problem on the entire plane. We also study several classes
of streamline topologies for two vortices in different layers. We conclude with
a Hamiltonian study of integrable two-layer 3 vortex motion on the half plane
by studying integrable symmetrical configurations and provide a rich class of
new relative equilibria.
