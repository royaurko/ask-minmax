In this note, we show that there exist solutions of the Muskat problem that
shift stability regimes: they start unstable, then become stable, and finally
return to the unstable regime. We also exhibit numerical evidence of solutions
with medium-sized $L^{\infty}$ norm of the derivative of the initial condition
that develop a turning singularity.
