This paper discusses the problems faced with interoperability between two
programming languages, with respect to GNU Octave, and GTK API written in C, to
provide the GTK API on Octave.Octave-GTK is the fusion of two different API's:
one exported by GNU Octave [scientific computing tool] and the other GTK [GUI
toolkit]; this enables one to use GTK primitives within GNU Octave, to build
graphical front ends,at the same time using octave engine for number crunching
power. This paper illustrates our implementation of binding logic, and shows
results extended to various other libraries using the same base code generator.
Also shown, are methods of code generation, binding automation, and the niche
we plan to fill in the absence of GUI in Octave. Canonical discussion of
advantages, feasibility and problems faced in the process are elucidated.
