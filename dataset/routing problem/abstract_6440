We present the solution to the "mean king's problem" in the continuous
variable setting. We show that in this setting, the outcome of a
randomly-selected projective measurement of any linear combination of the
canonical variables x and p can be ascertained with arbitrary precision.
Moreover, we show that the solution is in turn a solution to an associated
"conjunctive" version of the problem, unique to continuous variables, where the
inference task is to ascertain all the joint outcomes of a simultaneous
measurement of any number of linear combinations of x and p.
