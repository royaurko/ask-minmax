An approximate scaling relation is found for the transition temperature to a
charge-density-wave instability in the anharmonic electron-phonon problem,
which maps a wide range of interaction strengths, anharmonicities, and phonon
frequencies onto a common functional form. The relation employs the
wave-function renormalization parameter and is valid even for systems that are
not Fermi liquids.
