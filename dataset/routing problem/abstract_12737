We improve results regarding the stability and attractivity of solutions $u$
of a large class of initial-boundary-value problems characterized by a
semi-linear third order equation which may contain time-dependent coefficients.
In the proof we use Liapunov functionals $W$ depending on two parameters, which
we adapt to the 'error' $\sigma$.
