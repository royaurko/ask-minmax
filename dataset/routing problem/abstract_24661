Entanglement is a complexity measure of directed graphs that origins in fixed
point theory. This measure has shown its use in designing efficient algorithms
to verify logical properties of transition systems. We are interested in the
problem of deciding whether a graph has entanglement at most k. As this measure
is defined by means of games, game theoretic ideas naturally lead to design
polynomial algorithms that, for fixed k, decide the problem. Known
characterizations of directed graphs of entanglement at most 1 lead, for k = 1,
to design even faster algorithms. In this paper we present an explicit
characterization of undirected graphs of entanglement at most 2. With such a
characterization at hand, we devise a linear time algorithm to decide whether
an undirected graph has this property.
