In this study, we consider the exponential utility maximization problem in
the context of a jump-diffusion model. To solve the problem, we rely on the
dynamic programming principle and we derive from it a quadratic BSDE with
jumps. Since this quadratic BSDE is driven both by a Wiener process and by a
Poisson random measure having a Levy measure with infinite mass, our main task
consists in establishing a new existence result for the specific BSDE
introduced.
