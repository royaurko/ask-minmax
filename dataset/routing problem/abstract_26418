An one - parameter dynamical system is associated to the mathematical problem
governing the membrane excitability of a ventricular cardiomyocyte, according
to the Luo-Rudy I model. Limit cycles are described by the solutions of an
extended system. A finite element method time approximation (FEM) is used in
order to formulate the approximate problem. Starting from a Hopf bifurcation
point, approximate limit cycles are obtained, step by step, using an
arc-length-continuation method and Newton's method. Some numerical results are
presented.
