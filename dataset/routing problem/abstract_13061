We present a solution for the classical univariate rational interpolation
problem by means of (univariate) subresultants. In the case of Cauchy
interpolation (interpolation without multiplicities), we give explicit formulas
for the solution in terms of symmetric functions of the input data,
generalizing the well-known formulas for Lagrange interpolation. In the case of
the osculatory rational interpolation (interpolation with multiplicities), we
give determinantal expressions in terms of the input data, making explicit some
matrix formulations that can independently be derived from previous results by
Beckermann and Labahn.
