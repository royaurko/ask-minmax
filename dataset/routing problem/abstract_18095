The family of pointillist multitarget tracking filters is defined to be the
class of filters that is characterized by a joint target-measurement finite
point process. The probability generating functional (PGFL) of the joint
process is derived directly from the probabilistic structure of the tracking
problem. PGFLs exemplify the analytic combinatoric method applied to the
measurement to target assignment problems that are fundamental to the tracking
problem. It is shown that multi-hypothesis tracking (MHT), joint probabilistic
data association (JPDA), and many other now-classic tracking filters can be
derived via PGFLs, and thus are members of the family of pointillist filters.
When one or more of the target processes are dimensionally compatible, targets
can be superposed. It is shown that the classic MHT filter for superposed
targets is closely related to the multi-Bernoulli filter. A technique is
presented for deriving the functional derivatives by ordinary differentiation,
and both exact and approximate methods for evaluating the ordinary derivatives
are discussed.
