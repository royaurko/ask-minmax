The even cycle problem for both undirected and directed graphs has been the
topic of intense research in the last decade. In this paper, we study the
computational complexity of \emph{cycle length modularity problems}. Roughly
speaking, in a cycle length modularity problem, given an input (undirected or
directed) graph, one has to determine whether the graph has a cycle $C$ of a
specific length (or one of several different lengths), modulo a fixed integer.
We denote the two families (one for undirected graphs and one for directed
graphs) of problems by $(S,m)\hbox{-}{\rm UC}$ and $(S,m)\hbox{-}{\rm DC}$,
where $m \in \mathcal{N}$ and $S \subseteq \{0,1, ..., m-1\}$.
$(S,m)\hbox{-}{\rm UC}$ (respectively, $(S,m)\hbox{-}{\rm DC}$) is defined as
follows: Given an undirected (respectively, directed) graph $G$, is there a
cycle in $G$ whose length, modulo $m$, is a member of $S$? In this paper, we
fully classify (i.e., as either polynomial-time solvable or as ${\rm
NP}$-complete) each problem $(S,m)\hbox{-}{\rm UC}$ such that $0 \in S$ and
each problem $(S,m)\hbox{-}{\rm DC}$ such that $0 \notin S$. We also give a
sufficient condition on $S$ and $m$ for the following problem to be
polynomial-time computable: $(S,m)\hbox{-}{\rm UC}$ such that $0 \notin S$.
