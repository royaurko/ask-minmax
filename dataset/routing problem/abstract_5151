We study the use of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) as a tool for the
recognition of agents' behavior on the basis of observation of their sequential
decision behavior interacting with the environment. We model the problem faced
by the agents as a Markov decision process (MDP) and model the observed
behavior of the agents in terms of forward planning for the MDP. We use IRL to
learn reward functions and then use these reward functions as the basis for
clustering or classification models. Experimental studies with GridWorld, a
navigation problem, and the secretary problem, an optimal stopping problem,
suggest reward vectors found from IRL can be a good basis for behavior pattern
recognition problems. Empirical comparisons of our method with several existing
IRL algorithms and with direct methods that use feature statistics observed in
state-action space suggest it may be superior for recognition problems.
