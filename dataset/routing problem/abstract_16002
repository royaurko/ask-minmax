The contributor's recent results on an asymptotic description of the Schlesinger
equation are generalized to the JMMS equation. As in the case of the
Schlesinger equation, the JMMS equation is reformulated to include a small
parameter $\epsilon$. By the method of multiscale analysis, the isomonodromic
problem is approximated by slow modulations of an isospectral problem. A
modulation equation of this slow dynamics is proposed, and shown to possess a
number of properties similar to the Seiberg- Witten solutions of low energy
supersymmetric gauge theories.
