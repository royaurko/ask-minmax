We consider the computational complexity of a problem modeling bribery in the
context of voting systems. In the scenario of Swap Bribery, each voter assigns
a certain price for swapping the positions of two consecutive candidates in his
preference ranking. The question is whether it is possible, without exceeding a
given budget, to bribe the voters in a way that the preferred candidate wins in
the election. We initiate a parameterized and multivariate complexity analysis
of Swap Bribery, focusing on the case of k-approval. We investigate how
different cost functions affect the computational complexity of the problem. We
identify a special case of k-approval for which the problem can be solved in
polynomial time, whereas we prove NP-hardness for a slightly more general
scenario. We obtain fixed-parameter tractability as well as W[1]-hardness
results for certain natural parameters.
