We obtain the sharp estimates on the growth of the uniform norm of
orthonormal polynomials for measures satisfying the Steklov condition. This
improves the earlier results by Rakhmanov and completely settles a problem by
Steklov. The sharp estimates for the polynomial entropy in the Steklov class
are obtained as well.
