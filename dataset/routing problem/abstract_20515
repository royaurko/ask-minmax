The convergent iterative procedure for solving the groundstate Schroedinger
equation is extended to derive the excitation energy and the wave function of
the low-lying excited states. The method is applied to the one-dimensional
quartic potential problem. The results show that the iterative solution
converges rapidly when the coupling $g$ is not too small.
