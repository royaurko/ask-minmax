Numerical relativity is the most promising tool for theoretically modeling
the inspiral and coalescence of neutron star and black hole binaries, which, in
turn, are among the most promising sources of gravitational radiation for
future detection by gravitational wave observatories. In this article we review
numerical relativity approaches to modeling compact binaries. Starting with a
brief introduction to the 3+1 decomposition of Einstein's equations, we discuss
important components of numerical relativity, including the initial data
problem, reformulations of Einstein's equations, coordinate conditions, and
strategies for locating and handling black holes on numerical grids. We focus
on those approaches which currently seem most relevant for the compact binary
problem. We then outline how these methods are used to model binary neutron
stars and black holes, and review the current status of inspiral and
coalescence simulations.
