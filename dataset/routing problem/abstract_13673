We study the obstacle problem with an elliptic operator in divergence form.
We develop all of the basic theory of existence, uniqueness, optimal
regularity, and nondegeneracy of the solutions. These results, in turn, allow
us to begin the study of the regularity of the free boundary in the case where
the coefficients are in VMO.
