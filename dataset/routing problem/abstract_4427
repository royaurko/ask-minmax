We consider the problem of minimal correction of the training set to make it
consistent with monotonic constraints. This problem arises during analysis of
data sets via techniques that require monotone data. We show that this problem
is NP-hard in general and is equivalent to finding a maximal independent set in
special orgraphs. Practically important cases of that problem considered in
detail. These are the cases when a partial order given on the replies set is a
total order or has a dimension 2. We show that the second case can be reduced
to maximization of a quadratic convex function on a convex set. For this case
we construct an approximate polynomial algorithm based on convex optimization.
