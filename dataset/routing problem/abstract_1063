We have developed a simple, surfactant assisted synthesis route for the
preparation, in gram quantities, of Co and Li doped ZnO nanocrystalline samples
showing robust room temperature ferromagnetism. Our studies show that RTF is
intrinsic to Zn0.85Co0.05Li0.10O and not due to any segregated secondary
phases. In addition, it has been shown that the defects play an important role
in activating RTF in these oxide systems. This also provide an explanation for
the widely varying results observed in the literature. The method can also be
extended for the synthesis of other transition metal doped ZnO.
