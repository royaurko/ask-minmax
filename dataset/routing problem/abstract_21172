A multivariate version of Rosenblum's Fejer-Riesz theorem on outer
factorization of trigonometric polynomials with operator coefficients is
considered. Due to a simplification of the proof of the single variable case,
new necessary and sufficient conditions for the multivariable outer
factorization problem are formulated and proved.
