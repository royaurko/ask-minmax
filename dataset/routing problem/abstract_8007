In this paper we investigate the problem of minimization the Heisenberg's
uncertainty relation by the trajectory-coherent states. The conditions of
minimization for Hamiltonian and trajectory are obtained. We show that the
trajectory-coherent states minimize the Heisenberg's uncertainty relation for
special Cauchy problem for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation only.
