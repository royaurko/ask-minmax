In this paper we propose the approach for constructing partitionings of hard
variants of the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). Such partitionings can be
used for solving corresponding SAT instances in parallel. For the same SAT
instance one can construct different partitionings, each of them is a set of
simplified versions of the original SAT instance. The effectiveness of an
arbitrary partitioning is determined by the total time of solving of all SAT
instances from it. We suggest the approach, based on the Monte Carlo method,
for estimating time of processing of an arbitrary partitioning. With each
partitioning we associate a point in the special finite search space. The
estimation of effectiveness of the particular partitioning is the value of
predictive function in the corresponding point of this space. The problem of
search for an effective partitioning can be formulated as a problem of
optimization of the predictive function. We use metaheuristic algorithms
(simulated annealing and tabu search) to move from point to point in the search
space. In our computational experiments we found partitionings for SAT
instances encoding problems of inversion of some cryptographic functions.
Several of these SAT instances with realistic predicted solving time were
successfully solved on a computing cluster and in the volunteer computing
project SAT@home. The solving time agrees well with estimations obtained by the
proposed method.
