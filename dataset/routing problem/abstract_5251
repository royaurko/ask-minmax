In this paper, we propose a time-frequency analysis method to obtain
instantaneous frequencies and the corresponding decomposition by solving an
optimization problem. In this optimization problem, the basis to decompose the
signal is not known. Instead, it is adapted to the signal and is determined as
part of the optimization problem. In this sense, this optimization problem can
be seen as a dictionary learning problem. This dictionary learning problem is
solved by using the Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier method (ALM) iteratively.
We further accelerate the convergence of the ALM method in each iteration by
using the fast wavelet transform. We apply our method to decompose several
signals, including signals with poor scale separation, signals with outliers
and polluted by noise and a real signal. The results show that this method can
give accurate recovery of both the instantaneous frequencies and the intrinsic
mode functions.
