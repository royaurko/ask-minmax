We consider the problem of approximating an affinely structured matrix, for
example a Hankel matrix, by a low-rank matrix with the same structure. This
problem occurs in system identification, signal processing and computer
algebra, among others. We impose the low-rank by modeling the approximation as
a product of two factors with reduced dimension. The structure of the low-rank
model is enforced by introducing a penalty term in the objective function. The
proposed local optimization algorithm is able to solve the weighted structured
low-rank approximation problem, as well as to deal with the cases of missing or
fixed elements. In contrast to approaches based on kernel representations (in
linear algebraic sense), the proposed algorithm is designed to address the case
of small targeted rank. We compare it to existing approaches on numerical
examples of system identification, approximate greatest common divisor problem,
and symmetric tensor decomposition and demonstrate its consistently good
performance.
