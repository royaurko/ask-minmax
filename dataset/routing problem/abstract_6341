In this paper we study the problem of quantizing theories defined over a
nonclassical configuration space. If one follows the path-integral approach,
the first problem one is faced with is the one of definition of the integral
over such spaces. We consider this problem and we show how to define an
integration which respects the physical principle of composition of the
probability amplitudes for a very large class of algebras.
