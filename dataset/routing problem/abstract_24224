In the automotive industry, predicting noise during design cycle is a
necessary step. Well-known methods exist to answer this issue in low frequency
domain. Among these, Finite Element Methods, adapted to closed domains, are
quite easy to implement whereas Boundary Element Methods are more adapted to
infinite domains, but may induce singularity problems. In this article, the
described method, the SDM, allows to use both methods in their best application
domain. A new method is also presented to solve the SDM exterior problem.
Instead of using Boundary Element Methods, an original use of Finite Elements
is made. Efficiency of this new version of the Substructure Deletion Method is
discussed.
