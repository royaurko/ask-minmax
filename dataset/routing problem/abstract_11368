Gravitinos and hidden sector fields often cause a cosmological disaster in
supersymmetric models. We find that a model with gravitational gauge mediation
solves such a problem quite naturally. The mu-problem is also absent in the
model. Moreover, the abundance of gravitinos explains correct amount of dark
matter of the universe. The dark matter abundance can be calculated without
detailed information on the thermal history of the universe such as the
reheating temperature after inflation.
