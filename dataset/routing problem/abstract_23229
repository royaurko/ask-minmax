In Calabi-Yau string compactification, it is pointed out that there exists a
new type of $SU(5) \times U(1)^2$ model (the aligned $SU(5) \times U(1)^2$
model) in which the $SU(5)$ differs from the standard $SU(5)$ and also from the
flipped $SU(5)$. With the aid of the discrete symmetry suggested from Gepner
model, we construct a simple and phenomenologically interesting
three-generation model with the aligned $SU(5) \times U(1)^2$ gauge symmetry.
The triplet-doublet splitting problem can be solved. It is also found that
there is a realistic solution for solar neutrino problem and for the $\mu
$-problem. At low energies this model is in accord with the minimal
supersymmetric standard model except for the existence of singlet fields with
masses of $O(1)$TeV.
