We consider the Cauchy problem for nonlinear Schrodinger equations in the
presence of a smooth, possibly unbounded, potential. No assumption is made on
the sign of the potential. If the potential grows at most linearly at infinity,
we construct solutions in Sobolev spaces (without weight), locally in time.
Under some natural assumptions, we prove that the $H^1$-solutions are global in
time. On the other hand, if the potential has a super-linear growth, then the
Sobolev regularity of positive order is lost instantly, not matter how large it
is, unless the initial datum decays sufficiently fast at infinity.
