The minimal renormalizable supersymmetric SO(10) model, an SO(10) framework
with only one 10 and one 126 Higgs multiplets in the Yukawa sector, is
attractive because of its high predictive power for the neutrino oscillation
data. However, this model suffers from problems related to running of gauge
couplings. The gauge coupling unification may be spoiled due to the presence of
Higgs multiplets much lighter than the grand unification (GUT) scale. In
addition, the gauge couplings blow up around the GUT scale because of the
presence of Higgs multiplets of large representations. We consider the minimal
SO(10) model in the warped extra dimension and find a possibility to solve
these problems.
