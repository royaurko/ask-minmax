In this paper we address the complexity of solving linear programming
problems with a set of differential equations that converge to a fixed point
that represents the optimal solution. Assuming a probabilistic model, where the
inputs are i.i.d. Gaussian variables, we compute the distribution of the
convergence rate to the attracting fixed point. Using the framework of Random
Matrix Theory, we derive a simple expression for this distribution in the
asymptotic limit of large problem size. In this limit, we find that the
distribution of the convergence rate is a scaling function, namely it is a
function of one variable that is a combination of three parameters: the number
of variables, the number of constraints and the convergence rate, rather than a
function of these parameters separately. We also estimate numerically the
distribution of computation times, namely the time required to reach a vicinity
of the attracting fixed point, and find that it is also a scaling function.
Using the problem size dependence of the distribution functions, we derive high
probability bounds on the convergence rates and on the computation times.
