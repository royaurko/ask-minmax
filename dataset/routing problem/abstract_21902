When using finite element and finite difference methods to approximate
eigenvalues of $2m^{th}$-order elliptic problems, the number of reliable
numerical eigenvalues can be estimated in terms of the total degrees of freedom
$N$ in resulting discrete systems. The truth is worse than what we used to
believe in that the percentage of reliable eigenvalues decreases with an
increased $N$, even though the number of reliable eigenvalues increases with
$N$.
