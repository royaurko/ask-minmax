We apply the method of Arzhantseva-Ol'shanskii to prove that for an
exponentially generic (in the sense of Ol'shanskii) class of one-relator groups
the isomorphism problem is solvable in at most exponential time.
  This is obtained as a corollary of our more general result that for any fixed
integers $m>1, n>0$ there is an exponentially generic class of $m$-generator
$n$-relator groups where every group has only one Nielsen equivalence class of
$m$-tuples generating non-free subgroups. This means that a group $G$ in this
class has has only one non-free $m$-generated subgroup, namely $G$ itself.
Hence for any homomorphism for an $m$-generated group to $G$ the image of this
homomorphism is either free or is equal to $G$. Applied to injective
homomorphisms from $G$ to itself this implies that $G$ is co-Hopfian. Moreover,
every automorphism of $G$ is "freely induced", that is, it lifts to an
automorphism of the free group $F_m$.
  All of these results are obtained by folding methods without using the theory
of JSJ-decomposition or the R-tree techniques deployed by Zlil Sela in his
famous solution of the isomorphism problem for torsion-free word-hyperbolic
groups.
