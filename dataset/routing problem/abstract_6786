We define a random walk problem which admits analytic results, on a class of
infinite periodic lattices which are directed and colored. Our approach is
motivated from the fact that such lattices arise in string theoretic constructs
of certain gauge theories. An operator counting problem in the latter is mapped
to a problem in random walks. This is illustrated with several examples.
