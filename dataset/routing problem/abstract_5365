In this paper we study various scribability problems for polytopes. We begin
with the classical $k$-scribability problem proposed by Steiner and generalized
by Schulte, which asks about the existence of $d$-polytopes that can not be
realized with all $k$-faces tangent to a sphere. We answer this problem for
stacked and cyclic polytopes for all values of $d$ and $k$. We then continue
with the weak scribability problem proposed by Gr\"unbaum and Shephard, for
which we are able to complete the work by Schulte by presenting non weakly
circumscribable $3$-polytopes. Finally, we propose new $(i,j)$-scribability
problems, in a strong and a weak version, which generalize the classical ones.
They ask about the existence of $d$-polytopes that can not be realized with all
their $i$-faces "avoiding" the sphere and all their $j$-faces "cutting" the
sphere. We are able to provide such examples for all the cases where $j-i \le
d-3$.
