(abbreviated) We use a semi-numerical approach to study the secular behavior
of a system composed of a central star and two massive planets in eccentric
co-planar orbits. We show that the secular dynamics of this system can be
described using only two parameters, the ratios of the semimajor axes and the
planetary masses. The main dynamical features of the system are presented in
geometrical pictures that allows us to investigate a large domain of the
secular phase space of this three-body problem without time-expensive numerical
integrations of the equations of motion, and without any restriction on the
magnitude of the planetary eccentricities. We show that three different regimes
of secular motion with respect to the secular angle $\Delta\varpi$ are
possible: they are circulation, oscillation (around 0 and $180^\circ$), and
high eccentricity libration in a nonlinear secular resonance. The first two
regimes are a continuous extension of the classical linear secular perturbation
theory; the last is a new feature, hitherto unknown, in the secular dynamics of
the three-body problem.
