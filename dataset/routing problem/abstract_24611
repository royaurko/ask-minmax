An algorithm based on compressive sensing (CS) is proposed for synthetic
aperture radar (SAR) imaging of moving targets. The received SAR echo is
decomposed into the sum of basis sub-signals, which are generated by
discretizing the target spatial domain and velocity domain and synthesizing the
SAR received data for every discretized spatial position and velocity
candidate. In this way, the SAR imaging problem is converted into sub-signal
selection problem. In the case that moving targets are sparsely distributed in
the observed scene, their reflectivities, positions and velocities can be
obtained by using the CS technique. It is shown that, compared with traditional
algorithms, the target image obtained by the proposed algorithm has higher
resolution and lower side-lobe while the required number of measurements can be
an order of magnitude less than that by sampling at Nyquist sampling rate.
Moreover, multiple targets with different speeds can be imaged simultaneously,
so the proposed algorithm has higher efficiency.
