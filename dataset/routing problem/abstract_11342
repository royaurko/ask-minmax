Extra dimension provides an attractive way to break symmetry by boundary
conditions which can be useful to construct a natural grand unified theory
avoiding the doublet-triplet splitting problem and the proton decay problem. It
can provide also an elegant mechanism to generate hierarchical 4-dimensional
Yukawa couplings, involving the quasi-localization of matter fields in extra
dimension. We discuss the Kaluza-Klein threshold corrections to low energy
gauge couplings in generic 5-dimensional orbifold grand unified theories with
quasi-localized matter fields, and apply the results to some class of SU(5)
models on $S^1/Z_2\times Z_2$.
