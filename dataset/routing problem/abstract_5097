In wireless ad-hoc broadcast networks the pairing problem consists of
establishing a (long-term) connection between two specific physical nodes in
the network that do not yet know each other. We focus on the ephemeral
version of this problem. Ephemeral pairings occur, for example, when electronic
business cards are exchanged between two people that meet, or when one pays at
a check-out using a wireless wallet.
  This problem can, in more abstract terms, be phrased as an ephemeral key
exchange problem: given a low bandwidth authentic (or private) communication
channel between two nodes, and a high bandwidth broadcast channel, can we
establish a high-entropy shared secret session key between the two nodes
without relying on any a priori shared secret information.
  Apart from introducing this new problem, we present several ephemeral key
exchange protocols, both for the case of authentic channels as well as for the
case of private channels.
