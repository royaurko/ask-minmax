We show that, under general assumptions, in six-dimensional brane-world
models with compactified large extra dimensions, the energy density of brane
oscillations scales as that of cold dark matter and its present value is
compatible with observations. Such value is obtained from the only dimensional
scale in the theory, namely, the fundamental scale of gravity in six dimensions
$M_6\sim 1$ TeV, without any fine-tuning or the introduction of additional mass
scales apart from the large size of the extra dimensions. It has been suggested
that the same kind of models could provide also the correct magnitude of the
cosmological constant. This observation can be relevant for the resolution of
the cosmic coincidence problem in the brane-world scenario.
