For the string baryon model "triangle" the initial-boundary value problem is
stated and solved in general. This problem implies defining a classical motion
of the system on the base of given initial position and initial velocities of
string points. The presented solution reduces the initial-boundary value
problem for the considered model to the system of ordinary differential
equations that can be integrated numerically in general. Using this approach we
ascertain the stability of the rotational motions (flat uniform rotations) for
the "triangle" string configuration.
