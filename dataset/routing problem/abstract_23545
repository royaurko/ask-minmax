Covariant quantization of the Nambu-Goto spinning particle in 2+1-dimensions
is studied. The model is relevant in the context of recent activities in
non-commutative space-time. From a technical point of view also covariant
quantization of the model poses an interesting problem: the set of second class
constraints (in the Dirac classification scheme) is {\it reducible}. The
reducibility problem is analyzed from two contrasting approaches: (i) the
auxiliary variable method [bn] and (ii) the projection operator method [blm].
Finally in the former scheme, a Batalin-Tyutin quantization has been done. This
induces a mapping between the non-commutative and the ordinary space-time. BRST
quantization programme in the latter scheme has also been discussed.
