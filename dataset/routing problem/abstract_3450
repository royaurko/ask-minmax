In this paper we consider the solution of certain convex integer minimization
problems via greedy augmentation procedures. We show that a greedy augmentation
procedure that employs only directions from certain Graver bases needs only
polynomially many augmentation steps to solve the given problem. We extend
these results to convex $N$-fold integer minimization problems and to convex
2-stage stochastic integer minimization problems. Finally, we present some
applications of convex $N$-fold integer minimization problems for which our
approach provides polynomial time solution algorithms.
