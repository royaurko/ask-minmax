We study a Penrose-Fife phase transition model coupled with homogeneous
Neumann boundary conditions. Improving previous results, we show that the
initial value problem for this model admits a unique solution under weak
conditions on the initial data. Moreover, we prove asymptotic regularization
properties of weak solutions.
