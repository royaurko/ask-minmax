We review the literature on the localization transition for the class of
polymers with random potentials that goes under the name of copolymers near
selective interfaces. We outline the results, sketch some of the proofs and
point out the open problems in the field. We also present in detail some
alternative proofs that simplify what one can find in the literature.
