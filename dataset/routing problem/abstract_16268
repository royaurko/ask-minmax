Montgomery-Yang problem predicts that every pseudofree differentiable circle
action on the 5-dimensional sphere has at most 3 non-free orbits. Using a
certain one-to-one correspondence, Koll\'ar formulated the algebraic version of
the Montgomery-Yang problem: every projective surface $S$ with the second Betti
number $b_2(S) = 1$ and with quotient singularities only has at most 3 singular
points if its smooth locus $S^0$ is simply-connected. In a previous paper, we
have confirmed the conjecture when $S$ has at least one non-cyclic quotient
singularity. In this paper, we prove the conjecture either when $S$ is not
rational or when $-K_S$ is ample.
