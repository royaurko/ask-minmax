Campus Grid computing involves heterogeneous resources of an organization
working in collaboration to sol e the problems that cannot be addressed by a
single resource. However, basic problem for Campus Grid users is how to disco
er the best resources required for the particular type of a job. There are
various approaches using which Grid Discovery can be performed. This paper pro
ides the grid resource discovery solutions for Campus Grid using Globus Toolkit
which will enable us to customize the resource information according to the
requirements based on the jobs to be run on the Campus Grid and present it in
our own format. Here we propose building up our own service on top of globus
MDS in order to process the information provided by MDS and use it in our
Campus Grid Portal.
