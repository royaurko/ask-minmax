A parabolic integro differential operator L, suitable to describe many
phenomena in various physical fields, is considered. By means of equivalence
between L and the third order equation describing the evolution inside an
exponentially shaped Josephson junction (ESJJ), an asymptotic analysis for
(ESJJ) is achieved, explicitly evaluating, boundary contributions related to
the Dirichlet problem.
