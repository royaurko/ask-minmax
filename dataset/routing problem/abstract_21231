Let $A$ be an integral domain. We study new conditions on families of
integral ideals of $A$ in order to get that $A$ is of $t$-finite character
(i.e., each nonzero element of $A$ is contained in finitely many $t$-maximal
ideals). We also investigate problems connected with the local invertibility of
ideals.
