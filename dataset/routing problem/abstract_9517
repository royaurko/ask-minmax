In order to keep a green planet, in particular its important to limiting the
pollution with gas emissions. In a specific capacitated fixed-charge
transportation problem with fixed capacities for distribution centers and
customers with particular demands, the objective is to keep the pollution
factor in a given range while the total cost of the transportation is as low as
possible. In order to solve this problem, we developed several hybrid variants
of the nearest neighbor classical approach. The proposed models are analyzed on
a set of instances used in the literature. The preliminary results shows that
the newly approaches are attractive and appropriate for solving the described
transportation problem.
