We consider the Rosenau equation, which contains nonlinear dispersive
effects. We prove that as the diffusion parameter tends to zero, the solutions
of the dispersive equation converge to discontinuous weak solution of the
Burgers equation. The proof relies on deriving suitable a priori estimates
together with an application of the compensated compactness method in the L^p
setting.
