We study the large time behavior of Lipschitz continuous, possibly unbounded,
viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi Equations in the whole space $\R^N$. The
associated ergodic problem has Lipschitz continuous solutions if the analogue
of the ergodic constant is larger than a minimal value $\lambda_{min}$. We
obtain various large-time convergence and Liouville type theorems, some of them
being of completely new type. We also provide examples showing that, in this
unbounded framework, the ergodic behavior may fail, and that the asymptotic
behavior may also be unstable with respect to the initial data.
