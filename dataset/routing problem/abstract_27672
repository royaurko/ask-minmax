We prove results relative to the problem of finding sharp bounds for the
affine invariant $P(K)=V(\Pi K)/V^{d-1}(K)$. Namely, we prove that if $K$ is a
3-dimensional zonoid of volume 1, then its second projection body $\Pi^2K$ is
contained in 8K, while if $K$ is any symmetric 3-dimensional convex body of
volume 1, then $\Pi^2K$ contains 6K. Both inclusions are sharp. Consequences of
these results include a stronger version of a reverse isoperimetric inequality
for 3-dimensional zonoids-established by the contributor in a previous work, a
reduction for the 3-dimensional Petty conjecture to another isoperimetric
problem and the best known lower bound up to date for $P(K)$ in 3 dimensions.
As byproduct of our methods, we establish an almost optimal lower bound for
high-dimensional bodies of revolution.
