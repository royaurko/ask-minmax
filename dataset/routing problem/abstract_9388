A set $G$ of points on a 1.5-dimensional terrain, also known as an
$x$-monotone polygonal chain, is said to guard the terrain if any point on the
terrain is 'seen' by a point in $G$. Two points on the terrain see each other
if and only if the line segment between them is never strictly below the
terrain. The minimum terrain guarding problem asks for a minimum guarding set
for the given input terrain. We prove that the decision version of this problem
is NP-hard. This solves a significant open problem and complements recent
positive approximability results for the optimization problem.
  Our proof uses a reduction from PLANAR 3-SAT. We build gadgets capable of
'mirroring' a consistent variable assignment back and forth across a main
valley. The structural simplicity of 1.5-dimensional terrains makes it
difficult to build general clause gadgets that do not destroy this assignment
when they are evaluated. However, we exploit the structure in instances of
PLANAR 3-SAT to find very specific operations involving only 'adjacent'
variables. For these restricted operations we can construct gadgets that allow
a full reduction to work.
