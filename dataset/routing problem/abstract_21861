In this paper we give results about projective embeddings of Riemann
surfaces, smooth or nodal, which we apply to the inverse Dirichlet-to-Neumann
problem and to the inversion of a Riemann-Klein theorem. To produce useful
embeddings, we adapt a technique of Bishop in the open bordered case and use
Runge type harmonic approximation theorem in the compact case.
