This paper presents a novel methodology to test the security of the
Diffie-Hellman public key exchange protocol. The security of many cryptographic
schemes rely on the hardness of this problem. We are presenting a purely
statistical test to compare this problem in different groups. We are using
groups included in the Zp group with p prime as a major example, however the
methods presented are not restricted to these groups. The presentation of the
results is primarily intended to introduce novel applications of statistical
methodologies to the area of mathematical cryptography. As such we will
emphasize the cryptographical aspects of the work more than the statistical
notions.
