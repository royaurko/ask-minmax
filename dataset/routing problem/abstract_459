Traditional topology-based MANET routing protocols use stateful routing which
increases the processing,communication and memory overheads. The high mobility
of nodes in MANETs makes it difficult to maintain a deterministic route. To
overcome this, stateless geographic routing protocols which ensure reliable
data delivery have been proposed. It is found that link instability can be a
major factor for unreliable data delivery. Driven by this issue, Link and
Position based Opportunistic Routing (L-POR) protocol which chooses a forwarder
based on the reception power of a node has been proposed. A back-up scheme is
also proposed to handle communication holes. Simulation results show that the
proposed protocol achieves excellent performance even under high node mobility.
