For a class of scalar fields including the massless Klein-Gordon field the
general relativistic hyperboloidal initial value problems are equivalent in a
certain sense. By using this equivalence and conformal techniques it is proven
that the hyperboloidal initial value problem for those scalar fields has an
unique solution which is weakly asymptotically flat. For data sufficiently
close to data for flat spacetime there exist a smooth future null infinity and
a regular future timelike infinity.
