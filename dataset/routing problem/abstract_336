Mobile Ad hoc Networks are highly dynamic networks. Quality of Service (QoS)
routing in such networks is usually limited by the network breakage due to
either node mobility or energy depletion of the mobile nodes. Also, to fulfill
certain quality parameters, presence of multiple node-disjoint paths becomes
essential. Such paths aid in the optimal traffic distribution and reliability
in case of path breakages. Thus, to cater various challenges in QoS routing in
Mobile Add hoc Networks, a Node Disjoint Multipath Routing Considering Link and
Node Stability (NDMLNR) protocol has been proposed by the contributors. The metric
used to select the paths takes into account the stability of the nodes and the
corresponding links. This paper studies various challenges in the QoS routing
and presents the characteristic evaluation of NDMLNR w.r.t various existing
protocols in this area.
