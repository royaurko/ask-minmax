In the present work we address the problem of evaluating the historical
performance of a trading strategy or a certain portfolio of assets. Common
indicators such as the Sharpe ratio and the risk adjusted return have
significant drawbacks. In particular, they are global indices, that is they do
not preserve any 'local' information about the performance dynamics either in
time or for a particular investment horizon. This information could be
fundamental for practitioners as the past performance can be affected by the
non-stationarity of financial market. In order to highlight this feature, we
introduce the 'local risk decomposition' (LRD) formalism, where dynamical
information about a strategy's performance is retained. This framework,
motivated by the multi-scaling techniques used in complex system theory, is
particularly suitable for high-frequency trading systems and can be applied
into problems of strategy optimization.
