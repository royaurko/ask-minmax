A major challenge in single particle reconstruction from cryo-electron
microscopy is to establish a reliable ab-initio three-dimensional model using
two-dimensional projection images with unknown orientations. Common-lines based
methods estimate the orientations without additional geometric information.
However, such methods fail when the detection rate of common-lines is too low
due to the high level of noise in the images. An approximation to the least
squares global self consistency error was obtained using convex relaxation by
semidefinite programming. In this paper we introduce a more robust global self
consistency error and show that the corresponding optimization problem can be
solved via semidefinite relaxation. In order to prevent artificial clustering
of the estimated viewing directions, we further introduce a spectral norm term
that is added as a constraint or as a regularization term to the relaxed
minimization problem. The resulted problems are solved by using either the
alternating direction method of multipliers or an iteratively reweighted least
squares procedure. Numerical experiments with both simulated and real images
demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly reduce the orientation
estimation error when the detection rate of common-lines is low.
