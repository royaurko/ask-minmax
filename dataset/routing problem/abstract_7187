In this paper we address the problem of designing receding horizon control
algorithms for linear discrete-time systems with parametric uncertainty. We do
not consider presence of stochastic forcing or process noise in the system. It
is assumed that the parametric uncertainty is probabilistic in nature with
known probability density functions. We use generalized polynomial chaos theory
to design the proposed stochastic receding horizon control algorithms. In this
framework, the stochastic problem is converted to a deterministic problem in
higher dimensional space. The performance of the proposed receding horizon
control algorithms is assessed using a linear model with two states.
