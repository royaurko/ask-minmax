For a given a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold, whose stable and
unstable manifolds intersect transversally, we consider several tools and
techniques to detect trajectories with prescribed itineraries: the scattering
map, the transition map, the method of correctly aligned windows, and the
shadowing lemma. We provide an user's guide on how to apply these tools and
techniques to detect unstable orbits in Hamiltonian systems. This consists in
the following steps: (i) computation of the scattering map and of the
transition map for a flow, (ii) reduction to the scattering map and to the
transition map, respectively, for the return map to some surface of section,
(iii) construction of sequences of windows within the surface of section, with
the successive pairs of windows correctly aligned, alternately, under the
transition map, and under some power of the inner map, (iv) detection of
trajectories which follow closely those windows. We illustrate this strategy
with two models: the large gap problem for nearly integrable Hamiltonian
systems, and the the spatial circular restricted three-body problem.
