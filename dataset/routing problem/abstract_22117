The paper attempts to describe the space of possible mind designs by first
equating all minds to software. Next it proves some interesting properties of
the mind design space such as infinitude of minds, size and representation
complexity of minds. A survey of mind design taxonomies is followed by a
proposal for a new field of investigation devoted to study of minds,
intellectology, a list of open problems for this new field is presented.
