The lower dimensional Busemann-Petty problem asks whether origin symmetric
convex bodies in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with smaller volume of all $k$-dimensional
sections necessarily have smaller volume. As proved by Bourgain and Zhang, the
answer to this question is negative if $k>3$. The problem is still open for
$k=2,3$. In this article we formulate and completely solve the lower
dimensional Busemann-Petty problem in the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$.
