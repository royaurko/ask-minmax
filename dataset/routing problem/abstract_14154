We reconsider the geometrically nonlinear Cosserat model for a uniformly
convex elastic energy and write the equilibrium problem as a minimization
problem. Applying the direct methods of the calculus of variations we show the
existence of minimizers. We present a clear proof based on the coercivity of
the elastically stored energy density and on the weak lower semi-continuity of
the total energy functional. Use is made of the dislocation density tensor
$\bar{\boldsymbol{K}}=\bar{\boldsymbol{R}}^T\,\mathrm{Curl}\,\bar{\boldsymbol{R}}$
as a suitable Cosserat curvature measure.
