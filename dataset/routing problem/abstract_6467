Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $\neq 2$. We survey a general method of
the field intersection problem of generic polynomials via formal Tschirnhausen
transformation. We announce some of our recent results of cubic, quartic and
quintic cases the details of which are to appear elsewhere. In this note, we
give an explicit answer to the problem in the cases of cubic and dihedral
quintic by using multi-resolvent polynomials.
