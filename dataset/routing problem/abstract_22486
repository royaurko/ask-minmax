Looking for and studying very distant galaxy clusters, clusters at z>1, are
one of the prime subjects of the modern observational cosmology. If the
metallicity of the hot intra-cluster medium in very distant galaxy clusters is
measured for example, it provides fruitful informations for us to understand
the formation and evolution of galaxies. However, difficulty of the study is
that there is few confirmed very distant galaxy clusters yet. We first have to
search for very distant clusters but it requires very deep observations. A
random selection of sky is not practical. We have to select the sky. In this
article, it is demonstrated that missing lens problem has close connection with
very distant cluster of galaxies and dark lens searches could open a new window
for studying very distant cluster of galaxies. Firstly, the missing lens
problem is summarized and dark lens search is defined. Next, our results for
two dark lenses are summarized especially focused on the topics related to the
nature of the very distant clusters.
