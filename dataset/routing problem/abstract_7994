We introduce a Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean-field approach to treat the
problem of proton emission from a deformed nucleus. By substituting a rigid
rotor in a particle-rotor-model with a mean-field we obtain a better
description of experimental data in $^{141}$Ho. The approach also elucidates
the softening of kinematic coupling between particle and collective rotation,
the Coriolis attenuation problem.
