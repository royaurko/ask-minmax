Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) is attracting considerable attention from
the research community and the automotive industry to improve the services of
Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). As today's transportation system faces
serious challenges in terms of road safety, efficiency, and environmental
friendliness, the idea of so called "ITS" has emerged. Due to the expensive
cost of deployment and complexity of implementing such a system in real world,
research in VANET relies on simulation. This paper attempts to evaluate the
performance of VANET in a realistic environment. The paper contributes by
generating a real world road Map of JNU using existing Google Earth and GIS
tools. Traffic data from a limited region of road Map is collected to capture
the realistic mobility. In this work, the entire region has been divided into
various smaller routes. The realistic mobility model used here considers the
driver's route choice at the run time. It also studies the clustering effect
caused by traffic lights used at the intersection to regulate traffic movement
at different directions. Finally, the performance of the VANET is evaluated in
terms of average delivery ratio, packet loss, and router drop as statistical
measures for driver route choice with traffic light scenario. This experiment
has provided insight into the performance of vehicular traffic communication
for a small realistic scenario.
