There is described a spacetime formulation of both nonrelativistic and
relativistic elasticity. Specific attention is devoted to the causal structure
of the theories and the availability of local existence theorems for the
initial-value problem. Much of the presented material is based on joint work of
B.G.Schmidt and the contributor (in Class.Quantum Grav.\textbf{20} (2003), 889-904).
