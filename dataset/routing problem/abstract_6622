After a few remarks about the problem of extracting transport coefficients
from lattice QCD calculations, I report on recent developments in applying
stochastic quantization and complex Langevin dynamics to field theories with a
complex action due to a nonzero chemical potential. First results demonstrate
that the sign problem poses no obstacle for this approach, even in the
thermodynamic limit. I conclude with a comparison of two simple one-link
models, describing a euclidean system at finite chemical potential and a
Minkowski system in real time.
