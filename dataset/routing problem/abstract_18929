Contact algorithm between different bodies plays an important role in solving
collision problems. Usually it is not easy to be treated very well. Several
ones for material point method were proposed by Bardenhangen, Brackbill, and
  Sulsky\cite{Bardenhagen2000,Bardenhagen2001}, Hu and Chen\cite{Hu_Chen2003}.
  An improved one for three-dimensional material point method is presented in
this paper. The improved algorithm emphasizes the energy conservation of the
system and faithfully recovers opposite acting forces between contacting
bodies. Contrasted to the one by Bardenhagen, both the normal and tangential
contacting forces are more appropriately applied to the contacting bodies via
the contacting nodes of the background mesh; Contrasted to the one by Hu and
Chen, not only the tangential velocities but also the normal ones are handled
separately in respective individual mesh. This treatment ensures not only the
contact/sliding/separation procedure but also the friction between contacting
bodies are recovered. The presented contact algorithm is validated via
numerical experiments including rolling simulation, impact of elastic spheres,
impact of a Taylor bar and impact of plastic spheres. The numerical results
show that the multi-mesh material point method with the improved contact
algorithm is more suitable for solving collision problems.
