We present a zero-range pseudopotential applicable for all partial wave
interactions between neutral atoms. For p- and d-waves we derive effective
pseudopotentials, which are useful for problems involving anisotropic external
potentials. Finally, we consider two nontrivial applications of the p-wave
pseudopotential: we solve analytically the problem of two interacting
spin-polarized fermions confined in a harmonic trap, and analyze the scattering
of p-wave interacting particles in a quasi-two-dimensional system.
