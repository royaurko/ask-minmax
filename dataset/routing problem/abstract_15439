Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems have the potential to deliver
higher system throughput, compared to contemporary orthogonal multiple access
techniques. For a linearly precoded multiple-input multiple-output (MISO)
system, we study the downlink sum rate maximization problem, when the NOMA
principles are applied. Being a non-convex and intractable optimization
problem,we resort to approximate it with a minorization-maximization algorithm
(MMA), which is a widely used tool in statistics. In each step of the MMA, we
solve a second-order cone program, such that the feasibility set in each step
contains that of the previous one, and is always guaranteed to be a subset of
the feasibility set of the original problem. It should be noted that the
algorithm takes a few iterations to converge. Furthermore, we study the
conditions under which the achievable rates maximization can be further
simplified to a low complexity design problem, and we compute the probability
of occurrence of this event. Numerical examples are conducted to show a
comparison of the proposed approach against conventional multiple access
systems. NOMA is reported to provide better spectral and power efficiency with
a polynomial time computational complexity.
