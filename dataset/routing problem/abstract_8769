The existence of three smooth solutions, one negative, one positive, and one
nodal, to a homogeneous Robin problem with $p$-Laplacian and Carath\'eodory
reaction is established. No sub-critical growth condition is taken on. Proofs
exploit variational as well as truncation techniques. The case $p=2$ is
separately examined, obtaining a further nodal solution via Morse's theory.
