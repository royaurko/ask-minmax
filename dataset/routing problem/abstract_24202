In this paper, a method to construct topological template in terms of
symbolic dynamics for the diamagnetic Kepler problem is proposed. To confirm
the topological template, rotation numbers of invariant manifolds around
unstable periodic orbits in a phase space are taken as an object of comparison.
The rotation numbers are determined from the definition and connected with
symbolic sequences encoding the periodic orbits in a reduced Poincar\'e
section. Only symbolic codes with inverse ordering in the forward mapping can
contribute to the rotation of invariant manifolds around the periodic orbits.
By using symbolic ordering, the reduced Poincar\'e section is constricted along
stable manifolds and a topological template, which preserves the ordering of
forward sequences and can be used to extract the rotation numbers, is
established. The rotation numbers computed from the topological template are
the same as those computed from their original definition.
