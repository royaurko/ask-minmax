The Cooper problem is studied numerically for the Anderson model with
disorder in two-dimensions. It is shown that the attractive Hubbard interaction
creates a phase of bi-particle localized states in the regime where
non-interacting states are delocalized. This phase cannot be obtained in the
mean-field approximation and the pair coupling energy is strongly enhanced in
this regime. The effects of magnetic field are studied and it is shown that
under certain conditions they lead to delocalization.
