In this paper, the concepts of Pareto $H$-eigenvalue and Pareto
$Z$-eigenvalue are introduced for studying constrained minimization problem and
the necessary and sufficient conditions of such eigenvalues are given. It is
proved that a symmetric tensor has at least one Pareto $H$-eigenvalue (Pareto
$Z$-eigenvalue). Furthermore, the minimum Pareto $H$-eigenvalue (or Pareto
$Z$-eigenvalue) of a symmetric tensor is exactly equal to the minimum value of
constrained minimization problem of homogeneous polynomial deduced by such a
tensor, which gives an alternative methods for solving the minimum value of
constrained minimization problem. In particular, a symmetric tensor
$\mathcal{A}$ is copositive if and only if every Pareto $H$-eigenvalue
($Z-$eigenvalue) of $\mathcal{A}$ is non-negative.
