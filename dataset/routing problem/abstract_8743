In this article, we investigate the wave equation in spiral geometry and
study the modes of vibrations of a one-dimensional (1-D) string in spiral
shape. Here we show that the problem of wave propagation along a spiral can be
reduced to Bessel differential equation and hence, very closely related to the
problem of radial waves of two-dimensional (2-D) vibrating membrane in circular
geometry.
