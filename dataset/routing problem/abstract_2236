In the performance evaluation of a protocol for a vehicular ad hoc network,
the protocol should be tested under a realistic conditions including,
representative data traffic models, and realistic movements of the mobile nodes
which are the vehicles (i.e., a mobility model). This work is a comparative
study between two mobility models that are used in the simulations of vehicular
networks, i.e., MOVE (MObility model generator for VEhicular networks) and
CityMob, a mobility pattern generator for VANET. We describe several mobility
models for VANET simulations. In this paper we aim to show that the mobility
models can significantly affect the simulation results in VANET networks. The
results presented in this article prove the importance of choosing a suitable
real world scenario for performances studies of routing protocols in this kind
of network.
