We study asymptotics of the recurrence coefficients of orthogonal polynomials
associated to the generalized Jacobi weight, which is a weight function with a
finite number of algebraic singularities on $[-1,1]$. The recurrence
coefficients can be written in terms of the solution of the corresponding
Riemann-Hilbert problem for orthogonal polynomials. Using the steepest descent
method of Deift and Zhou, we analyze the Riemann-Hilbert problem, and obtain
complete asymptotic expansions of the recurrence coefficients. We will
determine explicitly the order $1/n$ terms in the expansions. A critical step
in the analysis of the Riemann-Hilbert problem will be the local analysis
around the algebraic singularities, for which we use Bessel functions of
appropriate order.
