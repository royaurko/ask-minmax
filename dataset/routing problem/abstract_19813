We examine discrete gauge symmetries in axionic extensions of the SSM which
provide a solution of the $\mu$-problem. Automatic-PQ symmetry and proton
stability are shown to be guaranteed by certain discrete symmetries. Focusing
on the L-violating discrete symmetries we discuss two sources of neutrino
masses and their relevance for the solar neutrino problem.
