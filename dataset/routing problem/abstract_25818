The Logit lane assignment model has been introduced recently in order to
describe multi-lane traffic flow from a macroscopic point of view. The model is
based on the idea that each available lane has a specific utility for each
driver, who chooses the lane with the highest utility. The model is expressed
by a system of conservation laws with a smooth but implicitly defined flux
function. The first aim of the paper is to explore on two data-sets how traffic
data supports the fact that traffic speed constitutes an explanatory variable
of lane assignment. Second the paper addresses the problem of discretization of
the model. Several numerical schemes are proposed: Lax-Friedrichs,
Euler-lagrange remap, Lagrange, and their convergence properties are
illustrated on the treatment of the Riemann problem. Directions for future
research are outlined.
