A restricted case of the Circuit Value Problem known as the Sequential NOR
Circuit Value Problem was recently used to obtain very succinct examples of
conjunctive grammars, Boolean grammars and language equations representing
P-complete languages (Okhotin, http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-74593-8_23
"A simple P-complete problem and its representations by language equations",
MCU 2007). In this paper, a new encoding of the same problem is proposed, and a
trellis automaton (one-way real-time cellular automaton) with 11 states solving
this problem is constructed.
