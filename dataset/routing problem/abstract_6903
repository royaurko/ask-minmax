A new numerical method for an inverse problem for an elliptic equation with
unknown potential is proposed. In this problem the point source is running
along a straight line and the source-dependent Dirichlet boundary condition is
measured as the data for the inverse problem. A rigorous convergence analysis
shows that this method converges globally, provided that the so-called tail
function is approximated well. This approximation is verified in numerical
experiments, so as the global convergence. Applications to medical imaging,
imaging of targets on battlefields and to electrical impedance tomography are
discussed.
