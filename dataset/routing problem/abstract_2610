We found that the transport Jc of the ex-situ PIT processed (Ba,K)Fe2As2
(Ba-122) wire with single Ag sheath can be significantly enhanced by repeating
the combined process of rolling and heat treatment. The transport Jc (4.2 K and
10 T) of 4.4 x 103 A/cm2 (Ic =15.7 A) was obtained for a thin tape of 0.3 mm in
thickness, which is the highest value reported so far for the PIT processed 122
wires and tapes with a Ag sheath and processed by a conventional route. The
measurement by a hybrid magnet showed that Jc-H curve maintains very small
field dependence up to the strong magnetic field of 28 T as expected from the
previously reported high Hc2 value. The core of the thin tape shows dense grain
structure with less cracks and voids and indicates the development of c-axis
alignment, although it is still incomplete. The researches to elucidate the
origin of Jc enhancement and to have further improvement of transport Jc are
now ongoing. The process is simple using a Ag single sheath and, therefore,
more realistic technique for long length wire production.
