We consider the problem of creating fair course timetables in the setting of
a university. Our motivation is to improve the overall satisfaction of
individuals concerned (students, teachers, etc.) by providing a fair timetable
to them. The central idea is that undesirable arrangements in the course
timetable, i.e., violations of soft constraints, should be distributed in a
fair way among the individuals. We propose two formulations for the fair course
timetabling problem that are based on max-min fairness and Jain's fairness
index, respectively. Furthermore, we present and experimentally evaluate an
optimization algorithm based on simulated annealing for solving max-min fair
course timetabling problems. The new contribution is concerned with measuring
the energy difference between two timetables, i.e., how much worse a timetable
is compared to another timetable with respect to max-min fairness. We introduce
three different energy difference measures and evaluate their impact on the
overall algorithm performance. The second proposed problem formulation focuses
on the tradeoff between fairness and the total amount of soft constraint
violations. Our experimental evaluation shows that the known best solutions to
the ITC2007 curriculum-based course timetabling instances are quite fair with
respect to Jain's fairness index. However, the experiments also show that the
fairness can be improved further for only a rather small increase in the total
amount of soft constraint violations.
