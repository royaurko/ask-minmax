We investigate the potential and limitations of the wave generation by
disturbances moving at the bottom. More precisely, we assume that the wavemaker
is composed of an underwater object of a given shape which can be displaced
according to a prescribed trajectory. We address the practical question of
computing the wavemaker shape and trajectory generating a wave with prescribed
characteristics. For the sake of simplicity we model the hydrodynamics by a
generalized forced Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (BBM) equation. This practical problem
is reformulated as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem. Additional
constraints are imposed in order to fulfill various practical design
requirements. Finally, we present some numerical results in order to
demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology.
