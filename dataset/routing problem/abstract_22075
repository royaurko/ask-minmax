In the present paper, we handle the problem of finding a hypersurface family
from a given asymptotic curve in R^4. Using the Frenet frame of the given
asymptotic curve, we express the hypersurface as a linear combination of this
frame and analyze the necessary and sufficient conditions for that curve to be
asymptotic. We illustrate this method by presenting some examples.
