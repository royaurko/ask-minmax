In this paper, we use the maximum principle to get the gradient estimate for
the solutions of the prescribed mean curvature equation with Neumann boundary
value problem, which gives a positive answer for the question raised by
Lieberman \cite{Lieb13} in page 360. As a consequence, we obtain the
corresponding existence theorem for a class of mean curvature equations.
Moreover we can get a new proof of the gradient estimates for the mean
curvature equation with prescribed contact angle boundary value problem.
