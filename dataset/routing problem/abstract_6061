In this paper, we consider a zero error coordination problem wherein the
nodes of a network exchange messages to be able to perfectly coordinate their
actions with the individual observations of each other. While previous works on
coordination commonly assume an asymptotically vanishing error, we assume
exact, zero error coordination. Furthermore, unlike previous works that employ
the empirical or strong notions of coordination, we define and use a notion of
set coordination. This notion of coordination bears similarities with the
empirical notion of coordination. We observe that set coordination, in its
special case of two nodes with a one-way communication link is equivalent with
the "Hide and Seek" source coding problem of McEliece and Posner. The Hide and
Seek problem has known intimate connections with graph entropy, rate distortion
theory, Renyi mutual information and even error exponents. Other special cases
of the set coordination problem relate to Witsenhausen's zero error rate and
the distributed computation problem. These connections motivate a better
understanding of set coordination, its connections with empirical coordination,
and its study in more general setups. This paper takes a first step in this
direction by proving new results for two node networks.
