We show how the highly accurate and efficient Constant Perturbation (CP)
technique for steady-state Schr\"odinger problems can be used in the solution
of time-dependent Schr\"odinger problems with explicitly time-dependent
Hamiltonians, following a technique suggested by Ixaru in Comput. Phys. Commun.
181 (2010). By introducing a sectorwise spatial discretization using bases of
accurately CP-computed eigenfunctions of carefully-chosen stationary problems,
we deal with the possible highy oscillatory behaviour of the wave function
while keeping the dimension of the resulting ODE system low. Also for the
time-integration of the ODE system a very effective CP-based approach can be
used.
