We improve the quantitative estimate for Roth's theorem on three-term
arithmetic progressions, showing that if $A\subset\{1,\ldots,N\}$ contains no
non-trivial three-term arithmetic progressions then $\lvert A\rvert\ll
N(\log\log N)^4/\log N$. By the same method we also improve the bounds in the
analogous problem over $\mathbb{F}_q[t]$ and for the problem of finding long
arithmetic progressions in a sumset.
