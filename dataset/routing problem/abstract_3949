We apply a proposal of Yuen and Tombesi, for treating stochastic problems
with negative diffusion, to the analytically soluble problem of the single-mode
anharmonic oscillator. We find that the associated stochastic realizations
include divergent trajectories. It is possible, however, to solve the
stochastic problem exactly, but the averaging must be performed with great
care.
