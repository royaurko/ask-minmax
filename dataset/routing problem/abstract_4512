We consider a class of discrete time stochastic control problems motivated by
some financial applications. We use a pathwise stochastic control approach to
provide a dual formulation of the problem. This enables us to develop a
numerical technique for obtaining an estimate of the value function which
improves on purely regression based methods. We demonstrate the competitiveness
of the method on the example of a gas storage valuation problem.
