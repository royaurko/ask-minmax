We introduce the concept of a threefold Post correspondence system (3PCS for
short) and we consider it as an instance of the threefold Post correspondence
problem. With each 3PCS, we associate three Post correspondence systems, i.e.,
three instances of the Post correspondence problem. We conjecture that for each
3PCS, the question of the threefold Post correspondence problem or for some
associated Post correspondence system the question of the Post correspondence
problem is decidable.
