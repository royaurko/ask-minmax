With the advent of the LHC and the continuing influx of cosmological data,
phenomenological aspects of string theory have received renewed attention in
recent years and many problems have been properly incorporated in this
framework. In this Dissertation, we suggest new string-related candidates for
the origin of dark energy and dark matter and propose ways of searching for
string resonances at the LHC.
