We consider the problem of recovering a target matrix that is a superposition
of low-rank and sparse components, from a small set of linear measurements.
This problem arises in compressed sensing of structured high-dimensional
signals such as videos and hyperspectral images, as well as in the analysis of
transformation invariant low-rank recovery. We analyze the performance of the
natural convex heuristic for solving this problem, under the assumption that
measurements are chosen uniformly at random. We prove that this heuristic
exactly recovers low-rank and sparse terms, provided the number of observations
exceeds the number of intrinsic degrees of freedom of the component signals by
a polylogarithmic factor. Our analysis introduces several ideas that may be of
independent interest for the more general problem of compressed sensing and
decomposing superpositions of multiple structured signals.
