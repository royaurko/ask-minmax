This paper studies the numerical solution of traveling singular sources
problems. In such problems, a big challenge is the sources move with different
speeds, which are described by some ordinary differential equations. A
predictor-corrector algorithm is presented to simulate the position of singular
sources. Then a moving mesh method in conjunction with domain decomposition is
derived for the underlying PDE. According to the positions of the sources, the
whole domain is splitted into several subdomains, where moving mesh equations
are solved respectively. On the resulting mesh, the computation of jump
$[\dot{u}]$ is avoided and the discretization of the underlying PDE is reduced
into only two cases. In addition, the new method has a desired second-order of
the spatial convergence. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the
convergence rates and the efficiency of the method. Blow-up phenomenon is also
investigated for various motions of the sources.
