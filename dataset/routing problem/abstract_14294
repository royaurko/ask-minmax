In this paper the method of compensated compactness is applied to the problem
of isometric immersion of a two dimensional Riemannian manifold with negative
Gauss curvature into three dimensional Euclidean space. Previous applications
of the method to this problem have required decay of order $t^{-4}$ in the
Gauss curvature. Here we show that the decay of Hong $t^{-2-\delta/2}$ where
$\delta\in(0,4)$ suffices.
