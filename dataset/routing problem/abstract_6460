A $k$-symplectic framework for classical field theories subject to
nonholonomic constraints is presented. If the constrained problem is regular
one can construct a projection operator such that the solutions of the
constrained problem are obtained by projecting the solutions of the free
problem. Symmetries for the nonholonomic system are introduced and we show that
for every such symmetry, there exist a nonholonomic momentum equation. The
proposed formalism permits to introduce in a simple way many tools of
nonholonomic mechanics to nonholonomic field theories.
