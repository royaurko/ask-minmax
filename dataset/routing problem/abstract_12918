We consider the planar $N$-centre problem, with homogeneous potentials of
degree $-\a<0$, $\a \in [1,2)$. We prove the existence of infinitely many
collisions-free periodic solutions with negative and small energy, for any
distribution of the centres inside a compact set. The proof is based upon
topological, variational and geometric arguments. The existence result allows
to characterize the associated dynamical system with a symbolic dynamics, where
the symbols are the partitions of the $N$ centres in two non-empty sets.
