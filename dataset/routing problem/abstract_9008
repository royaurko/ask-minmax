We investigate a controversial issue on the measure of CP violation in strong
in teractions. In the presence of nontrivial topological gauge configurations,
the $\theta$-term in QCD has a profound effect: it breaks the CP symmetry. The
CP-violating amplitude is shown to be determined by the vacuum tunneling
process, where the semiclassical method makes most sense. We discuss a
long-standing dispute on whether the instanton dynamics satisfies or not the
anomalous Ward identity (AWI). The strong CP violation measure, when complying
with the vacuum alignment, is proportional to the topological susceptibility.
We obtain an effective CP-violating lagrangian different from that provided by
Baluni. To solve the IR divergence problem of the instanton computation, We
present a ``classically gauged'' Georgi-Manohar model and derive an effective
potential which uniquely determines an explicit $U(1)_A$ symmetry breaking
sector. The CP violation effects are analyzed in this model. It is shown that
the strong CP problem and the $U(1)$ problem are closely related. Some possible
solutions to both problems are also discussed with new insights.
