Extracting text objects from the PDF images is a challenging problem. The
text data present in the PDF images contain certain useful information for
automatic annotation, indexing etc. However variations of the text due to
differences in text style, font, size, orientation, alignment as well as
complex structure make the problem of automatic text extraction extremely
difficult and challenging job. This paper presents two techniques under
block-based classification. After a brief introduction of the classification
methods, two methods were enhanced and results were evaluated. The performance
metrics for segmentation and time consumption are tested for both the models.
