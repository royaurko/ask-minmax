In this note we prove that a generic Riemannian manifold of dimension $\geq
3$ does not admit any nontrivial local conformal diffeomorphisms. This is a
conformal analog of a result of Sunada concerning local isometries, and makes
precise the principle that generic manifolds in high dimensions do not have
conformal symmetries. Consequently, generic manifolds of dimension $\geq 3$ do
not admit nontrivial conformal Killing vector fields near any point. As an
application to the inverse problem of Calder\'on on manifolds, this implies
that generic manifolds of dimension $\geq 3$ do not admit limiting Carleman
weights near any point.
