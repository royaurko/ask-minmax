Energy Conservation and prolonging the life of Wireless Sensor Network is one
of the major issues in the wireless sensor network as sensor nodes are highly
energy constrained devices. Many routing protocols have been proposed for
sensor network, especially cluster based routing protocols. Cluster based
routing protocols are best known for its energy efficiency, network stability
and for increasing the life time of the sensor network. Low Energy Adaptive
Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) is one of the fundamental protocols in this class.
In this research paper we propose a new energy efficient cluster based protocol
(EECP) for single hop heterogeneous wireless sensor network to increase the
life of a sensor network. Our sensor protocol use the distance of the sensor
from the sink as the major issue for the selection of a cluster in the sensor
network.
