In this paper we study the existence of maximizers for two families of
interpolation inequalities, namely a generalized Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality
and a new inequality involving the Riesz energy. Two basic tools in our
argument are a generalization of Lieb's Translation Lemma and a Riesz energy
version of the Br\'ezis--Lieb lemma.
