We give a detailed description of the geometry of single droplet patterns in
a nonlocal isoperimetric problem. In particular we focus on the sharp interface
limit of the Ohta-Kawasaki free energy for diblock copolymers, regarded as a
paradigm for those energies modeling physical systems characterized by a
competition between short and a long-range interactions. Exploiting fine
properties of the regularity theory for minimal surfaces, we extend previous
partial results in different directions and give robust tools for the geometric
analysis of more complex patterns.
