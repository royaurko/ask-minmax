We study the Cauchy problem for a multidimensional scalar conservation law
with merely continuous flux vector in the class of Besicovitch almost periodic
functions. The existence and uniqueness of entropy solutions are established.
We propose also the necessary and sufficient condition for the decay of almost
periodic entropy solutions as time $t\to+\infty$.
