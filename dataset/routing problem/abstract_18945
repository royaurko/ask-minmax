In this paper we consider the drag force problem in the STU model. Already
this problem and related topics were studied in ${\mathcal N}=4$ SYM theory.
Here we study the same problem in ${\mathcal N}=2$ supergravity theory with an
R-charge black hole (the STU model). This paper extends our previous work [1,2]
by studying more general charge configurations and by taking into account the
effect of a constant electromagnetic field and higher derivative corrections.
We consider a single quark and a $q \bar q$ pair in a three charge non-extremal
black hole background. First by using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we obtain the
drag force, the diffusion coefficient, the total energy and momentum,
quasinormal modes, and the effect of higher derivative corrections for the
single quark. Next we calculate the drag force for a $q \bar q$ pair which
rotates around its center of mass. For the first time we study the motion of a
rotating $q \bar q$ pair in ${\mathcal N}=2$ supergravity theory. We show that
our results in the near-extremal limit agree with the energy loss of the moving
quark which was calculated in the ${\mathcal N}=4$ SYM plasma.
