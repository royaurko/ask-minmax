The Busemann-Petty problem asks whether origin symmetric convex bodies in
$\R^n$ with smaller hyperplane sections necessarily have smaller volume. The
answer is affirmative if $n\leq 3$ and negative if $n\geq 4.$ We consider a
class of convex bodies that have a certain invariance property with respect to
their ordered k-tuples of coordinates in $\R^{kn}$ and prove the corresponding
problem.
