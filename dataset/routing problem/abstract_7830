We present a new algorithm to solve the conjugacy problem in Artin braid
groups, which is faster than the one presented by Birman, Ko and Lee. This
algorithm can be applied not only to braid groups, but to all Garside groups
(which include finite type Artin groups and torus knot groups among others).
