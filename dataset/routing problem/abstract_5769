The corona problem was motivated by the question of the density of the open
unit disk D in the maximal ideal space of the algebra, H1(D), of bounded
holomorphic functions on D. In this note we study relationships of the problem
with questions in operator theory and complex geometry. We use the framework of
Hilbert modules focusing on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of holomorphic
functions on a domain, in Cm. We interpret several of the approaches to the
corona problem from this point of view. A few new observations are made along
the way. 2012 MSC: 46515, 32A36, 32A70, 30H80, 30H10, 32A65, 32A35, 32A38
