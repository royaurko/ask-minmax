We prove some extension theorems for analytic objects, in particular sections
of a coherent sheaf, defined in semi q-coronae of a complex space. Semi
q-coronae are domains whose boundary is the union of a Levi flat part, a
q-pseudoconvex part and a q-pseudoconcave part. Such results are obtained
mainly using cohomological techniques.
