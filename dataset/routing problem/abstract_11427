We solve the Cauchy problem of the Ward model in light-cone coordinates using
the inverse spectral (scattering) method. In particular we show that the
solution can be constructed by solving a $2\times 2$ local matrix
Riemann-Hilbert problem which is uniquely defined in terms of the initial data.
These results are also directly applicable to the 2+1 Chiral model.
