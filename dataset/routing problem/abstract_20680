For a two-phase (liquid-gas) two-component (water-hydrogen) system in porous
media we discuss the formulation of the possible dissolution of hydrogen in the
liquid phase. We show how Henry's law fits in a phase diagram. Then the problem
is formulated as a set of nonlinear partial differential equations with
complementarity constraints.
