A reference set, or a fiber, of a contingency table is the space of all
realizations of the table under a given set of constraints such as marginal
totals. Understanding the geometry of this space is a key problem in algebraic
statistics, important for conducting exact conditional inference, calculating
cell bounds, imputing missing cell values, and assessing the risk of disclosure
of sensitive information.
  Motivated primarily by disclosure limitation problems where constraints can
come from summary statistics other than the margins, in this paper we study the
space $\mathcal{F_T}$ of all possible multi-way contingency tables for a given
sample size and set of observed conditional frequencies. We show that this
space can be decomposed according to different possible marginals, which, in
turn, are encoded by the solution set of a linear Diophantine equation. We
characterize the difference between two fibers: $\mathcal{F_T}$ and the space
of tables for a given set of corresponding marginal totals. In particular, we
solve a generalization of an open problem posed by Dobra et al. (2008). Our
decomposition of $\mathcal{F_T}$ has two important consequences: (1) we derive
new cell bounds, some including connections to Directed Acyclic Graphs, and (2)
we describe a structure for the Markov bases for the space $\mathcal{F_T}$ that
leads to a simplified calculation of Markov bases in this particular setting.
