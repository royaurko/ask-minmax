A general framework based on Gaussian models and a MAP-EM algorithm is
introduced in this paper for solving matrix/table completion problems. The
numerical experiments with the standard and challenging movie ratings data show
that the proposed approach, based on probably one of the simplest probabilistic
models, leads to the results in the same ballpark as the state-of-the-art, at a
lower computational cost.
