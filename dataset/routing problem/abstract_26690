Some common systems modelling and simulation approaches for immune problems
are Monte Carlo simulations, system dynamics, discrete-event simulation and
agent-based simulation. These methods, however, are still not widely adopted in
immunology research. In addition, to our knowledge, there is few research on
the processes for the development of simulation models for the immune system.
Hence, for this work, we have two contributions to knowledge. The first one is
to show the importance of systems simulation to help immunological research and
to draw the attention of simulation developers to this research field. The
second contribution is the introduction of a quick guide containing the main
steps for modelling and simulation in immunology, together with challenges that
occur during the model development. Further, this paper introduces an example
of a simulation problem, where we test our guidelines.
