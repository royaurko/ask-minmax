Inverse problems for differential pencils with nonlocal conditions are
investigated. Several uniqueness theorems of inverse problems from the
Weyl-type function and spectra are proved, which are generalizations of the
well-known Weyl function and Borg's inverse problem for the classical
Sturm-Liouville operator.
