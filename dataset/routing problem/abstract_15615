A basic problem that confronts the standard cosmological models is the
problem of initial singularity characterised by infinite material density,
infinite temperature and infinite spacetime curvature. The inevitable existence
of such a phase of the universe may be considered to be one of the major
drawbacks of Einstein's field equations. To some extent inflation models
ameliorate this. In the present work we postulate that whenever matter
(radiation) arises in flat spacetime, it introduces curvature and causes a
repulsive interaction to develop. A modified energy momentum tensor is
introduced towards this end, which invokes the temperature, entropy and a
cosmic scalar field. This redefinition of the energy momentum distribution when
applied to the early universe dynamics has the effect of producing a
non-singular initial behaviour. the repulsive interaction introduces some
features of an accelarating universe. In this model all cosmological parameters
are mathematically well behaved. There is no flatness problem. Temperature at
the beginning of this universe is 10^32 kelvin.
