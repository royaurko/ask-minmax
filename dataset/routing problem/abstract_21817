In this article we consider the problem of unique continuation for a class of
high order equations of Korteweg-de Vries type which include the kdV hierachy.
It is proved that if the difference w of two solutions of an equation of this
form has certain exponential decay for x>0 at two different times, then w is
identically zero.
