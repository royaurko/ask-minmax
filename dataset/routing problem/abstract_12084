Let $H_d$ denote the smallest integer $n$ such that for every convex body $K$
in $\Re^d$ there is a $0<\lambda < 1$ such that $K$ is covered by $n$
translates of $\lambda K$. In the book \emph{Research problems in discrete
geometry.} by Brass, Moser and Pach, the following problem was posed: Is there
a $0<\lambda_d<1$ depending on $d$ only with the property that every convex
body $K$ in $\Re^d$ is covered by $H_d$ translates of $\lambda_d K$? We prove
the affirmative answer to the question and hence show that the
Gohberg--Markus--Boltyanski--Hadwiger Conjecture (according to which $H_d\leq
2^d$) holds if, and only if, a formally stronger version of it holds.
