Burst contention is a well known challenging problem in Optical Burst
Switching (OBS) networks. Deflection routing is used to resolve contention.
Burst retransmission is used to reduce the Burst Loss Ratio (BLR) by
retransmitting dropped bursts. Previous works show that combining deflection
and retransmission outperforms both pure deflection and pure retransmission
approaches. This paper proposes a new Adaptive Hybrid Deflection and
Retransmission (AHDR) approach that dynamically combines deflection and
retransmission approaches based on network conditions such as BLR and link
utilization. Network Simulator 2 (ns-2) is used to simulate the proposed
approach on different network topologies. Simulation results show that the
proposed approach outperforms static approaches in terms of BLR and goodput.
