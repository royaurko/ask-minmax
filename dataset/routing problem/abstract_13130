The impressive progress of the kinetic schemes in the solution of gas
dynamics problems and the development of effective parallel algorithms for
modern high performance parallel computing systems led to the development of
advanced methods for the solution of the magnetohydrodynamics problem in the
important area of plasma physics. The novel feature of the method is the
formulation of the complex Boltzmann-like distribution function of kinetic
method with the implementation of electromagnetic interaction terms. The
numerical method is based on the explicit schemes. Due to logical simplicity
and its efficiency, the algorithm is easily adapted to modern high performance
parallel computer systems including hybrid computing systems with graphic
processors.
