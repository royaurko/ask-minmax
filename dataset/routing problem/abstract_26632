Given a directed graph D = (V,A) we define its intersection graph I(D) =
(A,E) to be the graph having A as a node-set and two nodes of I(D) are adjacent
if their corresponding arcs share a common node that is the tail of at least
one of these arcs. We call these graphs facility location graphs since they
arise from the classical uncapacitated facility location problem. In this paper
we show that facility location graphs are hard to recognize and they are easy
to recognize when the graph is triangle-free. We also determine the complexity
of the vertex coloring, the stable set and the facility location problems on
that class.
