A fork stack is a generalised stack which allows pushes and pops of several
items at a time. We consider the problem of determining which input streams can
be sorted using a single forkstack, or dually, which permutations of a fixed
input stream can be produced using a single forkstack. An algorithm is given to
solve the sorting problem and the minimal unsortable sequences are found. The
results are extended to fork stacks where there are bounds on how many items
can be pushed and popped at one time. In this context we also establish how to
enumerate the collection of sortable sequences.
