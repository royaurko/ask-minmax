We propose a new gradient projection algorithm that compares favorably with
the fastest algorithms available to date for $\ell_1$-constrained sparse
recovery from noisy data, both in the compressed sensing and inverse problem
frameworks. The method exploits a line-search along the feasible direction and
an adaptive steplength selection based on recent strategies for the alternation
of the well-known Barzilai-Borwein rules. The convergence of the proposed
approach is discussed and a computational study on both well-conditioned and
ill-conditioned problems is carried out for performance evaluations in
comparison with five other algorithms proposed in the literature.
