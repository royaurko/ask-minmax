Artificial Immune Systems have been successfully applied to a number of
problem domains including fault tolerance and data mining, but have been shown
to scale poorly when applied to computer intrusion detec- tion despite the fact
that the biological immune system is a very effective anomaly detector. This
may be because AIS algorithms have previously been based on the adaptive immune
system and biologically-naive mod- els. This paper focuses on describing and
testing a more complex and biologically-authentic AIS model, inspired by the
interactions between the innate and adaptive immune systems. Its performance on
a realistic process anomaly detection problem is shown to be better than
standard AIS methods (negative-selection), policy-based anomaly detection
methods (systrace), and an alternative innate AIS approach (the DCA). In
addition, it is shown that runtime information can be used in combination with
system call information to enhance detection capability.
