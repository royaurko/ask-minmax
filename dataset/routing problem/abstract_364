The pair distribution function of monodisperse rigid spherocylinders is
calculated by Shinomoto's method, which was originally proposed for hard
spheres. The equation of state is derived by two different routes: Shinomoto's
original route, in which a hard wall is introduced to estimate the pressure
exerted on it, and the virial route. The pressure from Shinomoto's original
route is valid only when the length-to-width ratio is less than or equal to
0.25 (i.e., when the spherocylinders are nearly spherical). The virial equation
of state is shown to agree very well with the results of numerical simulations
of spherocylinders with length-to-width ratio greater than or equal to 2.
