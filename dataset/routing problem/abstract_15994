Hypercomputation or super-Turing computation is a ``computation'' that
transcends the limit imposed by Turing's model of computability. The field
still faces some basic questions, technical (can we mathematically and/or
physically build a hypercomputer?), cognitive (can hypercomputers realize the
AI dream?), philosophical (is thinking more than computing?). The aim of this
paper is to address the question: can we mathematically build a hypercomputer?
We will discuss the solutions of the Infinite Merchant Problem, a decision
problem equivalent to the Halting Problem, based on results obtained in
\cite{Coins,acp}. The accent will be on the new computational technique and
results rather than formal proofs.
