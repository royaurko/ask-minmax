We propose the minimal (Least) version of the Supersymmetric Standard Model
which can solve the hierarchy problem in the same way as the so-called Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and presents solutions to some of its
problems. Supersymmetry is broken in a secluded sector and mediated to the
observable sector by messengers of a gauge group G under which the first two
generations transform. The group G spontaneously breaks (almost)
supersymmetrically at a scale at most a few orders of magnitude below the scale
of gauge messengers M_*\sim 10^{15} GeV. By gauge mediation sfermions of the
first two generations acquire supersymmetry breaking masses \hat m \sim 10 TeV.
Supersymmetry breaking is also mediated by gravity which generates masses for
all sfermions, Higgsinos and gauginos at the TeV scale and can provide
appropriate values to the \mu and B_\mu parameters by D-term effective
operators. If gravity mediation is Minimal Flavor Violating there is no
supersymmetric flavor problem. In the presence of R-parity dark matter can be
the lightest neutralino, as in the MSSM, and the LHC model phenomenology is
characterized by the fact that only third generation squarks and sleptons are
present.
