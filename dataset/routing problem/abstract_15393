Web services allow communication between heterogeneous systems in a
distributed environment. Their enormous success and their increased use led to
the fact that thousands of Web services are present on the Internet. This
significant number of Web services which not cease to increase has led to
problems of the difficulty in locating and classifying web services, these
problems are encountered mainly during the operations of web services discovery
and substitution. Traditional ways of search based on keywords are not
successful in this context, their results do not support the structure of Web
services and they consider in their search only the identifiers of the web
service description language (WSDL) interface elements. The methods based on
semantics (WSDLS, OWLS, SAWSDL...) which increase the WSDL description of a Web
service with a semantic description allow raising partially this problem, but
their complexity and difficulty delays their adoption in real cases. Measuring
the similarity between the web services interfaces is the most suitable
solution for this kind of problems, it will classify available web services so
as to know those that best match the searched profile and those that do not
match. Thus, the main goal of this work is to study the degree of similarity
between any two web services by offering a new method that is more effective
than existing works.
