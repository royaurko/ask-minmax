The circular Radon transform integrates a function over the set of all
spheres with a given set of centers. The problem of injectivity of this
transform (as well as inversion formulas, range descriptions, etc.) arises in
many fields from approximation theory to integral geometry, to inverse problems
for PDEs, and recently to newly developing types of tomography. The article
discusses known and provides new results that one can obtain by methods that
essentially involve only the finite speed of propagation and domain dependence
for the wave equation.
