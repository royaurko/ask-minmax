One of the problems reported by researchers and auditors in the field of
spreadsheet risks is that of getting and keeping managements attention to the
problem. Since 1996, the Information Systems Audit & Control Foundation and the
IT Governance Institute have published CobiT which brings mainstream IT control
issues into the corporate governance arena. This paper illustrates how
spreadsheet risk and control issues can be mapped onto the CobiT framework and
thus brought to managers attention in a familiar format.
