Due to the rapidly increasing usage of personal mobile devices and the need
of executing CVE applications in environments that have no previous network
infrastructure, Mobile Collaborative Virtual Environments (MCVEs) systems will
become ubiquitous in the future. In such systems, we enable users to act and
interact in three dimensional world shared through their mobile devices in an
ad-hoc network (MANET). A handful of interesting MCVE applications have been
developed in a variety of domains, ranging from multiplayer games to virtual
cities, virtual shopping malls, and various training simulations (i.e.
military, emergency preparedness, Education, Medicine, etc.). The designers of
such applications rely solely on network overhead, latency, limited bandwidth,
and mobile device limitation. In this survey we present a number of ways to
classify and analysis routing techniques that have been applied in Mobile
Collaborative Environment Applications.
