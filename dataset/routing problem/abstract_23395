A model of quark mass matrices from six dimensions, which is nearly democatic
in nature and which is previously constructed by two of us (PQH and MS), is
studied in detail in this manuscript. We found that not only it fits all the
six quark masses as well as the CKM matrix but also that there exists a region
in the allowed parameter space of the model where the constraint on the
parameter \bar{\theta} of the Strong CP problem is satisfied. This region
itself puts a constraint on the CKM parameters \bar{\rho} and \bar{\eta}. As
such, through our analysis, there appears to be a deep connection between
Strong and Weak CP in this model
