Spontaneous emission from crystal centers is influenced by both the photonic
local density of states and non-radiative processes. Here we monitor the
spontaneous emission of single nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers as their host
diamond is reduced in size from a large monolithic crystal to a nanocrystal by
successive cycles of oxidation. The size reduction induces a quenching of the
NV radiative emission. New non-radiative channels lead to a decrease of the
fluorescence intensity and the excited state lifetime. In one case we observe
the onset of blinking which may provide a route to understand these additional
non-radiative decay channels.
