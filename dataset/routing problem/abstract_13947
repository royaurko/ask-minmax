One of the common problems of system development projects is that the system
documentation is often outdated and does not describe the latest version of the
system. The situation is even more complicated if we are speaking not about a
natural language description of the system, but about its formal specification.
In this paper we discuss how the problem could be solved by updating the
documentation automatically, by generating a new formal specification from the
model if the model is frequently changed.
