We consider the problem of searching for an object on a line at an unknown
distance OPT from the original position of the searcher, in the presence of a
cost of d for each time the searcher changes direction. This is a
generalization of the well-studied linear-search problem. We describe a
strategy that is guaranteed to find the object at a cost of at most 9*OPT + 2d,
which has the optimal competitive ratio 9 with respect to OPT plus the minimum
corresponding additive term. Our argument for upper and lower bound uses an
infinite linear program, which we solve by experimental solution of an infinite
series of approximating finite linear programs, estimating the limits, and
solving the resulting recurrences. We feel that this technique is interesting
in its own right and should help solve other searching problems. In particular,
we consider the star search or cow-path problem with turn cost, where the
hidden object is placed on one of m rays emanating from the original position
of the searcher. For this problem we give a tight bound of
(1+(2(m^m)/((m-1)^(m-1))) OPT + m ((m/(m-1))^(m-1) - 1) d. We also discuss
tradeoff between the corresponding coefficients, and briefly consider
randomized strategies on the line.
