We show the existence of a weak solution of a semilinear elliptic Dirichlet
problem on an arbitrary open set. We make no assumptions about the open set,
very mild regularity assumptions on the semilinearity, plus a coerciveness
assumption which depends on the optimal Poincare-Steklov constant. The proof is
based on Schaefer's fixed point theorem applied to a sequence of truncated
problems. We state a simple uniqueness result. We also generalize the results
to Robin boundary conditions.
