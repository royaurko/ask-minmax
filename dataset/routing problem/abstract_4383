A convection problem with temperature-dependent viscosity in an infinite
layer is presented. As described, this problem has important applications in
mantle convection. The existence of a stationary bifurcation is proved together
with a condition to obtain the critical parameters at which the bifurcation
takes place. For a general dependence of viscosity with temperature a numerical
strategy for the calculation of the critical bifurcation curves and the most
unstable modes has been developed. For a exponential dependence of viscosity on
temperature the numerical calculations have been done. Comparisons with the
classical Rayleigh-B\'enard problem with constant viscosity indicate that the
critical threshold decreases as the exponential rate parameter increases.
