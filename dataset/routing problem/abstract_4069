We consider the following boundary value problem
  -\Delta u= g(x,u) + f(x,u)   x\in \Omega
  u=0                          x\in \partial \Omega
  where $g(x,-\xi)=-g(x,\xi)$ and $g$ has subcritical exponential growth in
$\mathbb{R} ^2$. Using the method developed by Bolle, we prove that this
problem has infinitely many solutions under suitable conditions on the growth
of $g(u)$ and $f(u)$.
