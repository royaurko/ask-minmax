One cannot pull an open, curved string along itself. This fact is clearly
reflected in the unwrapping motion of a string or chain as it is dragged around
an object, and implies strong consequences for slender structures in passive
locomotion, whether industrial cables and sheets or the ribbons of rhythmic
gymnastics. We address a basic problem in the dynamics of flexible bodies,
namely the solution of the string equations with a free boundary. This system
is the backbone of many fluid-structure interactions, and also a model problem
for thin structures where geometric nonlinearities cannot be ignored. We
consider planar dynamics under the restriction that the spatially-dependent
stress profile in the string is time-independent, which results in a
conservation law form for the equations. We find a new exact solution whose
range of validity is time-dependent, limited to greater than a distance scaling
as $t^{\frac4/3}$ from the free end. The remainder of the distance is covered
by splicing to another exact solution for a straight string, which introduces
an error into the combined solution. The splicing also implies a
$t^{-\frac2/3}$ singularity in acceleration, apparently corresponding to a
whipping motion of the vanishing straight segment.
