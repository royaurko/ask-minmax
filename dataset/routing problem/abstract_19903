Recently Garcia Bellido et. al. have proposed that electroweak baryogenesis
may occur at the end of inflation, in a scenario where the reheat temperature
is too low for electroweak symmetry restoration. I show why the scenario is
difficult to test reliably by classical field techniques on the lattice.
