We prove the existence of a 1/N expansion in unitary multimatrix models which
are Gibbs perturbations of the Haar measure, and express the expansion
coefficients recursively in terms of the unique solution of a noncommutative
initial value problem. The recursion obtained is closely related to the
"topological recursion" which underlies the asymptotics of many random matrix
ensembles and appears in diverse enumerative geometry problems, but has not
previously appeared in the context of random unitary matrices. Our approach
consists of two main ingredients: an asymptotic study of the Schwinger-Dyson
lattice over noncommutative Laurent polynomials, and uniform control on the
cumulants of Gibbs measures on product unitary groups. The required cumulant
bounds are obtained by concentration of measure arguments.
