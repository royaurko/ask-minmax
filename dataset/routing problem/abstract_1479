The RMn2O5 (R=Pr, Nd, Sm, and Eu) oxides showing magnetoelectric (ME)
behavior have been prepared in polycrystalline form by a standard citrate
route. The lattice parameters, obtained from the powder XRD analysis, follow
the rare-earth contraction indicating the trivalent character of the R ions.
Cusp-like anomalies in the magnetic susceptibility curve and sharp peaks in the
specific heat were reported at the corresponding temperatures in RMn2O5 (R=Pr,
Nd, Sm, and Eu) indicating the magnetic or electric ordering transitions.
