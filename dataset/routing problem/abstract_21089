In this paper, we give a new type of a posteriori error estimators suitable
for moving finite element methods under anisotropic meshes for general
second-order elliptic problems. The computation of estimators is simple once
corresponding Hessian matrix is recovered. Wonderful efficiency indices are
shown in numerical experiments.
