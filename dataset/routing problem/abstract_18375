The $^8$B solar neutrino flux predicted by the standard solar model (SSM) is
consistent within the theoretical and experimental uncertainties with that
observed at Kamiokande. The Gallium and Chlorine solar neutrino experiments,
however, seem to imply that the $^7$Be solar neutrino flux is strongly
suppressed compared with that predicted by the SSM. If the $^7$Be solar
neutrino flux is suppressed, still it can be due to astrophysical effects not
included in the simplistic SSM. Such effects include short term fluctuations or
periodic variation of the temperature in the solar core, rotational mixing of
$^3$He in the solar core, and dense plasma effects which may strongly enhance
p-capture by $^7$Be relative to e-capture. The new generation of solar
observations which already look non stop deep into the sun, like
Superkamiokande through neutrinos, and SOHO and GONG through acoustic waves,
may point at the correct solution. Only Superkamiokande and/or future solar
neutrino experiments, such as SNO, BOREXINO and HELLAZ, will be able to find
out whether the solar neutrino problem is caused by neutrino properties beyond
the minimal standard electroweak model or whether it is just a problem of the
too simplistic standard solar model.
