The decision-Diffie-Hellman problem (DDH) is a central computational problem
in cryptography. It is known that the Weil and Tate pairings can be used to
solve many DDH problems on elliptic curves. Distortion maps are an important
tool for solving DDH problems using pairings and it is known that distortion
maps exist for all supersingular elliptic curves. We present an algorithm to
construct suitable distortion maps. The algorithm is efficient on the curves
usable in practice, and hence all DDH problems on these curves are easy. We
also discuss the issue of which DDH problems on ordinary curves are easy.
