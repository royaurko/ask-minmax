Scheinerman and Wilf (1994) assert that `an important open problem in the
study of graph embeddings is to determine the rectilinear crossing number of
the complete graph K_n.' A rectilinear drawing of K_n is an arrangement of n
vertices in the plane, every pair of which is connected by an edge that is a
line segment. We assume that no three vertices are collinear, and that no three
edges intersect in a point unless that point is an endpoint of all three. The
rectilinear crossing number of K_n is the fewest number of edge crossings
attainable over all rectilinear drawings of K_n.
  For each n we construct a rectilinear drawing of K_n that has the fewest
number of edge crossings and the best asymptotics known to date. Moreover, we
give some alternative infinite families of drawings of K_n with good
asymptotics. Finally, we mention some old and new open problems.
