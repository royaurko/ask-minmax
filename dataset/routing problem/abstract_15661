We consider the problem of neutrino masses and mixing angles in a
supersymmetric model based on the gauge group
SU(4)$\otimes$SU(2)$_L\otimes$SU(2)$_R$ broken at the scale $M_X\approx
10^{16}$ GeV. We extend a previous operator analysis of the charged lepton and
quark masses and mixing angles in this model to include the neutrino sector,
assuming a universal Majorana mass $M$ for the right-handed neutrinos. The
Dirac part of the neutrino matrix is then fixed and the physical neutrino
masses and magnitudes of all of the elements of the leptonic mixing matrix are
then predicted in terms of the single additional parameter $M$. The successful
ansatze predict a tau neutrino mass in the relevant range for the dark matter
problem and structure formation, muon and electron neutrinos consistent with
the MSW solution to the solar neutrino problem, and tau-muon neutrino mixing at
a level which should soon be observed by the CHORUS and NOMAD experiments.
