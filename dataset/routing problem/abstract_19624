The recent paper by Fujimoto and Hirose makes an unfortunate error in
discussing the use of the jellium model for the electrodes, which has the
effect of making it appear that this model is not adequate to treat the problem
of the conductance of gold nanowires. In fact it is entirely adequate, and
gives results quite similar to those found in the contributors' more elaborate
treatment.
