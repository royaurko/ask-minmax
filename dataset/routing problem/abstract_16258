Algorithmic meta-theorems are general algorithmic results applying to a whole
range of problems, rather than just to a single problem alone. They often have
a "logical" and a "structural" component, that is they are results of the form:
every computational problem that can be formalised in a given logic L can be
solved efficiently on every class C of structures satisfying certain
conditions. This paper gives a survey of algorithmic meta-theorems obtained in
recent years and the methods used to prove them. As many meta-theorems use
results from graph minor theory, we give a brief introduction to the theory
developed by Robertson and Seymour for their proof of the graph minor theorem
and state the main algorithmic consequences of this theory as far as they are
needed in the theory of algorithmic meta-theorems.
