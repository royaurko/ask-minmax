I review the treatment of high-energy QCD in Minkowski space, with an
emphasis on factorization theorems as extensions of the operator product
expansion. I discuss how the factorization properties of high-energy cross
sections and amplitudes lead to evolution equations that resum large logarithms
for two-scale problems.
