The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is a fundamental problem of
sequence comparison. A natural approximation to this problem is a model in
which every pairs of letters of two ``sequences'' are matched independently of
the other pairs with probability 1/S, $S$ representing the size of the
alphabet. This model is analogous to a mean field version of the LCS problem,
which can be solved with a cavity approach (Eur. Phys. J. B 7-2(1999),pp.
293-308). We refine here this approximation by incorporating in a systematic
way correlations among the matches in the cavity calculation. We obtain a
series of closer and closer approximations to the LCS problem, which we
quantify in the large $S$ limit, both with a perturbative approach and by
Monte-Carlo simulations. We find that, as it happens in the expansion around
mean-field for other disordered systems, the corrections to our approximations
depend upon long-ranged correlation effects which render the large $S$
expansion non-perturbative.
