The coloring problem is studied in the paper for graph classes defined by two
small forbidden induced subgraphs. We prove some sufficient conditions for
effective solvability of the problem in such classes. As their corollary we
determine the computational complexity for all sets of two connected forbidden
induced subgraphs with at most five vertices except 13 explicitly enumerated
cases
