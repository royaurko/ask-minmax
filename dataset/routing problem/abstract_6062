Image formation for radio astronomy can be defined as estimating the spatial
power distribution of celestial sources over the sky, given an array of
antennas. One of the challenges with image formation is that the problem
becomes ill-posed as the number of pixels becomes large. The introduction of
constraints that incorporate a-priori knowledge is crucial. In this paper we
show that in addition to non-negativity, the magnitude of each pixel in an
image is also bounded from above. Indeed, the classical "dirty image" is an
upper bound, but a much tighter upper bound can be formed from the data using
array processing techniques. This formulates image formation as a least squares
optimization problem with inequality constraints. We propose to solve this
constrained least squares problem using active set techniques, and the steps
needed to implement it are described. It is shown that the least squares part
of the problem can be efficiently implemented with Krylov subspace based
techniques, where the structure of the problem allows massive parallelism and
reduced storage needs. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using
simulations.
