The generalized 2-server problem is an online optimization problem where a
sequence of requests has to be served at minimal cost. Requests arrive one by
one and need to be served instantly by at least one of two servers. We consider
the general model where the cost function of the two servers may be different.
Formally, each server moves in its own metric space and a request consists of
one point in each metric space. It is served by moving one of the two servers
to its request point. Requests have to be served without knowledge of the
future requests. The objective is to minimize the total traveled distance. The
special case where both servers move on the real line is known as the
CNN-problem. We show that the generalized work function algorithm is constant
competitive for the generalized 2-server problem.
