In this article we study topological bifurcations of critical orbits of
equivariant gradient equations. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for
the existence of global bifurcations of solutions of these equations. Moreover,
we apply these abstract results to the study of bifurcations of new families of
planar central configurations of the N-body problem.
