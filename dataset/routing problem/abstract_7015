We present a novel POMDP planning algorithm called heuristic search value
iteration (HSVI).HSVI is an anytime algorithm that returns a policy and a
provable bound on its regret with respect to the optimal policy. HSVI gets its
power by combining two well-known techniques: attention-focusing search
heuristics and piecewise linear convex representations of the value function.
HSVI's soundness and convergence have been proven. On some benchmark problems
from the literature, HSVI displays speedups of greater than 100 with respect to
other state-of-the-art POMDP value iteration algorithms. We also apply HSVI to
a new rover exploration problem 10 times larger than most POMDP problems in the
literature.
