Unbinding of a double-stranded DNA reduces to an unscreened long range
interaction and maps on various problems. Heterogeneity renormalizes
interaction. Renormalization is temperature dependent. At an unbinding
transition it approaches critical dimensionality. This implies giant
non-universal critical indexes and invalidity of the Gibbs distribution
sufficiently close to the critical temperature Tc. Fluctuations are
macroscopically large below Tc. There are no fluctuations above it.
