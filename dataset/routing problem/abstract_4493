When Martin Gardner first presented the Two-Children problem, he made a
mistake in its solution. Later he corrected the mistake in another publication,
but unfortunately his incorrect solution is more widely known than his
correction. In fact, a Tuesday-Child variation of this problem went viral in
2010, and the same flaw keeps reappearing in solutions for that problem as
well. In this article, I would like to popularize Martin Gardner's correction
and conduct a detailed discussion of the new problem.
