We study the old problem of isometrically embedding a 2-dimensional
Riemannian manifold into Euclidean 3-space. It is shown that if the Gaussian
curvature vanishes to finite order and its zero set consists of two Lipschitz
curves intersecting transversely at a point, then local sufficiently smooth
isometric embeddings exist.
