The motivation of this paper comes from the two weight inequality
$$\|P_\omega(f)\|_{L^p_v}\le C\|f\|_{L^p_v},\quad f\in L^p_v,$$ for the Bergman
projection $P_\omega$ in the unit disc. We show that the boundedness of
$P_\omega$ on $L^p_v$ is characterized in terms of self-improving Muckenhoupt
and Bekoll\'e-Bonami type conditions when the radial weights $v$ and $\omega$
admit certain smoothness. En route to the proof we describe the asymptotic
behavior of the $L^p$-means and the $L^p_v$-integrability of the reproducing
kernels of the weighted Bergman space $A^2_\omega$.
