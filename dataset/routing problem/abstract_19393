We consider the solution of the problem $$ -\Delta u=f(u) \ \mbox{ and } \
u>0 \ \ \mbox{ in } \ \Omega, \ \ u=0 \ \mbox{ on } \ \Gamma, $$ where $\Omega$
is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with boundary $\Gamma$ of class
$C^{2,\tau}$, $0<\tau<1$, and $f$ is a locally Lipschitz continuous
non-linearity. Serrin's celebrated symmetry theorem states that, if the normal
derivative $u_\nu$ is constant on $\Gamma$, then $\Omega$ must be a ball.
  In [CMS2], it has been conjectured that Serrin's theorem may be obtained by
stability in the following way: first, for a solution $u$ prove the estimate $$
r_e-r_i\le C_\delta\,[u]_{\Gamma^\delta} $$ for some constant $C_\delta$
depending on $\delta>0$, where $r_e$ and $r_i$ are the radii of a spherical
annulus containing $\Gamma$, $\Gamma^\delta$ is a surface parallel to $\Gamma$
at distance $\delta$ and sufficiently close to $\Gamma$, and
$[u]_{\Gamma^\delta}$ is the Lipschitz semi-norm of $u$ on $\Gamma^\delta$;
secondly, if in addition $u_\nu$ is constant on $\Gamma$, show that $$
[u]_{\Gamma^\delta}=o(C_\delta)\ \mbox{ as } \ \delta\to 0^+. $$ In this paper,
we prove that this strategy is successful.
  As a by-product of this method, for $C^{2,\tau}$-regular domains, we also
obtain a linear stability estimate for Serrin's symmetry result. Our result is
optimal and greatly improves the similar logarithmic-type estimate of [ABR] and
the H\"{o}lder estimate of [CMV] that was restricted to convex domains.
