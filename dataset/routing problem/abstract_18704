Counting and classifying blood cells is an important diagnostic tool in
medicine. Support Vector Machines are increasingly popular and efficient and
could replace artificial neural network systems. Here a method to classify
blood cells is proposed using SVM. A set of statistics on images are
implemented in C++. The MPEG-7 descriptors Scalable Color Descriptor, Color
Structure Descriptor, Color Layout Descriptor and Homogeneous Texture
Descriptor are extended in size and combined with textural features
corresponding to textural properties perceived visually by humans. From a set
of images of human blood cells these statistics are collected. A SVM is
implemented and trained to classify the cell images. The cell images come from
a CellaVision DM-96 machine which classify cells from images from microscopy.
The output images and classification of the CellaVision machine is taken as
ground truth, a truth that is 90-95% correct. The problem is divided in two --
the primary and the simplified. The primary problem is to classify the same
classes as the CellaVision machine. The simplified problem is to differ between
the five most common types of white blood cells. An encouraging result is
achieved in both cases -- error rates of 10.8% and 3.1% -- considering that the
SVM is misled by the errors in ground truth. Conclusion is that further
investigation of performance is worthwhile.
