We consider a linear equation $\partial_t u = \mathcal{L}u$, where
$\mathcal{L}$ is a generator of a semigroup of linear operators on a certain
Hilbert space related to an initial condition $u(0)$ being a generalised
stationary random field on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We show the existence and uniqueness
of generalised solutions to such initial value problems. Then we investigate
their scaling limits.
