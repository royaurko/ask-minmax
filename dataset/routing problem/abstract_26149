We show that cold clumps in the intra--cluster medium (ICM) efficiently lose
their angular momentum as they fall in, such that they can rapidly feed the
central AGN and maintain a heating feedback process. Such cold clumps are
predicted by the cold feedback model, a model for maintaining the ICM in
cooling flows hot by a feedback process. The clumps very effectively lose their
angular momentum in two channels: the drag force exerted by the ICM and the
random collisions between clumps when they are close to the central black hole.
We conclude that the angular momentum cannot prevent the accretion of the cold
clumps, and the cold feedback mechanism is a viable model for a feedback
mechanism in cooling flows. Cold feedback does not suffer from the severe
problems of models that are based on the Bondi accretion.
