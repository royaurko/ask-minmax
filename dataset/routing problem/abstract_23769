This is a survey about the Skorokhod embedding problem. It presents all known
solutions together with their properties and some applications. Some of the
solutions are just described, while others are studied in detail and their
proofs are presented. A certain unification of proofs, based on one-dimensional
potential theory, is made. Some new facts which appeared in a natural way when
different solutions were cross-examined, are reported. Az\'ema and Yor's and
Root's solutions are studied extensively. A possible use of the latter is
suggested together with a conjecture.
