The determination of the masses of Supersymmetric particles such as the
Selectron for energies above threshold using the energy end-points method is
subject to signal deconvolution difficulties and to Standard Model and
Supersymmetric backgrounds. The important features of Right and Left Selectron
production are used to design an experimentally robust method both for
determining the Left and Right Selectron masses, the Neutralino mass and for
suppresing backgrounds. The mass resolution is an order of magnitude better
than in previous methods. Additional features, such as the determination of the
relative leptonic branching ratios of the selectron decay are present in the
method.
