We exploit a new theory of duality transformations to construct dual
representations of models incompatible with traditional duality
transformations. Hence we obtain a solution to the long-standing problem of
non-Abelian dualities that hinges on two key observations: (i) from the point
of view of dualities, whether the group of symmetries of a model is or is not
Abelian is unimportant, and (ii) the new theory of dualities that we exploit
includes traditional duality transformations, but also introduces in a natural
way more general transformations.
