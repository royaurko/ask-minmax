To synthesize a new superconductor which has a critical temperature, Tc,
exceeding the room temperature, one needs to know what chemical components to
start with. This chapter presents analysis of experimental data which allow one
to draw a conclusion about components and the structure of a potential
room-temperature superconductor. The two essential components of a room
temperature superconductor are large organic molecules (polymers, tissues) and
atoms/molecules which are magnetic in the intercalated state. This conclusion
is fully based on experimental facts known today, and does not require any
assumptions about the mechanism of room-temperature superconductivity. This,
however, does not mean that to synthesize a room-temperature superconductor is
an easy task.
