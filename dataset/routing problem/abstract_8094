We study the existence problem and the enumeration problem for sections of
Serre fibrations over compact orientable surfaces. When the fundamental group
of the fiber is finite, a complete solution is given in terms of 2-dimensional
cohomology classes associated with certain irreducible representations of this
group. The proofs are based on Topological Quantum Field Theory.
