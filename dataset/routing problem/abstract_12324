We present several domain decomposition algorithms for sequential and
parallel minimization of functionals formed by a discrepancy term with respect
to data and total variation constraints. The convergence properties of the
algorithms are analyzed. We provide several numerical experiments, showing the
successful application of the algorithms for the restoration 1D and 2D signals
in interpolation/inpainting problems respectively, and in a compressed sensing
problem, for recovering piecewise constant medical-type images from partial
Fourier ensembles.
