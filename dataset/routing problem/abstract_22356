We construct a class of planar semimartingales which includes the Walsh
Brownian motion as a special case, and derive stochastic integral equations and
a change-of-variable formula for these so-called "Walsh semimartingales".
Through the study of appropriate martingale problems, we examine uniqueness of
the probability distribution for such processes in Markovian settings, and
study some examples.
