We have grown underdoped (x = 0.11, 0.12) and optimally doped (x = 0.16)
La2-xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) crystals by traveling-solvent floating-zone (TSFZ)
technique. In order to obtain LSCO single crystals of high quality, we have
made much effort to optimize the preparation procedures. For example, we have
adopted sol-gel route to prepare highly fine and homogeneous LSCO precursor
powder, and used quite slow growth rate. The sizable grown crystal ingots are
typically about 6.6 mm in diameter and 100 mm in length, and no impurity phases
were detected. The high quality of grown crystals has been verified by
double-crystal x-ray rocking curves, with full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM)
being only 113 ~ 150 arcseconds (or 0.03 deg - 0.04 deg), which are the best
data reported so far for LSCO crystals. The superconducting critical
temperatures (TC's) of the cuprate crystals are 30 K for x = 0.11, 31 K for x =
0.12 and 38.5 K for x = 0.16 samples according to magnetic measurements.
