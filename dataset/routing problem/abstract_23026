Wikis can be considered as public domain knowledge sharing system. They
provide opportunity for those who may not have the privilege to publish their
thoughts through the traditional methods. They are one of the fastest growing
systems of online encyclopaedia. In this study, we consider the importance of
wikis as a way of creating, sharing and improving public knowledge. We identify
some of the problems associated with wikis to include, (a) identification of
the identities of information and its creator (b) accuracy of information (c)
justification of the credibility of contributors (d) vandalism of quality of
information (e) weak control over the contents. A solution to some of these
problems is sought through the use of an annotation model. The model assumes
that contributions in wikis can be seen as annotation to the initial document.
It proposed a systematic control of contributors and contributions to the
initiative and the keeping of records of what existed and what was done to
initial documents. We believe that with this model, analysis can be done on the
progress of wiki initiatives. We assumed that using this model, wikis can be
better used for creation and sharing of knowledge for public use.
