The polar representation theorem for the n-dimensional time-dependent linear
Hamiltonian system with continuous coefficients, states that, given two
isotropic solutions (Q1, P1) and (Q2, P2), with the identity matrix as
Wronskian,the formula Q2 = rcos(f), Q1 = rsin(f), holds, where r and f are
continuous matrices, r is non-singular and f is symmetric. In this article we
use the monotonicity properties of the matrix f eigenvalues in order to obtain
results on the Sturm-Liouville problem.
