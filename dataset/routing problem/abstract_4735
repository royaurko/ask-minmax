Sturm-Liouville problems are abundant in the numerical treatment of
scientific and engineering problems. In the present contribution, we present an
efficient and highly accurate method for computing eigenvalues of singular
Sturm-Liouville boundary value problems. The proposed method uses the double
exponential formula coupled with Sinc collocation method. This method produces
a symmetric positive-definite generalized eigenvalue system and has exponential
convergence rate. Numerical examples are presented and comparisons with single
exponential Sinc collocation method clearly illustrate the advantage of using
the double exponential formula.
