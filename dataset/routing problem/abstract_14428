We study the stability in the inverse problem of determining the time
dependent zeroth-order coefficient $q(t,x)$ arising in the wave equation, from
boundary observations. We derive, in dimension $n\geq 2$, a log-type stability
estimate in the determination of $q$ from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, in a
subset of our domain assuming that it is known outside this subset. Moreover,
we prove that we can extend this result to the determination of $q$ in a larger
region, and then in the whole domain provided that we have much more data.
