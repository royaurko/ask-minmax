The contour-integral based eigensolvers are the recent efforts for computing
the eigenvalues inside a given region in the complex plane. The best-known
members are the Sakurai-Sugiura (SS) method, its stable version CIRR, and the
FEAST algorithm. An attractive computational advantage of these methods is that
they are easily parallelizable. The FEAST algorithm was developed for the
generalized Hermitian eigenvalue problems. It is stable and accurate. However,
it may fail when applied to non-Hermitian problems. In this paper, we extend
the FEAST algorithm to non-Hermitian problems. The approach can be summarized
as follows: (i) to construct a particular contour integral to form a subspace
containing the desired eigenspace, and (ii) to use the oblique projection
technique to extract desired eigenpairs with appropriately chosen test
subspace. The related mathematical framework is established. We also address
some implementation issues such as how to choose a suitable starting matrix and
design good stopping criteria. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate
that our method is stable and efficient.
