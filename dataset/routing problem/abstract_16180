The present study is devoted to the problem of tsunami wave generation. The
main goal of this work is two-fold. First of all, we propose a simple and
computationally inexpensive model for the description of the sea bed
displacement during an underwater earthquake, based on the finite fault
solution for the slip distribution under some assumptions on the dynamics of
the rupturing process. Once the bottom motion is reconstructed, we study waves
induced on the free surface of the ocean. For this purpose we consider three
different models approximating the Euler equations of the water wave theory.
Namely, we use the linearized Euler equations (we are in fact solving the
Cauchy-Poisson problem), a Boussinesq system and a novel weakly nonlinear
model. An intercomparison of these approaches is performed. The developments of
the present study are illustrated on the 17 July 2006 Java event, where an
underwater earthquake of magnitude 7.7 generated a tsunami that inundated the
southern coast of Java.
