In present article the self-contained derivation of eigenvalue inverse
problem results is given by using a discrete approximation of the Schroedinger
operator on a bounded interval as a finite three-diagonal symmetric Jacobi
matrix. This derivation is more correct in comparison with previous works which
used only single-diagonal matrix. It is demonstrated that inverse problem
procedure is nothing else than well known Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization in
Euclidean space for special vectors numbered by the space coordinate index. All
the results of usual inverse problem with continuous coordinate are reobtained
by employing a limiting procedure, including the Goursat problem -- equation in
partial derivatives for the solutions of the inversion integral equation.
