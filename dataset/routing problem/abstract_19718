This paper reviews work, largely due to W. Simon and the contributor, on multipole
theory of static spacetimes. The main purpose is to make this work, which lies
at the interface of potential theory, conformal geometry and general
relativity, known to mathematicians and to perhaps motivate them to look at the
open problems which still remain.
