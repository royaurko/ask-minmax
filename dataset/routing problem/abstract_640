The task of simulation is often complicated for which many naive users often
seek for relatively easier solutions. In many cases, simulations are done
without any visual output which makes them non-attractive. In this paper, we
present ViSim; a new simulation tool that has a user-friendly graphical
interface. ViSim could be useful for researchers, students, teachers in their
works, and for the demonstration of various wireless network scenarios on
computer screen. It could make the task of simulation more exciting and enhance
the interest of the users without going into complex command-only text
interface. ViSim is not a simulation engine rather it calls ns-2 simulations in
the background and makes the task easy for the users to visualize the
simulation in Windows environment. Though ViSim is mainly a simulation
demonstration tool, any user with the knowledge of ns-2 and Tcl scripting is
also allowed to do necessary modifications and quick configurations for any
other MANET routing scenario. Using our simulation tool, we measured the
performances of several Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) routing protocols. In
this paper, we present the performance analysis of three prominent MANET
routing protocols; DSDV, DSR, and AODV using our tool. The details of various
features of ViSim, brief descriptions of the selected routing protocols and
their comparisons, details about the performed experiments, and the gained
results are presented in this work.
