The history of how chiral symmetry has entered in nuclear physics, in which
Gerry Brown and I have participated from 1970 up to today, is described from my
personal viewpoint. The route of development we have traversed together goes
from meson exchange currents, to "little chiral bag," to chiral effective field
theory, to "Brown-Rho scaling" and then to dense matter and chiral phase
transition. It has been a great fun and exciting, some right and some wrong in
what we have done together, but none that can be dismissed as "not even wrong."
We have found all along that whatever signal there may be for the manifestation
of chiral symmetry in nuclear medium, be it at low density in meson exchange
currents or at high density approaching the chiral phase transition, is very
similar in its intricacy and subtlety.
