This study indicates that in E6 grand unified theories (GUTs), once a
hierarchical structure of up-quark-type Yukawa couplings is given as a basic
structure of flavor, larger lepton mixings than the quark mixings and milder
down-quark-type (and charged-lepton-type) mass hierarchies than up-quark-type
mass hierarchy can generically be obtained under a few natural assumptions. The
basic flavor structure is compatible with non-Abelian horizontal symmetry,
which can solve the SUSY flavor problem. It is shown that in solving the SUSY
flavor problem, the E6 structure, which realizes bi-large neutrino mixings,
also solves a problem that results from the large neutrino mixing angles.
