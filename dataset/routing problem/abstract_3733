Domain decomposition methods are used for approximate solving boundary
problems for partial differential equations on parallel computing systems.
Specific features of unsteady problems are taken into account in the most
complete way in iteration-free schemes of domain decomposition.
Regionally-additive schemes are based on different classes of splitting
schemes. In this paper we highlight a class of domain decomposition schemes
which is based on the partition of the initial domain into subdomains with
common boundary nodes. Using the partition of unit we have constructed and
studied unconditionally stable schemes of domain decomposition based on
two-component splitting: the problem within subdomain and the problem at their
boundaries. As an example there is considered the Cauchy problem for
evolutionary equations of first and second order with non-negative self-adjoint
operator in a finite Hilbert space. The theoretical consideration is
supplemented with numerical solving a model problem for the two-dimensional
parabolic equation.
