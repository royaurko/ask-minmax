We introduce a class of dynamical systems having an invariant measure, the
modifications of well known systems on Lie groups: LR and L+R systems. As an
example, we study modified Veselova nonholonomic rigid body problem, considered
as a dynamical system on the product of the Lie algebra $so(n)$ with the
Stiefel variety $V_{n,r}$, as well as the associated $\epsilon$L+R system on
$so(n)\times V_{n,r}$. In the 3--dimensional case, these systems model the
nonholonomic problems of a motion of a ball and a rubber ball over a fixed
sphere.
