An oriented graph is a directed graph without directed 2-cycles. Poljak and
Turz\'{i}k (1986) proved that every connected oriented graph $G$ on $n$
vertices and $m$ arcs contains an acyclic subgraph with at least
$\frac{m}{2}+\frac{n-1}{4}$ arcs. Raman and Saurabh (2006) gave another proof
of this result and left it as an open question to establish the parameterized
complexity of the following problem: does $G$ have an acyclic subgraph with
least $\frac{m}{2}+\frac{n-1}{4}+k$ arcs, where $k$ is the parameter? We answer
this question by showing that the problem can be solved by an algorithm of
runtime $(12k)!n^{O(1)}$. Thus, the problem is fixed-parameter tractable. We
also prove that there is a polynomial time algorithm that either establishes
that the input instance of the problem is a Yes-instance or reduces the input
instance to an equivalent one of size $O(k^2)$.
