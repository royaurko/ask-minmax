The averaging problem in general relativity is briefly discussed. A new
setting of the problem as that of macroscopic description of gravitation is
proposed. A covariant space-time averaging procedure is described. The
structure of the geometry of macroscopic space-time, which follows from
averaging Cartan's structure equations, is described and the correlation
tensors present in the theory are discussed. The macroscopic field equations
(averaged Einstein's equations) derived in the framework of the approach are
presented and their structure is analysed. The correspondence principle for
macroscopic gravity is formulated and a definition of the stress-energy tensor
for the macroscopic gravitational field is proposed. It is shown that the
physical meaning of using Einstein's equations with a hydrodynamic
stress-energy tensor in looking for cosmological models means neglecting all
gravitational field correlations. The system of macroscopic gravity equations
to be solved when the correlations are taken into consideration is given and
described.
