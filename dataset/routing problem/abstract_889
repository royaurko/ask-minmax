In order to make full use of geographic routing techniques developed for
sensor networks, nodes must be localized. However, traditional localization and
virtual localization techniques are dependent either on expensive and sometimes
unavailable hardware (e.g. GPS) or on sophisticated localization calculus (e.g.
triangulation) which are both error-prone and with a costly overhead.
  Instead of actually localizing nodes in the physical two-dimensional
Euclidean space, we use directly the raw distance to a set of anchors to
produce multi-dimensional coordinates. We prove that the image of the physical
two-dimensional Euclidean space is a two-dimensional surface, and we show that
it is possible to adapt geographic routing strategies on this surface, simply,
efficiently and successfully.
