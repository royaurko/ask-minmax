This paper concerns the global propagation of impact-induced tensile waves in
a kind of phase-transforming materials. It is well-known that the governing
system of partial differential equations is hyperbolic-elliptic and the
initial-boundary value problem is not well-posed at all levels of loading. By
making use of fully nonlinear stress-strain curve to model this material, Dai
and Kong succeeded in constructing a physical solution of the above
initial-boundary value problem. For the impact of intermediate range, they
assumed that $\beta<3\alpha$ in the stress-response function for simplicity. In
this paper, we revisit the impact problem and consider the propagation of
impact-induced tensile waves for all values of the parameters $\alpha$ and
$\beta$. The physical solutions for all levels of loading are obtained
completely.
