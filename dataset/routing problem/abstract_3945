We study the problem of information propagation in brain microtubules. After
considering the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a fluid of permanent
electric dipoles, the problem reduces to the sine-Gordon wave equation in one
space and one time dimensions. The problem of propagation of information is
thus set.
