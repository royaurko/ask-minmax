In this paper we define a new problem, motivated by computational biology,
$LCSk$ aiming at finding the maximal number of $k$ length $substrings$,
matching in both input strings while preserving their order of appearance. The
traditional LCS definition is a special case of our problem, where $k = 1$. We
provide an algorithm, solving the general case in $O(n^2)$ time, where $n$ is
the length of the input strings, equaling the time required for the special
case of $k=1$. The space requirement of the algorithm is $O(kn)$. %, however,
in order to enable %backtracking of the solution, $O(n^2)$ space is needed.
  We also define a complementary $EDk$ distance measure and show that
$EDk(A,B)$ can be computed in $O(nm)$ time and $O(km)$ space, where $m$, $n$
are the lengths of the input sequences $A$ and $B$ respectively.
