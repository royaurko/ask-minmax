We describe an algorithm that computes the index of a finitely generated
subgroup in a finitely $L$-presented group provided that this index is finite.
This algorithm shows that the subgroup membership problem for finite index
subgroups in a finitely $L$-presented group is decidable. As an application, we
consider the low-index subgroups of some self-similar groups including the
Grigorchuk group, the twisted twin of the Grigorchuk group, the Grigorchuk
super-group and the Hanoi 3-group
