Suggested the decision of the network cranback protocols performance
analyzing problem from Eyal Felstine, Reuven Cohen and Ofer Hadar, " Crankback
Prediction in Hierarchical ATM networks", Journal of Network and Systems
Management, Vol. 10, No. 3, September 2002. It show that the false alarm
probability and probability of successful way crossing can be calculated. The
main optimization equations are developed for cranback protocol parameters by
using analytical expressions for statistical protocol characteristics.
