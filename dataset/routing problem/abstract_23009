The aim of the paper is to introduce general techniques in order to optimize
the parallel execution time of sorting on a distributed architectures with
processors of various speeds. Such an application requires a partitioning step.
For uniformly related processors (processors speeds are related by a constant
factor), we develop a constant time technique for mastering processor load and
execution time in an heterogeneous environment and also a technique to deal
with unknown cost functions. For non uniformly related processors, we use a
technique based on dynamic programming. Most of the time, the solutions are in
O(p) (p is the number of processors), independent of the problem size n.
Consequently, there is a small overhead regarding the problem we deal with but
it is inherently limited by the knowing of time complexity of the portion of
code following the partitioning.
