In this article we prove local well-posedness of quasilinear dispersive
systems of PDE generalizing KdV. These results adapt the ideas of Kenig-
Ponce-Vega from the Quasi-Linear Schr\"odinger equations to the third order
dispersive problems. The main ingredient of the proof is a local smoothing
estimate for a general linear problem that allows us to proceed via the
artificial viscosity method.
