A supergrid graph is a finite induced subgraph of the infinite graph
associated with the two-dimensional supergrid. The supergrid graphs contain
grid graphs and triangular grid graphs as subgraphs. The Hamiltonian cycle
problem for grid and triangular grid graphs was known to be NP-complete. In the
past, we have shown that the Hamiltonian cycle problem for supergrid graphs is
also NP-complete. The Hamiltonian cycle problem on supergrid graphs can be
applied to control the stitching trace of computerized sewing machines. In this
paper, we will study the Hamiltonian cycle property of linear-convex supergrid
graphs which form a subclass of supergrid graphs. A connected graph is called
$k$-connected if there are $k$ vertex-disjoint paths between every pair of
vertices, and is called locally connected if the neighbors of each vertex in it
form a connected subgraph. In this paper, we first show that any 2-connected,
linear-convex supergrid graph is locally connected. We then prove that any
2-connected, linear-convex supergrid graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle.
