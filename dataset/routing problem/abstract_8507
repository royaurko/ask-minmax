We study the nonhomogeneous boundary value problem for Navier-Stokes
equations of steady motion of a viscous incompressible fluid in a
three-dimensional bounded multiply connected domain. We prove that this problem
has a solution in some axially symmetric cases, in particular, when all
components of the boundary intersect the axis of symmetry.
