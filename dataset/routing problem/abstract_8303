In this work we study the polytope associated with a 0/1 integer programming
formulation for the Equitable Coloring Problem. We find several families of
valid inequalities and derive sufficient conditions in order to be
facet-defining inequalities. We also present computational evidence of the
effectiveness of including these inequalities as cuts in a Branch & Cut
algorithm.
