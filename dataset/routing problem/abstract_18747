We discuss the algebro-geometric initial value problem for the Ablowitz-Ladik
hierarchy with complex-valued initial data and prove unique solvability
globally in time for a set of initial (Dirichlet divisor) data of full measure.
To this effect we develop a new algorithm for constructing stationary
complex-valued algebro-geometric solutions of the Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchy,
which is of independent interest as it solves the inverse algebro-geometric
spectral problem for general (non-unitary) Ablowitz-Ladik Lax operators,
starting from a suitably chosen set of initial divisors of full measure.
Combined with an appropriate first-order system of differential equations with
respect to time (a substitute for the well-known Dubrovin-type equations), this
yields the construction of global algebro-geometric solutions of the
time-dependent Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchy.
  The treatment of general (non-unitary) Lax operators associated with general
coefficients for the Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchy poses a variety of difficulties
that, to the best of our knowledge, are successfully overcome here for the
first time. Our approach is not confined to the Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchy but
applies generally to (1+1)-dimensional completely integrable soliton equations
of differential-difference type.
