We consider geodesics motion in a particular Kundt type III spacetime in
which Einstein-Yang-Mills equations admit solutions. On a particular surface as
constraint we project the geodesics into the (x,y) plane and treat the problem
as a 2-dimensional one. Our numerical study shows that chaotic behavior emerges
under reasonable conditions.
