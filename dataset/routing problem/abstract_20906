In the present paper we characterize the existence and uniqueness of maximal
Lp-regular solutions of high order convolution operator equations.
Particularly, we get coercive uniform estimates with respect to spectral
parameter and we show that corresponding realization operator is R-positive and
generates analytic semigroup in Lp. Then we apply these results to various
problems of nonlinear integro-differential equations.
