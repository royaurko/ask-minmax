A solution is proposed for the problem of composition of ordinary generating
functions. A new class of functions that provides a composition of ordinary
generating functions is introduced; main theorems are presented; compositae are
written for polynomials, trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, exponential
and log functions. It is shown that the composition holds true for many integer
sequences.
