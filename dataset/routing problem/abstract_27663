We establish the relation of the second virial coefficient of certain
$(\tilde{\mu},q)$-deformed Bose gas model, recently proposed by the contributors in
[Ukr. J. Phys., 2013], to the interaction and compositeness parameters when
either of these factors is taken into account separately. When the interaction
is dealt with, the deformation parameter becomes linked directly to the
scattering length, and the effective radius of interaction (in general, to
scattering phases). The additionally arising temperature dependence is a new
feature absent in the deformed Bose gas model within adopted interpretation of
the deformation parameters $\tilde{\mu}$ and $q$. Here the problem of the
temperature dependence is analyzed in detail and its possible solution is
proposed.
