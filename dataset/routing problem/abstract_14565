A non-autonomous system is defined to pass a tipping point when gradual
changes in input levels cause the output to change suddenly. We study a
prototypical model for rate-induced tipping, the saddle-node normal form
subject to parameter drift and noise. We determine the most likely time of
escape by finding the optimal path of escape. This is a variational
optimisation problem that can be transformed into a second order boundary value
problem. This is solved using continuation techniques in AUTO, which generates
contours for the optimal time of escape in a two parameter plane.
