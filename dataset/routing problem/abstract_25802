We introduce utility-directed procedures for mediating the flow of
potentially distracting alerts and communications to computer users. We present
models and inference procedures that balance the context-sensitive costs of
deferring alerts with the cost of interruption. We describe the challenge of
reasoning about such costs under uncertainty via an analysis of user activity
and the content of notifications. After introducing principles of
attention-sensitive alerting, we focus on the problem of guiding alerts about
email messages. We dwell on the problem of inferring the expected criticality
of email and discuss work on the Priorities system, centering on prioritizing
email by criticality and modulating the communication of notifications to users
about the presence and nature of incoming email.
