The complete experiment problem for photoproduction of single pseudoscalar
mesons is reviewed briefly. If this problem is investigated in the context of a
truncated partial wave analysis, the chance emerges to obtain a unique
multipole solution measuring less polarization observables than demanded by the
classical solution of the problem that is formulated in terms of spin
amplitudes.
