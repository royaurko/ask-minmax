In this paper, we consider the problem of minimizing the asymptotic exit rate
of diffusion processes from an open connected bounded set pertaining to a
multi-channel system with small random perturbations. Specifically, we
establish a connection between: (i) the existence of an invariant set for the
unperturbed multi-channel system with respect to certain class of
state-feedback controllers; and (ii) the asymptotic behavior of the principal
eigenvalue and the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations
corresponding to a family of singularly perturbed elliptic operators. Finally,
we provide a sufficient condition for the existence of a Pareto equilibrium
(i.e., a set of optimal exit rates with respect to each of input channels) for
the HJB equations -- where the latter correspond to a family of nonlinear
controlled eigenvalue problems.
