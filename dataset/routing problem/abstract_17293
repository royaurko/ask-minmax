Let (S1,i, S2,i), distributed according to i.i.d p(s1, s2), i = 1, 2, . . .
be a memoryless, correlated partial side information sequence. In this work we
study channel coding and source coding problems where the partial side
information (S1, S2) is available at the encoder and the decoder, respectively,
and, additionally, either the encoder's or the decoder's side information is
increased by a limited-rate description of the other's partial side
information. We derive six special cases of channel coding and source coding
problems and we characterize the capacity and the rate-distortion functions for
the different cases. We present a duality between the channel capacity and the
rate-distortion cases we study. In order to find numerical solutions for our
channel capacity and rate-distortion problems, we use the Blahut-Arimoto
algorithm and convex optimization tools. As a byproduct of our work, we found a
tight lower bound on the Wyner-Ziv solution by formulating its Lagrange dual as
a geometric program. Previous results in the literature provide a geometric
programming formulation that is only a lower bound, but not necessarily tight.
Finally, we provide several examples corresponding to the channel capacity and
the rate-distortion cases we presented.
