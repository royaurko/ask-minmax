We consider the problem of the bound states of a spin 1/2 chargless particle
in a given Aharonov-Casher configuration. To this end we recast the description
of the system in a supersymmetric form. Then the basic physical requirements
for unbroken supersymmetry are established. We comment on the possibility of
neutron confinement in this system.
