A dominating induced matching, also called an efficient edge domination, of a
graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n=|V|$ vertices and $m=|E|$ edges is a subset $F
\subseteq E$ of edges in the graph such that no two edges in $F$ share a common
endpoint and each edge in $E\setminus F$ is incident with exactly one edge in
$F$. It is NP-hard to decide whether a graph admits a dominating induced
matching or not. In this paper, we design a $1.1467^nn^{O(1)}$-time exact
algorithm for this problem, improving all previous results. This problem can be
redefined as a partition problem that is to partition the vertex set of a graph
into two parts $I$ and $F$, where $I$ induces an independent set (a 0-regular
graph) and $F$ induces a perfect matching (a 1-regular graph). After giving
several structural properties of the problem, we show that the problem always
contains some "good vertices", branching on which by including them to either
$I$ or $F$ we can effectively reduce the graph. This leads to a fast exact
algorithm to this problem.
