We investigate analytically the problem of enumeration of nonequivalent
primitive words in the braid group B_n for n >> 1 by analysing the random word
statistics and the target space on the basis of the locally free group
approximation. We develop a "symbolic dynamics" method for exact word
enumeration in locally free groups and bring arguments in support of the
conjecture that the number of very long primitive words in the braid group is
not sensitive to the precise local commutation relations. We consider the
connection of these problems with the conventional random operator theory,
localization phenomena and statistics of systems with quenched disorder. Also
we discuss the relation of the particular problems of random operator theory to
the theory of modular functions
