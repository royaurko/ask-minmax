Confinement has been introduced into the quark gap equation, as proposed by
Cornwall, as a possible solution to the problem of chiral symmetry breaking in
QCD with dynamically massive gluons. We argue that the same mechanism can be
applied for technicolor with dynamically massive technigluons. Within this
approach both theories develop a hard self-energy dynamics, resulting from an
effective four-fermion interaction, which does not lead to the known
technicolor phenomenological problems. We outline a quite general type of
technicolor model within this proposal that may naturally explain the masses of
different fermion generations.
