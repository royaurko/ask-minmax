Achieving joint objectives by teams of cooperative planning agents requires
significant coordination and communication efforts. For a single-agent system
facing a plan failure in a dynamic environment, arguably, attempts to repair
the failed plan in general do not straightforwardly bring any benefit in terms
of time complexity. However, in multi-agent settings the communication
complexity might be of a much higher importance, possibly a high communication
overhead might be even prohibitive in certain domains. We hypothesize that in
decentralized systems, where coordination is enforced to achieve joint
objectives, attempts to repair failed multi-agent plans should lead to lower
communication overhead than replanning from scratch.
  The contribution of the presented paper is threefold. Firstly, we formally
introduce the multi-agent plan repair problem and formally present the core
hypothesis underlying our work. Secondly, we propose three algorithms for
multi-agent plan repair reducing the problem to specialized instances of the
multi-agent planning problem. Finally, we present results of experimental
validation confirming the core hypothesis of the paper.
