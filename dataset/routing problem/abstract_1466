Carbon materials are attracting increasing attention due to the novelty of
the associated physical properties and the potential applications in high-tech
devices. The possibility to achieve outstanding properties in macroscopic
carbon materials opens up a profusion of new striking applications. Magnetic
properties induced by defects on graphite structures, such as pores, edges of
the planes and topological defects, have been theoretically predicted. The
possible coexistence of sp3 and sp2 bonds have been also invoked to predict
this behavior (for a review, see ref. 1). Some reports have proved the
existence of weak ferromagnetic-like magnetization loops in highly-oriented
pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) (ref. 2-3). Very recently two reports showed that the
existence of ferromagnetism in pure carbon is unambiguously possible (ref.
4-5). Here we report on a novel and inexpensive chemical route consistent in a
controlled etching on the graphite structure to obtain macroscopic amounts of
magnetic pure graphite. This material has a strong magnetic response even at
room temperature where it can be attracted by a commercial magnet and would be
the experimental confirmation for the defect induced magnetism previously
predicted.
