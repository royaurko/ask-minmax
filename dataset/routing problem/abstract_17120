In this paper, the notion of Integral Value Transformations (IVTs), a class
of Discrete Dynamical Maps has been introduced. Then notion of Affine Discrete
Dynamical System (ADDS) in the light of IVTs is defined and some rudimentary
mathematical properties of the system are depicted. Collatz Conjecture is one
of the most enigmatic problems in 20th Century. The Conjecture was posed by
German Mathematician L. Collatz in 1937. There are much advancement in
generalizing and defining analogous conjectures, but even to the date, there is
no fruitful result for the advancement for the settlement of the conjecture. We
have made an effort to make a Collatz type problem in the domain of IVTs and we
have been able to solve the problem in 2011 [1]. Here mainly, we have focused
and inquired on Collatz-like ADDS. Finally, we have designed the Optimal
Distributed and Parallel Environment (ODPE) in the light of ADDS.
