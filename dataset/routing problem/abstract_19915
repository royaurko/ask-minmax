It is argued that in hot gauge field theories, "Hard Thermal Loops" leading
order calculations call for a definite sequence of angular averages and
discontinuity (or Imaginary part prescription) operations, and run otherwise
into incorrect results. The ten years old collinear singularity problem of hot
$QCD$, provides a striking illustration of that fate.
