Supersymmetric models with an inverted mass hierarchy (IMH: multi-TeV first
and second generation matter scalars, and sub-TeV third generation scalars) can
ameliorate problems arising from flavor changing neutral currents, $CP$
violating phases and electric dipole moments, while at the same time satisfying
conditions on naturalness. It has recently been shown that such an IMH can be
generated radiatively, making use of infra-red fixed point properties of
renormalization group equations given Yukawa coupling unification and suitable
$GUT$ scale boundary conditions on soft SUSY breaking masses. In these models,
explicit spectra cannot be obtained due to problems implementing radiative
electroweak symmetry breaking (REWSB). We show that use of SO(10) $D$-term
contributions to scalar masses can allow REWSB to occur, while maintaining much
of the desired IMH. A somewhat improved IMH is obtained if splittings are
applied only to Higgs scalar masses.
