The Garside group, as a generalization of braid groups and Artin groups of
finite types, is defined as the group of fractions of a Garside monoid. We show
that the semidirect product of Garside monoids is a Garside monoid. We use the
semidirect product $\mathbb Z\ltimes G^n$ of the infinite cyclic group $\mathbb
Z$ and the cartesian product $G^n$ of a Garside group $G$ to study the
properties of roots and powers of elements in $G$.
  The main result is an estimate of the growth of the minimal word-length of
powers of elements in Garside groups, when the generating set is the set of
simple elements. A direct application is that the set of translation numbers in
Garside groups is discrete. It gives an affirmative answer to the question of
Gersten and Short for the case of Garside groups. The original question is for
biautomatic groups.
  And we show that the root extraction problem in a Garside group $G$ can be
reduced to a conjugacy problem in $\mathbb Z\ltimes G^n$. Using the algorithm
for the conjugacy problem in Garside groups, the root extraction problem is
decidable for any Garside group.
