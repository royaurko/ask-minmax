In the context of a species sampling problem we discuss a non-parametric
maximum likelihood estimator for the underlying probability mass function. The
estimator is known in the computer science literature as the high profile
estimator. We prove strong consistency and derive the rates of convergence, for
an extended model version of the estimator. We also study a sieved estimator
for which similar consistency results are derived. Numerical computation of the
sieved estimator is of great interest for practical problems, such as forensic
DNA analysis, and we present a computational algorithm based on the stochastic
approximation of the expectation maximisation algorithm. As an interesting
byproduct of the numerical analyses we introduce an algorithm for bounded
isotonic regression for which we also prove convergence.
