The discovery of a small cosmological constant has stimulated interest in the
measure problem. One should expect to be a typical observer, but defining such
a thing is difficult in the vastness of an eternally inflating universe. We
propose that a crucial prerequisite is understanding why one should exist as an
observer at all. We assume that the Physical Church Turing Thesis is correct
and therefore all observers (and everything else that exists) can be described
as different types of information. We then argue that the observers
collectively form the largest class of information (where, in analogy with the
Faddeev Popov procedure, we only count over "gauge invariant" forms of
information). The statistical predominance of the observers is due to their
ability to selectively absorb other forms of information from many different
sources. In particular, it is the combinatorics that arise from this selection
process which leads us to equate the observer class $\mathcal{O}$ with the
nontrivial power set $\hat{\mathcal{P}}(\mathcal{U})$ of the set of all
information $\mathcal{U}$. Observers themselves are thus the typical form of
information. If correct, this proposal simplifies the measure problem, and
leads to dramatic long term predictions.
