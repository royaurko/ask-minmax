Exclusive measurements of prompt $\gamma$-rays from the heavy-residues with
various light charged particles in the $^7$Li + $^{198}$Pt system, at an energy
near the Coulomb barrier (E/$V_b$ $\sim$ 1.6) are reported. Recent dynamic
classical trajectory calculations, constrained by the measured fusion, $\alpha$
and $t$ capture cross-sections have been used to explain the excitation energy
dependence of the residue cross-sections. These calculations distinctly
illustrate a two step process, breakup followed by fusion in case of the
capture of $t$ and $\alpha$ clusters; whereas for $^{6}$He + $p$ and $^{5}$He +
$d$ configurations, massive transfer is inferred to be the dominant mechanism.
The present work clearly demonstrates the role played by the cluster structures
of $^7$Li in understanding the reaction dynamics at energies around the Coulomb
barrier.
