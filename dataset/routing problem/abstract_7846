This survey paper is not a complete reference guide to number-theoretical
applications of ergodic theory. Instead, it considers an approach to a class of
problems involving Diophantine properties of $n$-tuples of real numbers,
namely, describes a specific dynamical system which is naturally connected with
these problems.
