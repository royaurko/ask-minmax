Consistent Query Answering (CQA) is the problem of computing from a database
the answers to a query that are consistent with respect to certain integrity
constraints that the database, as a whole, may fail to satisfy. Consistent
answers have been characterized as those that are invariant under certain
minimal forms of restoration of the database consistency. We investigate
algorithmic and complexity theoretic issues of CQA under database repairs that
minimally depart -wrt the cardinality of the symmetric difference- from the
original database. We obtain first tight complexity bounds.
  We also address the problem of incremental complexity of CQA, that naturally
occurs when an originally consistent database becomes inconsistent after the
execution of a sequence of update operations. Tight bounds on incremental
complexity are provided for various semantics under denial constraints. Fixed
parameter tractability is also investigated in this dynamic context, where the
size of the update sequence becomes the relevant parameter.
