Photonic technologies have received considerable attention for enhancement of
radio-frequency (RF) electrical systems, including high-frequency analog signal
transmission, control of phased arrays, analog-to-digital conversion, and
signal processing. Although the potential of radio-frequency photonics for
implementation of tunable electrical filters over broad RF bandwidths has been
much discussed, realization of programmable filters with highly selective
filter lineshapes and rapid reconfigurability has faced significant challenges.
A new approach for RF photonic filters based on frequency combs offers a
potential route to simultaneous high stopband attenuation, fast tunability, and
bandwidth reconfiguration. In one configuration tuning of the RF passband
frequency is demonstrated with unprecedented (~40 ns) speed by controlling the
optical delay between combs. In a second, fixed filter configuration, cascaded
four-wave mixing simultaneously broadens and smoothes comb spectra, resulting
in Gaussian RF filter lineshapes exhibiting extremely high (>60 dB) main lobe
to sidelobe suppression ratio and (>70 dB) stopband attenuation.
