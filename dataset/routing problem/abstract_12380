In this paper the basic model for the anisotropic geometrodynamics (AGD) is
introduced and used to discuss the classical GRT tests - orbit precession,
light bending and gravitational red shift - on the galactic scale. It is shown
that the corresponding effects could be used for the interpretation of the
observed phenomena. Moreover, the AGD approach provides the interpretations
that are free from the need of dark matter and dark energy, and explains the
problems with the cosmological constant which is introduced when the problems
arise.
