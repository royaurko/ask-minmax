Given a large data matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, we consider the
problem of determining whether its entries are i.i.d. with some known marginal
distribution $A_{ij}\sim P_0$, or instead $A$ contains a principal submatrix
$A_{{\sf Q},{\sf Q}}$ whose entries have marginal distribution $A_{ij}\sim
P_1\neq P_0$. As a special case, the hidden (or planted) clique problem
requires to find a planted clique in an otherwise uniformly random graph.
  Assuming unbounded computational resources, this hypothesis testing problem
is statistically solvable provided $|{\sf Q}|\ge C \log n$ for a suitable
constant $C$. However, despite substantial effort, no polynomial time algorithm
is known that succeeds with high probability when $|{\sf Q}| = o(\sqrt{n})$.
Recently Meka and Wigderson \cite{meka2013association}, proposed a method to
establish lower bounds within the Sum of Squares (SOS) semidefinite hierarchy.
  Here we consider the degree-$4$ SOS relaxation, and study the construction of
\cite{meka2013association} to prove that SOS fails unless $k\ge C\,
n^{1/3}/\log n$. An argument presented by Barak implies that this lower bound
cannot be substantially improved unless the witness construction is changed in
the proof. Our proof uses the moments method to bound the spectrum of a certain
random association scheme, i.e. a symmetric random matrix whose rows and
columns are indexed by the edges of an Erd\"os-Renyi random graph.
