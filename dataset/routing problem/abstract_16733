The problem of robust dynamic pricing of an abstract commodity, whose
inventory is specified at an initial time but never subsequently replenished,
originally studied by Perakis and Sood (2006) in discrete time, is considered
from the perspective of continuous time. We use a multiplicative demand
function to model the uncertain demand, and develop a robust counterpart to
replace the uncertain demand constraint. The sellers' robust best response
problem yields a generalized Nash equilibrium problem, which can be formulated
as an equivalent, continuous-time quasi-variational inequality. We demonstrate
that, for appropriate regularity conditions, a generalized robust Nash
equilibrium exists. We show that the quasi-variational inequality may be
replaced by an equivalent variational inequality, and use a fixed-point
algorithm to solve the variational inequality. We also demonstrate how explicit
time lags associated with price updating in real-world decision environments,
as well as specific pricing decision rules, may be introduced to create a dual
time scale formulation and the associated solutions computed. We illustrate,
via numerical examples, how robust pricing based on our DPFI formulation offers
generally superior and never inferior worst case performance compared to
nominal pricing.
