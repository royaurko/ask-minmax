In chiral soliton models for baryons the computation of hadronic decay widths
of baryon resonances is a long standing problem. For the three flavor Skyrme
model I present a solution to this problem that satisfies large--$N_C$
consistency conditions. As an application I focus on the hadronic decay of the
$\Theta$ and $\Theta^*$ pentaquarks.
