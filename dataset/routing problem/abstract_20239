We describe a very general (nonlinear) Fredholm theory for a new class of
ambient spaces, called polyfolds. This theory is applicable to Gromov-Witten
and Floer Theory as well as Symplectic Field Theory. It should also be
applicable to a wider range of elliptic problems with analytical limiting
behaviour.
