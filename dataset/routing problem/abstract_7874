We derive theta function representations of algebro-geometric solutions of a
discrete system governed by a transfer matrix associated with (an extension of)
the trigonometric moment problem studied by Szego and Baxter. We also derive a
new hierarchy of coupled nonlinear difference equations satisfied by these
algebro-geometric solutions.
