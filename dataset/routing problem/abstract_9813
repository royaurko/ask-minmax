In this survey article we present difference field algorithms for symbolic
summation. Special emphasize is put on new aspects in how the summation
problems are rephrased in terms of difference fields, how the problems are
solved there, and how the derived results in the given difference field can be
reinterpreted as solutions of the input problem. The algorithms are illustrated
with the Mathematica package \SigmaP\ by discovering and proving new harmonic
number identities extending those from (Paule and Schneider, 2003). In
addition, the newly developed package \texttt{EvaluateMultiSums} is introduced
that combines the presented tools. In this way, large scale summation problems
for the evaluation of Feynman diagrams in QCD (Quantum ChromoDynamics) can be
solved completely automatically.
