This paper surveys how formal verification can be used to prove the
correctness of ad hoc routing protocols, which are fundamental infrastructure
of wireless sensor networks. The existing techniques fall into two classes:
verification on small-scale networks and verification on unbounded networks.
The former one is always fully automatic and easy to use, thanks to the limited
state space generated in verification. However, it cannot prove the correctness
over all cases. The latter one can provide a complete proof based on
abstractions of unbounded network. However, it usually needs user intervention
and expertise in verification. The two kinds of technique are illustrated by
verifications against some key properties such as stability, loop-freedom and
deadlock-freedom. To conclude, they can be used to find faults and prove
correctness, respectively. We believe that they can together aid the
development of correct ad hoc routing protocols and their reliable
implementations.
