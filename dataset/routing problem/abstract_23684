The first part of the course is devoted to the study of solutions to the
Laplace equation in $\Omega\setminus K$, where $\Omega$ is a two-dimensional
smooth domain and $K$ is a compact one-dimensional subset of $\Omega$. The
solutions are required to satisfy a homogeneous Neumann boundary condition on
$K$ and a nonhomogeneous Dirichlet condition on (part of) $\partial\Omega$. The
main result is the continuous dependence of the solution on $K$, with respect
to the Hausdorff metric, provided that the number of connected components of
$K$ remains bounded. Classical examples show that the result is no longer true
without this hypothesis.
  Using this stability result, the second part of the course develops a
rigorous mathematical formulation of a variational quasi-static model of the
slow growth of brittle fractures, recently introduced by Francfort and Marigo.
Starting from a discrete-time formulation, a more satisfactory continuous-time
formulation is obtained, with full justification of the convergence arguments.
