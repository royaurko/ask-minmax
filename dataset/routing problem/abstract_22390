Ostrogradsky's construction of a Hamiltonian formalism for nondegenerate
higher derivative Lagrangians is reviewed. The resulting instability imposes by
far the most powerful restriction on fundamental, interacting, continuum
Lagrangian field theories. A discussion is given of the problems raised by
attempts to evade this restriction.
