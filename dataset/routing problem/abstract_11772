We show that the Painleve equations P3-P5 can be derived (in a unified way)
from a periodic sequence of Darboux transformations for a Schrodinger problem
with quadratic eigenvalue dependency. The general problem naturally divides
into three different branches, each described by an infinite chain of
equations. The Painleve equations are obtained by closing the chain
periodically at the lowest nontrivial level(s). The chains provide ``symmetric
forms'' for the Painleve equations, from which Hirota bilinear forms and Lax
pairs are derived. In this paper (Part 1) we analyze in detail the cases P3-P5,
while P6 will be studied in Part 2.
