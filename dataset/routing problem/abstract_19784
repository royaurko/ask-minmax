It has been shown recently that Dirac operators satisfying the
Ginsparg-Wilson relation provide a solution of the chirality problem in QCD at
finite lattice spacing. We discuss different ways to construct these operators
and their properties. The possibility to define lattice chiral gauge theories
is briefly discussed as well.
