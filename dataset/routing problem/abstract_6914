In this paper we deal with a free boundary problem modeling the growth of
nonnecrotic tumors.The tumor is treated as an incompressible fluid, the tissue
elasticity is neglected and no chemical inhibitor species are present. We
re-express the mathematical model as an operator equation and by using a
bifurcation argument we prove that there exist stationary solutions of the
problem which are not radially symmetric.
