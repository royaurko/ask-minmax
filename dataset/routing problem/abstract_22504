Large-scale skymapping with COMPTEL using the full survey database presents
challenging problems on account of the complex response and time-variable
background. A new approach which attempts to address some of these problems is
described, in which the information about each observation is preserved
throughout the analysis. In this method, a maximum-entropy algorithm is used to
determine image and background simultaneously. Because of the extreme computing
requirements, the method has been implemented on a parallel computer, which
brings large gains since the response computation is fully parallelizable. The
zero level is left undetermined in this method. Results using data from 7 years
of COMPTEL data are presented.
