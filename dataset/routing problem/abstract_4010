In this paper we discusses the relationship between the known classes P and
NP. We show that the difficulties in solving problem "P versus NP" have
methodological in nature. An algorithm for solving any problem is sensitive to
even small changes in its formulation. As we will shown in the paper, these
difficulties are exactly in the formulation of some problems of the class NP.
