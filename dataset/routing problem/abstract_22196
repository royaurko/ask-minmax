This work concerns the Perona-Malik equation, which plays essential role in
image processing. The first part gives a survey of results on existance,
uniqueness and stability of solutions, the second part introduces
discretisations of equation and deals with an analysis of discrete problem. In
the last part I present some numerical results, in particular with algorithms
applied to real images.
