We give a new two-pass authentication scheme, whichis a generalisation of an
authentication scheme of Sibert-Dehornoy-Girault based on the Diffie-Hellman
conjugacy problem. Compared to the above scheme, for some parameters it is more
efficient with respect to multiplications. We sketch a proof that our
authentication scheme is secure. We give a new key agreement protocols.
