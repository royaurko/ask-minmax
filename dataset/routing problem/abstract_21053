Throughout this article we develop and change the definitions and the ideas
in "arXiv:1006.4939", in order to consider the efficiency of functions and
complexity time problems. The central idea here is effective enumeration and
listing, and efficiency of function which is defined between two sets proposed
in basic definitions. More in detail, it might be that h and g were co-order
but the velocity of them be different.
