In this note an improvement of the Katz's bound on the number of elements in
a finite field with given trace and norm is given. The improvement is obtained
by reducing the problem to estimating the number of rational points on certain
toric Calabi-Yau hypersurface, and then to use detailed cohomological
calculations by Rojas-Leon and the second contributor for such toric hypersurfaces.
