The simulation of high-rate deformation and failure of metals is has
traditionally been performed using Lagrangian finite element methods or
Eulerian hydrocodes. Lagrangian mesh-based methods are limited by issues
involving mesh entanglement under large deformation and considerable complexity
in handling contact. On the other hand, Eulerian hydrocodes are prone to
material diffusion. In the Material Point Method (MPM), the material state is
defined on solid Lagrangian particles. The particles interact with other
particles in the same body, with other solid bodies, or with fluids through a
background mesh. Thus, some of the problems associated with finite element
codes and hydrocodes are alleviated. Another attractive feature of the material
point method is the ease with which large deformation, fully coupled,
fluid-structure interaction problems can be handled. In this work, we present
MPM simulations that involve large plastic deformations, contact, material
failure and fragmentation, and fluid-structure interaction.
