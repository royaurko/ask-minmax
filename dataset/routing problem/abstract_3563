Recently a large number of graph separator problems have been proven to be
\textsc{NP-Hard}. Amazingly we have found that
$\alpha$-Subgraph-Balanced-Vertex-Separator, an important variant, has been
overlooked. In this work ``Yet Another Graph Partitioning Problem is NP-Hard"
we present the surprising result that
$\alpha$-Subgraph-Balanced-Vertex-Separator is $NP$-Hard. This is despite the
fact that the constraints of our new problem are harder to satisfy than the
original problem.
