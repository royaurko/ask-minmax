The paper is devoted to the study of a stabilization problem for the 2D
incompressible Euler system in an infinite strip with boundary controls. We
show that for any stationary solution (c, 0) of the Euler system there is a
control which is supported in a given bounded part of the boundary of the strip
and stabilizes the system to (c, 0).
