The article is devoted to the problem of Hilbert-Schmidt type analytic
extensions in Hardy spaces over the infinite-dimensional unitary matrix group
endowed with an invariant probability measure. An orthogonal basis of
Hilbert-Schmidt polynomials, reproducing kernels, integral formulas and
boundary values are investigated.
