We pursue the study of families of functions on the natural numbers, with
emphasis here on the bounded families. The situation being more complicated
than the unbounded case, we attack the problem by classifying the families
according to their bounding and dominating numbers, the traditional scheme for
gaps. Many open questions remain.
