Application of root density estimator to problems of statistical data
analysis is demonstrated. Four sets of basis functions based on
Chebyshev-Hermite, Laguerre, Kravchuk and Charlier polynomials are considered.
The sets may be used for numerical analysis in problems of reconstructing
statistical distributions by experimental data. Examples of numerical modeling
are given.
