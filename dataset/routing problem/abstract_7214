Higher order boundary value problems (BVPs) play an important role modeling
various scientific and engineering problems. In this article we develop an
efficient numerical scheme for linear $m^{th}$ order BVPs. First we convert the
higher order BVP to a first order BVP. Then we use Tchebychev orthogonal
polynomials to approximate the solution of the BVP as a weighted sum of
polynomials. We collocate at Tchebychev clustered grid points to generate a
system of equations to approximate the weights for the polynomials. The
excellency of the numerical scheme is illustrated through some examples.
