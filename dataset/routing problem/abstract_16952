The dimer problem arose in a thermodynamic study of diatomic molecules, and
was abstracted into one of the most basic and natural problems in both
statistical mechanics and combinatoric mathematics. Given a rectangular lattice
of volume V in d dimensions, the dimer problem loosely speaking is to count the
number of different ways dimers (dominoes) may be laid down in the lattice
(without overlapping) to completely cover it. Each dimer covers two neighboring
vertices. It is known that the number of such coverings is roughly exp(lambda_d
V) for some constant lambda_d as V goes to infinity. Herein we present a
mathematical argument for an asymptotic expansion for lambda_d in inverse
powers of d, and the results of computer computations for the first few terms
in the series. As a glaring challenge, we conjecture no one will compute the
next term in the series, due to the requisite computer time and storage
demands.
