The L^2 -critical defocusing nonlinear Schrodinger initial value problem on
R^d is known to be locally well-posed for initial data in L^2. Hamiltonian
conservation and the pseudoconformal transformation show that global
well-posedness holds for initial data u_0 in Sobolev H^1 and for data in the
weighted space (1+|x|) u_0 in L^2. For the d=2 problem, it is known that global
existence holds for data in H^s and also for data in the weighted space
(1+|x|)^{\sigma} u_0 in L^2 for certain s, \sigma < 1. We prove: If global
well-posedness holds in H^s then global existence and scattering holds for
initial data in the weighted space with \sigma = s.
