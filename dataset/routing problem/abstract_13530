Using a capacity approach, and the theory of measure's perturbation of
Dirichlet forms, we give the probabilistic representation of the General Robin
boundary value problems on an arbitrary domain $\Omega$, involving smooth
measures, which give arise to a new process obtained by killing the general
reflecting Brownian motion at a random time. We obtain some properties of the
semigroup directly from its probabilistic representation, and some convergence
theorems, and also a probabilistic interpretation of the phenomena occurring on
the boundary.
