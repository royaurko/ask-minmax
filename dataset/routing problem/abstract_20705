It is shown that fifth-order nonlinear dispersion equations from compacton
theory admit shock and rarefaction waves. A self-similar gradient blow-up is
shown to admit infinitely many similarity extensions beyond blow-up time,
meaning principal nonuniqueness of solutions of the Cauchy problem after
occurring such singularities.
