We consider a well defined joint detection and parameter estimation problem.
By combining the Baysian formulation of the estimation subproblem with suitable
constraints on the detection subproblem we develop optimum one- and two-step
test for the joint detection/estimation case. The proposed combined strategies
have the very desirable characteristic to allow for the trade-off between
detection power and estimation efficiency. Our theoretical developments are
then applied to the problems of retrospective changepoint detection and MIMO
radar. In the former case we are interested in detecting a change in the
statistics of a set of available data and provide an estimate for the time of
change, while in the latter in detecting a target and estimating its location.
Intense simulations demonstrate that by using the jointly optimum schemes, we
can experience significant improvement in estimation quality with small
sacrifice in detection power.
