Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have severe energy constraints imposed by
limited capacity of the internal battery of sensor nodes. These restrictions
stimulate the development of energy-efficient strategies aimed at increasing
the period of stability and lifetime of these networks. In this paper, we
propose a centralized control to elect more appropriate Cluster Heads, assuming
three levels of heterogeneity and multi-hop communication between Cluster
Heads. The centralized control uses the k-means algorithm, responsible for the
division of clusters and Fuzzy Logic to elect the Cluster Head and selecting
the best route of communication. The study results indicate that the proposed
approach can increase the period of stability and lifetime in WSN.
