We present a numerical scheme for solving a parameter estimation problem for
a model of low-grade glioma growth. Our goal is to estimate the spatial
distribution of tumor concentration, as well as the magnitude of anisotropic
tumor diffusion. We use a constrained optimization formulation with a
reaction-diffusion model that results in a system of nonlinear partial
differential equations (PDEs). In our formulation, we estimate the parameters
using partially observed, noisy tumor concentration data at two different time
instances, along with white matter fiber directions derived from diffusion
tensor imaging (DTI). The optimization problem is solved with a Gauss-Newton
reduced space algorithm. We present the formulation and outline the numerical
algorithms for solving the resulting equations. We test the method using a
synthetic dataset and compute the reconstruction error for different noise
levels and detection thresholds for monofocal and multifocal test cases.
