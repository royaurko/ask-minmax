We focus here on the water waves problem for uneven bottoms in the long-wave
regime, on an unbounded two or three-dimensional domain. In order to derive
asymptotic models for this problem, we consider two different regimes of bottom
topography, one for small variations in amplitude, and one for strong
variations. Starting from the Zakharov formulation of this problem, we
rigorously compute the asymptotics expansion of the involved Dirichlet-Neumann
operator. then, following the global strategy introduced by Bona, Colin and
Lannes, new symetric asymptotic models are derived for each regime of bottom
topography. Solutions of these systems are proved to give good approximations
of solutions of the water waves problem. These results hold for solutions that
evanesce at infinity as well as for spatially periodic ones.
