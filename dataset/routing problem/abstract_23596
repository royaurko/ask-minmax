Gauge theories embedded into higher-dimensional spaces with certain
topologies acquire inductance terms, which reflect the energy cost of
topological charges accumulated in the extra dimensions. We compute topological
susceptibility in the strongly-coupled two-flavor massive Schwinger model with
such an inductance term and find that it vanishes, due to the contribution of a
global low-energy mode (a ``global axion''). This is in accord with the general
argument on the absence of theta-dependence in such topologies. Because the
mode is a single oscillator, there is no corresponding particle, and the
solution to the U(1) problem is unaffected.
