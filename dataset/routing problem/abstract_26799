Nowadays, the data to be processed by database systems has grown so large
that any conventional, centralized technique is inadequate. At the same time,
general purpose computation on GPU (GPGPU) recently has successfully drawn
attention from the data management community due to its ability to achieve
significant speed-ups at a small cost. Efficient skew handling is a well-known
problem in parallel queries, independently of the execution environment. In
this work, we investigate solutions to the problem of load imbalances in
parallel aggregate queries on GPUs that are caused by skewed data. We present a
generic load-balancing framework along with several instantiations, which we
experimentally evaluate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
attempt to present runtime load-balancing techniques for database operations on
GPUs.
