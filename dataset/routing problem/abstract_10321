We introduce a novel algorithm for solving learning problems where both the
loss function and the regularizer are non-convex but belong to the class of
difference of convex (DC) functions. Our contribution is a new general purpose
proximal Newton algorithm that is able to deal with such a situation. The
algorithm consists in obtaining a descent direction from an approximation of
the loss function and then in performing a line search to ensure sufficient
descent. A theoretical analysis is provided showing that the iterates of the
proposed algorithm {admit} as limit points stationary points of the DC
objective function. Numerical experiments show that our approach is more
efficient than current state of the art for a problem with a convex loss
functions and non-convex regularizer. We have also illustrated the benefit of
our algorithm in high-dimensional transductive learning problem where both loss
function and regularizers are non-convex.
