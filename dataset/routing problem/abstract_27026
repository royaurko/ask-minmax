Due to the rapid growth of internet broadband access and proliferation of
modern mobile devices, various types of multimedia (e.g. text, images, audios
and videos) have become ubiquitously available anytime. Mobile device users
usually store and use multimedia contents based on their personal interests and
preferences. Mobile device challenges such as storage limitation have however
introduced the problem of mobile multimedia overload to users. In order to
tackle this problem, researchers have developed various techniques that
recommend multimedia for mobile users. In this survey paper, we examine the
importance of mobile multimedia recommendation systems from the perspective of
three smart communities, namely, mobile social learning, mobile event guide and
context-aware services. A cautious analysis of existing research reveals that
the implementation of proactive, sensor-based and hybrid recommender systems
can improve mobile multimedia recommendations. Nevertheless, there are still
challenges and open issues such as the incorporation of context and social
properties, which need to be tackled in order to generate accurate and
trustworthy mobile multimedia recommendations.
