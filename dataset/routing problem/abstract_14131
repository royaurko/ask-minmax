Stability of the utility maximization problem with random endowment and
indifference prices is studied for a sequence of financial markets in an
incomplete Brownian setting. Our novelty lies in the nonequivalence of markets,
in which the volatility of asset prices (as well as the drift) varies.
Degeneracies arise from the presence of nonequivalence. In the positive real
line utility framework, a counterexample is presented showing that the expected
utility maximization problem can be unstable. A positive stability result is
proven for utility functions on the entire real line.
