In this paper we prove that the defocusing, $d$-dimensional mass critical
nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger initial value problem is globally well-posed and
scattering for $u_{0} \in L^{2}(\mathbf{R}^{d})$ and $d \geq 3$. To do this, we
will prove a frequency localized interaction Morawetz estimate similar to the
estimate made in [10]. Since we are considering an $L^{2}$ - critical initial
value problem we will localize to low frequencies.
