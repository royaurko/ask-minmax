We reappraise the flavour changing neutral currents (FCNC) problem in
string--derived supergravity models. We overview and classify possible sources
of flavour violation and find that the problem often does not arise in classes
of models which generate hierarchical Yukawa matrices. In such models,
constraints from the K- and D-meson systems leave room for substantial flavour
non-universality of the soft terms. The current B-physics experiments only
begin to probe its natural range. Correlations among different observables can
allow one to read off the chirality structure of flavour violating sources. We
briefly discuss the lepton sector where the problem of FCNC is indeed serious
and perhaps points at an additional symmetry or flavour universality.
