Recently the 14 moments model of Extended Thermodynamics for dense gases and
macromolecular fluids has been considered and an exact solution, of the
restrictions imposed by the entropy principle and that of Galilean relativity,
has been obtained through a non relativistic limit. Here we prove uniqueness of
the above solution and exploit other pertinent conditions such us the convexity
of the function $h'$ related to the entropy density, the problem of subsystems
and the fact that the flux in the conservation law of mass must be the moment
of order 1 in the conservation law of momentum. Also the solution of this last
condition is here obtained without using expansions around equilibrium. The
results present interesting aspects which were not suspected when only
approximated solutions of this problem were known.
