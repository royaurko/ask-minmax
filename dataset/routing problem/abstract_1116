Experimental results for the evolution of the probability distribution
function (PDF) of a scalar mixed by a turbulence flow in a channel are
presented. The sequence of PDF from an initial skewed distribution to a sharp
Gaussian is found to be non universal. The route toward homogeneization depends
on the ratio between the cross sections of the dye injector and the channel. In
link with this observation, advantages, shortcomings and applicability of
models for the PDF evolution based on a self-convolution mechanisms are
discussed.
