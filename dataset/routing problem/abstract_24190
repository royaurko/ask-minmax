The sensitivity parameter is widely used for quantifying fine tuning.
However, examples show it fails to give correct results under certain
circumstances. We argue that the problems of the sensitivity parameter are
almost identical to the consequences we have to solved if the time-varying fine
structure constant is proved to be true. The high sensitivity of the energy
scale parameter (\Lambda) to the dimensionless coupling constant plays an
important role in these problems. It affects the reliability of the sensitivity
parameter via mechanisms such as dynamical symmetry breaking, chiral symmetry
breaking etc. The reliability of the sensitivity parameter can be improved if
it is used properly.
