The main issue in Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) is the poor
performance of retrieval in terms of average precision when compared to
monolingual retrieval performance. The main reasons behind poor performance of
CLIR are mismatching of query terms, lexical ambiguity and un-translated query
terms. The existing problems of CLIR are needed to be addressed in order to
increase the performance of the CLIR system. In this paper, we are putting our
effort to solve the given problem by proposed an algorithm for improving the
performance of English-Hindi CLIR system. We used all possible combination of
Hindi translated query using transliteration of English query terms and
choosing the best query among them for retrieval of documents. The experiment
is performed on FIRE 2010 (Forum of Information Retrieval Evaluation) datasets.
The experimental result show that the proposed approach gives better
performance of English-Hindi CLIR system and also helps in overcoming existing
problems and outperforms the existing English-Hindi CLIR system in terms of
average precision.
