We apply the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to a harmonic diatomic molecule
with one electron. We compare the exact and approximate results not only for
the internal degrees of freedom but also for the motion of the center of mass.
We address the problem of identical nuclei and discuss other applications of
the model and its limitations.
