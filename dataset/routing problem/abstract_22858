We discuss the current status of the theory of the "high-temperature"
superconductivity in intercalated graphites YbC6 and CaC6. We emphasize that
while the general picture of conventional, phonon-driven superconductivity has
already emerged and is generally accepted, there are still interesting problems
with this picture, such as weak-coupling regime inferred from specific heat
suggesting coupling exclusively with high-energy carbon phonons coming in
direct contradiction with the isotope effect measurements suggesting coupling
exclusively with the low-energy intercalant modes. At the same time, the first
principle calculations, while explaining Tc, contradict both of the experiments
above by predicting equal coupling with both groups of phonons.
