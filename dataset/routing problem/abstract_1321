We present a theoretical analysis of different methods to synthesize
entangled states of two superconducting resonators. These methods use
experimentally demonstrated interactions of resonators with artificial atoms,
and offer efficient routes to generate nonclassical states. We analyze the
theoretical structure of these algorithms and their average performance for
arbitrary states and for deterministically preparing NOON states. Using a new
state synthesis algorithm, we show that NOON states can be prepared in a time
linear in the desired photon number and without any state-selective
interactions.
