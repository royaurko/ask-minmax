This paper presents a detailed study on analytical solutions to a general
nonlinear boundary-value problem in finite deformation theory. Based on
canonical duality theory and the associated pure complementary energy principle
in nonlinear elasticity proposed by Gao in 1999, we show that the general
nonlinear partial differential equation for deformation is actually equivalent
to an algebraic (tensor) equation in stress space. For St Venant-Kirchhoff
materials, this coupled cubic algebraic equation can be solved principally to
obtain all possible solutions. Our results show that for any given external
source field such that the statically admissible first Piola-Kirchhoff stress
field has no-zero eigenvalues, the problem has a unique global minimal
solution, which is corresponding to a positive-definite second Piola-Kirchhoff
stress S, and at most eight local solutions corresponding to negative-definite
S. Additionally, the problem could have 15 unstable solutions corresponding to
indefinite S. This paper demonstrates that the canonical duality theory and the
pure complementary energy principle play fundamental roles in nonconvex
analysis and finite deformation theory.
