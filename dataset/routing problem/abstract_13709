The work develops the structure-dynamic approach in nanoionics for detailed
description of non-stationary ion-transport processes in irregular potential
relief (direct problem) and interpretation of ionic properties and
characteristics of nanosystems (inverse problem). Theoretical basis of the
structure-dynamic approach, including structural model of interface space
charge region, method of hidden variables and the criterion of smallness of
external influence is presented. The approach is applied for the computational
modeling of ion-transport in the region of ideally polarizable (blocking) solid
electrolyte/electronic conductor (SE/EC) heterojunctions in ac and
galvanostatic modes of external influence.
