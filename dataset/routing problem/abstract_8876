In this paper, we consider a robust consensus tracking problem of
heterogeneous multi-agent systems with time-varying interconnection topologies.
Based on common Lyapunov function and internal model techniques, both state and
output feedback control laws are derived to solve this problem. The proposed
design is robust by admitting some parameter uncertainties in the multi-agent
system.
