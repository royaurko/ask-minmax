Estimating a constrained relation is a fundamental problem in machine
learning. Special cases are classification (the problem of estimating a map
from a set of to-be-classified elements to a set of labels), clustering (the
problem of estimating an equivalence relation on a set) and ranking (the
problem of estimating a linear order on a set). We contribute a family of
probability measures on the set of all relations between two finite, non-empty
sets, which offers a joint abstraction of multi-label classification,
correlation clustering and ranking by linear ordering. Estimating (learning) a
maximally probable measure, given (a training set of) related and unrelated
pairs, is a convex optimization problem. Estimating (inferring) a maximally
probable relation, given a measure, is a 01-linear program. It is solved in
linear time for maps. It is NP-hard for equivalence relations and linear
orders. Practical solutions for all three cases are shown in experiments with
real data. Finally, estimating a maximally probable measure and relation
jointly is posed as a mixed-integer nonlinear program. This formulation
suggests a mathematical programming approach to semi-supervised learning.
