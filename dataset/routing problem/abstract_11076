A newly developed sharp interface model describes crack propagation by a
phase transition process. We solve this free boundary problem numerically and
obtain steady state solutions with a self-consistently selected propagation
velocity and shape of the crack, provided that elastodynamic effects are taken
into account. Also, we find a saturation of the steady state crack velocity
below the Rayleigh speed, tip blunting with increasing driving force and a tip
splitting instability above a critical driving force.
