The system of hydrodynamic-type equations is derived from Alexeev's
generalized Boltzmann kinetic equation by two-side distribution function for a
stratified gas in gravity field. It is applied to a problem of ultrasound
propagation and attenuation. The linearized version of the obtained system is
studied and compared with the Navier-Stokes one at arbitrary Knudsen numbers.
The problem of a generation by a moving plane in a rarefied gas is explored and
used as a test while compared with experiment. It is good agreement between
predicted propagation speed, attenuation factor and experimental results for a
wide range of Knudsen numbers.
