Recent intriguing discussion of heat death by Kutrovatz is critically
examined. It is shown that there exists another way of answering the heat death
puzzle, already present in the ancient philosophical tradition. This
alternative route relies not only on the final duration of time (which has been
re-discovered in modern times), but also on the notion of observational
self-selection, which has received wide publicity in the last several decades
under the title of the anthropic principle(s). Although the questions Kutrovatz
raises are important and welcome, there are several errors in his treatment of
cosmology which marr his account of the entire topic. In addition, the nascent
discipline of physical eschatology holds promise of answering the basic
explanatory task concerning the future evolution of the universe without
appealing to metaphysics. This is a completely novel feature in the history of
science, in contradistinction to the historical examples discussed.
