In this paper, we consider the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for a
physical model of the extrusion process, which is described by two systems of
conservation laws with a free boundary. By suitable change of coordinates and
fixed point argument, we obtain the existence, uniqueness and regularity of the
weak solution to this Cauchy problem.
