The Lorentz Integral Transform approach allows microscopic calculations of
electromagnetic reaction cross sections without explicit knowledge of final
state wave functions. The necessary inversion of the transform has to be
treated with great care, since it constitutes a so-called ill-posed problem. In
this work new inversion techniques for the Lorentz Integral Transform are
introduced. It is shown that they all contain a regularization scheme, which is
necessary to overcome the ill-posed problem. In addition it is illustrated that
the new techniques have a much broader range of application than the present
standard inversion method of the Lorentz Integral Transform.
