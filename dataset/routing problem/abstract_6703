We consider eigenvalue problems for general elliptic operators of arbitrary
order subject to homogeneous boundary conditions on open subsets of the
euclidean N-dimensional space. We prove stability results for the dependence of
the eigenvalues upon variation of the mass density and we prove a maximum
principle for extremum problems related to mass density perturbations which
preserve the total mass.
