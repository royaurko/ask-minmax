We are given a project-based university course, where our task is to assign
students to suitable projects. In the Student/Project Allocation problem, or
shortly SPA, each student submits a weighted list of their acceptable projects,
and likewise, a set of assignable students is given to each project. Moreover,
some projects are equipped with upper and lower quotas with regards to the
number of students assigned to them. The quota requirement is strict: projects
not reaching their lower quotas must be closed entirely. The challenge is to
find a b-matching of maximum weight observing the lower quotas.
  In our present work we show that finding such a maximum weight matching is an
NP-complete task even if all students mark at most two projects and all
projects have upper and lower quota three. Moreover, we also prove that if no
upper quota is larger than two, the problem immediately becomes polynomially
tractable. For the general case, an approximation algorithm is presented that
reaches the best possible ratio -- due to inapproximability bounds -- expressed
in various terms.
