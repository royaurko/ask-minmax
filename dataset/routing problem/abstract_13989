Multi-context systems provide a powerful framework for modelling
information-aggregation systems featuring heterogeneous reasoning components.
Their execution can, however, incur non-negligible cost. Here, we focus on
cost-complexity of such systems. To that end, we introduce cost-aware
multi-context systems, an extension of non-monotonic multi-context systems
framework taking into account costs incurred by execution of semantic operators
of the individual contexts. We formulate the notion of cost-complexity for
consistency and reasoning problems in MCSs. Subsequently, we provide a series
of results related to gradually more and more constrained classes of MCSs and
finally introduce an incremental cost-reducing algorithm solving the reasoning
problem for definite MCSs.
