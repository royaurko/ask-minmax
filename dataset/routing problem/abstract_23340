We revisit the supersymmetric CP problem and find that it can be naturally
resolved if the origin of CP violation is closely related to the origin of
flavour structures. In this case, the supersymmetry breaking dynamics do not
bring in any new CP-violating phases. This mechanism requires hermitian Yukawa
matrices which naturally arise in models with a U(3) flavour symmetry. The
neutron electric dipole moment (NEDM) is predicted to be within one-two orders
of magnitude below the current experimental limit. The model also predicts a
strong correlation between A_{CP}(b --> s gamma)and the NEDM. The strong CP
problem is mitigated although not completely solved.
