Automated synthesis of reactive control protocols from temporal logic
specifications has recently attracted considerable attention in various
applications in, for example, robotic motion planning, network management, and
hardware design. An implicit and often unrealistic assumption in this past work
is the availability of complete and precise sensing information during the
execution of the controllers. In this paper, we use an abstraction procedure
for systems with partial observation and propose a formalism to investigate
effects of limitations in sensing. The abstraction procedure enables the
existing synthesis methods with partial observation to be applicable and
efficient for systems with infinite (or finite but large number of) states.
This formalism enables us to systematically discover sensing modalities
necessary in order to render the underlying synthesis problems feasible. We use
counterexamples, which witness unrealizability potentially due to the
limitations in sensing and the coarseness in the abstract system, and
interpolation-based techniques to refine the model and the sensing modalities,
i.e., to identify new sensors to be included, in such synthesis problems. We
demonstrate the method on examples from robotic motion planning.
