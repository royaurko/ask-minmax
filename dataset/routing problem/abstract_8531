In a recent paper, Lenz and Moody (arXiv:1111.3617) presented a method for
constructing families of real solutions to the inverse problem for a given pure
point diffraction measure. Applying their technique and discussing some
possible extensions, we present, in a non-technical manner, some examples of
homometric structures.
