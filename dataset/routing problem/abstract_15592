We review recent progress in the study of the vertex-cover problem (VC). VC
belongs to the class of NP-complete graph theoretical problems, which plays a
central role in theoretical computer science. On ensembles of random graphs, VC
exhibits an coverable-uncoverable phase transition. Very close to this
transition, depending on the solution algorithm, easy-hard transitions in the
typical running time of the algorithms occur.
  We explain a statistical mechanics approach, which works by mapping VC to a
hard-core lattice gas, and then applying techniques like the replica trick or
the cavity approach. Using these methods, the phase diagram of VC could be
obtained exactly for connectivities $c<e$, where VC is replica symmetric.
Recently, this result could be confirmed using traditional mathematical
techniques. For $c>e$, the solution of VC exhibits full replica symmetry
breaking.
  The statistical mechanics approach can also be used to study analytically the
typical running time of simple complete and incomplete algorithms for VC.
Finally, we describe recent results for VC when studied on other ensembles of
finite- and infinite-dimensional graphs.
