Using mesa array of $\rm{Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8}}$ single crystal was
demonstrated recently as a promising route to enhance the radiation power
generated by Josephson oscillations in mesas. We study the synchronization in
such an array via the plasma waves in the base crystal. First, we analyze
plasma oscillations inside the base crystal generated by the synchronized mesa
array and the associated dissipation. We then solve the dynamic equation for
superconducting phase numerically to find conditions for synchronization and to
check the stability of synchronized state. We find that mesas are synchronized
when the cavity resonance of mesas matches with that of the base crystal. An
optimal configuration of mesa arrays is also obtained.
