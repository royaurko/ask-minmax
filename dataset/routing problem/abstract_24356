The main purpose of this paper is to approximate several non-local evolution
equations by zero-sum repeated games in the spirit of the previous works of
Kohn and the second contributor (2006 and 2009): general fully non-linear parabolic
integro-differential equations on the one hand, and the integral curvature flow
of an interface (Imbert, 2008) on the other hand. In order to do so, we start
by constructing such a game for eikonal equations whose speed has a
non-constant sign. This provides a (discrete) deterministic control
interpretation of these evolution equations. In all our games, two players
choose positions successively, and their final payoff is determined by their
positions and additional parameters of choice. Because of the non-locality of
the problems approximated, by contrast with local problems, their choices have
to "collect" information far from their current position. For integral
curvature flows, players choose hypersurfaces in the whole space and positions
on these hypersurfaces. For parabolic integro-differential equations, players
choose smooth functions on the whole space.
