Solitons are non-dispersing localized waves that occur in diverse physical
settings. A variety of optical solitons have been observed, but versions that
involve both spatial and temporal degrees of freedom are rare. Optical fibers
designed to support multiple transverse modes offer opportunities to study wave
propagation in a setting that is intermediate between single-mode fiber and
free-space propagation. Here we report the observation of optical solitons and
soliton self-frequency shifting in graded-index multimode fiber. These wave
packets can be modeled as multi-component solitons, or as solitons of the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Solitons in graded-index fibers should enable
increased data rates in low-cost telecommunications systems, are pertinent to
space-division multiplexing, and can offer a new route to mode-area scaling for
high-power lasers and transmission.
