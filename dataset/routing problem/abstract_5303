Shape-from-X is an important class of problems in the fields of geometry
processing, computer graphics, and vision, attempting to recover the structure
of a shape from some observations. In this paper, we formulate the problem of
shape-from-operator (SfO), recovering an embedding of a mesh from intrinsic
differential operators defined on the mesh. Particularly interesting instances
of our SfO problem include synthesis of shape analogies, shape-from-Laplacian
reconstruction, and shape exaggeration. Numerically, we approach the SfO
problem by splitting it into two optimization sub-problems that are applied in
an alternating scheme: metric-from-operator (reconstruction of the discrete
metric from the intrinsic operator) and embedding-from-metric (finding a shape
embedding that would realize a given metric, a setting of the multidimensional
scaling problem).
