We introduce a family of directed geometric graphs, denoted $\paz$, that
depend on two parameters $\lambda$ and $\theta$. For $0\leq
\theta<\frac{\pi}{2}$ and ${1/2} < \lambda < 1$, the $\paz$ graph is a strong
$t$-spanner, with $t=\frac{1}{(1-\lambda)\cos\theta}$. The out-degree of a node
in the $\paz$ graph is at most $\lfloor2\pi/\min(\theta,
\arccos\frac{1}{2\lambda})\rfloor$. Moreover, we show that routing can be
achieved locally on $\paz$. Next, we show that all strong $t$-spanners are also
$t$-spanners of the unit disk graph. Simulations for various values of the
parameters $\lambda$ and $\theta$ indicate that for random point sets, the
spanning ratio of $\paz$ is better than the proven theoretical bounds.
