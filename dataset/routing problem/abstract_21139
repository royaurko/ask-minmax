This paper is concerned with the stability of steady solutions to
initial-boundary-value problems of reaction-hyperbolic systems for axonal
transport. Under proper structural assumptions, we clarify the relaxation
structure of the reaction-hyperbolic systems and show the time-asymptotic
stability of steady solutions or relaxation boundary-layers.
