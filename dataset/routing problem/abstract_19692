The solution of topologically massive gravity with cosmological constant is
reduced, for space-times with two commuting Killing vectors, to a
special-relativistic dynamical problem. This approach is applied to the
construction of a class of exact sourceless, horizonless solutions asymptotic
to the BTZ extreme black holes.
