In [U. Dempwolff: More Translation Planes and Semifields from
Dembowski-Ostrom Polynomials, Designs, Codes, Cryptogr. \textbf{68} (1-3)
(2013), 81-103], the contributor gives a construction of three classes of rank two
semifields of order $q^{2n}$, with $q$ and $n$ odd, using Dembowski-Ostrom
polynomials. The question whether these semifields are new, i.e. not isotopic
to previous constructions, is left as an open problem. In this paper we solve
this problem for $n>3$, in particular we prove that two of these classes,
labeled $D_{A}$ and $D_{AB}$, are new for $n>3$, whereas presemifields in
family $D_{B}$ are isotopic to Generalized Twisted Fields for each $n\geq 3$.
