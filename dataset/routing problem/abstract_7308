We design an accurate orbital integration scheme for the general N-body
problem preserving all the conserved quantities but the angular momentum.This
scheme is based on the chain concept (Mikkola & Aarseth 1993) and is regarded
as an extension of a d'Alembert-type scheme (Betsch 2005) for constrained
Hamiltonian systems. It also coincides with the discrete-time general
three-body problem (Minesaki 2013) for particle number N = 3. Although the
proposed scheme is only second-order accurate, it can accurately reproduce some
periodic orbits, which generic geometric numerical integrators cannot do.
