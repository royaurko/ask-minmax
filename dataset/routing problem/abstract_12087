In this paper, to solve the invariant subspace problem, contraction operators
are classified into three classes ; (Case 1) completely non-unitary
contractions with a non-trivial algebraic element, (Case 2) completely
non-unitary contractions without a non-trivial algebraic element, or (Case 3)
contractions which are not completely non-unitary. We know that every operator
of (Case 3) has a non-trivial invariant subspace. In this paper, we answer to
the invariant subspace problem for the operators of (Case 2). Since (Case 1) is
simpler than (Case 2), we leave as a question.
