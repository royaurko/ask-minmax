An unconstrained optimization problem is formulated in terms of tropical
mathematics to minimize a functional that is defined on a vector set by a
matrix and calculated through multiplicative conjugate transposition. For some
particular cases, the minimum in the problem is known to be equal to the
tropical spectral radius of the matrix. We examine the problem in the common
setting of a general idempotent semifield. A complete direct solution in a
compact vector form is obtained to this problem under fairly general
conditions. The result is extended to solve new tropical optimization problems
with more general objective functions and inequality constraints. Applications
to real-world problems that arise in project scheduling are presented. To
illustrate the results obtained, numerical examples are also provided.
