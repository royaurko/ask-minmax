We consider minimizers of linear functionals of the type $$L(u)=\int_{\p
\Omega} u \, d \sigma - \int_{\Omega} u \, dx$$ in the class of convex
functions $u$ with prescribed determinant $\det D^2 u =f$.
  We obtain compactness properties for such minimizers and discuss their
regularity in two dimensions.
