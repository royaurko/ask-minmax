Herein, we present a canonical form for a natural and necessary
generalization of the Lambert W function, natural in that it requires minimal
mathematical definitions for this generalization, and necessary in that it
provides a means of expressing solutions to a number of physical problems of
fundamental nature. In particular, this generalization expresses the exact
solutions for general-relativistic self-gravitating 2-body and 3-body systems
in one spatial and one time dimension. It also expresses the solution to a
previously unknown mathematical link between the lineal gravity problem and the
Schroedinger equation.
