This paper addresses the online exact string matching problem which consists
in finding all occurrences of a given pattern p in a text t. It is an
extensively studied problem in computer science, mainly due to its direct
applications to such diverse areas as text, image and signal processing, speech
analysis and recognition, data compression, information retrieval,
computational biology and chemistry. Since 1970 more than 80 string matching
algorithms have been proposed, and more than 50% of them in the last ten years.
In this note we present a comprehensive list of all string matching algorithms
and present experimental results in order to compare them from a practical
point of view. From our experimental evaluation it turns out that the
performance of the algorithms are quite different for different alphabet sizes
and pattern length.
