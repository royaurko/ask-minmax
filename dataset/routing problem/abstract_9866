We investiage the (slightly) super-critical 2-D Euler equations. The paper
consists of two parts. In the first part we prove well-posedness in $C^s$
spaces for all $s>0.$ We also give growth estimates for the $C^s$ norms of the
vorticity for $0< s \leq 1.$ In the second part we prove global regularity for
the vortex patch problem in the super-critical regime.This paper extends the
results of Chae, Constantin, and Wu where they prove well-posedness for the
so-called LogLog-Euler equation. We also extend the classical results of Chemin
and Bertozzi-Constantin on the vortex patch problem to the slightly
supercritical case. The supercritical vortex patch problem introduces several
extra difficulties which are overcome via delicate estimates which take
advantage of the extra tangential regularity of the vortex patches. Both
problems we study are done in the setting of the whole space.
