We prove local well-posedness of the initial-boundary value problem for the
Korteweg-de Vries equation on the right half-line, left half-line, and line
segment, in the low regularity setting. This is accomplished by introducing an
analytic family of boundary forcing operators, extending the techniques of
Colliander-Kenig (2002).
