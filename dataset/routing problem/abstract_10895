We present results from a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) simulation of
galaxy formation that exceeds the minimum resolution requirement suggested by
Steinmetz & Muller (1993) of 3*10^4 SPH particles per galaxy. Using the
multiple mass technique an effective resolution of a little over one billion
particles is attained within a 48 Mpc cube. We find that even with an SPH mass
resolution of 1.5*10^6 solar masses and a plausible feedback algorithm, the
cooling catastrophe continues to be a problem for Einstein-de Sitter CDM
cosmologies. Increasing resolution also appears to exacerbate the core-halo
angular momentum transport problem.
