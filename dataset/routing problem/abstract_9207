We present a novel and comprehensive approach to the study of the parametric
Plateau problem for locally strictly convex (LSC) hypersurfaces of prescribed
curvature for general convex curvature functions inside general Riemannian
manifolds. We prove existence of solutions to the Plateau problem with outer
barrier for LSC hypersurfaces of constant or prescribed curvature for general
curvature functions inside general Hadamard manifolds modulo a single scalar
condition. In particular, convex curvature functions of bounded type are fully
treated.
