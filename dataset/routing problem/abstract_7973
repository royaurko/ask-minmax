An eigenvalue problem with a reference function and the corresponding
hierarchy of nonlinear evolution equations are proposed. The bi-Hamiltonian
structure of the hierarchy is established by using the trace identity. The
isospectral problem is nonlinearized as to be finite-dimensional completely
integrable systems in Liouville sense under Neumann and Bargmann constraints.
