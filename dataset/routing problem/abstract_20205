We study the nonlinear wave equation with a sign-changing potential in any
space dimension. If the potential is small and rapidly decaying, then the
existence of small-amplitude solutions is driven by the nonlinear term. If the
potential induces growth in the linearized problem, however, solutions that
start out small may blow-up in finite time.
