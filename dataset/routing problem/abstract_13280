In this paper we study the problem of automatically generating switching
controllers for the class of Linear Hybrid Automata, with respect to safety
objectives. We identify and solve inaccuracies contained in previous
characterizations of the problem, providing a sound and complete symbolic
fixpoint procedure, based on polyhedral abstractions of the state space. We
also prove the termination of each iteration of the procedure. Some promising
experimental results are presented, based on an implementation of the fixpoint
procedure on top of the tool PHAVer.
