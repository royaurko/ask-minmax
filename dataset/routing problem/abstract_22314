We give some general criteria of being a homeomorphism for continuous
mappings of topological manifolds, as well as criteria of being a
diffeomorphism for smooth mappings of smooth manifolds. As an illustration, we
apply these criteria to the problems arising in two- and three-dimensional grid
generation.
