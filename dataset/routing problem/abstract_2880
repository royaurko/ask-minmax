A type of adaptive finite element method for the eigenvalue problems is
proposed based on the multilevel correction scheme. In this method, adaptive
finite element method to solve eigenvalue problems involves solving associated
boundary value problems on the adaptive partitions and small scale eigenvalue
problems on the coarsest partitions. Hence the efficiency of solving eigenvalue
problems can be improved to be similar to the adaptive finite element method
for the associated boundary value problems. The convergence and optimal
complexity is theoretically verified and numerically demonstrated.
