We study finite groups of automorphisms of the $p$-adic open disk. In
particular, we generalize results of Green, Matignon and Henrio from cyclic
groups of order $p$ to arbitrary finite groups. As an application, we produce a
counterexample to a question of Chinburg, Guralnick and Harbater, concerning
the local lifting problem for generalized quaternion groups.
