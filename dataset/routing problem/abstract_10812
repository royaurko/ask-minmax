We consider the existence, uniqueness, and $L^1$-contractivity of weak
solutions to a fractional porous medium equation on an evolving hypersurface.
We reformulate the equation as a local problem on a semi-infinite cylinder,
regularise the porous medium nonlinearity and truncate the cylinder. Then we
pass to the limit first in the truncation parameter and then in the
nonlinearity. The identification of limits is done using the theory of
subdifferentials of convex functionals. In order to facilitate all of this, we
begin by studying (in the setting of closed Riemannian manifolds and Sobolev
spaces) the fractional Laplace--Beltrami operator which can be seen as the
Dirichlet-to-Neumann map of a harmonic extension problem. A truncated harmonic
extension problem will also be examined and convergence results of the solution
to the (untruncated) harmonic extension will be given (these results are used
in passing to the limit in the truncation described above). This theory is of
course independent of the fractional porous medium equation and will be of use
generally in the study of fractional elliptic and parabolic problems on
manifolds. We will also consider some related extension problems on evolving
hypersurfaces which will provide us with the language to formulate and solve
the fractional porous medium equation (amongst others) on evolving
hypersurfaces.
