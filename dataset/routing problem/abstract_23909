In this work, we present the analytic treatment of the large order Bessel
functions that arise in the Fourier Transform (FT) of the Gravitational Wave
(GW) signal from a pulsar. We outline several strategies which employ
asymptotic expansions in evaluation of such Bessel functions which also happen
to have large argument. Large order Bessel functions also arise in the
Peters-Mathews model of binary inspiralling stars emitting GW and several
problems in potential scattering theory. Other applications also arise in a
variety of problems in Applied Mathematics as well as in the Natural Sciences
and present a challenge for High Performance Computing(HPC).
