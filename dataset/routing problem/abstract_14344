A pedagogical approach of problem-based learning with embedded librarianship
in several undergraduate mathematics courses is implemented in this educational
research. The students are assigned to work on several projects on various
applications of mathematical topics in daily life and submit written reports.
An embedded librarian collaborates together with the instructor and the
students to improve the students' information literacy. Initial reaction and
anecdotal evidence show that the students' information literacy and academic
performance have improved throughout the semesters.
