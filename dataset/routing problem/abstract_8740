We analyze the convergence of degenerate approximations to Green's function
of elliptic boundary value problems with high-contrast coefficients. It is
shown that the convergence is independent of the contrast if the error is
measured with respect to suitable norms. This lays ground to fast methods
(so-called hierarchical matrix approximations) which do not have to be adapted
to the coefficients.
