In the present paper the linearized problem of half-space plasma oscillations
in external longitudinal alternating electric field is solved analytically.
Specular - accommodative boundary conditions of electron reflection from the
plasma boundary are considered. Coefficients of continuous and discrete spectra
of the problem are found, and electron distribution function on the plasma
boundary and electric field are expressed in explicit form.
