We study the existence of solutions of the Dirichlet problem {gather}
-\phi_p(u')' -a_+ \phi_p(u^+) + a_- \phi_p(u^-) -\lambda \phi_p(u) = f(x,u),
\quad x \in (0,1), \label{pb.eq} \tag{1} u(0)=u(1)=0,\label{pb_bc.eq} \tag{2}
{gather} where $p>1$, $\phi_p(s):=|s|^{p-1}\sgn s$ for $s \in \mathbb{R}$, the
coefficients $a_\pm \in C^0[0,1]$, $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, and $u^\pm :=
\max\{\pm u,0\}$. We suppose that $f\in C^1([0,1]\times\mathbb{R})$ and that
there exists $f_\pm \in C^0[0,1]$ such that $\lim_{\xi\to\pm\infty} f(x,\xi) =
f_\pm(x)$, for all $x \in [0,1]$. With these conditions the problem
\eqref{pb.eq}-\eqref{pb_bc.eq} is said to have a `jumping nonlinearity'. We
also suppose that the problem {gather} -\phi_p(u')' = a_+ \phi_p(u^+) - a_-
\phi_p(u^-) + \lambda \phi_p(u) \quad\text{on} \ (0,1), \tag{3}
\label{heval_pb.eq} {gather} together with \eqref{pb_bc.eq}, has a non-trivial
solution $u$. That is, $\lambda$ is a `half-eigenvalue' of
\eqref{pb_bc.eq}-\eqref{heval_pb.eq}, and the problem
\eqref{pb.eq}-\eqref{pb_bc.eq} is said to be `resonant'. Combining a shooting
method with so called `Landesman-Lazer' conditions, we show that the problem
\eqref{pb.eq}-\eqref{pb_bc.eq} has a solution.
  Most previous existence results for jumping nonlinearity problems at
resonance have considered the case where the coefficients $a_\pm$ are
constants, and the resonance has been at a point in the `Fucik spectrum'. Even
in this constant coefficient case our result extends previous results. In
particular, previous variational approaches have required strong conditions on
the location of the resonant point, whereas our result applies to any point in
the Fucik spectrum.
