This paper presents the results of studies in elaboration of a mathematical
model of the cavity-chain slow wave structures. Considered is the problem of
coupling of an infinitely long cylindrical cavity chain coupled through
centerholes in the dividing walls of finite thickness without the assumption
about smallness of any parameters. On the basis of a rigorous electrodynamic
approach it is shown that the cavity chain can be described by a set of
equations that describe the coupling of an infinite number of similar-type
modes of short-circuit cavities. At the same time the coupling coefficients are
determined by solving the basic sets of linear algebraic equations which
describe the coupling the tangential electric fields on the right and left
cylindrical hole cross-sections of the disks. The results are given of
numerical simulations of the dependence of electrodynamic characteristics on
the number of connections between the modes taken into account. Based on these
calculations for different cavity dimensions, the number of coupling
connections that give the sufficient accuracy of the description was
determined.
