We study linear elasticity problems with high contrast in the coefficients
using asymptotic limits recently introduced. We derive an asymptotic expansion
to solve heterogeneous elasticity problems in terms of the contrast in the
coefficients. We study the convergence of the expansion in the $H^1$ norm.
