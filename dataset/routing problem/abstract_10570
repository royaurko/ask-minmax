In the contexts of automated reasoning and formal verification, important
decision problems are effectively encoded into Satisfiability Modulo Theories
(SMT). In the last decade efficient SMT solvers have been developed for several
theories of practical interest (e.g., linear arithmetic, arrays, bit-vectors).
Surprisingly, very few work has been done to extend SMT to deal with
optimization problems; in particular, we are not aware of any work on SMT
solvers able to produce solutions which minimize cost functions over
arithmetical variables. This is unfortunate, since some problems of interest
require this functionality.
  In this paper we start filling this gap. We present and discuss two general
procedures for leveraging SMT to handle the minimization of LA(Q) cost
functions, combining SMT with standard minimization techniques. We have
implemented the proposed approach within the MathSAT SMT solver. Due to the
lack of competitors in AR and SMT domains, we experimentally evaluated our
implementation against state-of-the-art tools for the domain of linear
generalized disjunctive programming (LGDP), which is closest in spirit to our
domain, on sets of problems which have been previously proposed as benchmarks
for the latter tools. The results show that our tool is very competitive with,
and often outperforms, these tools on these problems, clearly demonstrating the
potential of the approach.
