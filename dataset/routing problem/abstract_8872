We resolve problems posed by Kesten and Erd\"os-Sz\"usz-Tur\'an on
probabilistic Diophantine approximation via methods of homogeneous dynamics.
Our methods allows us to generalize the problem to the setting of general
measure-valued processes in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and obtain applications to the
distribution of point sets which occur in higher dimensional Diophantine
approximation and the geometry of translation surfaces.
