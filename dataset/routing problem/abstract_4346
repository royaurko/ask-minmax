The engineering and design of self-organizing systems with emergent
properties is a long-standing problem in the field of complex and distributed
systems, for example in the engineering of self-organizing Multi-Agent Systems.
The problem of combining engineering with emergence - to find a simple rule for
a complex pattern - equals the problem of science in general. Therefore the
answers are similar, and the scientific method is the general solution to the
problem of engineering complex systems.
