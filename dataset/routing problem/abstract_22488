The current status of extragalactic deuterium abundance is discussed using
two examples of `low' and `high' D/H measurements. We show that the discordance
of these two types of D abundances may be a consequence of the spatial
correlations in the stochastic velocity field. Within the framework of the
generalized procedure (accounting for such effects) one finds good agreement
between different observations and the theoretical predictions for standard big
bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN). In particular, we show that the deuterium
absorption seen at z = 2.504 toward Q1009+2956 and the H+D Ly-alpha profile
observed at z = 0.701 toward Q1718+4807 are compatible with D/H $\sim 4.1 -
4.6\times10^{-5}$. This result supports SBBN and, thus, no inhomogeneity is
needed. The problem of precise D/H measurements is discussed.
