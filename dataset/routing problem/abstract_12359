We revisit the classic problem of the structure of the isotropic-nematic
interface within Ginzburg-Landau-de Gennes theory, refining previous analytic
treatments of biaxiality at the interface. We compare our analysis with
numerical results obtained through a highly accurate spectral collocation
scheme for the solution of the Landau-Ginzburg-de Gennes equations. In
comparison to earlier work, we obtain improved agreement with numerics for both
the uniaxial and biaxial profiles, accurate asymptotic results for the decay of
biaxial order on both nematic and isotropic sides of the interface and accurate
fits to data from density functional approaches to this problem.
