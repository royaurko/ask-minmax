The dynamics of iterates at the transition to chaos in one-dimensional
unimodal maps is shown to exhibit the characteristic elements of the glass
transition, e.g. two-step relaxation and aging. The properties of the
bifurcation gap induced by external noise, including a relationship between
relaxation time and entropy, are seen to be comparable to those of a
supercooled liquid above a glass transition temperature. Universal time
evolution obtained from the Feigenbaum RG transformation is expressed
analytically via $q$-exponentials, and interpreted in terms of nonextensive
statistics.
