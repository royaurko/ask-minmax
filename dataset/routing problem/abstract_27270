We develop a theory of complexity for numerical computations that takes into
account the condition of the input data and allows for roundoff in the
computations. We follow the lines of the theory developed by Blum, Shub, and
Smale for computations over R (which in turn followed those of the classical,
discrete, complexity theory as laid down by Cook, Karp, and Levin among
others). In particular, we focus on complexity classes of decision problems and
paramount among them, on appropriate versions of the classes P, NP and EXP of
polynomial, nondeterministic polynomial, and exponential time, respectively. We
prove some basic relationships between these complexity classes and exhibit
natural NP-complete problems.
