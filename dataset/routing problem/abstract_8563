This article is devoted to the regular fractional Sturm--Liouville eigenvalue
problem. Applying methods of fractional variational analysis we prove existence
of countable set of orthogonal solutions and corresponding eigenvalues.
Moreover, we formulate two results showing that the lowest eigenvalue is the
minimum value for a certain variational functional.
