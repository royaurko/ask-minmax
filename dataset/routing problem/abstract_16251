The SUSY flavour problem is deeply related to the origin of flavour and hence
to the origin of the SM Yukawa couplings themselves. Since all CP-violation in
the SM is restricted to the flavour sector, it is possible that the SUSY CP
problem is related to the origin of flavour as well. In this work, we present
three variations of an SU(3) flavour model with spontaneous CP violation. Such
models explain the hierarchy in the fermion masses and mixings, and predict the
structure of the flavoured soft SUSY breaking terms. In such a situation, both
SUSY flavour and CP problems do not exist. We use electric dipole moments and
lepton flavour violation processes to distinguish between these models, and
place constraints on the SUSY parameter space.
