Belief Propagation (BP) is a popular, distributed heuristic for performing
MAP computations in Graphical Models. BP can be interpreted, from a variational
perspective, as minimizing the Bethe Free Energy (BFE). BP can also be used to
solve a special class of Linear Programming (LP) problems. For this class of
problems, MAP inference can be stated as an integer LP with an LP relaxation
that coincides with minimization of the BFE at ``zero temperature". We
generalize these prior results and establish a tight characterization of the LP
problems that can be formulated as an equivalent LP relaxation of MAP
inference. Moreover, we suggest an efficient, iterative annealing BP algorithm
for solving this broader class of LP problems. We demonstrate the algorithm's
performance on a set of weighted matching problems by using it as a cutting
plane method to solve a sequence of LPs tightened by adding ``blossom''
inequalities.
