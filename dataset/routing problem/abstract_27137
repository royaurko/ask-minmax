The object of this work is to design an adequate regularization for the
problem of recovering missing Fourier coefficients, particularly in some non
standard situations were low frequency coefficients are lost. In the framework
of non-local regularization, we propose a technique to build an original
patchwise similarity measure that is adapted to the missing spectrum. Then, a
simple Non-Local quadratic energy is minimized. By construction, the similarity
criterion is invariant under the corruption process so that the distance
between two patches of the corrupted image is almost exactly equal to the one
computed on the clean image. We illustrate our method with experiments which
show its efficiency, both in terms of speed and quality of the results, with
respect to other common approaches. We show that the method is practical on
synthetic examples which are built upon models of inverse scattering problems,
synthetic aperture mirrors for spatial imaging or also medical imaging.
