We construct a finite element method (FEM) for the infinity Laplacian.
Solutions of this problem may be singular, which has prompted us to conduct an
a posteriori analysis of the method deriving residual based estimators to drive
an adaptive algorithm. It is numerically shown that the optimal convergence
rates are regained upon using the adaptive procedure.
