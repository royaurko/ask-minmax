Absorbing boundary condition approach to nuclear breakup reactions is
investigated. A key ingredient of the method is an absorbing potential outside
the physical area, which simulates the outgoing boundary condition for
scattered waves. After discretizing the radial variables, the problem results
in a linear algebraic equation with a sparse coefficient matrix, to which
efficient iterative methods can be applicable. No virtual state such as
discretized continuum channel needs to be introduced in the method. Basic
aspects of the method are discussed by considering a nuclear two-body
scattering problem described with an optical potential. We then apply the
method to the breakup reactions of deuterons described in a three-body direct
reaction model. Results employing the absorbing boundary condition are found to
accurately coincide with those of the existing method which utilizes
discretized continuum channels.
