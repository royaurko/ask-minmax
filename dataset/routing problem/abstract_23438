The same, well known, det(Sigma)+ h.c. term in effective theories, which 't
Hooft showed is generated by instantons in QCD and which resolves the UA(1)
problem giving mass, in particular to the $\eta'$ is for three light flavors
shown to give three classical minima along the UA(1) circle. The three minima
are related to the Z(3) center of SU(3). The term also contributes, in a
similar way as the diquark model of Jaffe, to an inverted scalar mass spectrum
for the light scalars. The three vacua suggests a connection to the strong CP
problem and confinement.
