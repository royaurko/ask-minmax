In the Block Graph Deletion problem, we are given a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices
and a positive integer $k$, and the objective is to check whether it is
possible to delete at most $k$ vertices from $G$ to make it a block graph,
i.e., a graph in which each block is a clique. In this paper, we obtain a
kernel with $\mathcal{O}(k^{9})$ vertices for the Block Graph Deletion problem.
This is a first step to investigate polynomial kernels for deletion problems
into non-trivial classes of graphs of bounded rank-width, but unbounded
tree-width. Our result also implies that Chordal Vertex Deletion admits a
polynomial-size kernel on diamond-free graphs. For the kernelization and its
analysis, we introduce the notion of `complete degree' of a vertex and also use
the Sauer-Shelah Lemma [J. of Comb. Theory, Ser. A, 13:145--147, 1972]. We
believe that these are of independent interest and the underlying ideas can be
potentially applied to other problems. We also prove that the Block Graph
Deletion problem can be solved in time $10^{k}\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$.
