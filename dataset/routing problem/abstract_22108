We discuss the problem of existence of rational curves on a certain del Pezzo
surface from a computational point of view and suggest a computer algorithm
implementing search. In particular, our computations reveal that the surface
contains 920 rational curves with parametrizations of degree 8 and does not
contain rational curves for a smaller degree.
