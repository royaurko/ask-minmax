Solar neutrinos are discussed in the light of the new data and of recent
progress in helioseismology. Most attention is given to the new status of
Standard Solar Models due to seismically measured density and sound speed in
the inner solar core. The elementary particle solutions to the Solar Neutrino
Problem and their observational signatures are discussed.
