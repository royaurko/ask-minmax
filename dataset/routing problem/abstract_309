We investigate the symmetry properties of a pair of Ermakov equations. The
system is superintegrable and yet possesses only three Lie point symmetries
with the algebra sl(2,R). The number of point symmetries is insufficient and
the algebra unsuitable for the complete specification of the system. We use the
method of reduction of order to reduce the nonlinear fourth-order system to a
third-order system comprising a linear second-order equation and a conservation
law. We obtain the representation of the complete symmetry group from this
system. Four of the required symmetries are nonlocal and the algebra is the
direct sum of a one-dimensional Abelian algebra with the semidirect sum of a
two-dimensional solvable algebra with a two-dimensional Abelian algebra. The
problem illustrates the difficulties which can arise in very elementary
systems. Our treatment demonstrates the existence of possible routes to
overcome these problems in a systematic fashion.
