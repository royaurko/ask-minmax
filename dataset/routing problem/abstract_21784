We prove that the existence of a solution to a fully nonlinear elliptic
equation in a bounded domain $\Omega$ with an overdetermined boundary condition
prescribing both Dirichlet and Neumann constant data forces the domain $\Omega$
to be a ball. This is a generalization of Serrin's classical result from 1971.
