The coupled system, where one is a degenerate parabolic equation and the
other has not a diffusion term arises in the modeling of European options with
liquidity shocks. Two implicit-explicit (IMEX) schemes that preserve the
positivity of the differential problem solution are constructed and analyzed.
Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and illustrate the high
accuracy and efficiency of the schemes in combination with Richardson
extrapolation
