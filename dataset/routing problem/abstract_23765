We study several constrained variational problem in the 2-Wasserstein metric
for which the set of probability densities satisfying the constraint is not
closed. For example, given a probability density $F_0$ on $\R^d$ and a
time-step $h>0$, we seek to minimize $I(F) = hS(F) + W_2^2(F_0,F)$ over all of
the probability densities $F$ that have the same mean and variance as $F_0$,
where $S(F)$ is the entropy of $F$. We prove existence of minimizers. We also
analyze the induced geometry of the set of densities satisfying the constraint
on the variance and means, and we determine all of the geodesics on it. From
this, we determine a criterion for convexity of functionals in the induced
geometry. It turns out, for example, that the entropy is uniformly strictly
convex on the constrained manifold, though not uniformly convex without the
constraint. The problems solved here arose in a study of a variational approach
to constructing and studying solutions of the nonlinear kinetic Fokker-Planck
equation, which is briefly described here and fully developed in a companion
paper.
