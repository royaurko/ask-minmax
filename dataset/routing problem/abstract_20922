We propose to address the problem of how to know students' knowledge in an
entirely new approach called ?epistemography? which is, roughly, an attempt to
describe the structure of this knowledge. We claim that what is to be known is
made of five tightly interrelated organised systems: the mathematical universe,
the system of semio-linguistic representations, the instruments, the rules of
the mathematical game, and the identifiers.
