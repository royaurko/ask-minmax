In this paper, we derive a boundary and an internal observability inequality
for stochastic hyperbolic equations with nonsmooth lower order terms. The
required inequalities are obtained by global Carleman estimate for stochastic
hyperbolic equations. By these inequalities, we study a state observation
problem for stochastic hyperbolic equations. As a consequence, we also
establish a unique continuation property for stochastic hyperbolic equations.
