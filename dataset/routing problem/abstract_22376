We show that the effective factorization of Ore polynomials over
$\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ is still an open problem. This is so because the known
algorithm in [1] presents two gaps, and therefore it does not cover all the
examples. We amend one of the gaps, and we discuss what kind of partial
factorizations can be then computed by using [1].
