A new description of the binary fluid problem via the lattice Boltzmann
method is presented which highlights the use of the moments in constructing two
equilibrium distribution functions. This offers a number of benefits, including
better isotropy, and a more natural route to the inclusion of multiple
relaxation times for the binary fluid problem. In addition, the implementation
of solid colloidal particles suspended in the binary mixture is addressed,
which extends the solid-fluid boundary conditions for mass and momentum to
include a single conserved compositional order parameter. A number of simple
benchmark problems involving a single particle at or near a fluid-fluid
interface are undertaken and show good agreement with available theoretical or
numerical results.
