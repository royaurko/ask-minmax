Nuclear formation cross sections are reported for 26 radionuclides, measured
with 40 to 200 MeV proton irradiations of terbium foils. These data are
relevant to the production of medically relevant radionuclides (e.g., 152Tb,
155Tb, 155Eu, and 156Eu) and to ongoing efforts to characterize stellar
nucleosynthesis routes passing through long-lived intermediaries (e.g., 153Gd).
Computational predictions from the ALICE2011, CEM03.03, Bertini, and INCL+ABLA
codes are compared with newly measured data to contribute to the ongoing
process of code development, and yields are calculated for selected
radionuclides using measured data.
