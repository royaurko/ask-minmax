We propose a unifying framework based on configuration linear programs and
randomized rounding, for different energy optimization problems in the dynamic
speed-scaling setting. We apply our framework to various scheduling and routing
problems in heterogeneous computing and networking environments. We first
consider the energy minimization problem of scheduling a set of jobs on a set
of parallel speed scalable processors in a fully heterogeneous setting. For
both the preemptive-non-migratory and the preemptive-migratory variants, our
approach allows us to obtain solutions of almost the same quality as for the
homogeneous environment. By exploiting the result for the
preemptive-non-migratory variant, we are able to improve the best known
approximation ratio for the single processor non-preemptive problem.
Furthermore, we show that our approach allows to obtain a constant-factor
approximation algorithm for the power-aware preemptive job shop scheduling
problem. Finally, we consider the min-power routing problem where we are given
a network modeled by an undirected graph and a set of uniform demands that have
to be routed on integral routes from their sources to their destinations so
that the energy consumption is minimized. We improve the best known
approximation ratio for this problem.
