Soft Constraint Logic Programming is a natural and flexible declarative
programming formalism, which allows to model and solve real-life problems
involving constraints of different types.
  In this paper, after providing a slightly more general and elegant
presentation of the framework, we show how we can apply it to the e-mobility
problem of coordinating electric vehicles in order to overcome both energetic
and temporal constraints and so to reduce their running cost. In particular, we
focus on the journey optimization sub-problem, considering sequences of trips
from a user's appointment to another one. Solutions provide the best
alternatives in terms of time and energy consumption, including route sequences
and possible charging events.
