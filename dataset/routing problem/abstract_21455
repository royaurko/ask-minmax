In this note, a brief review of the consistent state approach to systems
containing closed timelike curves or similar devices is given, and applied to
the well known thermodynamic problem of Maxwell's demon. The 'third party
paradox' for acausal systems is defined and applied to CTC censorship and black
hole evaporation. Some traditional arguments for chronology protection are
re-examined.
