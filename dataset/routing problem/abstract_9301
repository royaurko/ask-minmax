A brief description of the novel approach towards solving few-body scattering
problems in a finite-dimensional functional space of the $L_2$-type is
presented. The method is based on the complete few-body continuum
discretization in the basis of stationary wave packets. This basis, being
transformed to the momentum representation, leads to the cell-lattice-like
discretization of the momentum space. So the initial scattering problem can be
formulated on the multi-dimensional momentum lattice which makes it possible to
reduce the solution of any scattering problem above the breakup threshold
(where the integral kernels include, in general, some complicated moving
singularities) to convenient simple matrix equations which can be solved on the
real energy axis. The phase shifts and inelasticity parameters for the
three-body $nd$ elastic scattering with MT I-III $NN$ potential both below and
above the three-body breakup threshold calculated with the proposed wave-packet
technique are in a very good agreement with the previous accurate benchmark
calculation results.
