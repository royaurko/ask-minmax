The aim of this work is to model the nodes battery discharge in wireless ad
hoc networks. Many work focus on the energy consumption in such networks. Even,
the research in the highest layers of the ISO model, takes into account the
energy consumption and efficiency. Indeed, the nodes that form such network are
mobiles, so no instant recharge of battery. Also with special type of ad hoc
networks are wireless sensors networks using non-rechargeable batteries. All
nodes with an exhausted battery are considered death and left the network. To
consider the energy consumption, in this work we model using a Markov chain,
the discharge of the battery considering of instant activation and deactivation
distribution function of these nodes.
