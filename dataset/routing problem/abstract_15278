We study the asymptotics of singular values and singular functions of a
Finite Hilbert transform (FHT), which is defined on several intervals.
Transforms of this kind arise in the study of the interior problem of
tomography. We suggest a novel approach based on the technique of the matrix
Riemann-Hilbert problem and the steepest descent method of Deift-Zhou. We
obtain a family of matrix RHPs depending on the spectral parameter $\lambda$
and show that the singular values of the FHT coincide with the values of
$\lambda$ for which the RHP is not solvable. Expressing the leading order
solution as $\lambda\to 0$ of the RHP in terms of the Riemann Theta functions,
we prove that the asymptotics of the singular values can be obtained by
studying the intersections of the locus of zeroes of a certain Theta function
with a straight line. This line can be calculated explicitly, and it depends on
the geometry of the intervals that define the FHT. The leading order
asymptotics of the singular functions and singular values are explicitly
expressed in terms of the Riemann Theta functions and of the period matrix of
the corresponding normalized differentials, respectively. We also obtain the
error estimates for our asymptotic results.
