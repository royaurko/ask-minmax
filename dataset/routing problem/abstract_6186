The form of the initial value constraints in Ashtekar's hamiltonian
formulation of general relativity is recalled, and the problem of solving them
is compared with that in the traditional metric variables. It is shown how the
general solution of the four diffeomorphism constraints can be obtained
algebraically provided the curvature is non-degenerate, and the form of the
remaining (Gauss law) constraints is discussed. The method is extended to cover
the case when matter is included, using an approach due to Thiemann. The
application of the method to vacuum Bianchi models is given. The paper
concludes with a brief discussion of alternative approaches to the initial
value problem in the Ashtekar formulation.
