Tensile stress-strain behavior of Ni57.5Mn22.5Ga20.0 single crystal
exhibiting a high-temperature 2M-martensitic phase stable up to 360\degree C
has been studied in the course of thermal and mechanical cycling. The
ultra-large reversible strains, about 9%, caused by the shape memory and
superelasticity effects, have been observed up to 400 \degree C being the
instrumental temperature limit. Abnormally large two-way shape memory effect
with 9% of strain magnitude has been found. The cycling procedure and the
variation of thermal/mechanical routs of the training of samples revealed the
destabilization (rejuvenation) of martensite. This physical effect is opposite
to the well-known phenomenon of martensite stabilization. A destabilization
effect is explained phenomenologically in terms of internal stressing of the
alloy sample by the crystal defects.
