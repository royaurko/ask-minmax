This paper describes the work done on Matrix Browser, which is a recently
developed graphical user interface to explore and navigate complex networked
information spaces. This approach presents a new way of navigating information
nets in windows explorer like widget. The problem on hand was how to export
arbitrary knowledge bases in Matrix Browser. This was achieved by identifying
the relationships present in knowledge bases and then by forming the
hierarchies from this data and these hierarchies are being exported to matrix
browser. This paper gives solution to this problem and informs about
implementation work.
