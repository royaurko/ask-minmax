This paper presents several classes of fusion problems which cannot be
directly attacked by the classical mathematical theory of evidence, also known
as the Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) either because the Shafer's model for the
frame of discernment is impossible to obtain or just because the Dempster's
rule of combination fails to provide coherent results (or no result at all). We
present and discuss the potentiality of the DSmT combined with its classical
(or hybrid) rule of combination to attack these infinite classes of fusion
problems.
