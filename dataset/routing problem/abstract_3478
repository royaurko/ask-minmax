In this survey we show how well known results about the Word Problem for
finite group presentations can be generalized to the Word Problem and other
decision problems for non-necessarily finite monoid and group presentations.
This is done by introducing functions playing the same role of the Dehn
function for the given decision problem and by finding the Tietze
transformations that leave this function invariant. This survey presents some
original ideas and points of view.
