In probabilistic game structures, probabilistic alternating simulation
(PA-simulation) relations preserve formulas defined in probabilistic
alternating-time temporal logic with respect to the behaviour of a subset of
players. We propose a partition based algorithm for computing the largest
PA-simulation, which is to our knowledge the first such algorithm that works in
polynomial time, by extending the generalised coarsest partition problem (GCPP)
in a game-based setting with mixed strategies. The algorithm has higher
complexities than those in the literature for non-probabilistic simulation and
probabilistic simulation without mixed actions, but slightly improves the
existing result for computing probabilistic simulation with respect to mixed
actions.
