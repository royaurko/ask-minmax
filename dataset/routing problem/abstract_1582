The hybrid hiding encryption algorithm, as its name implies, embraces
concepts from both steganography and cryptography. In this exertion, an
improved micro-architecture Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation
of this algorithm is presented. This design overcomes the observed limitations
of a previously-designed micro-architecture. These observed limitations are: no
exploitation of the possibility of parallel bit replacement, and the fact that
the input plaintext was encrypted serially, which caused a dependency between
the throughput and the nature of the used secret key. This dependency can be
viewed by some as vulnerability in the security of the implemented
micro-architecture. The proposed modified micro-architecture is constructed
using five basic modules. These modules are; the message cache, the message
alignment module, the key cache, the comparator, and at last the encryption
module. In this work, we provide comprehensive simulation and implementation
results. These are: the timing diagrams, the post-implementation timing and
routing reports, and finally the floor plan. Moreover, a detailed comparison
with other FPGA implementations is made available and discussed.
