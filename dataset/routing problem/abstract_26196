In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating finite rate of
innovation (FRI) signals from noisy measurements, and specifically analyze the
interaction between FRI techniques and the underlying sampling methods. We
first obtain a fundamental limit on the estimation accuracy attainable
regardless of the sampling method. Next, we provide a bound on the performance
achievable using any specific sampling approach. Essential differences between
the noisy and noise-free cases arise from this analysis. In particular, we
identify settings in which noise-free recovery techniques deteriorate
substantially under slight noise levels, thus quantifying the numerical
instability inherent in such methods. This instability, which is only present
in some families of FRI signals, is shown to be related to a specific type of
structure, which can be characterized by viewing the signal model as a union of
subspaces. Finally, we develop a methodology for choosing the optimal sampling
kernels based on a generalization of the Karhunen--Lo\`eve transform. The
results are illustrated for several types of time-delay estimation problems.
