A recent study characterizing failures in computer networks shows that
transient single element (node/link) failures are the dominant failures in
large communication networks like the Internet. Thus, having the routing paths
globally recomputed on a failure does not pay off since the failed element
recovers fairly quickly, and the recomputed routing paths need to be discarded.
In this paper, we present the first distributed algorithm that computes the
alternate paths required by some "proactive recovery schemes" for handling
transient failures. Our algorithm computes paths that avoid a failed node, and
provides an alternate path to a particular destination from an upstream
neighbor of the failed node. With minor modifications, we can have the
algorithm compute alternate paths that avoid a failed link as well. To the best
of our knowledge all previous algorithms proposed for computing alternate paths
are centralized, and need complete information of the network graph as input to
the algorithm.
