Much artificial intelligence research focuses on the problem of deducing the
validity of unobservable propositions or hypotheses from observable evidence.!
Many of the knowledge representation techniques designed for this problem
encode the relationship between evidence and hypothesis in a directed manner.
Moreover, the direction in which evidence is stored is typically from evidence
to hypothesis.
