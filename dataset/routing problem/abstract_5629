Let $H: V(G) \rightarrow 2^{\mathbb{N}}$ be a set mapping for a graph $G$.
Given a spanning subgraph $F$ of $G$, $F$ is called a {\it general factor} or
an $H$-{\it factor} of $G$ if $d_{F}(x)\in H(x)$ for every vertex $x\in V(G)$.
$H$-factor problems are, in general, $NP$-complete problems and imply many
well-known factor problems (e.g., perfect matchings, $f$-factor problems and
$(g, f)$-factor problems) as special cases. Lov\'asz [The factorization of
graphs (II),
  Acta Math. Hungar., 23 (1972), 223--246] gave a structure description and
obtained a deficiency formula for $H$-optimal subgraphs. In this note, we use a
generalized alternating path method to give a structural characterization and
provide an alternative and shorter proof of Lov\'asz's deficiency formula.
