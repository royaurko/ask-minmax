This paper is about a model reduction framework for parameterized eigenvalue
problems by a reduced basis method. In contrast to the standard single output
case, one is interested in approximating several outputs simultaneously, namely
a cer- tain number of the smallest eigenvalues. For a fast and reliable
evaluation of these input-output relations, we analyze a posteriori error
estimators for eigenvalues. Moreover, we present different greedy strategies
and study systematically their performance. Special attention needs to be paid
to multiple eigenvalues whose appearance is parameter-dependent. Our methods
are of particular interest for ap- plications in vibro-acoustics.
