One can formulate the classical Kepler problem on the Heisenberg group, the
simplest sub-Riemannian manifold. We take the sub-Riemannian Hamiltonian as our
kinetic energy, and our potential is the fundamental solution to the Heisenberg
sub-Laplacian. The resulting dynamical system is known to contain a fundamental
integrable subsystem. Here we use variational methods to prove that the
Kepler-Heisenberg system admits periodic orbits with $k$-fold rotational
symmetry for any odd integer $k\geq 3$. Approximations are shown for $k=3$.
