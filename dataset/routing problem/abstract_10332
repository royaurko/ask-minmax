We consider the discretization of parabolic initial boundary value problems
by finite element methods in space and a Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme.
Order optimal a-priori error estimates are derived in an energy-norm under
natural smoothness assumptions on the solution and without artificial
regularity conditions on the parameters and the domain. The key steps in our
analysis are the careful treatment of time derivatives in the H(-1)-norm and
the the use of an L2-projection in the error splitting instead of the Ritz
projector. This allows us to restore the optimality of the estimates with
respect to smoothness assumptions on the solution and to avoid artificial
regularity requirements for the problem, usually needed for the analysis of the
Ritz projector, which limit the applicability of previous work. The wider
applicability of our results is illustrated for two irregular problems, for
which previous results can either not by applied or yield highly sub-optimal
estimates.
