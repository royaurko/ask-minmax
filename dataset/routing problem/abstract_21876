We study Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equations in an infinite dimensional Hilbert
space, with Lipschitz coefficients, where the Hamiltonian has superquadratic
growth with respect to the derivative of the value function, and the final
condition is not bounded. This allows to study stochastic optimal control
problems for suitable controlled state equations with unbounded control
processes. The results are applied to a controlled wave equation.
