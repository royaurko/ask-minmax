A large deviation analysis of the solving complexity of random
3-Satisfiability instances slightly below threshold is presented. While finding
a solution for such instances demands an exponential effort with high
probability, we show that an exponentially small fraction of resolutions
require a computation scaling linearly in the size of the instance only. This
exponentially small probability of easy resolutions is analytically calculated,
and the corresponding exponent shown to be smaller (in absolute value) than the
growth exponent of the typical resolution time. Our study therefore gives some
theoretical basis to heuristic stop-and-restart solving procedures, and
suggests a natural cut-off (the size of the instance) for the restart.
