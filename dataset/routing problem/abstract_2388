Bilevel optimization problems are a class of challenging optimization
problems, which contain two levels of optimization tasks. In these problems,
the optimal solutions to the lower level problem become possible feasible
candidates to the upper level problem. Such a requirement makes the
optimization problem difficult to solve, and has kept the researchers busy
towards devising methodologies, which can efficiently handle the problem.
Despite the efforts, there hardly exists any effective methodology, which is
capable of handling a complex bilevel problem. In this paper, we introduce
bilevel evolutionary algorithm based on quadratic approximations (BLEAQ) of
optimal lower level variables with respect to the upper level variables. The
approach is capable of handling bilevel problems with different kinds of
complexities in relatively smaller number of function evaluations. Ideas from
classical optimization have been hybridized with evolutionary methods to
generate an efficient optimization algorithm for generic bilevel problems. The
efficacy of the algorithm has been shown on two sets of test problems. The
first set is a recently proposed SMD test set, which contains problems with
controllable complexities, and the second set contains standard test problems
collected from the literature. The proposed method has been evaluated against
two benchmarks, and the performance gain is observed to be significant.
