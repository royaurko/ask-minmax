Ambiguity or uncertainty is a pervasive element of many real world decision
making processes. Variation in decisions is a norm in this situation when the
same problem is posed to different subjects. Psychological and metaphysical
research had proven that decision making by human is subjective. It is
influenced by many factors such as experience, age, background, etc. Scene
understanding is one of the computer vision problems that fall into this
category. Conventional methods relax this problem by assuming scene images are
mutually exclusive; and therefore, focus on developing different approaches to
perform the binary classification tasks. In this paper, we show that scene
images are non-mutually exclusive, and propose the Fuzzy Qualitative Rank
Classifier (FQRC) to tackle the aforementioned problems. The proposed FQRC
provides a ranking interpretation instead of binary decision. Evaluations in
term of qualitative and quantitative using large numbers and challenging public
scene datasets have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method in modeling
the non-mutually exclusive scene images.
