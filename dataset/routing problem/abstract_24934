We construct three flipped SU(5) X U(1)_X models from F-theory, and consider
two such models from free fermionic string model building. To achieve the
decoupling scenario in F-theory models and the string-scale gauge coupling
unification in free fermionic models, we introduce vector-like particles at the
TeV scale that can be observed at the Large Hadron Collider. We study gauge
coupling unification, and find that proton decay is within the reach of the
future Hyper-Kamiokande experiment. In these models, the doublet-triplet
splitting problem and monopole problem can be solved, the neutrino masses and
mixings can be explained via the double seesaw or seesaw mechanism, the
observed baryon asymmetry can be obtained through leptogenesis, the hybrid
inflation can be realized, and the correct cosmic primodial density
fluctuations can be generated.
