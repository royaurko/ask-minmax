A class of (1+1)--dimensional nonlinear boundary value problems (BVPs),
modeling the process of melting and evaporation of solid materials, is studied
by means of the classical Lie symmetry method. New definition of invariance in
Lie's sense for BVP is presented and applied for the class of BVPs in question.
