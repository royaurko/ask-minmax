In a preceding article, we have studied a generalization of the problem of
finding a martingale on a manifold whose terminal value is known. This article
completes the results obtained in the first article by providing uniqueness and
existence theorems in a general framework (in particular if positive curvatures
are allowed), still using differential geometry tools.
