Divide and Conquer is a well known algorithmic procedure for solving many
kinds of problem. In this procedure, the problem is partitioned into two parts
until the problem is trivially solvable. Finding the distance of the closest
pair is an interesting topic in computer science. With divide and conquer
algorithm we can solve closest pair problem. Here also the problem is
partitioned into two parts until the problem is trivially solvable. But it is
theoretically and practically observed that sometimes partitioning the problem
space into more than two parts can give better performances. In this paper, a
new proposal is given that dividing the problem space into (n) number of parts
can give better result while divide and conquer algorithm is used for solving
the closest pair of point's problem.
