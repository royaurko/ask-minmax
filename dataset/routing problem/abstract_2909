In this paper two related simplification problems for systems of linear
inequalities describing precedence relation systems are considered. Given a
precedence relation system, the first problem seeks a minimum subset of the
precedence relations (i.e., inequalities) which has the same solution set as
that of the original system. The second problem is the same as the first one
except that the ``subset restriction'' in the first problem is removed. This
paper establishes that the first problem is NP-hard. However, a sufficient
condition is provided under which the first problem is solvable in
polynomial-time. In addition, a decomposition of the first problem into
independent tractable and intractable subproblems is derived. The second
problem is shown to be solvable in polynomial-time, with a full
parameterization of all solutions described. The results in this paper
generalize those in [Moyles and Thompson 1969, Aho, Garey, and Ullman 1972] for
the minimum equivalent graph problem and transitive reduction problem, which
are applicable to unweighted directed graphs.
