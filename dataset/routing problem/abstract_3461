A flaw in the greedy approximation algorithm proposed by Zhang et al. for
minimum connected set cover problem is corrected, and a stronger result on the
approximation ratio of the modified greedy algorithm is established. The
results are now consistent with the existing results on connected dominating
set problem which is a special case of the minimum connected set cover problem.
