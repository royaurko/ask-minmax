The so-called negative mode problem in the path integral approach to the
false vacuum decay with the effect of gravity has been an unsolved problem.
Several years ago, we proposed a conjecture which is to be proved in order to
give a consistent solution to the negative mode problem. We called it the
``no-negative mode conjecture''. In the present paper, we give a proof of this
conjecture for rather general models. Recently, we also proposed the
``no-supercritical supercurvature mode conjecture'' that claims the absence of
supercritical supercurvature modes in the one-bubble open inflation model. In
the same paper, we clarified the equivalence between the ``no-negative mode
conjecture'' and the ``no-supercritical supercurvature mode conjecture''.
Hence, the latter is also proved at the same time when the former is proved.
