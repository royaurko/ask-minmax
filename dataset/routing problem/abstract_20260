The survey presents the main developments obtained over the last decade
regarding pointwise ergodic theorems for measure preserving actions of locally
compact groups. The survey includes an exposition of the solutions to a number
of long standing open problems in ergodic theory, some of which are very recent
and have not yet appeared elsewhere.
