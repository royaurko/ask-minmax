This paper aims at finding a subclass of DTDs that covers many of the
real-world DTDs while offering a polynomial-time complexity for deciding the
XPath satisfiability problem. In our previous work, we proposed RW-DTDs, which
cover most of the real-world DTDs (26 out of 27 real-world DTDs and 1406 out of
1407 DTD rules). However, under RW-DTDs, XPath satisfiability with only child,
descendant-or-self, and sibling axes is tractable. In this paper, we propose
MRW-DTDs, which are slightly smaller than RW-DTDs but have tractability on
XPath satisfiability with parent axes or qualifiers. MRW-DTDs are a proper
superclass of duplicate-free DTDs proposed by Montazerian et al., and cover 24
out of the 27 real-world DTDs and 1403 out of the 1407 DTD rules. Under
MRW-DTDs, we show that XPath satisfiability problems with (1) child, parent,
and sibling axes, and (2) child and sibling axes and qualifiers are both
tractable, which are known to be intractable under RW-DTDs.
