In this paper we present a summary of the last works of Jorge Ize regarding
the global bifurcation of periodic solutions from the equilibria of a satellite
attracted by n primary bodies. We present results on the global bifurcation of
periodic solutions for the primary bodies from the Maxwell's ring, in the plane
and in space, where n identical masses on a regular polygon and one central
mass are turning in a plane at a constant speed. The symmetries of the problem
are used in order to find the irreducible representations, and with the help of
the orthogonal degree theory, all the symmetries of the bifurcating branches.
The results presented in this paper were done during the Ph.D. of the contributor
under the direction of Jorge Ize. This paper is dedicated to his memory.
