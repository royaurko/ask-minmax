The problem of weak radiative hyperon decays (WRHD) is reviewed. With the
recent measurement of the $\Xi ^0 \to \Lambda \gamma$ asymmetry confirming
Hara's theorem, implications from its violation in low-energy theoretical
approaches are discussed. It is shown how an underlying symmetry link should be
formulated for a successful description of both nonleptonic and radiative weak
hyperon decays. The sign of the $\Xi ^0 \to \Lambda \gamma$ asymmetry and the
overall size of parity-violating WRHD amplitudes together lead to the
resolution of the old S:P problem in nonleptonic decays.
