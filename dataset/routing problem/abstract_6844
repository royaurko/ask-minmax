We study the minimum \emph{interval deletion} problem, which asks for the
removal of a set of at most $k$ vertices to make a graph of $n$ vertices into
an interval graph. We present a parameterized algorithm of runtime $10^k \cdot
n^{O(1)}$ for this problem, that is, we show the problem is fixed-parameter
tractable.
