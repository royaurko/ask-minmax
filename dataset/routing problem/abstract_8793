In this paper, we are concerned with the first initial boundary value problem
for a class of fully nonlinear parabolic equations on Riemannian manifolds. As
usual, the establishment of the a priori C^2 estimates is our main part. Based
on these estimates, the existence of classical solutions is proved under
conditions which are nearly optimal.
