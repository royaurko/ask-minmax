We discuss a problem of cyclization of a polymer molecule, which is an
important example of reaction in a system showing strongly non-Markovian
behavior on the timescales of interest. We show that the knowledge of the joint
three-time probability distribution of the end-to-end distance is sufficient
for the full description of the cyclization kinetics, so that the survival
probability follows rigorously as a solution of the Volterra integral equation.
The corresponding kinetics can easily be evaluated numerically. We moreover
discuss how do some well-known approximations appear from this exact scheme due
to decoupling.
