Algorithms for resolution of singularities in characteristic zero are based
on Hironaka's idea of reducing the problem to a simpler question of
desingularization of an "idealistic exponent" (or "marked ideal"). How can we
determine whether two marked ideals are equisingular in the sense that they can
be resolved by the same blowing-up sequences? We show there is a
desingularization functor defined on the category of equivalence classes of
marked ideals and smooth morphisms, where marked ideals are "equivalent" if
they have the same sequences of "test transformations". Functoriality in this
sense realizes Hironaka's idealistic exponent philosophy. We use it to show
that the recent algorithms for desingularization of marked ideals of Wlodarczyk
and of Kollar coincide with our own, and we discuss open problems. This article
is dedicated to Heisuke Hironaka for his 77th birthday, in celebration of
"Kiju" -- joy and long life!
