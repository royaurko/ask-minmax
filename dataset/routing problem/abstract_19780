In this paper we propose a new approach to formulate the field theory on a
lattice. This approach can eliminate the Fermion doubling problem, preserve the
chiral symmetry and get the same dispersion relation for both Fermion and Boson
fields. This gives us the possibility to write down the chiral model (such as
the Weinberg-Salam model) on a lattice.
