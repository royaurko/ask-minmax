We propose and develop an efficient implementation of the robust tabu search
heuristic for sparse quadratic assignment problems. The traditional
implementation of the heuristic applicable to all quadratic assignment problems
is of O(N^2) complexity per iteration for problems of size N. Using multiple
priority queues to determine the next best move instead of scanning all
possible moves, and using adjacency lists to minimize the operations needed to
determine the cost of moves, we reduce the asymptotic complexity per iteration
to O(N log N ). For practical sized problems, the complexity is O(N).
