We suggest a new optical solution for solving the YES/NO version of the Exact
Cover problem by using the massive parallelism of light. The idea is to build
an optical device which can generate all possible solutions of the problem and
then to pick the correct one. In our case the device has a graph-like
representation and the light is traversing it by following the routes given by
the connections between nodes. The nodes are connected by arcs in a special way
which lets us to generate all possible covers (exact or not) of the given set.
For selecting the correct solution we assign to each item, from the set to be
covered, a special integer number. These numbers will actually represent delays
induced to light when it passes through arcs. The solution is represented as a
subray arriving at a certain moment in the destination node. This will tell us
if an exact cover does exist or not.
