Let $L$ be a Lie algebra with its enveloping algebra $U(L)$ over a field. In
this paper we survey results concerning the isomorphism problem for enveloping
algebras: given another Lie algebra $H$ for which $U(L)$ and $U(H)$ are
isomorphic as associative algebras, can we deduce that $L$ and $H$ are
isomorphic Lie algebras? Over a field of positive characteristic we consider a
similar problem for restricted Lie algebras, that is, given restricted Lie
algebras $L$ and $H$ for which their restricted enveloping algebras are
isomorphic as algebras, can we deduce that $L$ and $H$ are isomorphic?
