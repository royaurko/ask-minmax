The paper deals with the observer design problem for a wide class of
triangular nonlinear time-varying systems. The results of the present work
generalize previous results in the literature dealing with the observer design
problem for triangular systems and particularly, constitute generalizations of
those obtained in a recent contributors work concerning a class of triangular
systems, whose dynamics have p-normal form.
