We shall deal with the periodic problem for nonlinear perturbations of
abstract hyperbolic evolution equations generating an evolution system of
contractions. We prove an averaging principle for the translation along
trajectories operator associated to the nonlinear evolution system, expressed
in terms of the topological degree. The abstract results shall be applied to
the damped hyperbolic partial differential equation.
