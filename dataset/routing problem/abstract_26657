We solve the COLT 2013 open problem of \citet{SCB} on minimizing regret in
the setting of advice-efficient multiarmed bandits with expert advice. We give
an algorithm for the setting of K arms and N experts out of which we are
allowed to query and use only M experts' advices in each round, which has a
regret bound of \tilde{O}\bigP{\sqrt{\frac{\min\{K, M\} N}{M} T}} after T
rounds. We also prove that any algorithm for this problem must have expected
regret at least \tilde{\Omega}\bigP{\sqrt{\frac{\min\{K, M\} N}{M}T}}, thus
showing that our upper bound is nearly tight.
