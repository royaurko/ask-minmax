As a model of more general contour integration problems we consider the
numerical calculation of high-order derivatives of holomorphic functions using
Cauchy's integral formula. Bornemann (2011) showed that the condition number of
the Cauchy integral strongly depends on the chosen contour and solved the
problem of minimizing the condition number for circular contours. In this paper
we minimize the condition number within the class of grid paths of step size h
using Provan's algorithm for finding a shortest enclosing walk in weighted
graphs embedded in the plane. Numerical examples show that optimal rectangular
paths yield small condition numbers even in those cases where circular contours
are known to be of limited use, such as for functions with branch-cut
singularities.
