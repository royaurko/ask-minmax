In this paper we discuss the dissipative property of near-equilibrium
classical solutions to the Cauchy problem of the Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann
System in the whole space $\R^3$ when the positive charged ion flow provides a
spatially uniform background. The most key point of studying this coupled
degenerately dissipative system here is to establish the dissipation of the
electromagnetic field which turns out to be of the regularity-loss type.
Precisely, for the linearized non-homogeneous system, some $L^2$ energy
functionals and $L^2$ time-frequency functionals which are equivalent with the
naturally existing ones are designed to capture the optimal dissipation rate of
the system, which in turn yields the optimal $L^p$-$L^q$ type time-decay
estimates of the corresponding linearized solution operator. These results show
a special feature of the one-species Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system different
from the case of two-species, that is, the dissipation of the magnetic field in
one-species is strictly weaker than the one in two-species. As a by-product,
the global existence of solutions to the nonlinear Cauchy problem is also
proved by constructing some similar energy functionals but the time-decay rates
of the obtained solution still remain open.
