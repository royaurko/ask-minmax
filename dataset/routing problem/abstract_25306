The verification and validation of cyber-physical systems is known to be a
difficult problem due to the different modeling abstractions used for control
components and for software components. A recent trend to address this
difficulty is to reduce the need for verification by adopting correct-by-design
methodologies. According to the correct-by-design paradigm, one seeks to
automatically synthesize a controller that can be refined into code and that
enforces temporal specifications on the cyber-physical system. In this paper we
consider an instance of this problem where the specifications are given by a
fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and the physical environment is
described by a smooth differential equation. The contribution of this paper is
to show that synthesis for cyber-physical systems is viable by considering a
fragment of LTL that is expressive enough to describe interesting properties
but simple enough to avoid Safra's construction. We report on two examples
illustrating a preliminary implementation of these techniques on the tool
PESSOALTL.
