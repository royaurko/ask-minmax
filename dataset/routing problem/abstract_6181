We study the problem of scheduling equal-length jobs with release times and
deadlines, where the objective is to maximize the number of completed jobs.
Preemptions are not allowed. In Graham's notation, the problem is described as
1|r_j;p_j=p|\sum U_j. We give the following results: (1) We show that the often
cited algorithm by Carlier from 1981 is not correct. (2) We give an algorithm
for this problem with running time O(n^5).
