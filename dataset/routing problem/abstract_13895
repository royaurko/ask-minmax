Problems in two axiomatizations of Ja\'skowski's discussive (or discursive)
logic D2 are considered. A recent axiomatization of D2 and completeness proof
relative to D2's intended semantics seems to be mistaken because some formulas
valid according to the intended semantics turn out to be unprovable. Although
no new axiomatization is offered, nor a repaired completeness proof given, the
shortcomings identified here may be a step toward an improved axiomatization.
