We give an interpretation of the bilateral exit problem for L\'{e}vy
processes via the study of an elementary Markov chain. We exhibit a strong
connection between this problem and Krein's theory on strings. For instance,
for symmetric L\'{e}vy processes with bounded variations, the L\'{e}vy exponent
is the correspondant spectral density and the Wiener-Hopf factorization turns
out to be a version of Krein's entropy formula.
