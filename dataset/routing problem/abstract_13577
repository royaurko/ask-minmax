A new system for object detection in cluttered RGB-D images is presented. Our
main contribution is a new method called Bingham Procrustean Alignment (BPA) to
align models with the scene. BPA uses point correspondences between oriented
features to derive a probability distribution over possible model poses. The
orientation component of this distribution, conditioned on the position, is
shown to be a Bingham distribution. This result also applies to the classic
problem of least-squares alignment of point sets, when point features are
orientation-less, and gives a principled, probabilistic way to measure pose
uncertainty in the rigid alignment problem. Our detection system leverages BPA
to achieve more reliable object detections in clutter.
