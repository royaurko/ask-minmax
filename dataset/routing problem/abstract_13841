The outlier detection problem in some cases is similar to the classification
problem. For example, the main concern of clustering-based outlier detection
algorithms is to find clusters and outliers, which are often regarded as noise
that should be removed in order to make more reliable clustering. In this
article, we present an algorithm that provides outlier detection and data
clustering simultaneously. The algorithmimprovesthe estimation of centroids of
the generative distribution during the process of clustering and outlier
discovery. The proposed algorithm consists of two stages. The first stage
consists of improved genetic k-means algorithm (IGK) process, while the second
stage iteratively removes the vectors which are far from their cluster
centroids.
