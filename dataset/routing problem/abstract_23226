It has recently been shown that the neutrino can have non-zero electric
charge in a number of gauge theories, including the Minimal Standard Model.
Assuming non-zero neutrino charge, we develop a new approach to the solar
neutrino problem. The key idea is that the charged neutrinos will be deflected
by the Lorentz force while they are crossing the solar magnetic fields. Such a
deflection will result in the anisotropy of the solar neutrino flux. Because of
this anisotropy, the solar neutrino flux registered on earth can be reduced as
compared to the Standard Solar Model prediction. The mechanism is purely
classical and does not require neutrino oscillations, spin-flip or neutrino
decay. We discuss qualitatively the consequences of our scenario for present
and future solar neutrino experiments as well as differences between our
mechanism and other proposed solutions.
