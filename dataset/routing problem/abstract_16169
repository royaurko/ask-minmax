We identify the presence of Pet-Fish problem situations and the corresponding
Guppy effect of concept theory on the World-Wide Web. For this purpose, we
introduce absolute weights for words expressing concepts and relative weights
between words expressing concepts, and the notion of 'meaning bound' between
two words expressing concepts, making explicit use of the conceptual structure
of the World-Wide Web. The Pet-Fish problem occurs whenever there are exemplars
- in the case of Pet and Fish these can be Guppy or Goldfish - for which the
meaning bound with respect to the conjunction is stronger than the meaning
bounds with respect to the individual concepts.
