On the basis of the transfer matrix technique an analytical method to
investigate the stationary states, for an electron in one-dimensional periodic
structures in an external electrical field, displaying the symmetry of the
problem is developed. These solutions are shown to be current-carrying. It is
also shown that the electron spectrum for infinite structures is continuous,
and the corresponding wave functions do not satisfy the symmetry condition of
the problem.
