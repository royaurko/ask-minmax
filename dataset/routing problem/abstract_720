We study the critical behavior of period doublings in $N$ symmetrically
coupled area-preserving maps for many-coupled cases with $N>3$. It is found
that the critical scaling behaviors depend on the range of coupling
interaction. In the extreme long-range case of global coupling, in which each
area-preserving map is coupled to all the other area-preserving maps with equal
strength, there exist an infinite number of bifurcation routes in the parameter
plane, each of which ends at a critical point. The critical behaviors, which
vary depending on the type of bifurcation routes, are the same as those for the
previously-studied small $N$ cases $(N=2,3)$, independently of $N$. However,
for any other non-global coupling cases of shorter range couplings, there
remains only one bifurcation route ending at the zero-coupling critical point,
at which the $N$ area-preserving maps become uncoupled, The critical behavior
at the zero-coupling point is also the same as that for the small $N$ cases
$(N=2,3)$, independently of the coupling range.
