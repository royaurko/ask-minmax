Initial value problems for the integrable discrete equations on quad-graphs
are investigated. A geometric criterion of the well-posedness of such a problem
is found. The effects of the interaction of the solutions with the localized
defects in the regular square lattice are discussed for the discrete potential
KdV and linear wave equations. The examples of kinks and solitons on various
quad-graphs, including quasiperiodic tilings, are presented.
