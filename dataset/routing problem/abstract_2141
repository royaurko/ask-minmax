In this paper, we present an identity (ID) based protocol that secures AODV
and TCP so that it can be used in dynamic and attack prone environments of
mobile ad hoc networks. The proposed protocol protects AODV using Sequential
Aggregate Signatures (SAS) based on RSA. It also generates a session key for
each pair of source-destination nodes of a MANET for securing the end-to-end
transmitted data. Here each node has an ID which is evaluated from its public
key and the messages that are sent are authenticated with a signature/ MAC. The
proposed scheme does not allow a node to change its ID throughout the network
lifetime. Thus it makes the network secure against attacks that target AODV and
TCP in MANET. We present performance analysis to validate our claim.
