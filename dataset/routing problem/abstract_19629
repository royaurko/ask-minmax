We formulate, under general conditions, the problem of maximisation of the
total entropy of the system, assumed to be in a composable form, for fixed
total value of the constrained quantity. We derive the general form of the
composability function and also point out the criterion which leads to a
violation of the zeroth law of thermodynamics.
