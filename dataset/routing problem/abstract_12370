We study the theory of scattering of two anyons in the presence of a
quadratic saddle-point potential and a perpendicular magnetic field. The
scattering problem decouples in the centre-of-mass and the relative
coordinates. The scattering theory for the relative coordinate encodes the
effects of anyon statistics in the two-particle scattering. This is fully
characterized by two energy-dependent scattering phase shifts. We develop a
method to solve this scattering problem numerically, using a generalized lowest
Landau level approximation.
