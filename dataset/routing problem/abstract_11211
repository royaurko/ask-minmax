In this paper we obtain unstable even-parity eigenmodes to the static regular
spherically symmetric solutions of the SU(2) Yang-Mills-dilaton coupled system
of equations in 3+1 Minkowski space-time. The corresponding matrix
Sturm-Liouville problem is solved numerically by means of the continuous
analogue of Newton's method. The method, being the powerful tool for solving
both boundary-value and Sturm-Liouville problems, is described in details.
