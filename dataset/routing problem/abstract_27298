We consider products of independent random matrices taken from the induced
Ginibre ensemble with complex or quaternion elements. The joint densities for
the complex eigenvalues of the product matrix can be written down exactly for a
product of any fixed number of matrices and any finite matrix size. We show
that the squared absolute values of the eigenvalues form a permanental process,
generalising the results of Kostlan and Rider for single matrices to products
of complex and quaternionic matrices. Based on these findings, we can first
write down exact results and asymptotic expansions for the so-called hole
probabilities, that a disc centered at the origin is void of eigenvalues.
Second, we compute the asymptotic expansion for the opposite problem, that a
large fraction of complex eigenvalues occupies a disc of fixed radius centered
at the origin; this is known as the overcrowding problem. While the expressions
for finite matrix size depend on the parameters of the induced ensembles, the
asymptotic results agree to leading order with previous results for products of
square Ginibre matrices.
