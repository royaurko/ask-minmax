We consider the problem of finding secrecy rate of a multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) wire-tap channel. A transmitter, a legitimate receiver,
and an eavesdropper are all equipped with multiple antennas. The channel states
from the transmitter to the legitimate user and to the eavesdropper are assumed
to be known at the transmitter. In this contribution, we address the problem of
finding the optimal precoder/transmit covariance matrix maximizing the secrecy
rate of the given wiretap channel. The problem formulation is shown to be
equivalent to a difference of convex functions programming problem and an
efficient algorithm for addressing this problem is developed.
