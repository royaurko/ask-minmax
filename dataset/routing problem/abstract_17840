This paper presents a novel approach to the optimisation of structures using
a Tabu search (TS) method. TS is a metaheuristic which is used to guide local
search methods towards a globally optimal solution by using flexible memory
cycles of differing time spans. Results are presented for the well established
ten bar truss problem and compared to results published in the literature. In
the first example a truss is optimised to minimise mass and the results
compared to results obtained using an alternative TS implementation. In the
second example, the problem has multiple objectives that are compounded into a
single objective function value using game theory. In general the results
demonstrate that the TS method is capable of solving structural optimisation
problems at least as efficiently as other numerical optimisation approaches.
