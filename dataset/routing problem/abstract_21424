We consider the problem of sorting elements on a series of stacks, introduced
by Tarjan and Knuth. We improve the asymptotic lower bound for the number of
stacks necessary to sort $n$ elements to $0.561 \log_2 n + O(1)$. This is the
first significant improvement since the previous lower bound, $1/2 \log_2 n +
O(1)$, was established by Knuth in 1972.
