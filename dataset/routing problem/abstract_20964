We introduce a new complexity measure of a path of (problems, solutions)
pairs in terms of the length of the path in the condition metric which we
define in the article. The measure gives an upper bound for the number of
Newton steps sufficient to approximate the path discretely starting from one
end and thus produce an approximate zero for the endpoint. This motivates the
study of short paths or geodesics in the condition metric.
