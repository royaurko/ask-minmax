We discuss the twin paradox or the clock paradox under the small velocity
approximation of special relativity. In this paper the traveller twin of the
standard twin parable sets out with a non-relativistic speed for the trip
leaving behind the stay-at-home one on earth and continues up to a distance and
finally returns home with the same speed when the siblings can compare their
ages or their initially synchronized wrist watches. The common knowledge that
at small velocities the length contraction and time dilation effects of special
relativity can be ignored so that the world becomes essentially classical,
tends to lead to a paradox in connection with the twin problem, which a
"clever" student eventually discovers. After discussing and resolving the
issue, some more related paradoxes have been presented. The resolution of all
these problems provides some additional insight into the century old paradox.
