We investigate the parameterized complexity of generalisations and variations
of the dominating set problem on classes of graphs that are nowhere dense. In
particular, we show that the distance-d dominating-set problem, also known as
the (k,d)-centres problem, is fixed-parameter tractable on any class that is
nowhere dense and closed under induced subgraphs. This generalises known
results about the dominating set problem on H-minor free classes, classes with
locally excluded minors and classes of graphs of bounded expansion. A key
feature of our proof is that it is based simply on the fact that these graph
classes are uniformly quasi-wide, and does not rely on a structural
decomposition. Our result also establishes that the distance-d dominating-set
problem is FPT on classes of bounded expansion, answering a question of Ne{\v
s}et{\v{r}}il and Ossona de Mendez.
