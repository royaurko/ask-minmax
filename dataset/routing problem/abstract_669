In a recent paper (Physica A 296, 320 (2001)), T. Nagatani proposes a
time-headway model for buses on a bus route, and studies the stability of that
model's homogeneous solutions. While investigating the phase diagram gotten by
varying the rate of passenger arrival and the initial spacing of buses, he
discovers a discrepancy between the results of simulation and those of linear
stability analysis. In this paper, we reconcile the discrepancy by noting the
existence of three types of phase diagrams, and present simulational results
which confirm the stability analysis.
