We consider the classical online scheduling problem P||C_{max} in which jobs
are released over list and provide a nearly optimal online algorithm. More
precisely, an online algorithm whose competitive ratio is at most (1+\epsilon)
times that of an optimal online algorithm could be achieved in polynomial time,
where m, the number of machines, is a part of the input. It substantially
improves upon the previous results by almost closing the gap between the
currently best known lower bound of 1.88 (Rudin, Ph.D thesis, 2001) and the
best known upper bound of 1.92 (Fleischer, Wahl, Journal of Scheduling, 2000).
It has been known by folklore that an online problem could be viewed as a game
between an adversary and the online player. Our approach extensively explores
such a structure and builds up a completely new framework to show that, for the
online over list scheduling problem, given any \epsilon>0, there exists a
uniform threshold K which is polynomial in m such that if the competitive ratio
of an online algorithm is \rho<=2, then there exists a list of at most K jobs
to enforce the online algorithm to achieve a competitive ratio of at least
\rho-O(\epsilon). Our approach is substantially different from that of Gunther
et al. (Gunther et al., SODA 2013), in which an approximation scheme for online
over time scheduling problems is given, where the number of machines is fixed.
Our method could also be extended to several related online over list
scheduling models.
