We consider $hp$-Galerkin time stepping methods as applied to nonlinear
initial value problems in real Hilbert spaces. More precisely, we develop new
techniques to prove general Peano-type existence results for discrete solutions
for both the continuous as well as the discontinuous Galerkin schemes. In
particular, our results show that the existence of solutions is independent of
the local approximation order. The theory in this paper will be applied to
problems with finite time blow-ups. In addition, a series of numerical
experiments will be presented.
