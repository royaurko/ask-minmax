In the paper we show that an important class of multistage traffic
equillibrium models (including correspondence matrix calculation, traffic
assignment problem etc) and their economic generalizations can be considered as
proper population games with the minimax structure of equillibriums. This is
not trivial because at the first sight we have to consider competetive (Valras)
equilibrium and Nash-Vardroop equillibrium.
