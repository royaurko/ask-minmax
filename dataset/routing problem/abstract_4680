In this paper, we study a class of set cover problems that satisfy a special
property which we call the {\em small neighborhood cover} property. This class
encompasses several well-studied problems including vertex cover, interval
cover, bag interval cover and tree cover. We design unified distributed and
parallel algorithms that can handle any set cover problem falling under the
above framework and yield constant factor approximations. These algorithms run
in polylogarithmic communication rounds in the distributed setting and are in
NC, in the parallel setting.
