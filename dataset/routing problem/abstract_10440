The constraint satisfaction probem (CSP) is a well-acknowledged framework in
which many combinatorial search problems can be naturally formulated. The CSP
may be viewed as the problem of deciding the truth of a logical sentence
consisting of a conjunction of constraints, in front of which all variables are
existentially quantified. The quantified constraint satisfaction problem (QCSP)
is the generalization of the CSP where universal quantification is permitted in
addition to existential quantification. The general intractability of these
problems has motivated research studying the complexity of these problems under
a restricted constraint language, which is a set of relations that can be used
to express constraints.
  This paper introduces collapsibility, a technique for deriving positive
complexity results on the QCSP. In particular, this technique allows one to
show that, for a particular constraint language, the QCSP reduces to the CSP.
We show that collapsibility applies to three known tractable cases of the QCSP
that were originally studied using disparate proof techniques in different
decades: Quantified 2-SAT (Aspvall, Plass, and Tarjan 1979), Quantified
Horn-SAT (Karpinski, Kleine B\"{u}ning, and Schmitt 1987), and Quantified
Affine-SAT (Creignou, Khanna, and Sudan 2001). This reconciles and reveals
common structure among these cases, which are describable by constraint
languages over a two-element domain. In addition to unifying these known
tractable cases, we study constraint languages over domains of larger size.
