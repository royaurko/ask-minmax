This paper considers the Cauchy problem of equations for the viscous
compressible and heat-conductive fluids in the two-dimensional(2D) space. We
establish the local existence theory of unique strong solution under some
initial layer compatibility conditions. The initial data can be arbitrarily
large, the initial density is allowed to vanish in any set and the far field
state is assumed to be vacuum.
