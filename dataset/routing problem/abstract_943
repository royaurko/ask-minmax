We report structural, magnetic and dielectric properties of Co1.5Fe1.5O4
nanoparticles and their composites with non-magnetic NaNO3. The samples were
derived from metal nitrates solution at different pH values. The chemical
routed sample was air heated at 200 0C and 500 0C. Heating of the material
showed unusual decrease of crystallite size, but cubic spinel structure is seen
in all samples. The samples of Co1.5Fe1.5O4 showed substantially large room
temperature ferromagnetic moment, electrical conductivity, dielectric constant,
and low dielectric loss. The samples are soft ferromagnet and electrically
highly polarized. The interfaces of grains and grain boundaries are actively
participating to determine the magnetic and dielectric properties of the
ferrite grains. The effects of interfacial contribution are better realized
using the ferrite and NaNO3 composite samples. We have examined different
scopes of modifying the magnetic and dielectric parameters using same material
in pure and composite form.
