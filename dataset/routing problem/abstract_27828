The purpose of this paper is to propose a non-iterative method for the
inverse conductivity problem of recovering multiple small anomalies from the
boundary measurements. When small anomalies are buried in a conducting object,
the electric potential values inside the object can be expressed by integrals
of densities with a common sparse support on the location of anomalies. Based
on this integral expression, we formulate the reconstruction problem of small
anomalies as a joint sparse recovery and present an efficient non-iterative
recovery algorithm of small anomalies. Furthermore, we also provide a slightly
modified algorithm to reconstruct an extended anomaly. We validate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm over the linearized method and the
MUSIC algorithm by numerical simulations.
