Most of the intra-cellular events involved in the initiation and propagation
phases of this process has now been identified astrocytes. The control of the
spread of intracellular calcium signaling has been demonstrated to occur at
several levels including IP3 receptors, intracellular Ca2+ stores like
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) . In normal and pathological situations that affect
one or several of these steps can be predicted to influence on astrocytic
calcium waves. In view of above a mathematical model is developed to study
interdependence of all the important parameters like diffusion coefficient and
influx over [Ca2+] profile. Model incorporates the ER fluxes like, leak Pump
Chan J J andJ . Finite volume method is employed to solve the problem. A
program has been developed using in MATLAB 7.5 for the entire problem and
simulated on an AMD-Turion 32-bite machine to compute the numerical results. In
view of above a mathematical model is developed to study calcium transport
between cytosol and ER.
