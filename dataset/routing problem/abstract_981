Due to the increased capabilities of mobile devices and through wireless
opportunistic contacts, users can experience new ways to share and retrieve
content anywhere and anytime, even in the presence of link intermittency. Due
to the significant number of available routing solutions, it is difficult to
understand which one has the best performance, since all of them follow a
different evaluation method. This paper proposes an assessment model, based on
a new taxonomy, which comprises an evaluation guideline with performance
metrics and experimental setup to aid designers in evaluating solutions through
fair comparisons. Simulation results based on the proposed model revisit the
performance results published by Epidemic, PROPHET, and Bubble Rap, showing how
they perform under the same set of metrics and scenario.
