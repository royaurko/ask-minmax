Reducing thermal noise from optical coatings is crucial to reaching the
required sensitivity in next generation interferometric gravitational-waves
detectors. Here we show that adding TiO$_2$ to Ta$_2$O$_5$ in
Ta$_2$O$_5$/SiO$_2$ coatings reduces the internal friction and in addition
present data confirming it reduces thermal noise. We also show that
TiO$_2$-doped Ta$_2$O$_5$/SiO$_2$ coatings are close to satisfying the optical
absorption requirements of second generation gravitational-wave detectors.
