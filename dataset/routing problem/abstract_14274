Monge-Amp\`ere equation $\det(D^2u)=f$ in two dimensional spaces is different
in nature from their counterparts in higher dimensional spaces. In this article
we employ new ideas to establish two main results for the Monge-Amp\`ere
equation defined either globally in $\mathbb R^2$ or outside a convex set.
First we prove the existence of a global solution that satisfies a prescribed
asymptotic behavior at infinity, if $f$ is asymptotically close to a positive
constant. Then we solve the exterior Dirichlet problem if data are given on the
boundary of a convex set and at infinity.
