A new concept analogous to global hyperbolicity is introduced, based on test
fields. It is shown that the space-times termed here ``curve integrable'' are
globally hyperbolic in this new sense, and a plausibility argument is given
suggesting that the result applies to shell crossing singularities. If the
assumptions behind this last argument are valid, this provides an alternative
route to the assertion that such singularities do not violate cosmic
censorship.
