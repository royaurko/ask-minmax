We investigate the problem of mapping, through the Morita equivalence, odd
dimensional noncommutative lattice gauge theories onto suitable matrix models.
We specialize our analysis to noncommutative three dimensional QED (NCQED) and
scalar QED (NCSQED), for which we explicitly build the corresponding Matrix
Model.
