The final-state interaction in multichannel decay processes is sytematically
studied with application to B decay in mind. Since the final-state inteaction
is intrinsically interwoven with the decay interaction in this case, no simple
phase theorem like "Watson's theorem" holds for experimentally observed final
states. We first examine in detail the two-channel problem as a toy-model to
clarify the issues and to remedy common mistakes made in earlier literature.
Realistic multichannel problems are too challenging for quantitative analysis.
To cope with mathematical complexity, we introduce a method of approximation
that is applicable to the case where one prominant inelastic channel dominates
over all others. We illustrate this approximation method in the amplitude of
the decay B to pi K fed by the intermediate states of a charmed meson pair.
Even with our approximation we need more accurate information of strong
interactions than we have now. Nonethless we are able to obtain some insight in
the issue and draw useful conclusions on general fearyres on the strong phases.
