We obtain exact expressions for the asymptotic behaviour of the average
probability of the block decoding error for ensembles of regular low density
parity check error correcting codes, by employing diagrammatic techniques.
Furthermore, we show how imposing simple constraints on the code ensemble (that
can be practically implemented in linear time), allows one to suppress the
error probability for codes with more than 2 checks per bit, to an arbitrarily
low power of $N$. As such we provide a practical route to a (sub-optimal){\em
expurgated} ensemble.
