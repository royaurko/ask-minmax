An output-polynomial algorithm for the listing of minimal dominating sets in
graphs is a challenging open problem and is known to be equivalent to the
well-known Transversal problem which asks for an output-polynomial algorithm
for listing the set of minimal hitting sets in hypergraphs. We give a
polynomial delay algorithm to list the set of minimal dominating sets in
chordal graphs, an important and well-studied graph class where such an
algorithm was open for a while.
