We present a family of p-enrichment schemes. These schemes may be separated
into two basic classes: the first, called \emph{fixed tolerance schemes}, rely
on setting global scalar tolerances on the local regularity of the solution,
and the second, called \emph{dioristic schemes}, rely on time-evolving bounds
on the local variation in the solution. Each class of $p$-enrichment scheme is
further divided into two basic types. The first type (the Type I schemes)
enrich along lines of maximal variation, striving to enhance stable solutions
in "areas of highest interest." The second type (the Type II schemes) enrich
along lines of maximal regularity in order to maximize the stability of the
enrichment process. Each of these schemes are tested over a pair of model
problems arising in coastal hydrology. The first is a contaminant transport
model, which addresses a declinature problem for a contaminant plume with
respect to a bay inlet setting. The second is a multicomponent chemically
reactive flow model of estuary eutrophication arising in the Gulf of Mexico.
