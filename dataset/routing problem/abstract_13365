A version of generalized eigenoscillation method is applied to the problem
about resonant effects in metallic nanoparticles. An approach is proposed, that
permits to avoid calculating all higher eigenoscillations except the resonant
one. An algorithm for determination of the resonant eigenoscillation, based on
the Galerkin procedure, is described in details for the case of bodies of
revolution. Model numerical results are presented.
