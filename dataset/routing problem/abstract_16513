Artificial Neural Network is one of the most common AI application fields.
This field has direct and indirect usages most sciences. The main goal of ANN
is to imitate biological neural networks for solving scientific problems. But
the level of parallelism is the main problem of ANN systems in comparison with
biological systems. To solve this problem, we have offered a XML-based
framework for implementing ANN on the Globus Toolkit Platform. Globus Toolkit
is well known management software for multipurpose Grids. Using the Grid for
simulating the neuron network will lead to a high degree of parallelism in the
implementation of ANN. We have used the XML for improving flexibility and
scalability in our framework.
