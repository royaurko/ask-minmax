Motivated by the problem of domino tilings of the Aztec diamond, a weighted
particle system is defined on $N$ lines, with line $j$ containing $j$
particles. The particles are restricted to lattice points from 0 to $N$, and
particles on successive lines are subject to an interlacing constraint. It is
shown that marginal distributions for this particle system can be computed
exactly. This in turn is used to give unified derivations of a number of
fundamental properties of the tiling problem, for example the evaluation of the
number of distinct configurations and the relation to the GUE minor process. An
interlaced particle system associated with the domino tiling of a certain half
Aztec diamond is similarly defined and analyzed.
