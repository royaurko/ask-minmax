A perfect Euler cuboid is a rectangular parallelepiped with integer edges and
integer face diagonals whose space diagonal is also integer. The problem of
finding such parallelepipeds or proving their non-existence is an old unsolved
mathematical problem. The Diophantine equations of a perfect Euler cuboid have
an explicit $S_3$ symmetry. In this paper the cuboid equations are factorized
with respect to their $S_3$ symmetry in terms of multisymmetric polynomials.
Some factor equations are calculated explicitly.
