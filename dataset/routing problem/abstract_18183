We use a diffuse interface method for solving Poisson's equation with a
Dirichlet condition on an embedded interface. The resulting diffuse interface
problem is identified as a standard Dirichlet problem on approximating domains.
A specific property of the approach is that the boundaries of the approximating
domains do not interpolate the sharp interfaces. We estimate the errors
introduced by these domain perturbations, and prove convergence and
convergences rates in the $H^1$-norm, the $L^2$-norm and the $L^\infty$-norm in
terms of the width $\varepsilon$ of the diffuse layer. For an efficient
numerical solution we consider the finite element method for which another
domain perturbation is introduced. We prove convergence and convergences rates
in the $H^1$-norm and the $L^2$-norm in terms of $\varepsilon$ and the mesh
size. Our results are illustrated by numerical experiments.
