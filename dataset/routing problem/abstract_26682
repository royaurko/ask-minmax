The Bogomolov multiplier $B_0(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is defined as the
subgroup of the Schur multiplier consisting of the cohomology classes vanishing
after restriction to all abelian subgroups of $G$. The triviality of the
Bogomolov multiplier is an obstruction to Noether's problem. We show that if
$G$ is a central product of $G_1$ and $G_2$, where $G_2$ is a metaabelian
group, and $\theta:G_1\to G_2$ is a group homomorphism such that its
restriction $\theta|_{K_1}:K_1\to K_2$ is an isomorphism, then the triviality
of $B_0(G_1)$ and $B_0(G_2)$ implies the triviality of $B_0(G)$. We show that
the Bogomolov multipliers are trivial for seven series of 4-generator
$p$-groups of nilpotency class 2 that do not have the ABC (Abelian-By-Cyclic)
property. We give a positive answer to Noether's problem for all 2-generator
$p$-groups of nilpotency class 2, and for two series of 4-generator $p$-groups
of nilpotency class 2 that do not posses the ABC property (with the usual
requirement for the roots of unity).
