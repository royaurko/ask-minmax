In this work the existence of weak solutions for a class of non-Newtonian
viscous fluid problems is analyzed. The problem is modeled by the steady case
of the generalized Navier-Stokes equations, where the exponent $q$ that
characterizes the flow depends on the space variable: $q=q(\mathbf{x})$. For
the associated boundary-value problem we show that, in some situations, the
log-H\"older continuity condition on $q$ can be dropped and the result of the
existence of weak solutions still remain valid for any variable exponent
$q\geq\alpha>\frac{2N}{N+2}$, where $\alpha=\mathrm{ess}\inf q$.
