The Kondo lattice model has been analyzed in the presence of a random
inter-site interaction among localized spins with non zero mean Jo and standard
deviation J. Following the same framework previously introduced by us, the
problem is formulated in the path integral formalism where the spin operators
are expressed as bilinear combinations of Grassmann fields. The static
approximation and the replica symmetry ansatz have allowed us to solve the
problem at a mean field level. The resulting phase diagram displays several
phase transitions among a ferromagnetically ordered region,a spin glass one, a
mixed phase and a Kondo state depending on Jo, J and its relation with the
Kondo interaction coupling Jk. These results could be used to address part of
the experimental data for the CeNi_{1-x}Cu_x compound, when x =< 0.8.
