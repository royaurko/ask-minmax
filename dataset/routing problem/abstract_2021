In parameter space of nonlinear dynamical systems, windows of periodic states
are aligned following routes of period-adding configuring periodic window
sequences. In state space of driven nonlinear oscillators, we determine the
torsion associated with the periodic states and identify regions of uniform
torsion in the window sequences. Moreover, we find that the measured of torsion
differs by a constant between successive windows in periodic window sequences.
We call this phenomenon as torsion-adding. Finally, combining the torsion and
the period adding rules, we deduce a general rule to obtain the asymptotic
winding number in the accumulation limit of such periodic window sequences.
