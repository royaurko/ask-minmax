Suppose $\fA$ is an algebra of operators on a Hilbert space $H$ and $A_1,...,
A_n \in \fA$. If the row operator $[A_1,..., A_n] \in B(H^{(n)},H)$ has a right
inverse in $B(H, H^{(n)})$, the Toeplitz corona problem for $\fA$ asks if a
right inverse can be found with entries in $\fA$. When $H$ is a complete
Nevanlinna-Pick space and $\fA$ is a weakly-closed algebra of multiplication
operators on $H$, we show that under a stronger hypothesis, the corona problem
for $\fA$ has a solution. When $\fA$ is the full multiplier algebra of $H$, the
Toeplitz corona theorems of Arveson, Schubert and Ball-Trent-Vinnikov are
obtained. A tangential interpolation result for these algebras is developed in
order to solve the Toeplitz corona problem.
