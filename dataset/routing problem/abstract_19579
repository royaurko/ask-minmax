In this tutorial we will tackle the problem of electronic correlations in
quasi-one-dimensional organic superconductors. We will go through different
pieces of experimental evidence showing the range of applicability of the Fermi
and Luttinger liquid descriptions of the normal phase of the Bechgaard salts
series and their sulfur analogs.
