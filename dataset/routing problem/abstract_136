We briefly report on the current state of a new dynamic algorithm for the
route planning problem based on a concept of scope (the static variant
presented at ESA'11, HM2011A). We first motivate dynamization of the concept of
scope admissibility, and then we briefly describe a modification of the
scope-aware query algorithm of HM2011A to dynamic road networks. Finally, we
outline our future work on this concept.
