In this paper we examine the Maxwell Demon problem from an information
theoretic and computational point-of-view. In particular we calculate the
required capacity of a communication channel that transports information to and
from the Demon. Equivalently, this is the number of bits required to store the
information on a computer tape. We show that, in a simple model for the Maxwell
Demon, the entropy of the universe increases by at least an amount
eta=0.83999552 bits per particle in going from unsorted to sorted particles and
by an amount eta*=2.37314 in going from one sorted state to another sorted
state.
