We consider testing statistical hypotheses about densities of signals in
deconvolution models. A new approach to this problem is proposed. We
constructed score tests for the deconvolution with the known noise density and
efficient score tests for the case of unknown density. The tests are
incorporated with model selection rules to choose reasonable model dimensions
automatically by the data. Consistency of the tests is proved.
