We investigate the problem of Multiple Description (MD) coding of discrete
ergodic processes. We introduce the notion of MD stationary coding, and
characterize its relationship to the conventional block MD coding. In
stationary coding, in addition to the two rate constraints normally considered
in the MD problem, we consider another rate constraint which reflects the
conditional entropy of the process generated by the third decoder given the
reconstructions of the two other decoders. The relationship that we establish
between stationary and block MD coding enables us to devise a universal
algorithm for MD coding of discrete ergodic sources, based on simulated
annealing ideas that were recently proven useful for the standard rate
distortion problem.
