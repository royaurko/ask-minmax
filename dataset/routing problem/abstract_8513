We rigorously prove the convergence of appropriately scaled solutions of the
2D Hele-Shaw moving boundary problem with surface tension in the limit of thin
threads to the solution of the formally corresponding Thin Film equation. The
proof is based on scaled parabolic estimates for the nonlocal, nonlinear
evolution equations that arise from these problems.
