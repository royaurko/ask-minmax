We give the solution to the minimum-energy control problem for linear
stochastic systems. The problem is as follows: given an exactly controllable
system, find the control process with the minimum expected energy that
transfers the system from a given initial state to a desired final state. The
solution is found in terms of a certain forward-backward stochastic
differential equation of Hamiltonian type.
