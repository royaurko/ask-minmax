Very recently crowdsourcing has become the de facto platform for distributing
and collecting human computation for a wide range of tasks and applications
such as information retrieval, natural language processing and machine
learning. Current crowdsourcing platforms have some limitations in the area of
quality control. Most of the effort to ensure good quality has to be done by
the experimenter who has to manage the number of workers needed to reach good
results.
  We propose a simple model for adaptive quality control in crowdsourced
multiple-choice tasks which we call the \emph{bandit survey problem}. This
model is related to, but technically different from the well-known multi-armed
bandit problem. We present several algorithms for this problem, and support
them with analysis and simulations. Our approach is based in our experience
conducting relevance evaluation for a large commercial search engine.
