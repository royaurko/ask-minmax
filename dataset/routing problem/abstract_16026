We consider the linear regression problem of estimating an unknown,
deterministic parameter vector based on measurements corrupted by colored
Gaussian noise. We present and analyze blind minimax estimators (BMEs), which
consist of a bounded parameter set minimax estimator, whose parameter set is
itself estimated from measurements. Thus, one does not require any prior
assumption or knowledge, and the proposed estimator can be applied to any
linear regression problem. We demonstrate analytically that the BMEs strictly
dominate the least-squares estimator, i.e., they achieve lower mean-squared
error for any value of the parameter vector. Both Stein's estimator and its
positive-part correction can be derived within the blind minimax framework.
Furthermore, our approach can be readily extended to a wider class of
estimation problems than Stein's estimator, which is defined only for white
noise and non-transformed measurements. We show through simulations that the
BMEs generally outperform previous extensions of Stein's technique.
