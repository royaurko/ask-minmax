Attributing a cyber-operation through the use of multiple pieces of technical
evidence (i.e., malware reverse-engineering and source tracking) and
conventional intelligence sources (i.e., human or signals intelligence) is a
difficult problem not only due to the effort required to obtain evidence, but
the ease with which an adversary can plant false evidence. In this paper, we
introduce a formal reasoning system called the InCA (Intelligent Cyber
Attribution) framework that is designed to aid an analyst in the attribution of
a cyber-operation even when the available information is conflicting and/or
uncertain. Our approach combines argumentation-based reasoning, logic
programming, and probabilistic models to not only attribute an operation but
also explain to the analyst why the system reaches its conclusions.
