Mn doping in dilute III-V alloys has been examined as a route to enhance
ferromagnetic stability. Strong valence band bowing is expected at the dilute
limit, implying a strong modification of the ferromagnetic stability upon
alloying, with even an increase in some cases. Using first principle electronic
structure calculations we show that while codoping with a group V anion
enhances the ferromagnetic stability in some cases when the effects of
relaxation of the lattice are not considered, strong impurity scattering in the
relaxed structure result in a reduction of the ferromagnetic stability.
