Landau Fermi liquid theory, with its pivotal assertion that electrons in
metals can be simply understood as independent particles with effective masses
replacing the free electron mass, has been astonishingly successful. This is
true despite the Coulomb interactions an electron experiences from the host
crystal lattice, its defects, and the other ~1022/cm3 electrons. An important
extension to the theory accounts for the behaviour of doped semiconductors1,2.
Because little in the vast literature on materials contradicts Fermi liquid
theory and its extensions, exceptions have attracted great attention, and they
include the high temperature superconductors3, silicon-based field effect
transistors which host two-dimensional metals4, and certain rare earth
compounds at the threshold of magnetism5-8. The origin of the non-Fermi liquid
behaviour in all of these systems remains controversial. Here we report that an
entirely different and exceedingly simple class of materials - doped small gap
semiconductors near a metal-insulator transition - can also display a non-Fermi
liquid state. Remarkably, a modest magnetic field functions as a switch which
restores the ordinary disordered Fermi liquid. Our data suggest that we have
finally found a physical realization of the only mathematically rigourous route
to a non-Fermi liquid, namely the 'undercompensated Kondo effect', where there
are too few mobile electrons to compensate for the spins of unpaired electrons
localized on impurity atoms9-12.
