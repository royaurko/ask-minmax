The constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a general problem central to
computer science and artificial intelligence. Although the CSP is NP-hard in
general, considerable effort has been spent on identifying tractable
subclasses. The main two approaches consider structural properties
(restrictions on the hypergraph of constraint scopes) and relational properties
(restrictions on the language of constraint relations). Recently, some contributors
have considered hybrid properties that restrict the constraint hypergraph and
the relations simultaneously.
  Our key contribution is the novel concept of a CSP pattern and classes of
problems defined by forbidden patterns (which can be viewed as forbidding
generic subproblems). We describe the theoretical framework which can be used
to reason about classes of problems defined by forbidden patterns. We show that
this framework generalises relational properties and allows us to capture known
hybrid tractable classes.
  Although we are not close to obtaining a dichotomy concerning the
tractability of general forbidden patterns, we are able to make some progress
in a special case: classes of problems that arise when we can only forbid
binary negative patterns (generic subproblems in which only inconsistent tuples
are specified). In this case we are able to characterise very large classes of
tractable and NP-hard forbidden patterns. This leaves the complexity of just
one case unresolved and we conjecture that this last case is tractable.
