In this work, we show how to obtain a free boundary problem as the limit of a
fully non linear elliptic system of equations that models population
segregation (Gause-Lotka-Volterra type). We study the regularity of the
solutions. In particular, we prove Lipschitz regularity across the free
boundary. The problem is motivated by the work done by Caffarelli, Karakhanyan
and Fang-Hua Lin for the linear case.
