The modifications of circular cosmic string loop dynamics due to the
electromagnetic self-interaction are calculated and shown to reduce the
available phase space for reaching classical vorton states, thereby decreasing
their remnant abundance. Use is made of the duality between master-function and
Lagrangian formalisms on an explicit model.
