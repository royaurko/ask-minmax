In this paper, we further investigate the problem of commutativity up to a
factor (or $\lambda$-commutativity) in the setting of bounded and unbounded
linear operators in a complex Hilbert space. The results are based on a new
approach to the problem. We finish the paper by a conjecture on the
commutativity of self-adjoint operators.
