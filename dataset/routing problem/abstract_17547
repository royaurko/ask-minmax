We present variational and numerical solutions for the problem of stability
of persistent currents in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate of
distinguishable atoms which rotate in a ring potential. We consider the general
class of solutions of constant density in the two components separately, thus
providing an alternative approach of the solution of the same problem given
recently by Zhigang Wu and Eugene Zaremba [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 88}, 063640
(2013)]. Our approach provides a physically transparent solution of this
delicate problem. Finally, we give a unified and simple picture of the
lowest-energy state of the system for large values of the coupling.
