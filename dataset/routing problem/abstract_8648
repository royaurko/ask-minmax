We study open sets $\mathcal{P}$ in normed spaces $X$ attaining a large
volume while avoiding pairs of points at integral distance. The proposed task
is to find sharp inequalities for the maximum possible $d$-dimensional volume.
This problem can be viewed as an opposite to known problems on point sets with
pairwise integral or rational distances.
