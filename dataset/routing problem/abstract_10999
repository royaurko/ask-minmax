The generating functional of correlation functions for the XXZ spin chain is
considered in the thermodynamic limit. We derive a system of integro-difference
equations that prescribe this functional. On the basis of this system we
establish the operator-valued Riemann-Hilbert problem for correlation functions
of the XXZ spin chain.
