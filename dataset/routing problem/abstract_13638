This paper is concerned with two problems. One is to count Hitchin bundles on
a projective curve and the other is to get an explicit formula for the
nilpotent part of the Arthur-Selberg trace formula for a simple test function.
The fact that the two problems are in fact related has been noticed in a
previous paper. We expand the nilpotent part of the Arthur-Selberg trace
formula in a sum of adelic integrals indexed by nilpotent orbits. For "regular
by blocks" orbits, we get an explicit formula for these integrals in terms of
the zeta function of the curve.
