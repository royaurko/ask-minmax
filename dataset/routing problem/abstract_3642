We define the min-min expectation selection problem (resp. max-min
expectation selection problem) to be that of selecting k out of n given
discrete probability distributions, to minimize (resp. maximize) the
expectation of the minimum value resulting when independent random variables
are drawn from the selected distributions. We assume each distribution has
finitely many atoms. Let d be the number of distinct values in the support of
the distributions. We show that if d is a constant greater than 2, the min-min
expectation problem is NP-complete but admits a fully polynomial time
approximation scheme. For d an arbitrary integer, it is NP-hard to approximate
the min-min expectation problem with any constant approximation factor. The
max-min expectation problem is polynomially solvable for constant d; we leave
open its complexity for variable d. We also show similar results for binary
selection problems in which we must choose one distribution from each of n
pairs of distributions.
