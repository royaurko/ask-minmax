Asymptotic behavior of the tuning parameter selection in the standard
cross-validation methods is investigated for the high-dimensional variable
selection problem. It is shown that the shrinkage problem with the Lasso
penalty is not always the true reason for the over-selection phenomenon in the
cross-validation based tuning parameter selection. After identifying the
potential problems with the standard cross-validation methods, we propose a new
procedure, Consistent Cross-Validation (CCV), for selecting the optimal tuning
parameter. CCV is shown to enjoy the tuning parameter selection consistency
under certain technical conditions. Extensive simulations and real data
analysis support the theoretical results and demonstrate that CCV also works
well in terms of prediction.
