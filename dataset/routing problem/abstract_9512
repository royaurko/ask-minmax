In this paper we use probabilistic arguments (Tug-of-War games) to obtain
existence of viscosity solutions to a parabolic problem of the form $$ {cases}
K_{(x,t)}(D u)u_t (x,t)= \frac12 <D^2 u J_{(x,t)}(D u),J_{(x,t)}(D u) (x,t)
&{in} \Omega_T, u(x,t)=F(x)&{on}\Gamma, {cases} $$ where
$\Omega_T=\Omega\times(0,T]$ and $\Gamma$ is its parabolic boundary. This
problem can be viewed as a version with spatial and time dependence of the
evolution problem given by the infinity Laplacian, $ u_t (x,t)= <D^2 u (x,t)
\frac{D u}{|Du|} (x,t),\, \frac{D u}{|Du|} (x,t)>$.
