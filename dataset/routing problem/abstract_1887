We report a synthesis route to grow iron nitride thin films with giant
saturation magnetization (Ms) through an N inter-diffusion process. By post
annealing Fe/Fe-N structured films grown on GaAs(001) substrates, nitrogen
diffuses from the over-doped amorphous-like Fe-N layer into strained
crystalline Fe layer and facilitates the development of metastable Fe16N2
phase. As explored by polarized neutron reflectometry, the depth-dependent Ms
profile can be well described by a model with the presence of a giant Ms up to
2360 emu/cm3 at near-substrate interface, corresponding to the strained regions
of these annealed films. This is much larger than the currently known limit
(Fe65Co35 with Ms \sim 1900 emu/cm3). The present synthesis method can be used
to develop writer materials for future magnetic recording application.
