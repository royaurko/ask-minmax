The number of road vehicles significantly increased in recent decades. This
trend accompanied a build-up of road infrastructure and development of various
control systems to increase road traffic safety, road capacity and travel
comfort. In traffic safety significant development has been made and today's
systems more and more include cameras and computer vision methods. Cameras are
used as part of the road infrastructure or in vehicles. In this paper a review
on computer vision systems in vehicles from the stand point of traffic
engineering is given. Safety problems of road vehicles are presented, current
state of the art in-vehicle vision systems is described and open problems with
future research directions are discussed.
