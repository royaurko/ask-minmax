A recently developed expansion method for analytically solving the ground
states of strongly coupling Schr\"odinger equations by Friedberg, Lee and Zhao
is extended to excited states and applied to the pedagogically important
problems of power-law central forces. With the extended method, the Hydrogen
atom problem is resolved and the low-lying states of Yukawa potential are
approximately obtained.
