We illustrate a problem in the self-financing condition used in the papers
"Funding beyond discounting: collateral agreements and derivatives pricing"
(Risk Magazine, February 2010) and "Partial Differential Equation
Representations of Derivatives with Counterparty Risk and Funding Costs" (The
Journal of Credit Risk, 2011). These papers state an erroneous self-financing
condition. In the first paper, this is equivalent to assuming that the equity
position is self-financing on its own and without including the cash position.
In the second paper, this is equivalent to assuming that a subportfolio is
self-financing on its own, rather than the whole portfolio. The error in the
first paper is avoided when clearly distinguishing between price processes,
dividend processes and gain processes. We present an outline of the derivation
that yields the correct statement of the self-financing condition, clarifying
the structure of the relevant funding accounts, and show that the final result
in "Funding beyond discounting" is correct, even if the self-financing
condition stated is not.
