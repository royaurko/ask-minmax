In this work we study the transport properties of a finite Peierls-Fr\"ohlich
dielectric with a charge density wave of the commensurate type. We show that at
low temperatures this problem can be mapped onto a problem of fractional charge
transport through a finite-length correlated dielectric, recently studied by
Ponomarenko and Nagaosa [Phys. Rev. Lett {\bf 81}, 2304 (1998)]. The
temperature dependence of conductance of the charge density wave junction is
presented for a wide range of temperatures.
