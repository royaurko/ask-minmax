In this paper we study an initial boundary value problem for Zakharov's
equations, describing the space propagation of a laser beam entering in a
plasma. We prove a strong instability result and prove that the mathematical
problem is ill-posed in Sobolev spaces. We also show that it is well posed in
spaces of analytic functions. Several consequences for the physical consistency
of the model are discussed.
