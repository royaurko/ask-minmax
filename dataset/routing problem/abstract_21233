An exact analytic solution has been obtained for a uniformly expanding,
neutral, infinitely conducting plasma cylinder in an external uniform and
constant magnetic field. The electrodynamical aspects related to the emission
and transformation of energy have been considered as well. The results obtained
can be used in analysing the recent experimental and simulation data.
