We investigate the problem of propagation of three-component resonant light
pulses with adiabatically varying amplitudes through a medium consisting of
atoms with the tripod level configuration. By means of both analytic and
numerical methods we found the two modes of shape-preserving pulse propagation.
The pulse propagation velocity is found to be either equal to the speed of
light or significantly slowed down, depending on a particular propagation mode.
