Recently introduced 3D vertical flash memory is expected to be a disruptive
technology since it overcomes scaling challenges of conventional 2D planar
flash memory by stacking up cells in the vertical direction. However, 3D
vertical flash memory suffers from a new problem known as fast detrapping,
which is a rapid charge loss problem. In this paper, we propose a scheme to
compensate the effect of fast detrapping by intentional inter-cell interference
(ICI). In order to properly control the intentional ICI, our scheme relies on a
coding technique that incorporates the side information of fast detrapping
during the encoding stage. This technique is closely connected to the
well-known problem of coding in a memory with defective cells. Numerical
results show that the proposed scheme can effectively address the problem of
fast detrapping.
