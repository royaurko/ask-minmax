The active cloak comprises a discrete set of multipole sources that
destructively interfere with an incident time harmonic scalar wave to produce
zero total field over a finite spatial region. For a given number of sources
and their positions in two dimensions it is shown that the multipole amplitudes
can be expressed as infinite sums of the coefficients of the incident wave
decomposed into regular Bessel functions. The field generated by the active
sources vanishes in the infinite region exterior to a set of circles defined by
the relative positions of the sources. The results provide a direct solution to
the inverse problem of determining the source amplitudes. They also define a
broad class of non-radiating discrete sources.
