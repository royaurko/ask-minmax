We present algorithms for computing ranks and order statistics in the Farey
sequence, taking time O (n^{2/3}). This improves on the recent algorithms of
Pawlewicz [European Symp. Alg. 2007], running in time O (n^{3/4}). We also
initiate the study of a more general algorithmic problem: counting primitive
lattice points in planar shapes.
