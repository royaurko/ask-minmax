In this note, we establish some connection between the nonnegative inverse
eigenvalue problem and that of doubly stochastic one. More precisely, we prove
that if $(r; {\lambda}_2, ..., {\lambda}_n)$ is the spectrum of an $n\times n$
nonnegative matrix A with Perron eigenvalue r, then there exists a least real
number $k_A\geq -r$ such that $(r+\epsilon; {\lambda}_2, ..., {\lambda}_n)$ is
the spectrum of an $n\times n$ nonnegative generalized doubly stochastic matrix
for all $\epsilon\geq k_A.$ As a consequence, any solutions for the nonnegative
inverse eigenvalue problem will yield solutions to the doubly stochastic
inverse eigenvalue problem. In addition, we give a new sufficient condition for
a stochastic matrix A to be cospectral to a doubly stochastic matrix B and in
this case B is shown to be the unique closest doubly stochastic matrix to A
with respect to the Frobenius norm. Some related results are also discussed.
