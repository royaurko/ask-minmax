In contrast to the well-known solution of the two-body problem through the
use of the concept of reduced mass, a solution is proposed involving separation
of potentials. It is shown that each of the two point bodies moves in its own
stationary potential well generated by the other body, and the magnitudes of
these potentials are calculated. It is shown also that for each body separately
the energy and the angular momentum laws are valid. The knowledge of the
potentials in which the bodies are moving permits calculation of the
trajectories of each body without resorting to the reduced mass.
  Key words: mechanics, two-body problem, gravitational potential, virial
