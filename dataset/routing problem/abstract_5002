The 3-domatic number problem asks whether a given graph can be partitioned
intothree dominating sets. We prove that this problem can be solved by a
deterministic algorithm in time 2.695^n (up to polynomial factors). This result
improves the previous bound of 2.8805^n, which is due to Fomin, Grandoni,
Pyatkin, and Stepanov. To prove our result, we combine an algorithm by Fomin et
al. with Yamamoto's algorithm for the satisfiability problem. In addition, we
show that the 3-domatic number problem can be solved for graphs G with bounded
maximum degree Delta(G) by a randomized algorithm, whose running time is better
than the previous bound due to Riege and Rothe whenever Delta(G) >= 5. Our new
randomized algorithm employs Schoening's approach to constraint satisfaction
problems.
