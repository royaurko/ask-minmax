For the three-body problem, we consider the Lagrange stability. To analyze
the stability, along with integrals of energy and angular momentum, we use
relations by the contributor from Sosnitskii (2005), which band together separately
squared mutual distances between bodies (mass points) and squared mutual
distances from bodies to the barycenter of the system. In this case, we prove
the Lagrange stability theorem, which allows us to define more exactly the
character of hyperbolic-elliptic and parabolic-elliptic final evolutions
