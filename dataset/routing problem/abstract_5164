The Whitehead minimization problem consists in finding a minimum size element
in the automorphic orbit of a word, a cyclic word or a finitely generated
subgroup in a finite rank free group. We give the first fully polynomial
algorithm to solve this problem, that is, an algorithm that is polynomial both
in the length of the input word and in the rank of the free group. Earlier
algorithms had an exponential dependency in the rank of the free group. It
follows that the primitivity problem -- to decide whether a word is an element
of some basis of the free group -- and the free factor problem can also be
solved in polynomial time.
