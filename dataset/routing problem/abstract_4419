This paper explores an idealized dynamic population sizing strategy for
solving additive decomposable problems of uniform scale. The method is designed
on top of the foundations of existing population sizing theory for this class
of problems, and is carefully compared with an optimal fixed population sized
genetic algorithm. The resulting strategy should be close to a lower bound in
terms of what can be achieved, performance-wise, by self-adjusting population
sizing algorithms for this class of problems.
