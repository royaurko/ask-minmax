Real-time prediction of signals is a task often encountered in control
problems as well as by living systems. Here a model-free prediction approach
based on the coupling of a linear relaxation system to a smooth signal is
described. The resulting anticipatory relaxation dynamics (ARD) is attracted to
a manifold on which its states assume future signal values. ARD not only
approximately predicts signals on average but can anticipate the occurrence of
signal peaks, too. This can be explained by recognizing ARD as an input/output
system with negative group delay, with possible applications in control
problems, metamaterials, or the neurosciences.
