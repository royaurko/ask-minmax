The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is plagued by two major
fine-tuning problems: the mu-problem and the proton decay problem. We present a
simultaneous solution to both problems within the framework of a U(1)'-extended
MSSM (UMSSM), without requiring R-parity conservation. We identify several
classes of phenomenologically viable models and provide specific examples of
U(1)' charge assignments. Our models generically contain either lepton number
violating or baryon number violating renormalizable interactions, whose
coexistence is nevertheless automatically forbidden by the new U(1)' gauge
symmetry. The U(1)' symmetry also prohibits the potentially dangerous and often
ignored higher-dimensional proton decay operators such as QQQL and UUDE which
are still allowed by R-parity. Thus, under minimal assumptions, we show that
once the mu-problem is solved, the proton is sufficiently stable, even in the
presence of a minimum set of exotics fields, as required for anomaly
cancellation. Our models provide impetus for pursuing the collider
phenomenology of R-parity violation within the UMSSM framework.
