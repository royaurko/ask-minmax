Three-body Faddeev equations are considered as a spectral problem for
nonsymmetrical matrix operator. Invariant subspaces related to physical and
spurious solutions to Faddeev equations and its adjoint are described.
Respective eigenvectors corresponding to invariant subspaces are constructed
for Faddeev operator and its adjoint. Extensions of the formalism on CCA
equations are discussed.
