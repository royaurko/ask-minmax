Parabolic equations with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions on the boundary are
studied in a setting where the solutions are required to have a prescribed
change of the profile in fixed time, instead of a Cauchy condition. It is shown
that this problem is well-posed in L_2-setting. Existence and regularity
results are established, as well as an analog of the maximum principle.
