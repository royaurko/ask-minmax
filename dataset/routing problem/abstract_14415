We present here necessary and sufficient conditions for the invertibility of
circulant and symmetric matrices that depend on three parameters and moreover,
we explicitly compute the inverse. The techniques we use are related with the
solution of boundary value problems associated to second order linear
difffference equations. Consequently, we reduce the computational cost of the
problem. In particular, we recover the inverses of some well known circulant
matrices whose coeffifficients are arithmetic or geometric sequences, Horadam
numbers among others. We also characterize when a general symmetric circulant
and tridiagonal matrix is invertible and in this case, we compute explicitly
its inverse.
