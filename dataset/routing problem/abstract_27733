Matching people across multiple camera views known as person
re-identification, is a challenging problem due to the change in visual
appearance caused by varying lighting conditions. The perceived color of the
subject appears to be different with respect to illumination. Previous works
use color as it is or address these challenges by designing color spaces
focusing on a specific cue. In this paper, we propose a data driven approach
for learning color patterns from pixels sampled from images across two camera
views. The intuition behind this work is that, even though pixel values of same
color would be different across views, they should be encoded with the same
values. We model color feature generation as a learning problem by jointly
learning a linear transformation and a dictionary to encode pixel values. We
also analyze different photometric invariant color spaces. Using color as the
only cue, we compare our approach with all the photometric invariant color
spaces and show superior performance over all of them. Combining with other
learned low-level and high-level features, we obtain promising results in
ViPER, Person Re-ID 2011 and CAVIAR4REID datasets.
