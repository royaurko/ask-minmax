We consider an impulse control problem in infinite horizon. To solve this
problem, we extend to the infinite horizon case results of double barrier
reflected backward stochastic differential equations. The properties of the
Snell envelope can reduce our problem to show the existence of a pair of
measurable continuous processes.
