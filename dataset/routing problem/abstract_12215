We provide a sufficient condition for the existence of a positive solution to
$-\Delta u+V(|x|) u=u^p$ in $B_1$, when p is large enough. Here $B_1$ is the
unit ball of $R^n$, n greater or equal to 2, and we deal both with Neumann and
Dirichlet homogeneous boundary conditions. The solution turns to be a
constrained minimum of the associated energy functional. As an application we
show that, in case $V(|x|)$ is smooth, nonnegative and not identically zero,
and p is sufficiently large, the Neumann problem always admits a solution.
