In this paper, we propose a crowdsourcing based framework for myopic target
tracking by designing an incentive-compatible mechanism based optimal auction
in a wireless sensor network (WSN) containing sensors that are selfish and
profit-motivated. For typical WSNs which have limited bandwidth, the fusion
center (FC) has to distribute the total number of bits that can be transmitted
from the sensors to the FC among the sensors. To accomplish the task, the FC
conducts an auction by soliciting bids from the selfish sensors, which reflect
how much they value their energy cost. Furthermore, the rationality and
truthfulness of the sensors are guaranteed in our model. The final problem is
formulated as a multiple-choice knapsack problem (MCKP), which is solved by the
dynamic programming method in pseudo-polynomial time. Simulation results show
the effectiveness of our proposed approach in terms of both the tracking
performance and lifetime of the sensor network.
