Recently the theory of widths of Kolmogorov-Gelfand has received a great deal
of interest due to its close relationship with the newly born area of
Compressed Sensing. It has been realized that widths reflect properly the
sparsity of the data in Signal Processing. However fundamental problems of the
theory of widths in multidimensional Theory of Functions remain untouched, as
well as analogous problems in the theory of multidimensional Signal Analysis.
In the present paper we provide a multidimensional generalization of the
original result of Kolmogorov by introducing a new hierarchy of
infinite-dimensional spaces based on solutions of higher order elliptic
equation.
