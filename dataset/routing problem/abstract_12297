In the present work, torsion energy is defined. Its law of conservation is
given. It is shown that this type of energy gives rise to a repulsive force
which can be used to interpret supernovae type Ia observations, and
consequently the accelerating expansion of the Universe. This interpretation is
a pure geometric one and is a direct application of the geometrization
philosophy. Torsion energy can also be used to solve other problems of General
Relativity especially the singularity problem.
