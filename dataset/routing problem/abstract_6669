The Cauchy problem for the Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann equations (VMB) is
considered. First the renormalized solution to the Vlasov equation with the
Lorentz force is discussed and the difficulty on the partial differentiability
of the coefficients is overcome. Then the weak stability of the renormalized
solutions to the Cauchy problem of VMB is established using the compactness of
velocity averages and a renormalized formulation. Furthermore, the large time
behavior of the renormalized solutions to VMB is studied and it is proved that
the density of particles tends to a local Maxwellian as the time goes to
infinity.
