We determine the complexity of several constraint satisfaction problems using
the heuristic algorithm, WalkSAT. At large sizes N, the complexity increases
exponentially with N in all cases. Perhaps surprisingly, out of all the models
studied, the hardest for WalkSAT is the one for which there is a polynomial
time algorithm.
