We consider the Work Function Algorithm for the k-server problem. We show
that if the Work Function Algorithm is c-competitive, then it is also strictly
(2c)-competitive. As a consequence of [Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou, JACM
1995] this also shows that the Work Function Algorithm is strictly
(4k-2)-competitive.
