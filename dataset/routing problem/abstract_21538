The perfectly matched layers (PMLs), as a boundary termination over an
unbounded spatial domain, are widely used in numerical simulations of wave
propagation problems. Given a set of discretization parameters, a procedure to
select the PML profiles based on minimizing the discrete reflectivity is
established for frequency domain simulations. We, by extending the function
class and adopting a direct search method, improve the former procedure for
traveling waves.
