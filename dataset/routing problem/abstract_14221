We solve an open problem concerning syntactic complexity: We prove that the
cardinality of the syntactic semigroup of a suffix-free language with $n$ left
quotients (that is, with state complexity $n$) is at most $(n-1)^{n-2}+n-2$ for
$n\ge 7$. Since this bound is known to be reachable, this settles the problem.
We also reduce the alphabet of the witness languages reaching this bound to
five letters instead of $n+2$, and show that it cannot be any smaller. Finally,
we prove that the transition semigroup of a minimal deterministic automaton
accepting such a witness language is unique for each $n\ge 7$.
