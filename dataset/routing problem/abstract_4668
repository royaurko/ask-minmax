The purpose of this paper is to report on recent approaches to reconstruction
problems based on analog, or in other words, infinite-dimensional, image and
signal models. We describe three main contributions to this problem. First,
linear reconstructions from sampled measurements via so-called generalized
sampling (GS). Second, the extension of generalized sampling to inverse and
ill-posed problems. And third, the combination of generalized sampling with
sparse recovery techniques. This final contribution leads to a theory and set
of methods for infinite-dimensional compressed sensing, or as we shall also
refer to it, compressed sensing over the continuum.
