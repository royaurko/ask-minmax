The Green-function formalism for the electromagnetic field in a
magnetoelectric (ME) medium is constructed, as a generalization of conventional
Casimir theory. Zero temperature is assumed. It is shown how the formalism
predicts electromagnetic momentum to be extracted from the vacuum field, just
analogous to how energy is extracted in the Casimir case. The possibility of
extracting momentum from vacuum was discussed recently by Feigel [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 92, 020404 (2004)]. By contrast to Feigel's approach, we assume that the
ME coupling occurs naturally, and is not produced by external strong fields. We
also find the same effect qualitatively via another route, by considering one
single electromagnetic mode.
