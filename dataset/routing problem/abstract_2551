All samples are synthesized through standard solid state reaction route and
are quenched to room temperature systematically at 7000C, 5000C, 3000C and room
temperature (RT); named as 700Q, 500Q, 300Q and RTQ respectively. The
structural and magnetic properties are studied. Careful Reitveld analysis of
XRD patterns revealed that though all samples except 700Q are crystallized in
single phase with space group P4/nmm, the presence of interstitial Fe (Feint)
at 2c site is increased from 5% for RTQ to 8% for 500Q. The 700Q sample is
crystallized in Fe7Se8 phase. The transport and magnetization results revealed
that though RTQ and 300Q are superconducting at 10 K and 13 K respectively,
while the 500Q and 700Q are not. Magnetic ordering (Tmag) is observed at around
125 K for all the samples. The prominence of Tmag in terms of effective moment
is sufficiently higher for 500Q and 700Q than RTQ and 300Q. Summarily it is
found that quenching induced disorder affects the occupancy of interstitial Fe
in FeTe1/2Se1/2 and thus both its superconducting and magnetic properties.
Further it clear that limited presence of interstitial Fe at 2c site is not
fully against observation of superconductivity, because 300Q sample possesses
higher Tc (13 K) for higher Feint (6%) than RTQ sample with relatively lower Tc
(10 K) having lower Feint (5%). Further the 500Q sample with much higher Feint
(8%) is though non-superconducting.
