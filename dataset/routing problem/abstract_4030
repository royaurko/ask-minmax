This work considers the allocation problem for multivariate stratified random
sampling as a problem of integer non-linear stochastic multiobjective
mathematical programming. With this goal in mind the asymptotic distribution of
the vector of sample variances is studied. Two alternative approaches are
suggested for solving the allocation problem for multivariate stratified random
sampling. An example is presented by applying the different proposed
techniques.
