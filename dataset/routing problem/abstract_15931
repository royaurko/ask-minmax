Variational principles for field theories where variations of fields are
restricted along a parametrization are considered. In particular, gauge-natural
parametrized variational problems are defined as those in which both the
Lagrangian and the parametrization are gauge covariant and some further
conditions is satisfied in order to formulate a N\"other theorem that links
horizontal and gauge symmetries to the relative conservation laws (generalizing
what Fern{\'a}ndez, Garc{\'{\i}}a and Rodrigo did in some recent papers). The
case of vakonomic constraints in field theory is also studied within the
framework of parametrized variational problems, defining and comparing two
different concepts of criticality of a section, one arising directly from the
vakonomic schema, the other making use of an adapted parametrization. The
general theory is then applied to the case of hydrodynamics of a charged fluid
coupled with its gravitational and electromagnetic field. A variational
formulation including conserved currents and superpotentials is given that
turns out to be computationally much easier than the standard one.
