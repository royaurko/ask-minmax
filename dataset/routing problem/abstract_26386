We generalize the Landau levels of two-dimensional Dirac fermions to three
dimensions and above with the full rotational symmetry. Similarly to the
two-dimensional case, there exists a branch of zero energy Landau levels of
fractional fermion modes for the massless Dirac fermions. The spectra of other
Landau levels distribute symmetrically with respect to the zero energy scaling
with the square root of the Landau-level indices. This mechanism is a
nonminimal coupling of Dirac fermions to the background fields. This high
dimensional relativistic Landau-level problem is a square-root problem of its
previous studied nonrelativistic version investigated in Li and Wu
[arXiv:1103.5422 (2011)].
