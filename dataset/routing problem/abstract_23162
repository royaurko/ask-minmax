We argue that, when coupled to Einstein's theory of gravity, the Yukawa
theory may solve the cosmological constant problem in the following sense: The
radiative corrections of fermions generate an effective potential for the
scalar field, such that the effective cosmological term Lambda_eff is
dynamically driven to zero. Thence, for any initial positive cosmological
constant Lambda_0, Lambda_eff = 0 is an attractor of the semiclassical Einstein
theory coupled to fermionic and scalar matter fields. When the initial
cosmological term is negative, Lambda_eff=Lambda_0 does not change. Next we
argue that the dark energy of the Universe may be explained by a GUT scale
fermion with a mass, m = 4.3 * 10^15 (Lambda_0/10^13GeV)^(1/2) GeV.
 Finally, we comment on how the inflationary paradigm, BEH mechanism and phase
transitions in the early Universe get modified in the light of our findings.
