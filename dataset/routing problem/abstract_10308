This paper is concerned with the inflow problem for the one-dimensional
compressible Navier-Stokes equations. For such a problem, F. M. Huang, A.
Matsumura and X. D. Shi showed that there exists viscous shock wave solution to
the inflow problem and both the boundary layer solution, the viscous shock
wave, and their superposition are time-asymptotically nonlinear stable under
small initial perturbation. The main purpose of this paper is to show that
similar stability results still hold for a class of large initial perturbation
which can allow the initial density to have large oscillations. The proofs are
given by an elementary energy method and the key point is to deduce the desired
uniform positive lower and upper bounds on the density.
