Unary operator domains -- i.e., domains in which operators have a single
effect -- arise naturally in many control problems. In its most general form,
the problem of STRIPS planning in unary operator domains is known to be as hard
as the general STRIPS planning problem -- both are PSPACE-complete. However,
unary operator domains induce a natural structure, called the domain's causal
graph. This graph relates between the preconditions and effect of each domain
operator. Causal graphs were exploited by Williams and Nayak in order to
analyze plan generation for one of the controllers in NASA's Deep-Space One
spacecraft. There, they utilized the fact that when this graph is acyclic, a
serialization ordering over any subgoal can be obtained quickly. In this paper
we conduct a comprehensive study of the relationship between the structure of a
domain's causal graph and the complexity of planning in this domain. On the
positive side, we show that a non-trivial polynomial time plan generation
algorithm exists for domains whose causal graph induces a polytree with a
constant bound on its node indegree. On the negative side, we show that even
plan existence is hard when the graph is a directed-path singly connected DAG.
More generally, we show that the number of paths in the causal graph is closely
related to the complexity of planning in the associated domain. Finally we
relate our results to the question of complexity of planning with serializable
subgoals.
