We consider the problem of sampling from the uniform distribution on the set
of Eulerian orientations of subgraphs of the triangular lattice. Although it is
known that this can be achieved in polynomial time for any graph, the algorithm
studied here is more natural in the context of planar Eulerian graphs. We
analyse the mixing time of a Markov chain on the Eulerian orientations of a
planar graph which moves between orientations by reversing the edges of
directed faces. Using path coupling and the comparison method we obtain a
polynomial upper bound on the mixing time of this chain for any solid subgraph
of the triangular lattice. By considering the conductance of the chain we show
that there exist subgraphs with holes for which the chain will always take an
exponential amount of time to converge. Finally, as an additional justification
for studying a Markov chain on the set of Eulerian orientations of planar
graphs, we show that the problem of counting Eulerian orientations remains
#P-complete when restricted to planar graphs.
