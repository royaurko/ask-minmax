We consider second-order elliptic equations in a half space with leading
coefficients measurable in a tangential direction. We prove the
$W^2_p$-estimate and solvability for the Dirichlet problem when $p\in (1,2]$,
and for the Neumann problem when $p\in [2,\infty)$. We then extend these
results to equations with more general coefficients, which are measurable in a
tangential direction and have small mean oscillations in the other directions.
As an application, we obtain the $W^2_p$-solvability of elliptic equations in
convex wedge domains or in convex polygonal domains with discontinuous
coefficients.
