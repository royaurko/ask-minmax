In the space of holomorphic functions in a convex domain it is studied the
interpolation problem by means of sums of the series of exponentials converging
uniformly on all compact sets of the domain. The discrete set of the
interpolation nodes with multiplicities is located on the real axis in the
domain and it has the only finite limit point. It is obtained a criterion for
solvability of the problem in the terms of distribution of limit directions of
exponents of exponentials at infinity.
