In this paper, a new stabilized discontinuous Galerkin method within a new
function space setting is introduced, which involves an extra stabilization
term on the normal fluxes across the element interfaces. It is different from
the general DG methods. The formulation satisfies a local conservation property
and we prove well posedness of the new formulation by Inf-Sup condition. A
priori error estimates are derived, which are verified by a 2D experiment on a
reaction-diffusion type model problem.
