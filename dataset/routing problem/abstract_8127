In [4], Kuroda generalized Roberts' counterexample \cite{Roberts} to the
fourteenth problem of Hilbert. The counterexample is given as the kernel of a
locally nilpotent derivation on a polynomial ring. We replace his construction
of the invariant elements by a more straightforward construction and give a
more precise form of invariant elements.
