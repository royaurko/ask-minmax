This paper is devoted to the investigation of propagation of singularities in
hyperbolic equations with non-smooth oefficients, using the Colombeau theory of
generalized functions. As a model problem, we study the Cauchy problem for the
one-dimensional wave equation with a discontinuous coefficient depending on
time. After demonstrating the existence and uniqueness of generalized solutions
in the sense of Colombeau to the problem, we investigate the phenomenon of
propagation of singularities, arising from delta function initial data, for the
case of a piecewise constant coefficient. We also provide an analysis of the
interplay between singularity strength and propagation effects. Finally, we
show that in case the initial data are distributions, the Colombeau solution to
the model problem is associated with the piecewise distributional solution of
the corresponding transmission problem.
