Space gravitational wave detectors employing laser interferometry between
free-flying spacecraft differ in many ways from their laboratory counterparts.
Among these differences is the fact that, in space, the end-masses will be
moving relative to each other. This creates a problem by inducing a Doppler
shift between the incoming and outgoing frequencies. The resulting beat
frequency is so high that its phase cannot be read to sufficient accuracy when
referenced to state-of-the-art space-qualified clocks. This is the problem that
is addressed in this paper. We introduce a set of time-domain algorithms in
which the effects of clock jitter are exactly canceled. The method employs the
two-color laser approach that has been previously proposed, but avoids the
singularities that arise in the previous frequency-domain algorithms. In
addition, several practical aspects of the laser and clock noise cancellation
schemes are addressed.
