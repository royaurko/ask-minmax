The problem of integrable discretization of Liouville type hyperbolic PDE is
studied. The method of discretization preserving characteristic integrals is
adopted to nonautonomous case. An intriguing relation between Darboux
integrable differential-difference equations and the Guldberg-Vessiot-Lie
problem of describing all ODE, possessing fundamental solution systems is
observed.
