Let PCS_p^N denote a set of p binary sequences of length N such that the sum
of their periodic auto-correlation functions is a delta-function. In the 1990,
Boemer and Antweiler addressed the problem of constructing such sequences. They
presented a table covering the range p <= 12, N <= 50 and showing in which
cases it was known at that time whether such sequences exist, do not exist, or
the question of existence is undecided. The number of undecided cases was
rather large.
  Subsequently the number of undecided cases was reduced to 26 by the contributor.
In the present note, several cyclic difference families are constructed and
used to obtain new sets of periodic binary sequences. Thereby the original
problem of Boemer and Antweiler is completely solved.
