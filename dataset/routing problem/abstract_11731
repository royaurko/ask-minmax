The Schroedinger equation on the half line is considered with a real-valued,
integrable potential having a finite first moment. It is shown that the
potential and the boundary conditions are uniquely determined by the data
containing the discrete eigenvalues for a boundary condition at the origin, the
continuous part of the spectral measure for that boundary condition, and a
subset of the discrete eigenvalues for a different boundary condition. This
result extends the celebrated two-spectrum uniqueness theorem of Borg and
Marchenko to the case where there is also a continuous spectrum
