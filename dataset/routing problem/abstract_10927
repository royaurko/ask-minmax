In this work we study in detail the NeVII 2s3p-2s3s singlet line, which was
also the object of a recent experiment. The standard perturbative impact theory
predictions are tested against a fully non-perturbative semiclassical impact
calculation, taking into account dipole and quadrupole interactions.
Potentially very significant problems with the standard perturbative theory are
encountered and discussed and a simple remedy is proposed.
