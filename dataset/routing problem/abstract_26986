A new tur\'an-type problem on distances on graphs was introduced by Tyomkyn
and Uzzell. In this paper, we focus on the case that the distance is two. We
primely show that for any value of $n$, a graph on $n$ vertices without three
vertices pairwise at distance $2$, if it has a vertex $v \in V(G)$, whose
neighbours are covered by at most two cliques, then it has at most $(n^2 - 1)/4
+ 1$ pairs of vertices at distance $2$. This partially answers a guess of
Tyomkyn and Uzzell [Tyomkyn, M., Uzzell, A.J.: A new Tur\'an-Type promble on
distaces of graphs. Graphs Combin. {\bf 29}(6), 1927--1942 (2012)].
