We present the numerical solution of the renormalization group (RG) equations
derived in Ref. [1], for the problem of superconductivity in the presence of
both electron-electron and electron-phonon coupling at zero temperature. We
study the instability of a Fermi liquid to a superconductor and the RG flow of
the couplings in presence of retardation effects and the crossover from weak to
strong coupling. We show that our numerical results provide an ansatz for the
analytic solution of the problem in the asymptotic limits of weak and strong
coupling.
