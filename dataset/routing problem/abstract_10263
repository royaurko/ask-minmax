We investigate the stabilizing effects of the magnetic fields in the
linearized magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) problem of a nonhomogeneous
incompressible viscous magnetohydrodynamic fluid of zero resistivity in the
presence of a uniform gravitational field in a three-dimensional bounded
domain, in which the velocity of the fluid is non-slip on the boundary. By
adapting a modified variational method and careful deriving \emph{a priori}
estimates, we establish a criterion for the instability/stability of the
linearized problem around a magnetic RT equilibrium state. In the criterion, we
find a new phenomenon that a sufficiently strong horizontal magnetic field has
the same stabilizing effect as that of the vertical magnetic field on growth of
the magnetic RT instability. In addition, we further study the corresponding
compressible case, i.e., the Parker (or magnetic buoyancy) problem, for which
the strength of a horizontal magnetic field decreases with height, and also
show the stabilizing effect of a sufficiently large magnetic field.
