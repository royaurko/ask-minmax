Inspired by the problem of elastic wave scattering on wrinkled interfaces, we
studied the scattering of ballistic electrons on a wrinkled potential energy
region. The electron transmission coefficient depends on both wrinkle amplitude
and periodicity, having different behaviors for positive and negative
scattering potential energies. For scattering on potential barriers, minibands
appear in electron transmission, as in superlattices, whereas for scattering on
periodic potential wells the transmission coefficient has a more complex form.
Besides suggesting that tuning of electron transmission is possible by
modifying the scattering potential via voltages on wrinkled gate electrodes,
our results emphasize the analogies between ballistic electrons and elastic
waves even in scattering problems on non-typical configurations.
