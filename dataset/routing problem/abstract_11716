The factorisation method for Schr\"odinger operators with magnetic fields on
a two-dimensional surface $M^2$ with non-trivial metric is investigated. This
leads to the new integrable examples of such operators and brings a new look at
some classical problems such as Dirac magnetic monopole and Landau problem. The
global geometric aspects and related spectral properties of the operators from
the factorisation chains are discussed in details. We also consider the Laplace
transformations on a curved surface and extend the class of Schr\"odinger
operators with two integrable levels introduced in the flat case by S.P.Novikov
and one of the contributors.
