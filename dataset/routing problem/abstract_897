Wireless sensor networks sense and monitor real-time events. They supervise a
geographic area where a phenomenon is to be monitored. The data in sensor
networks have different levels of priority and hence their criticality differs.
In order to keep up the real time commitment, the applications need higher
transmission rates and reliability in information delivery. In this work we
propose a multipath routing algorithm which enables the reliable delivery of
data. By controlling the scheduling rate, it is possible to prevent congestion
and packet loss in the network. The algorithm provides an efficient way to
prevent the packet loss at each node. This results in congestion management in
the sensor networks. This protocol prevents packet clustering and provides
smoothness to the traffic. Through monitoring and controlling the scheduling
rate the flow control and congestion control are managed.
