We consider the spectral theory for discrete Schr\"odinger operators on the
hexagonal lattice and their inverse scattering problem. We give a procedure for
reconstructing the compactly supported potential from the scattering matrix for
all energies. The same procedure is applicable for the inverse scattering
problem on the triangle lattice.
