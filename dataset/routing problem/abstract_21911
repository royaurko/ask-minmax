A $k$-isogeny class of abelian varieties over a finite field $k$ is uniquely
determined by the Weil polynomial $f$ of any variety from this class. When we
consider classification problems concerning abelian varieties inside an isogeny
class, the classification can be given in terms of the corresponding Weil
polynomial. In this paper we improve our previous results on classification of
groups of points on abelian varieties over finite fields.
