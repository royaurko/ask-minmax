In the plane, we consider the problem of reconstructing a domain from the
normal derivative of its Green's function (with fixed pole) relative to the
Dirichlet problem for the Laplace operator. By means of the theory of conformal
mappings, we derive stability estimates of polynomial type in Holder norms.
