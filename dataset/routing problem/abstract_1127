We report on the transport properties of novel carbon nanostructures made of
partially unzipped carbon nanotubes, which can be regarded as a seamless
junction of a tube and a nanoribbon. We find that graphene nanoribbons act at
certain energy ranges as a perfect valley filters for carbon nanotubes, with
the maximum possible conductance. Our results show that a partially unzipped
carbon nanotube is a magnetoresistive device, with a very large value of the
magnetoresistance. We explore the properties of several structures combining
nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons, demonstrating that they behave as optimal
contacts for each other, and opening a new route for the design of mixed
graphene/nanotube devices.
