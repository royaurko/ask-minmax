In a previous paper (q-alg/9501022) we suggested some algorithms that could
be useful in solving the problem of knot classification. Here we continue this
discussion by answering questions raised in that paper and by commenting on
practical aspects related to running these algorithms as computer programs.
Further on, we reach a solution by improving on the efficiency of these
algorithms, and by introducing new ones.
