In this paper, the weak convergence of additive functionals of processes with
locally independent increments and with Markov switching in the scheme of
Poisson approximation is proved. For the relative compactness, a method
proposed by R. Liptser for semimartingales is used with a modification, where
we apply a solution of a singular perturbation problem instead of an ergodic
theorem.
