We show that, when handled properly, the Cauchy principal value integral
$\cpint_{a}^{b}f(x)(x-\tau)^{-1} dx\,\,\,(a < \tau < b)$ can be computed very
easily and accurately using any reliable adaptive quadrature. We give detailed
estimations of the roundoff errors in the case the function $f$ has bounded
first derivative in the interval $[a,b]$.
