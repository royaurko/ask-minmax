This is essentially a survey paper in which we solve the global Cauchy
problem on causal manifolds for hyperbolic systems of linear partial
differential equations in the framework of hyperfunctions. Besides the
classical Cauchy-Kowalevsky theorem, our proofs only use tools from the
microlocal theory of sheaves, that is, tools of purely algebraic and geometric
nature.
