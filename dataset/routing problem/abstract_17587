We consider a broadcast communication system over parallel sub-channels where
the transmitter sends three messages: a common message to two users, and two
confidential messages to each user which need to be kept secret from the other
user. We assume partial channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT),
stemming from noisy channel estimation. The first contribution of this paper is
the characterization of the secrecy capacity region boundary as the solution of
weighted sum-rate problems, with suitable weights. Partial CSIT is addressed by
adding a margin to the estimated channel gains. The second paper contribution
is the solution of this problem in an almost closed-form, where only two single
real parameters must be optimized, e.g., through dichotomic searches. On the
one hand, the considered problem generalizes existing literature where only two
out of the three messages are transmitted. On the other hand, the solution
finds also practical applications into the resource allocation of orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems with both secrecy and fairness
constraints.
