Excitons in MoS2 dominate the absorption and emission properties of the
two-dimensional system. Here, we study the microscopic origin of the
electroluminescence from monolayer MoS2 fabricated on a heavily p-type doped
silicon substrate. By comparing the photoluminescence and electroluminescence
of a MoS2 diode, direct-exciton and bound-exciton related recombination
processes can be identified. Auger recombination of the exciton-exciton
annihilation of bound exciton emission is observed under a high electron-hole
pair injection rate at room temperature. We expect the direct exciton-exciton
annihilation lifetime to exceed the carrier lifetime, due to the absence of any
noticeable direct exciton saturation. We believe that our method of electrical
injection opens a new route to understand the microscopic nature of the exciton
recombination and facilitate the control of valley and spin excitation in MoS2.
