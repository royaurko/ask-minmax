An approximate groundstate of the Anderson-Friedel impurity problem is
presented in a very compact form. It requires solely the optimization of two
localized electron states and consists of four Slater states (Slater
determinants). The resulting singlet ground state energy lies far below the
Anderson mean field solution and agrees well with the numerical results by
Gunnarsson and Schoenhammer, who used an extensive 1/N_{f}-expansion for a spin
1/2 impurity with double occupancy of the impurity level.
