Recent progress of the complex Langevin method and the Lefschetz thimble in
connection with the sign problem is reviewed. These methods rely on the
complexification of the original field manifold and they allow direct
simulations of theories with non-real measures. Similarities and differences of
the two approaches are pointed out. Results using the complex Langevin method,
which allows simulations to evade the sign problem in full QCD, are presented.
Promising results of the thimble approach for non-gauge theories are also
discussed.
