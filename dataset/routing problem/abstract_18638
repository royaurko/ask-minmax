(abridged) Predictions of the Concordance Cosmological Model (CCM) of the
structures in the environment of large spiral galaxies are compared with
observed properties of Local Group galaxies. Five new most probably
irreconcilable problems are uncovered. However, the Local Group properties
provide hints that may lead to a solution of the above problems The DoS and
bulge--satellite correlation suggest that dissipational events forming bulges
are related to the processes forming phase-space correlated satellite
populations. Such events are well known to occur since in galaxy encounters
energy and angular momentum are expelled in the form of tidal tails, which can
fragment to form populations of tidal-dwarf galaxies (TDGs) and associated star
clusters. If Local Group satellite galaxies are to be interpreted as TDGs then
the sub-structure predictions of CCM are internally in conflict. All findings
thus suggest that the CCM does not account for the Local Group observations and
that therefore existing as well as new viable alternatives have to be further
explored. These are discussed and natural solutions for the above problems
emerge.
