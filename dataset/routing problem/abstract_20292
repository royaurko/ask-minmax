We introduce a new class of graded rings extending the class of generalized
Weyl algebras. These rings are orders in crossed products of the most general
type, and we introduce their basic structure theory. We provide an extensive
list of examples, some completely new but also some considered earlier, and
highlight some specific structure results. Many new and interesting problems
about the crystalline graded rings may be identified.
