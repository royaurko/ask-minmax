As shown in [15], under some structural assumptions, working on congested
traffic problems in general and increasingly dense networks leads, at the limit
by {\Gamma}-convergence, to continuous minimization problems posed on measures
on generalized curves. Here, we show the equivalence with another problem that
is the variational formulation of an anisotropic, degenerate and elliptic PDE.
For particular cases, we prove a Sobolev regularity result for the minimizers
of the minimization problem despite the strong degeneracy and anisotropy of the
Euler-Lagrange equation of the dual. We extend the analysis of [6] to the
general case. Finally, we use the method presented in [5] to make numerical
simulations.
