This paper presents the differences between two NP problems. It focuses in
the Euclidian 2 Dimension Travelling Salesman Problems and General Assign
Problems. The main results are the triangle reduction to verify the solution in
polynomial time for the former and for the later the solution to the Noted
Conjecture of the NP-Class, NP is not P.
