We present here a survey of recent results concerning the mathematical
analysis of instabilities of the interface between two incompressible, non
viscous, fluids of constant density and vorticity concentrated on the
interface. This configuration includes the so-called Kelvin-Helmholtz (the two
densities are equal), Rayleigh-Taylor (two different, nonzero, densities) and
the water waves (one of the densities is zero) problems. After a brief review
of results concerning strong and weak solutions of the Euler equation, we
derive interface equations (such as the Birkhoff-Rott equation) that describe
the motion of the interface. A linear analysis allows us to exhibit the main
features of these equations (such as ellipticity properties); the consequences
for the full, non linear, equations are then described. In particular, the
solutions of the Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor problems are necessarily
analytic if they are above a certain threshold of regularity (a consequence is
the illposedness of the initial value problem in a non analytic framework). We
also say a few words on the phenomena that may occur below this regularity
threshold. Finally, special attention is given to the water waves problem,
which is much more stable than the Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor
configurations. Most of the results presented here are in 2d (the interface has
dimension one), but we give a brief description of similarities and differences
in the 3d case.
