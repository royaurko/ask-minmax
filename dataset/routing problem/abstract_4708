We obtain a generalized Neumann solution for the two-phase fractional
Lam\'{e}-Clapeyron-Stefan problem for a semi-infinite material with constant
boundary and initial conditions. In this problem, the two governing equations
and a governing condition for the free boundary include a fractional time
derivative in the Caputo sense of order $0<\al\leq 1$. When $ \al \nearrow $ 1
we recover the classical Neumann solution for the two-phase
Lam\'{e}-Clapeyron-Stefan problem given through the error function.
