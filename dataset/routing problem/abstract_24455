An approach is treated for numerical integration of ordinary differential
equations systems of the first order with choice of a computation scheme,
ensuring the required local precision. The treatment is made on the basis of
schemes of Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg type. Criteria are proposed as well as a method
for the realization of the choice of an 'optimum' scheme. The effectiveness of
the presented approach to problems in the field of satellite dynamics is
illustrated by results from a numerical experiment. These results refer to a
case when a satisfactory global stability of the solution for all treated cases
is available. The effectiveness has been evaluated as good, especially when
solving multi-variable problems in the sphere of simulation modelling.
