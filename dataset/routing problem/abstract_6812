Many real world problems can be defined as optimisation problems in which the
aim is to maximise an objective function. The quality of obtained solution is
directly linked to the pertinence of the used objective function. However,
designing such function, which has to translate the user needs, is usually
fastidious. In this paper, a method to help user objective functions designing
is proposed. Our approach, which is highly interactive, is based on man machine
dialogue and more particularly on the comparison of problem instance solutions
by the user. We propose an experiment in the domain of cartographic
generalisation that shows promising results.
