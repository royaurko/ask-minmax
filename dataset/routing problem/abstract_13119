In this paper we prove the existence of a solution to a nonlinear
Schr{\"o}dinger--Poisson eigenvalue problem in dimension less than $3$. Our
proof is based on a global approach to the determination of eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions which allows us to characterize the complete sequence of
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions at once, via a variational approach, and thus
differs from the usual and less general proofs developed for similar problems
in the literature. Our approach seems to be new for the determination of the
spectrum and eigenfunctions for compact and self-adjoint operators, even in a
finite dimensional setting.
