The theory of regular cost functions is a quantitative extension to the
classical notion of regularity. A cost function associates to each input a
non-negative integer value (or infinity), as opposed to languages which only
associate to each input the two values "inside" and "outside". This theory is a
continuation of the works on distance automata and similar models. These models
of automata have been successfully used for solving the star-height problem,
the finite power property, the finite substitution problem, the relative
inclusion star-height problem and the boundedness problem for monadic-second
order logic over words. Our notion of regularity can be -- as in the classical
theory of regular languages -- equivalently defined in terms of automata,
expressions, algebraic recognisability, and by a variant of the monadic
second-order logic. These equivalences are strict extensions of the
corresponding classical results. The present paper introduces the cost monadic
logic, the quantitative extension to the notion of monadic second-order logic
we use, and show that some problems of existence of bounds are decidable for
this logic. This is achieved by introducing the corresponding algebraic
formalism: stabilisation monoids.
