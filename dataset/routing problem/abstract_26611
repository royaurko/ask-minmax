Given an undirected graph $G$, the Minimum Sum Coloring problem (MSCP) is to
find a legal assignment of colors (represented by natural numbers) to each
vertex of $G$ such that the total sum of the colors assigned to the vertices is
minimized. This paper presents a memetic algorithm for MSCP based on a tabu
search procedure with two neighborhoods and a multi-parent crossover operator.
Experiments on a set of 77 well-known DIMACS and COLOR 2002-2004 benchmark
instances show that the proposed algorithm achieves highly competitive results
in comparison with five state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, the
proposed algorithm can improve the best known results for 17 instances. We also
provide upper bounds for 18 additional instances for the first time.
