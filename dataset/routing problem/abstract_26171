In applied mathematics generally and fluid dynamics in particular, the role
of complex variable methods is normally confined to two-dimensional motion and
the association of points with complex numbers via the assignment w = x+i y. In
this framework 2D potential flow can be treated through the use of holomorphic
functions and biharmonic flow through a simple, but superficially
non-holomorphic extension. This paper explains how to elevate the use of
complex methods to three dimensions, using Penrose's theory of twistors as
adapted to intrinsically 3D and non-relativistic problems by Hitchin. We first
summarize the equations of 3D steady viscous fluid flow in their basic
geometric form. We then explain the theory of twistors for 3D, resulting in
complex holomorphic representations of solutions to harmonic and biharmonic
problems. It is shown how this intrinsically holomorphic 3D approach reduces
naturally to the well-known 2D situations when there is translational or
rotational symmetry, and an example is given. We also show how the case of
small but finite Reynolds number can be integrated by complex variable
techniques in two dimensions, albeit under strong assumptions.
