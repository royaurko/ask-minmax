While studying the s-number of a particular set of SU-manifolds we noticed
that the calculation was simply computing a multinomial coefficient. We were,
at the time, interested in computing the greatest common divisor of these
s-numbers, and from that came this fun and interesting number theory problem.
In this short paper, I will give the answer to this problem, which gives the
greatest common divisor of certain multinomial coefficients.
