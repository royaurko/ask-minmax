The asymptotic behavior of second order self-adjoint elliptic Steklov
eigenvalue problems with periodic rapidly oscillating coefficients and with
indefinite (sign-changing) density function is investigated in periodically
perforated domains. We prove that the spectrum of this problem is discrete and
consists of two sequences, one tending to -{\infty} and another to +{\infty}.
The limiting behavior of positive and negative eigencouples depends crucially
on whether the average of the weight over the surface of the reference hole is
positive, negative or equal to zero. By means of the two-scale convergence
method, we investigate all three cases.
