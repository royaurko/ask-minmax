It has been observed that the famous Feigenbaum-Coullet-Tresser period
doubling universality has a counterpart for area-preserving maps of
$\field{R}^2$. A renormalization approach has been used in a computer-assisted
proof of existence of an area-preserving map with orbits of all binary periods
by J.-P. Eckmann, H. Koch and P. Wittwer (1982 and 1984). As it is the case
with all non-trivial universality problems in non-dissipative systems in
dimensions more than one, no analytic proof of this period doubling
universality exists to date.
  We argue that the period doubling renormalization fixed point for
area-preserving maps is almost one dimensional, in the sense that it is close
to the following Henon-like map: $$H^*(x,u)=(\phi(x)-u,x-\phi(\phi(x)-u)),$$
where $\phi$ solves $$\phi(x)={2 \over \lambda} \phi(\phi(\lambda x))-x.$$
  We then give a ``proof'' of existence of solutions of small analytic
perturbations of this one dimensional problem, and describe some of the
properties of this solution.
  The ``proof'' consists of an analytic argument for factorized inverse
branches of $\phi$ together with verification of several inequalities and
inclusions of subsets of $\field{C}$ numerically.
  Finally, we suggest an analytic approach to the full period doubling problem
for area-preserving maps based on its proximity to the one dimensional. In this
respect, the paper is an exploration of a possible analytic machinery for a
non-trivial renormalization problem in a conservative two-dimensional system.
