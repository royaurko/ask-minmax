We provide a sufficient condition for $P$-convexity for (singular) supports
for an open subset $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ in terms of the minimum principle
for the boundary distance of $X$. Contrary to the general case, this allows us
to prove for certain semi-elliptic differential operators $P(D)$, including the
heat operator, and for differential operators acting along a subspace and being
elliptic there, resp., that surjectivity of $P(D)$ on $\mathscr{D}'(X)$ implies
surjectivity of the augmented operator $P^+(D)$ on
$\mathscr{D}'(X\times\mathbb{R})$. Thus, we solve in the affirmative the
problem of parameter dependence for solutions of differential equations posed
by Bonet and Domanski for these classes of differential operators.
