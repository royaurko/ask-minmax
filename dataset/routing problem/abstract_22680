We study, via bosonization, the Landau fixed point for the problem of
interacting spinless fermions near the Fermi surface in dimensions higher than
one. We rederive the bosonic representation of the Fermi operator and use it to
find the general form of the fermion propagator for the Landau fixed point.
Using a generalized Bogoliubov transformation we diagonalize exactly the
bosonized hamiltonian for the fixed point and calculate the Fermion propagator
(and the quasiparticle residue) for isotropic interactions (independently of
their strength). We reexamine two well known problems in this context: the
screening of long range potentials and the Landau damping of gauge fields. We
also discuss the origin of the Luttinger fixed point in one dimension in
contrast with the Landau fixed point in higher dimensions.
