The theory and application of numerical methods for unstructured meshes have
been improved significantly in recent years. Because the grids can be place
arbitrarily in space, unstructured meshes can provide much higher spatial
resolution than regular meshes. The built-in nature of mesh adaptivity for
unstructured meshes gives one way to simulate highly dynamic, hierarchical
problems involving both collisionless dark matter and collisional gas dynamics.
In this paper, we describe algorithms to construct unstructured meshes from a
set of points with periodic boundary conditions through Delaunay triangulation,
and algorithms to solve hydrodynamic and N-body problems on an unstructured
mesh . A combination of a local transformation algorithm and the traditional
Bowyer-Watson algorithm gives an efficient approach to perform Delaunay
triangulation. A novel algorithm to solve N-body equations of motion on an
unstructured mesh is described. Poisson's equation is solved using the
conjugate gradient method. A gas-kinetic scheme based on the BGK model to solve
Euler equations is used to evolve the hydrodynamic equations. We apply these
algorithms to solve cosmological settings, which involve both dark and baryonic
matter. Various cooling and heating processes for primordial baryonic matter
are included in the code. The numerical results show that the N-body and
hydrodynamic algorithms based on unstructured meshes with mesh refinement are
well-suited for hierarchical structure formation problems.
