Online feature selection with dynamic features has become an active research
area in recent years. However, in some real-world applications such as image
analysis and email spam filtering, features may arrive by groups. Existing
online feature selection methods evaluate features individually, while existing
group feature selection methods cannot handle online processing. Motivated by
this, we formulate the online group feature selection problem, and propose a
novel selection approach for this problem. Our proposed approach consists of
two stages: online intra-group selection and online inter-group selection. In
the intra-group selection, we use spectral analysis to select discriminative
features in each group when it arrives. In the inter-group selection, we use
Lasso to select a globally optimal subset of features. This 2-stage procedure
continues until there are no more features to come or some predefined stopping
conditions are met. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark and real-world
data sets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms other
state-of-the-art online feature selection methods.
