We explore the machine-minimizing job scheduling problem, which has a rich
history in the line of research, under an online setting. We consider systems
with arbitrary job arrival times, arbitrary job deadlines, and unit job
execution time. For this problem, we present a lower bound 2.09 on the
competitive factor of \emph{any} online algorithms, followed by designing a
5.2-competitive online algorithm. We also point out a false claim made in an
existing paper of Shi and Ye regarding a further restricted case of the
considered problem. To the best of our knowledge, what we present is the first
concrete result concerning online machine-minimizing job scheduling with
arbitrary job arrival times and deadlines.
