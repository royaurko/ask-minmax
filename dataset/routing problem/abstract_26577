Subdiffusive fractional equations are not structurally stable with respect to
spatial perturbations to the anomalous exponent (Phys. Rev. E 85, 031132
(2012)). The question arises of applicability of these fractional equations to
model real world phenomena. To rectify this problem we propose the inclusion of
the random death process into the random walk scheme from which we arrive at
the modified fractional master equation. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of
this equation, both analytically and by Monte Carlo simulation, and show that
this equation is structurally stable against spatial variations of anomalous
exponent. Additionally, in the continuous and long time limit we arrived at an
unusual advection-diffusion equation, where advection and diffusion
coefficients depend on both the death rate and anomalous exponent. We apply the
regularized fractional master equation to the problem of morphogen gradient
formation.
