We study the conjugacy problem in cyclic extensions of free groups. It is
shown that the conjugacy problem is solvable in split extensions of finitely
generated free groups by virtually inner automorphisms. An algorithm for
construction of the unique representative (the conjugacy normal form) for each
conjugacy class is given.
