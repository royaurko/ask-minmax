A fractional Stefan problem with a boundary convective condition is solved,
where the fractional derivative of order $ \alpha \in (0,1) $ is taken in the
Caputo sense. Then an equivalence with other two fractional Stefan problems
(the first one with a constant condition on $ x = 0 $ and the second with a
flux condition)is proved and the convergence to the classical solutions is
analyzed when $ \alpha \nearrow 1$ recovering the heat equation with its
respective Stefan condition.
