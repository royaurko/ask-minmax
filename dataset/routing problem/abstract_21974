Rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) are popular in motion planning because
they find solutions efficiently to single-query problems. Optimal RRTs (RRT*s)
extend RRTs to the problem of finding the optimal solution, but in doing so
asymptotically find the optimal path from the initial state to every state in
the planning domain. This behaviour is not only inefficient but also
inconsistent with their single-query nature.
  For problems seeking to minimize path length, the subset of states that can
improve a solution can be described by a prolate hyperspheroid. We show that
unless this subset is sampled directly, the probability of improving a solution
becomes arbitrarily small in large worlds or high state dimensions. In this
paper, we present an exact method to focus the search by directly sampling this
subset.
  The advantages of the presented sampling technique are demonstrated with a
new algorithm, Informed RRT*. This method retains the same probabilistic
guarantees on completeness and optimality as RRT* while improving the
convergence rate and final solution quality. We present the algorithm as a
simple modification to RRT* that could be further extended by more advanced
path-planning algorithms. We show experimentally that it outperforms RRT* in
rate of convergence, final solution cost, and ability to find difficult
passages while demonstrating less dependence on the state dimension and range
of the planning problem.
