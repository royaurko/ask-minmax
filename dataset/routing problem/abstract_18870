Background Protein domain ranking is a fundamental task in structural
biology. Most protein domain ranking methods rely on the pairwise comparison of
protein domains while neglecting the global manifold structure of the protein
domain database. Recently, graph regularized ranking that exploits the global
structure of the graph defined by the pairwise similarities has been proposed.
However, the existing graph regularized ranking methods are very sensitive to
the choice of the graph model and parameters, and this remains a difficult
problem for most of the protein domain ranking methods.
  Results To tackle this problem, we have developed the Multiple Graph
regularized Ranking algorithm, MultiG- Rank. Instead of using a single graph to
regularize the ranking scores, MultiG-Rank approximates the intrinsic manifold
of protein domain distribution by combining multiple initial graphs for the
regularization. Graph weights are learned with ranking scores jointly and
automatically, by alternately minimizing an ob- jective function in an
iterative algorithm. Experimental results on a subset of the ASTRAL SCOP
protein domain database demonstrate that MultiG-Rank achieves a better ranking
performance than single graph regularized ranking methods and pairwise
similarity based ranking methods.
  Conclusion The problem of graph model and parameter selection in graph
regularized protein domain ranking can be solved effectively by combining
multiple graphs. This aspect of generalization introduces a new frontier in
applying multiple graphs to solving protein domain ranking applications.
