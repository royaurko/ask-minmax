We study the problem of inviscid slightly compressible fluids in a bounded
domain. We find a unique solution to the initial-boundary value problem and
show that it is close to the analogous solution for an incompressible fluid.
Furthermore we find that solutions to the compressible motion problem in
Lagrangian coordinates depend differentiably on their initial data, an
unexpected result for non-linear equations. The results were announced by the
first contributor in Comm. Pure Appl. Math. Vol. XXXV, pp. 451-485.
