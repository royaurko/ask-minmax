We consider a model of individual clustering with two specific reproduction
rates and small diffusion parameter in one space dimension. It consists of a
drift-diffusion equation for the population density coupled to an elliptic
equation for the velocity of individuals. We prove the convergence (in suitable
topologies) of the solution of the problem to the unique solution of the limit
transport problem, as the diffusion coefficient tends to zero.
