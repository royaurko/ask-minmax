In this project, we first study the Gaussian-based hidden Markov random field
(HMRF) model and its expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Then we
generalize it to Gaussian mixture model-based hidden Markov random field. The
algorithm is implemented in MATLAB. We also apply this algorithm to color image
segmentation problems and 3D volume segmentation problems.
