The accelerated Kepler problem is obtained by adding a constant acceleration
to the classical two-body Kepler problem. This setting models the dynamics of a
jet-sustaining accretion disk and its content of forming planets as the disk
loses linear momentum through the asymmetric jet-counterjet system it powers.
The dynamics of the accelerated Kepler problem is analyzed using physical as
well as parabolic coordinates. The latter naturally separate the problem's
Hamiltonian into two unidimensional Hamiltonians. In particular, we identify
the origin of the secular resonance in the accelerated Kepler problem and
determine analytically the radius of stability boundary of initially circular
orbits that are of particular interest to the problem of radial migration in
binary systems as well as to the truncation of accretion disks through stellar
jet acceleration.
