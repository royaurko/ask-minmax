The formalism used in describing the thermodynamics of abrupt (or
first-order) phase transitions is reviewed as an application of maximum entropy
inference. In this treatment, we show that the concepts of transition
temperature, latent heat and entropy difference between phases will inevitably
have an equivalent in any problem of inferring the result of a yes/no question,
given information in the form of expectation values.
