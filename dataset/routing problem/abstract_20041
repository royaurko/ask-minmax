The known problem of fermion parity is considered on the base of
investigating possible linear single-valued representations of spinor coverings
of the extended Lorentz group. It is shown that in the frame of this theory
does not exist, as separate concepts, P-parity and T-parity for a fermion,
instead only some unified concept of (PT)-parity can be determined in a
group-theoretical language.
