First we give here a simple proof of a remarkable result of Videnskii and
Shirokov: let $B$ be a Blaschke product with $n$ zeros, then there exists an
outer function $\phi, \phi(0)=1$, such that $\|(B\phi)'\| \leq C n$, where $C$
is an absolute constant. Then we apply this result to a certain problem of
finding the asymptotic of orthogonal polynomials.
