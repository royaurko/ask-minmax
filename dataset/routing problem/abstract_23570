In the context of the Renormalization Group (RG) for gravity I discuss the
role of field rescalings and their relation to choices of units. I concentrate
on a simple Higgs model coupled to gravity, where natural choices of units can
be based on Newton's constant or on the Higgs mass. These quantities are not
invariant under the RG, and the ratio between the units is scale-dependent. In
the toy model, strong RG running occurs in the intermediate regime between the
Higgs and the Planck scale, reproducing the results of the Randall-Sundrum I
model. Possible connections with the problem of the mass hierarchy are pointed
out.
