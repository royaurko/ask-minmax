Due to Poinsot's theorem, the motion of a rigid body about a fixed point is
represented as rolling without slipping of the moving hodograph of the angular
velocity over the fixed one. If the moving hodograph is a closed curve,
visualization of motion is obtained by the method of P.V.Kharlamov. For an
arbitrary motion in an integrable problem with an axially symmetric force field
the moving hodograph densely fills some two-dimensional surface and the fixed
one fills a three-dimensional surface. In this paper, we consider the
irreducible integrable case in which both hodographs are two-frequency curves.
We obtain the equations of bearing surfaces, illustrate the main types of the
surfaces. We propose a method of the so-called non-straight geometric
interpretation representing the motion of a body as a superposition of two
periodic motions.
