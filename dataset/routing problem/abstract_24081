In this paper I study the dynamics of a two-level atom interacting with a
standing wave field. When the atom is subjected to a weak linear force, the
problem can be turned into a time dependent one, and the evolution is
understood from the band structure of the spectrum. The presence of level
crossings in the spectrum gives rise to Bloch oscillations of the atomic
motion. Here I investigate the effects of the atom-field detuning parameter. A
variety of different level crossings are obtained by changing the magnitude of
the detuning, and the behaviour of the atomic motion is strongly affected due
to this. I also consider the situation in which the detuning is oscillating in
time and its impact on the atomic motion. Wave packet simulations of the full
problem are treated numerically and the results are compared with analytical
solutions given by the standard Landau-Zener and the three-level Landau-Zener
models.
