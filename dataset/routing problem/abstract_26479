The use of real-time applications over the Internet is a challenging problem
that the QoS epoch attempted to solve by proposing the DiffServ architecture.
Today, the only existing service provided by the Internet is still best-effort.
As a result, multimedia applications often perform on top of a transport layer
that provides a variable sending rate. In an obvious manner, this variable
sending rate is an issue for these applications with strong delay constraint.
In a real-time context where retransmission can not be used to ensure
reliability, video quality suffers from any packet losses. In this position
paper, we discuss this problem and motivate why we want to bring out a certain
class of erasure coding scheme inside multimedia congestion control protocols
such as TFRC.
