The method of Morse theory is used to analyze the distributions of unit
charges interacting through a repulsive force and constrained to move on the
surface of a sphere -- the Thomson problem. We find that, due to topological
reasons, the system may organize itself in the form of pentagonal structures.
This gives a qualitative account for the interesting ``pentagonal buttons''
discovered in recent numerical work.
