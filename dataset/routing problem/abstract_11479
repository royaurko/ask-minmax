We investigated the elastic scattering problem with deformed Heisenberg
algebra leading to the existence of a minimal length. The continuity equations
for the moving particle in deformed space were constructed. We obtained the
Green's function for a free particle, scattering amplitude and cross-section in
deformed space. We also calculated the scattering amplitudes and differential
cross-sections for the Yukawa and the Coulomb potentials in the Born
approximation.
