We consider the inverse refractor and the inverse reflector problem. The task
is to design a free-form lens or a free-form mirror that, when illuminated by a
point light source, produces a given illumination pattern on a target. Both
problems can be modeled by strongly nonlinear second-order partial differential
equations of Monge-Amp\`ere type. In [Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci. 25
(2015), pp. 803--837, DOI: 10.1142/S0218202515500190] the contributors have proposed
a B-spline collocation method which has been applied to the inverse reflector
problem. Now this approach is extended to the inverse refractor problem. We
explain in depth the collocation method and how to handle boundary conditions
and constraints. The paper concludes with numerical results of refracting and
reflecting optical surfaces and their verification via ray tracing.
