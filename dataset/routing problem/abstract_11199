In this paper, we study the scattering problem of the scalar wave in the
traversable Lorentzian wormhole geometry. The potentials and Schr\"odinger-like
equations are found in cases of the static uncharged and the charged wormholes.
The differential scattering cross sections are determined by the phase shift of
the asymptotic wave function in low frequency limit. It is also found that the
cross section for charged wormhole is smaller than that for uncharged case by
the reduction of the throat size due to the charge effect.
