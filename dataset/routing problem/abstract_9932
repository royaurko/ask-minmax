The Euclidean TSP with neighborhoods (TSPN) is the following problem: Given a
set R of k regions, find a shortest tour that visits at least one point from
each region. We study the special cases of disjoint, connected, alpha-fat
regions (i.e., every region P contains a disk of diameter diam(P)/alpha) and
disjoint unit disks.
  For the latter, Dumitrescu and Mitchell proposed an algorithm based on
Mitchell's guillotine subdivision approach for the Euclidean TSP and claimed it
to be a PTAS. However, their proof contains a severe gap, which we will close
in the following. Bodlaender et al. remark that their techniques for the
minimum corridor connection problem carry over to the TSPN and yield an
alternative PTAS for this problem.
  For disjoint connected alpha-fat regions of varying size, Mitchell proposed a
slightly different PTAS candidate. We will expose several further problems and
gaps in this approach. Some of them we can close, but overall, for alpha-fat
regions, the existence of a PTAS for the TSPN remains open.
