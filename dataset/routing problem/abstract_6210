I explain the methods that are used in field theory for problems involving
typical momenta on two or more widely disparate scales. The principal topics
are: (a) renormalization, which treats the problem of taking an ultra-violet
cut-off to infinity, (b) the renormalization group, which is used to relate
phenomena on different scales, (c) the operator product expansion, which shows
how to obtain the asymptotics of amplitudes when some of its external momenta
approach infinity.
