We obtain for the two-phase Lam\'e-Clapeyron-Stefan problem for a
semi-infinite material an equivalence between the temperature and convective
boundary conditions at the fixed face in the case that an inequality for the
convective transfer coefficient is satisfied. Moreover, an inequality for the
coefficient which characterizes the solid-liquid interface of the classical
Neumann solution is also obtained. This inequality must be satisfied for data
of any phase-change material, and as a consequence the result given in Tarzia,
Quart. Appl. Math., 39 (1981), 491-497 is also recovered when a heat flux
condition was imposed at the fixed face.
