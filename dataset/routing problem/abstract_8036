In this report, we consider maximal solutions to the induced bounded-degree
subgraph problem and relate it to issues concerning stream control in
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks. We present a new distributed
algorithm that completes in logarithmic time with high probability and is
guaranteed to complete in linear time. We conclude the report with simulation
results that address the effectiveness of stream control and the relative
impact of receiver overloading and flexible interference suppression.
