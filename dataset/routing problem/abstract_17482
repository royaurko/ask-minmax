Randomized optimization is an established tool for control design with
modulated robustness. While for uncertain convex programs there exist
randomized approaches with efficient sampling, this is not the case for
non-convex problems. Approaches based on statistical learning theory are
applicable to non-convex problems, but they usually are conservative in terms
of performance and require high sample complexity to achieve the desired
probabilistic guarantees. In this paper, we derive a novel scenario approach
for a wide class of random non-convex programs, with a sample complexity
similar to that of uncertain convex programs and with probabilistic guarantees
that hold not only for the optimal solution of the scenario program, but for
all feasible solutions inside a set of a-priori chosen complexity. We also
address measure-theoretic issues for uncertain convex and non-convex programs.
Among the family of non-convex control- design problems that can be addressed
via randomization, we apply our scenario approach to randomized Model
Predictive Control for chance-constrained nonlinear control-affine systems.
