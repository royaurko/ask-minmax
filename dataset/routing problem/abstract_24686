This paper aims at proving asymptotic stability of the radial stationary
solution of a free boundary problem modeling the growth of nonnecrotic tumors
with fluid-like tissues. In a previous paper we considered the case where the
nutrient concentration $\sigma$ satisfies the stationary diffusion equation
$\Delta\sigma=f(\sigma)$, and proved that there exists a threshold value
$\gamma_*>0$ for the surface tension coefficient $\gamma$, such that the radial
stationary solution is asymptotically stable in case $\gamma>\gamma_*$, while
unstable in case $\gamma<\gamma_*$. In this paper we extend this result to the
case where $\sigma$ satisfies the non-stationary diffusion equation
$\epsln\partial_t\sigma=\Delta\sigma-f(\sigma)$. We prove that for the same
threshold value $\gamma_*$ as above, for every $\gamma>\gamma_*$ there is a
corresponding constant $\epsln_0(\gamma)>0$ such that for any
$0<\epsln<\epsln_0(\gamma)$ the radial stationary solution is asymptotically
stable with respect to small enough non-radial perturbations, while for
$0<\gamma<\gamma_*$ and $\epsln$ sufficiently small it is unstable under
non-radial perturbations.
