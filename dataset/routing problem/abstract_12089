Bassi and Ghirardi have developed a new theory to address the measurement
problem based upon non-linear and stochastic modifications of the Schroedinger
equation, which has been given the name Quantum Mechanical Spontaneous
Localization or QMSL, with one of the emphasis dealing with reduction or
wavefunction collapse within the nervous system. Analysis of this portion of
their theory reveals that it faces several problems.
