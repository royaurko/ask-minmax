In 2002, J.M.Rassias (Uniqueness of quasi-regular solutions for bi-parabolic
elliptic bi-hyperbolic Tricomi problem, Complex Variables, 47 (8) (2002),
707-718) imposed and investigated the bi-parabolic elliptic bi-hyperbolic mixed
type partial differential equation of second order. In the present paper some
boundary-value problems with non-local initial condition for model and
degenerate parabolic equations with parameter were considered. Also uniqueness
theorems are proved and non-trivial solutions of certain non-local problems for
forward-backward parabolic equation with parameter are investigated at specific
values of this parameter by employing the classical "a-b-c" method. Classical
references in this field of mixed type partial differential equations are given
by: J.M.Rassias (Lecture Notes on Mixed Type Partial Differential Equations,
World Scientific, 1990, pp.1-144) and M.M.Smirnov (Equations of Mixed Type,
Translations of Mathematical Monographies, 51, American Mathematical Society,
Providence, R.I., 1978 pp.1-232). Other investigations are achieved by G.C.Wen
et al. (in period 1990-2007).
