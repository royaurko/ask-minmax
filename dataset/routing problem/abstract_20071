The main result of this paper states that for any group $G$ with an automatic
structure $L$ with unique representatives one can construct a uniform partial
algorithm which detects $L$-rational subgroups and gives their preimages in
$L$. This provides a practical, not just theoretical, procedure for solving the
occurrence problem for such subgroups.
