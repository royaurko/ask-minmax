A report on neutrino masses, mixing and oscillations, made in Dubna at the
symposium dedicated to 100 years of the Rutherford's discovery of atomic
nucleus, is presented. We start with the hypothesis of neutrino which was
proposed by W. Pauli in December 1930 in order to solve some problems of nuclei
(the problem of spin of $^{7}N_{14}$ and other nuclei and the problem of
continuous $\beta$-spectra). After that we consider the theory of massless
two-component neutrino and first ideas of neutrino oscillations which were put
forward by B. Pontecorvo in Dubna in 1957-58. The present status of neutrino
mixing and oscillations is briefly reviewed. The seesaw mechanism of the
generation of small Majorana neutrino masses is discussed and neutrinoless
double $\beta$-decay of nuclei is considered. A possibility to probe the
Majorana mass mechanism of the $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay is discussed.
