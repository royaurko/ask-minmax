A mean field feedback artificial neural network algorithm is developed and
explored for the set covering problem. A convenient encoding of the inequality
constraints is achieved by means of a multilinear penalty function. An
approximate energy minimum is obtained by iterating a set of mean field
equations, in combination with annealing. The approach is numerically tested
against a set of publicly available test problems with sizes ranging up to
5x10^3 rows and 10^6 columns. When comparing the performance with exact results
for sizes where these are available, the approach yields results within a few
percent from the optimal solutions. Comparisons with other approximate methods
also come out well, in particular given the very low CPU consumption required
-- typically a few seconds. Arbitrary problems can be processed using the
algorithm via a public domain server.
