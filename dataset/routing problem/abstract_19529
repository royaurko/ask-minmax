The Standard Solar Model (SSM) and its basic assumption of an equation of
state of perfect gases for the plasmas of its interior is analyzed within the
new theoretical framework of QED coherent states. We find that for
$\frac{r}{r_{\odot}}\leq 0.3$ the SSM solution is unstable against collapse to
a dense, {\it cold} coherent core and as a result a large suppression of
$B^{8}$-neutrinos is obtained, apparently solving the long standing solar
neutrino problem.
