This paper is concerned with a class of nonlinear reaction-hyperbolic systems
as models for axonal transport in neuroscience. We show the global existence of
entropy-satisfying BV-solutions to the initial-value problems by using
hyperbolic-type methods. Moreover, we rigorously justify the limit as the
biochemical processes are much faster than the transport ones.
