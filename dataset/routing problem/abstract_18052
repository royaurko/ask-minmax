Cooperation between individuals is crucial for a population-based
meta-heuristic search method to be successful. This paper presents a new
population-based search method, namely Negatively Correlated Search (NCS),
which essentially maintains multiple individual search processes in parallel.
In NCS, the search behaviors of individual search processes are modeled as
probability distributions. Negatively correlated search behaviors are
explicitly promoted by encouraging difference among the probability
distributions (search behaviors). By this means, individual search processes
share information and cooperate with each other to search diverse regions of a
search space, and makes NCS a promising method for multimodal problems. The
cooperation scheme of NCS could also be regarded as a novel diversity
preservation scheme that, different from other existing schemes, directly
promotes diversity at the level of search behaviors rather than merely trying
to maintain diversity among candidate solutions. Empirical studies on a set of
multimodal continuous optimization problems showed that NCS is competitive to 6
well-established meta-heuristic search methods in the sense that NCS achieved
better solutions on majority of the tested problems.
