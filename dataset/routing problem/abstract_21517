Let $\mu$ be a nonnegative Borel measure on the open unit disk
$\mathbb{D}\subset\mathbb{C}$. This note shows how to decide that the M\"obius
invariant space $\mathcal{Q}_p$, covering $\mathcal{BMOA}$ and $\mathcal{B}$,
is boundedly (resp., compactly) embedded in the quadratic tent-type space
$T^\infty_p(\mu)$. Interestingly, the embedding result can be used to determine
the boundedness (resp., the compactness) of the Volterra-type and
multiplication operators on $\mathcal{Q}_p$.
