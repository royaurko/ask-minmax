The analysis of many problems of interest associated with Markov chains, e.g.
stationary distributions, moments of first passage time distributions and
moments of occupation time random variables, involves the solution of a system
of linear equations involving I - P, where P is the transition matrix of a
finite, irreducible, discrete time Markov chain. Generalized inverses play an
important role in the solution of such singular sets of equations. In this
presentation we survey the application of generalized matrix inverses to the
aforementioned problems.
