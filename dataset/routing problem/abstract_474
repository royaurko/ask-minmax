Road traffic jams is a most important problem in nearly all cities around the
world, especially in developing regions resulting in enormous delays, increased
fuel wastage and monetary losses. In this paper, we have obtained an in-sight
idea of simulating real world scenario of a critical region where traffic
congestion is very high. As it is not easy to set up and implement such a
complicated system in real world before knowing the impact of all parameters
used in Vehicle Ad hoc Network (VANET), a small real world area i.e. Jamshedpur
Regal area was taken into consideration, for studying the impact of mobility in
the VANET. Traffic movement has been deployed across the area under
consideration using one of the realistic vehicular mobility models. The
behavior of this network was simulated using SUMO and NS2 to study the impact
of traffic and traffic lights at the intersection on packet transmission over
Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication using Ad hoc On Demand Vector (AODV)
routing protocol and IEEE 802.11 standard. From the traffic simulation results,
it is proved that congestion problem for the given sample map with traffic
lights and predefined flow can be solved. There was negligible congestion at
lanes when traffic logic was changed in accordance with allowing flow with high
traffic overload to have high priority than those with low load.
