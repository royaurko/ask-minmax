This paper studies parameterized stochastic optimization problems in finite
discrete time that arise in many applications in operations research and
mathematical finance. We prove the existence of solutions and the absence of a
duality gap under conditions that relax the boundedness assumption made by
Pennanen and Perkki\"o in [Stochastic programs without duality gaps, Math.
Program., 136(1):91--110,2012]. We apply the result to a utility maximization
problem with an unbounded utility.
