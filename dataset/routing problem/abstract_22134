An accelerating electric charge coupled to its own electromagnetic (EM) field
both emits radiation and experiences the radiation's reaction as a
(self-)force. Considering the system from an Effective Field Theory
perspective, and using the physical initial conditions of no incoming radiation
can help resolve many of the problems associated with the often considered
"notorious" Abraham-Lorentz / Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac equations.
