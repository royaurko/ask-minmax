A detailed investigation of the effect of PMMA on the structure,
microstructure and magneto-transport properties of manganite La_0.7Ca_0.3MnO_3
(LCMO) is presented. LCMO-PMMA nanostructured composites have been synthesized
by a unique polymeric sol-gel route, which leads to improved solubility of PMMA
in the LCMO matrix. The LCMO phase is grown in the presence of varying PMMA
concentration at ~500 ^0 C. This route yields single phase material and the
grain size is observed to decrease slightly with increasing PMMA concentration.
On increasing the PMMA concentration, T_C undergoes a small decrease,
resistivity is observed to increase by two orders of magnitude, with a
concomitant large decrease in T_IM, e.g., from 218 K for virgin LCMO to 108 K
for 50 wt% PMMA admixed LCMO. Low field magneto-resistance measured in the
temperature range 77-300 K shows considerable enhancement as a function of the
PMMA concentration. These phenomena are explained by taking into account the
increased intergranular disorder as a consequence of PMMA admixture.
