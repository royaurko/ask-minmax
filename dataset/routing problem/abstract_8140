It was recently shown that the theory of linear stochastic systems can be
viewed as a particular case of the theory of linear systems on a certain
commutative ring of power series in a countable number of variables. In the
present work we study an interpolation problem in this setting. A key tool is
the principle of permanence of algebraic identities.
