In spite of the huge literature on deconvolution problems, very little is
done for hybrid contexts where signals are quantized. In this paper we
undertake an information theoretic approach to the deconvolution problem of a
simple integrator with quantized binary input and sampled noisy output. We
recast it into a decoding problem and we propose and analyze (theoretically and
numerically) some low complexity on-line algorithms to achieve deconvolution.
