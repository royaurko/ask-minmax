The generation of (Bell-)nonlocal correlations, i.e., correlations leading to
the violation of a Bell-like inequality, requires the usage of a nonlocal
resource, such as an entangled state. When given a correlation (a collection of
conditional probability distributions) from an experiment or from a theory, it
is desirable to determine the extent to which the participating parties would
need to collaborate nonlocally for its (re)production. Here, we propose to
achieve this via the minimal group size (MGS) of the resource, i.e., the
smallest number of parties that need to share a given type of nonlocal resource
for the above-mentioned purpose. In addition, we provide a general recipe ---
based on the lifting of Bell-like inequalities --- to construct MGS witnesses
for non-signaling resources starting from any given ones. En route to
illustrating the applicability of this recipe, we also show that when
restricted to the space of full-correlation functions, non-signaling resources
are as powerful as unconstrained signaling resources. Explicit examples of
correlations where their MGS can be determined using this recipe and other
numerical techniques are provided.
