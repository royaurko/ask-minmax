Convergence and stability results for the inverse Born series [Moskow and
Schotland, Inverse Problems, 24:065005, 2008] are generalized to mappings
between Banach spaces. We show that by restarting the inverse Born series one
obtains a class of iterative methods containing the Gauss-Newton and
Chebyshev-Halley methods. We use the generalized inverse Born series results to
show convergence of the inverse Born series for the Schr\"odinger problem with
discrete internal measurements. In this problem, the Schr\"odinger potential is
to be recovered from a few measurements of solutions to the Schr\"odinger
equation resulting from a few different source terms. An application of this
method to a problem related to transient hydraulic tomography is given, where
the source terms model injection and measurement wells.
