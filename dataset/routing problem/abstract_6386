We consider a nonlinear version of the Landau-Zener problem, focusing on
photoassociation of a Bose-Einstein condensate as a specific example. Contrary
to the exponential rate dependence obtained for the linear problem, a series
expansion technique indicates that, when the resonance is crossed slowly, the
probability for failure of adiabaticity is directly proportional to the rate at
which the resonance is crossed.
