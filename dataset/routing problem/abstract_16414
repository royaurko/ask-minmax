We consider algebraic Delone sets $\varLambda$ in the Euclidean plane and
address the problem of distinguishing convex subsets of $\varLambda$ by X-rays
in prescribed $\varLambda$-directions, i.e., directions parallel to nonzero
interpoint vectors of $\varLambda$. Here, an X-ray in direction $u$ of a finite
set gives the number of points in the set on each line parallel to $u$. It is
shown that for any algebraic Delone set $\varLambda$ there are four prescribed
$\varLambda$-directions such that any two convex subsets of $\varLambda$ can be
distinguished by the corresponding X-rays. We further prove the existence of a
natural number $c_{\varLambda}$ such that any two convex subsets of
$\varLambda$ can be distinguished by their X-rays in any set of
$c_{\varLambda}$ prescribed $\varLambda$-directions. In particular, this
extends a well-known result of Gardner and Gritzmann on the corresponding
problem for planar lattices to nonperiodic cases that are relevant in
quasicrystallography.
