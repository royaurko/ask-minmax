The boundary-value problem on semi-axis for one class operator-differential
equations of the fourth order, the main part of which has the multiple
characteristic is investigated in this paper in Sobolev type weighted space.
Correctness and unique solvability of the boundary-value problem is proved, and
the solvability conditions are expressed in terms of the operator coefficients
of the equation. Estimations of the norms of the operators of intermediate
derivatives, closely connected with the solvability conditions, have been
carried out. The connection between the exponent of the weight and the lower
border of the spectrum of the main operator, participating in the equation, is
determined in the results of the paper.
