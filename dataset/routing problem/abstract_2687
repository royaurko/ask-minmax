We study the structural and magnetic properties of the MnBi inter-metallic
compound. The LTP (Low Temperature Phase) MnBi compound is successfully
synthesized in single step by vacuum encapsulation technique and rapid
quenching from phase formation temperature. The phase purity and the magnetic
moments of MnBi are highly dependent on heat treating schedule. The best phase
purity and the magnetic moment are found for a sample heat treated at 310oC for
48h. Rietveld fitted X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns revealed that the studied
MnBi compound is crystallized in hexagonal P63/mmc space group with minute
presence of unreacted Bi and Mn phases. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
study is carried out to visualize the grains morphology and phase
identification. The bulk MnBi powder showed appreciable magnetic moment of
(62emu/g at 6Tesla) and maximum energy product (BHmax of 4.01MGOe at 6Tesla).
The magnetic properties of synthesized MnBi show that it could be a potential
candidate for rare earth free permanent magnets.
