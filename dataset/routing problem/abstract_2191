We derive periodic multilayer absorbers with effective uniaxial properties
similar to perfectly matched layers (PML). This approximate representation of
PML is based on the effective medium theory and we call it an effective medium
PML (EM-PML). We compare the spatial reflection spectrum of the layered
absorbers to that of a PML material and demonstrate that after neglecting gain
and magnetic properties, the absorber remains functional. This opens a route to
create electromagnetic absorbers for real and not only numerical applications
and as an example we introduce a layered absorber for the wavelength of
$8$~$\mu$m made of SiO$_2$ and NaCl. We also show that similar cylindrical
core-shell nanostructures derived from flat multilayers also exhibit very good
absorptive and reflective properties despite the different geometry.
