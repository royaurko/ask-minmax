We deal with entropy solutions to the Cauchy problem for the isentropic
compressible Euler equations in the space-periodic case. In more than one space
dimension, the methods developed by De Lellis-Sz\'ekelyhidi enable us to show
failure of uniqueness on a finite time-interval for entropy solutions starting
from any continuously differentiable initial density and suitably constructed
bounded initial linear momenta.
