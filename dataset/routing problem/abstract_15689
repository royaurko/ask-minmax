We consider the explanation of both data of the atmospheric neutrino and the
solar neutrino by the neutrino mass matrix derived from the mixing of neutrinos
and gauginos in the extended MSSM with an extra U(1) gauge symmetry. This
scenario directly relates the neutrino mass to supersymmetry. The structure of
the mass hierarchy and the mixing is determined only by the extra U(1)-charge
of neutrinos. Although the model is rather simple, it may be able to realize
both the small and large mixing angle solutions for the solar neutrino problem.
In particular, the large mixing angle MSW solution for the solar neutrino
problem can be easily realized. We discuss the relation between the extra
U(1)-charge and four solutions for the solar neutrino problem.
