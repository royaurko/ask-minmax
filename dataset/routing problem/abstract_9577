We formalize the problem of detecting a community in a network into testing
whether in a given (random) graph there is a subgraph that is unusually dense.
We observe an undirected and unweighted graph on N nodes. Under the null
hypothesis, the graph is a realization of an Erd\"os-R\'enyi graph with
probability p0. Under the (composite) alternative, there is a subgraph of n
nodes where the probability of connection is p1 > p0. We derive a detection
lower bound for detecting such a subgraph in terms of N, n, p0, p1 and exhibit
a test that achieves that lower bound. We do this both when p0 is known and
unknown. We also consider the problem of testing in polynomial-time. As an
aside, we consider the problem of detecting a clique, which is intimately
related to the planted clique problem. Our focus in this paper is in the
quasi-normal regime where n p0 is either bounded away from zero, or tends to
zero slowly.
