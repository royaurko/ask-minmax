In this paper, the isodiametric problem for centrally symmetric convex bodies
in the Euclidean d-space R^d containing no interior non-zero point of a lattice
L is studied. It is shown that the intersection of a suitable ball with the
Dirichlet-Voronoi cell of 2L is extremal, i.e., it has minimum diameter among
all bodies with the same volume. It is conjectured that these sets are the only
extremal bodies, which is proved for all three dimensional and several
prominent lattices.
