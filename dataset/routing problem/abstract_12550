We review the computation of scattering amplitudes of planar maximally
super-symmetric Yang-Mills at strong coupling. By using the AdS/CFT duality the
problem boils down to the computation of the area of certain minimal surfaces
on AdS. The integrability of the model can then be efficiently used in order to
give an answer for the problem in terms of a set of integral equations.
