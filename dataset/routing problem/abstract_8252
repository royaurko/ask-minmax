The problem of phase retrieval is a difficult one which remains far from
solved. Two homometric sets are always connected by way of a convolution
product by some spectral unit, though not necessarily in a unique way. Here we
elucidate one small aspect, the subgroup of spectral units with finite order.
Its elements are completely characterized by relations between their
eigenvalues. This sheds some light on the beltway problem.
