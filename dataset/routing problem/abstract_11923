How to calculate the exponential of matrices in an explicit manner is one of
fundamental problems in almost all subjects in Science.
  Especially in Mathematical Physics or Quantum Optics many problems are
reduced to this calculation by making use of some approximations whether they
are appropriate or not. However, it is in general not easy.
  In this paper we give a very useful formula which is both elementary and
getting on with computer.
