A review is given of the key works relevant to the problem of dynamical
fluctuation-electromagnetic interaction, a problem of topical interest over a
period of several decades. We discuss controversies and present day progress in
this problem considering two basic geometrical configurations: a small particle
moving above a plate, and two parallel plates in relative motion.
