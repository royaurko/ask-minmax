We study geometrical properties of the complete set of solutions of the
random 3-satisfiability problem. We show that even for moderate system sizes
the number of clusters corresponds surprisingly well with the theoretic
asymptotic prediction. We locate the freezing transition in the space of
solutions which has been conjectured to be relevant in explaining the onset of
computational hardness in random constraint satisfaction problems.
