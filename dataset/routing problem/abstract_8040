Considered is the problem of local equivalence of generic four-dimensional
metrics possessing two commuting and orthogonally transitive Killing vector
fields. A sufficient set of eight differential invariants is explicitly
constructed, among them four of first order and four of second order in terms
of metric coefficients. In vacuum case the four first-order invariants suffice
to distinguish generic metrics.
