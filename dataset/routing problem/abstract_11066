We have devised a variational sinc collocation method (VSCM) which can be
used to obtain accurate numerical solutions to many strong-coupling problems.
Sinc functions with an optimal grid spacing are used to solve the linear and
non-linear Schr\"odinger equations and a lattice $\phi^4$ model in $(1+1)$. Our
results indicate that errors decrease exponentially with the number of grid
points and that a limited numerical effort is needed to reach high precision.
