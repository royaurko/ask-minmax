The MICZ-Kepler orbits are the non-colliding orbits of the MICZ Kepler
problems (the magnetized versions of the Kepler problem). The oriented
MICZ-Kepler orbits can be parametrized by the canonical angular momentum
$\mathbf L$ and the Lenz vector $\mathbf A$, with the parameter space
consisting of the pairs of 3D vectors $(\mathbf A, \mathbf L)$ with ${\mathbf
L}\cdot {\mathbf L} > (\mathbf L\cdot \mathbf A)^2$. The recent 4D perspective
of the Kepler problem yields a new parametrization, with the parameter space
consisting of the pairs of Minkowski vectors $(a,l)$ with $l\cdot l =-1$,
$a\cdot l =0$, $a_0>0$.
  This new parametrization of orbits implies that the MICZ-Kepler orbits of
different magnetic charges are related to each other by symmetries:
\emph{${\mathrm {SO}}^+(1,3)\times {\mathbb R}_+$ acts transitively on both the
set of oriented elliptic MICZ-Kepler orbits and the set of oriented parabolic
MICZ-Kepler orbits}. This action extends to ${\mathrm {O}}^+(1,3)\times
{\mathbb R}_+$, the \emph{structure group} for the rank-two Euclidean Jordan
algebra whose underlying Lorentz space is the Minkowski space.
