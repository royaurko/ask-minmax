In this paper we study the cosmological constant emerging from the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation as an eigenvalue of the related Sturm-Liouville
problem. We employ Gaussian trial functionals and we perform a mode
decomposition to extract the transverse-traceless component, namely, the
graviton contribution, at one loop. We implement a noncommutative-geometry-
induced minimal length to calculate the number of graviton modes. As a result,
we find regular graviton fluctuation energies for the Schwarzschild, de Sitter,
and anti-de Sitter backgrounds. No renormalization scheme is necessary to
remove infinities, in contrast to what happens in conventional approaches.
