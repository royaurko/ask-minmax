We present an inverse scattering approach for computing n-peakon solutions of
the Degasperis-Procesi equation (a modification of the Camassa-Holm (CH)
shallow water equation). The associated non-self-adjoint spectral problem is
shown to be amenable to analysis using the isospectral deformations induced
from the n-peakon solution, and the inverse problem is solved by a method
generalizing the continued fraction solution of the peakon sector of the CH
equation.
