We demonstrate a novel in situ polymerization technique to develop localized
polymer coatings on the surface of dispersed pristine graphene sheets. Graphene
sheets show great promise as strong, conductive fillers in polymer
nanocomposites; however, difficulties in dispersion quality and interfacial
strength between filler and matrix have been a persistent problem for
graphene-based nanocomposites, particularly for pristine graphene. To address
this problem, a physisorbed polymer layer is used to stabilize graphene sheets
in solution. To form this protective layer, an organic microenvironment is
formed around dispersed graphene sheets in surfactant solutions, and a nylon
6,10 or nylon 6,6 coating is created via interfacial polymerization. A similar
technique was originally developed to protect luminescent properties of carbon
nanotubes in solution. These coated graphene dispersions are
aggregation-resistant and may be reversibly redispersed in water even after
freeze-drying. The coated graphene holds promise for a number of applications,
including multifunctional graphene-polymer nanocomposites.
