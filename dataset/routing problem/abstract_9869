The inverse problem for electromagnetic field produced by arbitrary altered
charge distribution in dipole approximation is solved. The charge distribution
is represented by its dipole moment. It is assumed that the spectral properties
of magnetic field of the dipole are known. The position of the dipole and its
Fourier components are considered as the unknown quantities. It is assumed that
relative increments of amplitude and phase of magnetic field in the vicinity of
the observation point are known. The derived results can be used for study of
phenomena concerned with occurrence and variation of localized electric charge
distribution, when the position and the dynamics of a localized source of
electromagnetic field are to be defined.
