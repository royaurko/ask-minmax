We consider the Manev Potential in an anisotropic space, i.e., such that the
force acts differently in each direction. Using a generalization of the
  Poincare' continuation method we study the existence of periodic solutions
for weak anisotropy. In particular we find that the symmetric periodic orbits
of the Manev system are perturbed to periodic orbits in the anisotropic
problem.
