We propose a parallel adaptive constraint-tightening approach to solve a
linear model predictive control problem for discrete-time systems, based on
inexact numerical optimization algorithms and operator splitting methods. The
underlying algorithm first splits the original problem in as many independent
subproblems as the length of the prediction horizon. Then, our algorithm
computes a solution for these subproblems in parallel by exploiting auxiliary
tightened subproblems in order to certify the control law in terms of
suboptimality and recursive feasibility, along with closed-loop stability of
the controlled system. Compared to prior approaches based on constraint
tightening, our algorithm computes the tightening parameter for each subproblem
to handle the propagation of errors introduced by the parallelization of the
original problem. Our simulations show the computational benefits of the
parallelization with positive impacts on performance and numerical conditioning
when compared with a recent nonparallel adaptive tightening scheme.
