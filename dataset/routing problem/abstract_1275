We investigate the role of the substrate for the strength of the electon
phonon coupling in Li-decorated graphene. We find that the interaction with a
$h$-BN substrate leads to a significant enhancement from $\lambda_0=0.62$ to
$\lambda_1=0.67$, which corresponds to a $25\%$ increase of the transition
temperature from $T_{c0}=10.33$ K to $T_{c1}=12.98$ K. The superconducting gaps
amount to 1.56 meV (suspended) and 1.98 meV (supported). These findings open up
a new route to enhanced superconducting transition temperatures in
graphene-based materials by substrate engineering.
