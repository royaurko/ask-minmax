We propose a simple pedagogical way of introducing the Euler-MacLaurin
summation formula in an undergraduate course on statistical mechanics. We put
forward two alternative routes: the first one is the simplest and yields the
first two terms of the expansion. The second one is somewhat more elaborate and
takes into account all the correction terms. We apply both to the calculation
of the simplest one-particle canonical partition functions for the
translational, vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom.
