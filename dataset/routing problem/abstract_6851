Active context-free games are two-player games on strings over finite
alphabets with one player trying to rewrite the input string to match a target
specification. These games have been investigated in the context of exchanging
Active XML (AXML) data. While it was known that the rewriting problem is
undecidable in general, it is shown here that it is EXPSPACE-complete to decide
for a given context-free game, whether all safely rewritable strings can be
safely rewritten in a left-to-right manner, a problem that was previously
considered by Abiteboul et al. Furthermore, it is shown that the corresponding
problem for games with finite replacement languages is EXPTIME-complete.
