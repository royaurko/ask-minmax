We derive analytical solutions for p-spin models with finite connectivity at
zero temperature. These models are the statistical mechanics equivalent of
p-XORSAT problems in theoretical computer science. We give a full
characterization of the phase diagram: location of the phase transitions
(static and dynamic), together with a description of the clustering phenomenon
taking place in configurational space. We use two alternative methods: the
cavity approach and a rigorous derivation.
