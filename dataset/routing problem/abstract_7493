An important class of problems exhibits smooth behaviour in space and time on
a macroscopic scale, while only a microscopic evolution law is known. For such
time-dependent multi-scale problems, an ``equation-free framework'' has been
proposed, of which the gap-tooth scheme is an essential component. The
gap-tooth scheme is designed to approximate a time-stepper for an unavailable
macroscopic equation in a macroscopic domain; it uses appropriately initialized
simulations of the available microscopic model in a number of small boxes,
which cover only a fraction of the domain. We analyze the convergence of this
scheme for a parabolic homogenization problem with non-linear reaction. In this
case, the microscopic model is a partial differential equation with rapidly
oscillating coefficients, while the unknown macroscopic model is approximated
by the homogenized equation. We show that our method approximates a finite
difference scheme of arbitrary (even) order for the homogenized equation when
we appropriately constrain the microscopic problem in the boxes. We illustrate
this theoretical result with numerical tests on several model problems. We also
demonstrate that it is possible to obtain a convergent scheme without
constraining the microscopic code, by introducing buffer regions around the
computational boxes.
