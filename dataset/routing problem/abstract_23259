Assuming three flavour neutrino mixing takes place in vacuum, we investigate
the possibility that the solar $\nu_e$ take part in MSW transitions in the Sun
due to $\Delta m^2_{31} \sim (10^{-7} - 10^{-4})~eV^2$, followed by long wave
length vacuum oscillations on the way to the Earth, triggered by $\Delta
m^2_{21}$ (or $\Delta m^2_{32}$) $\sim (10^{-12} - 10^{-10})~eV^2$. The solar
$\nu_e$ survival probability is shown to be described in this case by a simple
analytic expression. New ranges of neutrino parameters which allow to fit the
solar neutrino data have been found. The best fit characterized by the minimum
$\chi^2$ is extremely good. This hybrid (MSW+vacuum oscillations) solution of
the solar neutrino problem leads to peculiar distortions of energy spectrum of
the boron neutrinos which can be observed by the SuperKamiokande and SNO
experiments. Other flavour scheme (e.g. 2 active $\nu$s + 1 sterile $\nu$) can
provide MSW+vacuum solution also.
