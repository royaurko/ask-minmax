This study concerns the fast and accurate solution of multilevel non-LTE
radiation transfer problems. We propose and evaluate an alternative iterative
scheme to the classical MALI method. Our study is indeed based on the
application of Broyden's method for the solution of nonlinear systems of
equations. Comparative tests, in 1D plane-parallel geometry, between the
popular MALI method and our alternative method are discussed. The Broyden
method is typically 4.5 times faster than MALI. It makes it also fairly
competitive with Gauss-Seidel and Successive Over-Relaxation methods developed
after MALI.
