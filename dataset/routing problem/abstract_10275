Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are typically solved using
conventional von Neumann computing architectures. However, these architectures
do not reflect the distributed nature of many of these problems and are thus
ill-suited to solving them. In this paper we present a hybrid analog/digital
hardware architecture specifically designed to solve such problems. We cast
CSPs as networks of stereotyped multi-stable oscillatory elements that
communicate using digital pulses, or events. The oscillatory elements are
implemented using analog non-stochastic circuits. The non-repeating phase
relations among the oscillatory elements drive the exploration of the solution
space. We show that this hardware architecture can yield state-of-the-art
performance on a number of CSPs under reasonable assumptions on the
implementation. We present measurements from a prototype electronic chip to
demonstrate that a physical implementation of the proposed architecture is
robust to practical non-idealities and to validate the theory proposed.
