This paper deals with the problem of computing the boundary of the capacity
region for the memoryless two-user binary-input binary-output multiple-access
channel ((2,2;2)-MAC), or equivalently, the computation of input probability
distributions maximizing weighted sum-rate. This is equivalent to solving a
difficult nonconvex optimization problem. For a restricted class of
(2,2;2)-MACs and weight vectors, it is shown that, depending on an ordering
property of the channel matrix, the optimal solution is located on the
boundary, or the objective function has at most one stationary point in the
interior of the domain. For this, the problem is reduced to a pseudoconcave
one-dimensional optimization and the single-user problem.
