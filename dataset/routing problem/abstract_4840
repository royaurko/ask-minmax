We explore the intricate interdependent relationship among counting problems,
considered from three frameworks for such problems: Holant Problems, counting
CSP and weighted H-colorings. We consider these problems for general complex
valued functions that take boolean inputs. We show that results from one
framework can be used to derive results in another, and this happens in both
directions. Holographic reductions discover an underlying unity, which is only
revealed when these counting problems are investigated in the complex domain
$\mathbb{C}$. We prove three complexity dichotomy theorems, leading to a
general theorem for Holant$^c$ problems. This is the natural class of Holant
problems where one can assign constants 0 or 1. More specifically, given any
signature grid on $G=(V,E)$ over a set ${\mathscr F}$ of symmetric functions,
we completely classify the complexity to be in P or #P-hard, according to
${\mathscr F}$, of \[\sum_{\sigma: E \rightarrow \{0,1\}} \prod_{v\in V}
f_v(\sigma\mid_{E(v)}),\] where $f_v \in {\mathscr F} \cup \{{\bf 0}, {\bf
1}\}$ ({\bf 0}, {\bf 1} are the unary constant 0, 1 functions). Not only is
holographic reduction the main tool, but also the final dichotomy can be only
naturally stated in the language of holographic transformations. The proof goes
through another dichotomy theorem on boolean complex weighted #CSP.
