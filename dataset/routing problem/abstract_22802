We use the Kubo-Landauer formalism to compute the longitudinal (two-terminal)
conductance of a two dimensional electron system placed in a strong
perpendicular magnetic field, and subjected to periodic modulations and/or
disorder potentials. The scattering problem is recast as a set of
inhomogeneous, coupled linear equations, allowing us to find the transmission
probabilities from a finite-size system computation; the results are exact for
non-interacting electrons. Our method fully accounts for the effects of the
disorder and the periodic modulation, irrespective of their relative strength,
as long as Landau level mixing is negligible. In particular, we focus on the
interplay between the effects of the periodic modulation and those of the
disorder. This appears to be the relevant regime to understand recent
experiments [S. Melinte {\em et al}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 92}, 036802 (2004)],
and our numerical results are in qualitative agreement with these experimental
results. The numerical techniques we develop can be generalized
straightforwardly to many-terminal geometries, as well as other multi-channel
scattering problems.
