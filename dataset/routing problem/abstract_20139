This work is devoted to the investigation of the problem about inverse
mapping systems expansions of ultrauniform spaces $X$ using polyhedra over
non-Archimedean locally compact fields $\bf L$. Theorems about expansions of
complete ultrametric and ultrauniform spaces are proved. Absolute polyhedral
expansions and inverse mapping systems of expansions for non-complete spaces
are investigated. This article also contains results about a relation of $dim
(X)$ and dimensions of polyhedra over $\bf L$.
