The space representations of linear canonical transformations were studied by
Moshinsky and Quesne in 1972. For a few decades, the bilinear hamiltonian
remained as the only exactly solvable representative for such problems. In this
work we show that the Mello-Moshinsky equations can be solved exactly for a
class of problems with discrete symmetry, leading to exact propagators for
Wannier-Stark ladders in one and two dimensional crystals. We give a detailed
study for a particle in a triangular lattice under the influence of a
time-dependent electric field. A more general set of Mello-Moshinsky equations
for arbitrary lattices is presented.
