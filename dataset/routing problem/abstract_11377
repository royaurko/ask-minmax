We analyse the spectral problem for the q-Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations
for $U_q(\widehat{sl_2}) (0 < q \leq 1)$ at level zero. The case of 2-point
functions in the fundamental representation is studied in detail. The
scattering states are found explicitly in terms of continuous q-Jacobi
polynomials. The corresponding S-matrix is shown to coincide, up to a trivial
factor, with the kink-antikink S-matrix in the spin-1/2 XXZ antiferromagnet.
