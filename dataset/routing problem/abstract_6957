A linear singularly perturbed convection-diffusion problem with
characteristic layers is considered in three dimensions. Sharp bounds for the
associated Green's function and its derivatives are established in the $L_1$
norm. The dependence of these bounds on the small perturbation parameter is
shown explicitly. The obtained estimates will be used in a forthcoming
numerical analysis of the considered problem.
  The present article is a more detailed version of our recent paper [7].
