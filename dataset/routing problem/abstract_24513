We consider the nonlinear integer programming problem of minimizing a
quadratic function over the integer points in variable dimension satisfying a
system of linear inequalities. We show that when the Graver basis of the matrix
defining the system is given, and the quadratic function lies in a suitable
{\em dual Graver cone}, the problem can be solved in polynomial time. We
discuss the relation between this cone and the cone of positive semidefinite
matrices, and show that none contains the other. So we can minimize in
polynomial time some non-convex and some (including all separable) convex
quadrics.
  We conclude by extending our results to efficient integer minimization of
multivariate polynomial functions of arbitrary degree lying in suitable cones.
