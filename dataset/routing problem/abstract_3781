We consider the problem of minimizing a sum of non-convex functions over a
compact domain, subject to linear inequality and equality constraints.
Approximate solutions can be found by solving a convexified version of the
problem, in which each function in the objective is replaced by its convex
envelope. We propose a randomized algorithm to solve the convexified problem
which finds an $\epsilon$-suboptimal solution to the original problem. With
probability one, $\epsilon$ is bounded by a term proportional to the number of
constraints in the problem. The bound does not depend on the number of
variables in the problem or the number of terms in the objective. In contrast
to previous related work, our proof is constructive, self-contained, and gives
a bound that is tight.
