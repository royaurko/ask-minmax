We propose a novel numerical method for solving inverse problems subject to
impulsive noises which possibly contain a large number of outliers. The
approach is of Bayesian type, and it exploits a heavy-tailed t distribution for
data noise to achieve robustness with respect to outliers. A hierarchical model
with all hyper-parameters automatically determined from the given data is
described. An algorithm of variational type by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler
divergence between the true posteriori distribution and a separable
approximation is developed. The numerical method is illustrated on several one-
and two-dimensional linear and nonlinear inverse problems arising from heat
conduction, including estimating boundary temperature, heat flux and heat
transfer coefficient. The results show its robustness to outliers and the fast
and steady convergence of the algorithm.
