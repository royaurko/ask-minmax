Initial conditions are set by Big bang nucleosynthesis from which we know
that 90 per cent of baryons are dark and have essentially unknown chemical
composition. In our own Galaxy, there are many clues from individual stars in
different populations whereas in elliptical galaxies the data largely come from
integrated spectra, but these raise problems enough like the Mg/Fe and G-dwarf
problems. Irregular and blue compact galaxies display the primary--secondary
transition in N/O; this in turn may be relevant to element ratios observed in
damped Lyman-alpha systems at high red-shift, which offer rather little
evidence for for pure SNII synthesis such as is found in the Galactic halo
stars. A recent estimate of past star formation rates as a function of
red-shift is presented and the appropriateness of the conventional conversion
factor of 42 from SFR to metal production is discussed. For any reasonable
value of this conversion factor, it is clear that most of the metals existing
at z=2.5 have yet to be detected.
