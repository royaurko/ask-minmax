In the theory of Bose-condensed systems, there exists the well known problem,
the Hohenberg-Martin dilemma of conserving versus gapless approximations. This
dilemma is analysed and it is shown that it arises because of the internal
inconsistency of the standard grand ensemble, as applied to Bose-systems with
broken global gauge symmetry. A solution of the problem is proposed, based on
the notion of representative statistical ensembles, taking into account all
constraints imposed on the system. A general approach for constructing
representative ensembles is formulated. Applying a representative ensemble to
Bose-condensed systems results in a completely self-consistent theory, both
conserving and gapless in any approximation.
