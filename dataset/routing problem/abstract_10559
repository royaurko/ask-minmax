We investigate structural complexity measures on digraphs, in particular the
cycle rank. This concept is intimately related to a classical topic in formal
language theory, namely the star height of regular languages. We explore this
connection, and obtain several new algorithmic insights regarding both cycle
rank and star height. Among other results, we show that computing the cycle
rank is NP-complete, even for sparse digraphs of maximum outdegree 2.
Notwithstanding, we provide both a polynomial-time approximation algorithm and
an exponential-time exact algorithm for this problem. The former algorithm
yields an O((log n)^(3/2))- approximation in polynomial time, whereas the
latter yields the optimum solution, and runs in time and space O*(1.9129^n) on
digraphs of maximum outdegree at most two. Regarding the star height problem,
we identify a subclass of the regular languages for which we can precisely
determine the computational complexity of the star height problem. Namely, the
star height problem for bideterministic languages is NP-complete, and this
holds already for binary alphabets. Then we translate the algorithmic results
concerning cycle rank to the bideterministic star height problem, thus giving a
polynomial-time approximation as well as a reasonably fast exact exponential
algorithm for bideterministic star height.
