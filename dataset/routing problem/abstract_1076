The thermo-mechanical properties of silicon make it of significant interest
as a possible material for mirror substrates and suspension elements for future
long-baseline gravitational wave detectors. The mechanical dissipation in 92um
thick <110> single-crystal silicon cantilevers has been observed over the
temperature range 85 K to 300 K, with dissipation approaching levels down to
phi = 4.4E-7.
