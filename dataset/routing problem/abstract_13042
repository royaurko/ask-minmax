In this paper we address the global stability problem for double-bubbles in
the plane. This is accomplished by combining the "improved convergence theorem"
for planar clusters developed in arXiv:1409.6652 with an ad hoc analysis of the
problem, which addresses the delicate interaction between the (possible)
dislocation of singularities and the multiple-volumes constraint.
