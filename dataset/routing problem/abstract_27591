We revisit the small field Coleman-Weinberg (CW) inflation, which has the
following two problems. First, the smallness of the slow roll parameter
$\epsilon$ requires the inflation scale to be very low. Second, the spectral
index $n_s \approx1+2 \eta$ tends to become smaller compared to the observed
value. In this letter, we consider two possible effects on the dynamics of
inflation: radiatively generated non-minimal coupling to gravity $\xi \phi^2
{\cal R}$ and condensation of fermions coupled to the inflaton as $\phi
\bar\psi \psi$. We show that the fermion condenate can solve the above
problems.
