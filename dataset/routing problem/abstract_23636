Boris Shapiro and Michael Shapiro have a conjecture concerning the Schubert
calculus and real enumerative geometry and which would give infinitely many
families of zero-dimensional systems of real polynomials (including families of
overdetermined systems)--all of whose solutions are real. It has connections to
the pole placement problem in linear systems theory and to totally positive
matrices. We give compelling computational evidence for its validity, prove it
for infinitely many families of enumerative problems, show how a simple version
implies more general versions, and present a counterexample to a general
version of their conjecture.
