Superconducting rf technology (SRF) is evolving rapidly as are its
applications. While there is active exploitation of what one may term the
current state-of-the-practice, there is also rapid progress expanding in
several dimensions the accessible and useful parameter space. While
state-of-the-art performance sometimes outpaces thorough understanding, the
improving scientific understanding from active SRF research is clarifying
routes to obtain optimum performance from present materials and opening avenues
beyond the standard bulk niobium. The improving technical basis understanding
is enabling process engineering to both improve performance confidence and
reliability and also unit implementation costs. Increasing confidence in the
technology enables the engineering of new creative application designs. We
attempt to survey this landscape to highlight the potential for future
accelerator applications.
