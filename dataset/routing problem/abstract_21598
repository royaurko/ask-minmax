In this paper we consider an inverse problem for the time dependent linear
Boltzmann equation. It concerns the identification of the coefficients via a
finite number of measurements on the boundary. We prove that the total
extinction coefficient and the collision kernel can be uniquely determined by
at most k measurements on the boundary, provided that these coefficients belong
to a finite k-dimensional vector space.
