In this work we revise the most recent developments concerning the study of
first order problems regarding differential equations with involutions. We take
into account two cases: the case of initial conditions and constant
coefficients and the case of homogeneous boundary conditions and non-constant
coefficients. Using different techniques, we obtain the Green's function for
both problems, study its sign and derive further results.
