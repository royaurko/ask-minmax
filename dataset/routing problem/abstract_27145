In this paper we consider the problem of online stochastic optimization of a
locally smooth function under bandit feedback. We introduce the high-confidence
tree (HCT) algorithm, a novel any-time $\mathcal{X}$-armed bandit algorithm,
and derive regret bounds matching the performance of existing state-of-the-art
in terms of dependency on number of steps and smoothness factor. The main
advantage of HCT is that it handles the challenging case of correlated rewards,
whereas existing methods require that the reward-generating process of each arm
is an identically and independent distributed (iid) random process. HCT also
improves on the state-of-the-art in terms of its memory requirement as well as
requiring a weaker smoothness assumption on the mean-reward function in compare
to the previous anytime algorithms. Finally, we discuss how HCT can be applied
to the problem of policy search in reinforcement learning and we report
preliminary empirical results.
