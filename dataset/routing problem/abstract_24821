One of the biggest challenges for the Computer Science of today can be summed
up by the paradigm "access to information from $everywhere$ at $anytime$". This
is especially true for pervasive computing. With the growth of mobile devices
(e.g., smart-phones), on the one hand, and the quick development of the
Internet (this has become the really pervasive network of today), on the other
hand, the development of real-time pervasive applications has broadened. This
paper focuses on the problem of drafting detection in the Ironman triathlons
which causes serious problems for the majority of organizers regarding such
competitions. A concept of drafting detection system in Ironman is based on the
paradigm of pervasive computing. Results of performing a test system show that
this concept can along with further development of computer technologies become
a reality in the near future.
