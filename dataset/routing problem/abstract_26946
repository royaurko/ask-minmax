Peer reviewed journals are a key part of the system by which academic
knowledge is developed and communicated. Problems have often been noted, and
alternatives proposed, but the journal system still survives. In this article I
focus on problems relating to reliance on subject-specific journals and peer
review. Contrary to what is often assumed, there are alternatives to the
current system, some of which have only becoming viable since the rise of the
world wide web. The market for academic ideas should be opened up by separating
the publication service from the review service: the former would ideally be
served by an open access, web-based repository system encompassing all
disciplines, whereas the latter should be opened up to encourage non-peer
reviews from different perspectives, user reviews, statistics reviews, reviews
from the perspective of different disciplines, and so on. The possibility of
multiple reviews of the same artefact should encourage competition between
reviewing organizations and should make the system more responsive to the
requirements of the differing audience groups. These possibilities offer the
potential to make the academic system far more productive.
