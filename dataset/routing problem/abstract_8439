The structure of all graphs having minimum rank at most k over a finite field
with q elements is characterized for any possible k and q. A strong connection
between this characterization and polarities of projective geometries is
explained. Using this connection, a few results in the minimum rank problem are
derived by applying some known results from projective geometry.
