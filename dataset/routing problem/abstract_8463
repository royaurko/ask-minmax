The number of available algorithms for the so-called Basis Pursuit Denoising
problem (or the related LASSO-problem) is large and keeps growing. Similarly,
the number of experiments to evaluate and compare these algorithms on different
instances is growing.
  In this note, we present a method to produce instances with exact solutions
which is based on a simple observation which is related to the so called source
condition from sparse regularization.
