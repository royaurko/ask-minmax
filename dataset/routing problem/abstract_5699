We propose a Projected Proximal Point Algorithm (ProPPA) for solving a class
of optimization problems. The algorithm iteratively computes the proximal point
of the last estimated solution projected into an affine space which itself is
parallel and approaching to the feasible set. We provide convergence analysis
theoretically supporting the general algorithm, and then apply it for solving
$\ell_1$-minimization problems and the matrix completion problem. These
problems arise in many applications including machine learning, image and
signal processing. We compare our algorithm with the existing state-of-the-art
algorithms. Experimental results on solving these problems show that our
algorithm is very efficient and competitive.
