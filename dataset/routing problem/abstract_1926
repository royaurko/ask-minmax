Using density functional theory plus Hubbard-U (DFT+U) approach, we find that
quasi one-dementation(1D) 3d transition metal(TM) zigzag nanowire can be
constructed by TM adsorbed on the surface of graphyne sheet. The results show
that the TM exchange coupling of the zigzag nanowire mediated by sp hybridized
carbon atoms gives rise to long range ferromagnetic order except for Cr with
anti-ferromagnetic order. The magnetic exchange interaction of TM chains
follows like-Zener's p_z-d exchange mechanism: the coexistence of out-of plane
p_z-d and in-plane p_x-y-d exchange. Finally, by including spin-orbit
interactions within spin-DFT, we calculate the magnetic anisotropy energy of
the TM chain on graphyne. We find that the Fe and Co chains show considerable
magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) and orbital magnetic moment. The easy axis of
V, Cr, Mn and Fe chains is perpendicular to the surface, whereas the easy axis
of Co lies in the surface. Moreover, only V chain shows relatively larger
in-plane anisotropy. Our results open a new route to realize the applications
of graphyne in spintronics.
