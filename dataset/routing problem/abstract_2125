We study the spectral characteristics of spin current nano-oscillators based
on the Pt/[Co/Ni] magnetic multilayer with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.
By varying the applied magnetic field and current, both localized and
propagating spin wave modes of the oscillation are achieved. At small fields,
we observe an abrupt onset of the modulation sidebands. We use micromagnetic
simulations to identify this state as a dynamical magnetic skyrmion stabilized
in the active device region by spin current injection, whose current-induced
dynamics is accompanied by the gyrotropic motion of the core due to the skew
deflection. Our results demonstrate a practical route for controllable skyrmion
manipulation by spin current in magnetic thin films.
