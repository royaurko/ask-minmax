The Cauchy problem for a modified Zakharov system is proven to be locally
well-posed for rough data in two and three space dimensions. In the three
dimensional case the problem is globally well-posed for data with small energy.
Under this assumption there also exists a global classical solution for
sufficiently smooth data.
