Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in the plane and $S$ a set of non-crossing
line segments between vertices in $P$, called constraints. Two vertices are
visible if the straight line segment connecting them does not properly
intersect any constraints. The constrained $\theta_m$-graph is constructed by
partitioning the plane around each vertex into $m$ disjoint cones, each with
aperture $\theta = 2 \pi/m$, and adding an edge to the `closest' visible vertex
in each cone. We consider how to route on the constrained $\theta_6$-graph. We
first show that no deterministic 1-local routing algorithm is
$o(\sqrt{n})$-competitive on all pairs of vertices of the constrained
$\theta_6$-graph. After that, we show how to route between any two visible
vertices of the constrained $\theta_6$-graph using only 1-local information.
Our routing algorithm guarantees that the returned path has length at most 2
times the Euclidean distance between the source and destination. Additionally,
we provide a 1-local 18-competitive routing algorithm for visible vertices in
the constrained half-$\theta_6$-graph, a subgraph of the constrained
$\theta_6$-graph that is equivalent to the Delaunay graph where the empty
region is an equilateral triangle. To the best of our knowledge, these are the
first local routing algorithms in the constrained setting with guarantees on
the length of the returned path.
