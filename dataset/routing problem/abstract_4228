We prove new results on existence of solutions for the prescribed gaussian
curvature problem on the euclidean sphere S^2. Those results are achieved by
relating this problem with the holomorphic triples theory on Riemann surfaces.
We think this approach might be applied to study some other semi-linear
elliptic equations of 2nd order on the sphere.
