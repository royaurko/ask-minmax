We consider the problem of predicting winners in elections, for the case
where we are given complete knowledge about all possible candidates, all
possible voters (together with their preferences), but where it is uncertain
either which candidates exactly register for the election or which voters cast
their votes. Under reasonable assumptions, our problems reduce to counting
variants of election control problems. We either give polynomial-time
algorithms or prove #P-completeness results for counting variants of control by
adding/deleting candidates/voters for Plurality, k-Approval, Approval,
Condorcet, and Maximin voting rules. We consider both the general case, where
voters' preferences are unrestricted, and the case where voters' preferences
are single-peaked.
