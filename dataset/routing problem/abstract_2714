Today people increasingly have the opportunity to opt-in to "usage-based"
automotive insurance programs for reducing insurance premiums. In these
programs, participants install devices in their vehicles that monitor their
driving behavior, which raises some privacy concerns. Some devices collect
fine-grained speed data to monitor driving habits. Companies that use these
devices claim that their approach is privacy-preserving because speedometer
measurements do not have physical locations. However, we show that with
knowledge of the user's home location, as the insurance companies have, speed
data is sufficient to discover driving routes and destinations when trip data
is collected over a period of weeks. To demonstrate the real-world
applicability of our approach we applied our algorithm, elastic pathing, to
data collected over hundreds of driving trips occurring over several months.
With this data and our approach, we were able to predict trip destinations to
within 250 meters of ground truth in 10% of the traces and within 500 meters in
20% of the traces. This result, combined with the amount of speed data that is
being collected by insurance companies, constitutes a substantial breach of
privacy because a person's regular driving pattern can be deduced with repeated
examples of the same paths with just a few weeks of monitoring.
