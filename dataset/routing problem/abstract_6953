In this letter we are concerned with the possibility to approach the
existence of solutions to a class of discontinuous dynamical systems of
fractional order. In this purpose, the underlying initial value problem is
transformed into a fractional set-valued problem. Next, the Cellina's Theorem
is applied leading to a single-valued continuous initial value problem of
fractional order. The existence of solutions is assured by a P\'{e}ano like
theorem for ordinary differential equations of fractional order.
