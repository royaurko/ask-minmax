We show that the wide-spread concept of optical eigen modes in lossless
waveguide structures, which assumes the separation on propagating and
evanescent modes, fails in the case of metal-dielectric structures, including
photonic crystals. In addition to these modes, there is a sequence of new
eigen-states with complex values of the propagation constant and non-vanishing
circulating energy flow. The whole eigen-problem ceases to be hermitian because
of changing sign of the optical dielectric constant. The new anomalous modes
are shown to be of prime importance for the description of the anomalous light
transmission through subwavelength holes.
