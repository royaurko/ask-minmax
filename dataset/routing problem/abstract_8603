Cagnetti, Gomes, Mitake and Tran (2013) introduced a new idea to study the
large time behavior for degenerate viscous Hamilton--Jacobi equations. In this
paper, we apply the method to study the large-time behavior of the solution to
the obstacle problem for degenerate viscous Hamilton--Jacobi equations. We
establish the convergence result under rather general assumptions.
