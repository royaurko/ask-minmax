We investigate a way of circumventing the sign problem in lattice QCD
simulations with a theta-vacuum term, using the PNJL model. We consider the
reweighting method for the QCD Lagrangian after the U_A(1) transformation. In
the Lagrangian, the P-odd mass term as a cause of the sign problem is
minimized. In order to find out a good reference system in the reweighting
method, we estimate the average reweighting factor by using the two-flavor PNJL
model and eventually find a good reference system.
