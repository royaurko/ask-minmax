We introduce a polynomial zeta function $\zeta^{(p)}_{P_n}$, related to
certain problems of mathematical physics, and compute its value and the value
of its first derivative at the origin $s=0$, by means of a very simple
technique. As an application, we compute the determinant of the Dirac operator
on quaternionic vector spaces.
