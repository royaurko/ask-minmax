We prove that two angle-compatible Coxeter generating sets of a given
finitely generated Coxeter group are conjugate provided one of them does not
admit any elementary twist. This confirms a basic case of a general conjecture
which describes a potential solution to the isomorphism problem for Coxeter
groups.
