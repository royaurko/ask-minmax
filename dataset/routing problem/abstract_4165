A posteriori error estimators are studied for discontinuous Galerkin methods
for solving a frictional contact problem, which is a representative elliptic
variational inequality of the second kind. The estimators are derived by
relating the error of the variational inequality to that of a linear problem.
Reliability and efficiency of the estimators are shown.
