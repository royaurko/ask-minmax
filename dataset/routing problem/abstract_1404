The fraction of substructures required to account for anomalous flux ratios
in gravitational lens systems appears to be higher than that predicted in the
standard cold dark matter cosmology. We present a possible alternative route to
anomalous flux ratios from lens galaxy environments. We consider the compound
lens system such that a lens galaxy lie in a group or cluster, and estimate the
contribution of substructures in the group/cluster to the fraction using an
analytic model of substructures. We find that the contribution becomes dominant
when the impact parameter of the lens is less than ~30% of the virial radius of
the group/cluster. This indicates that the environmental effect can partly
explain the high incidence of anomalous flux ratios.
