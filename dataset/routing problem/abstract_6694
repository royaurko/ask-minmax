We study Ising chains with arbitrary multispin finite-range couplings,
providing an explicit solution of the associated inverse Ising problem, i.e.
the problem of inferring the values of the coupling constants from the
correlation functions. As an application, we reconstruct the couplings of chain
Ising Hamiltonians having exponential or power-law two-spin plus three- or
four-spin couplings. The generalization of the method to ladders and to Ising
systems where a mean-field interaction is added to general finite-range
couplings is as well as discussed.
