In the stable marriage problem N men and N women have to be matched by pairs
under the constraint that the resulting matching is stable. We study the
statistical properties of stable matchings in the large N limit using both
numerical and analytical methods. Generalizations of the model including
singles and unequal numbers of men and women are also investigated.
