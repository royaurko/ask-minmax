We consider the problem of characterizing isomorphisms of types, or,
equivalently, constructive cardinality of sets, in the simultaneous presence of
disjoint unions, Cartesian products, and exponentials. Mostly relying on
results about polynomials with exponentiation that have not been used in our
context, we derive: that the usual finite axiomatization known as High-School
Identities (HSI) is complete for a significant subclass of types; that it is
decidable for that subclass when two types are isomorphic; that, for the whole
of the set of types, a recursive extension of the axioms of HSI exists that is
complete; and that, for the whole of the set of types, the question as to
whether two types are isomorphic is decidable when base types are to be
interpreted as finite sets. We also point out certain related open problems.
