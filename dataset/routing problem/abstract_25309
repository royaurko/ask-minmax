Nash's solution in his celebrated article on the bargaining problem calling
for maximization of product of marginal utilities is revisited; a different
line of argument supporting such a solution is suggested by straightforward or
more direct reasoning, and a conjecture is raised which purports uniqueness of
algorithm, namely his solution. Other alternative inferior algorithms are also
suggested. It is argued in this article that the scale invariance principle for
utility functions should and could be applied here, namely that utility
rescaling u'=a*u is allowed, while translations, adding a constant to utility
functions u'=u+b could not be applied here, since it is not invariant and leads
to contradictory behavior. Finally, special situations of ownership and
utilities, where trading is predicted not to take place at all because none is
profitable are examined, and then shown to be consistent with the scale
invariance principle.
