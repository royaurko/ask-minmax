We consider the self-adjoint Dirac operators on a finite interval with
summable matrix-valued potentials and general boundary conditions. For such
operators, we study the inverse problem of reconstructing the potential and the
boundary conditions of the operator from its eigenvalues and suitably defined
norming matrices.
