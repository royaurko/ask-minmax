We consider homogenization problems in the framework of deterministic optimal
control when the dynamics and running costs are completely different in two (or
more) complementary domains of the space $\R^N$. For such optimal control
problems, the three first contributors have shown that several value functions can
be defined, depending, in particular, of the choice is to use only "regular
strategies" or to use also "singular strategies". We study the homogenization
problem in these two different cases. It is worth pointing out that, if the
second one can be handled by usual partial differential equations method " \'a
la Lions-Papanicolaou-Varadhan" with suitable adaptations, the first case has
to be treated by control methods (dynamic programming).
