We deal with some generalizations on a Black--Scholes model arising in
financial mathematics. As novelty in this paper, we consider a variable
volatility and abstract functional boundary conditions, which allow us to treat
a very large class of problems involving Black--Scholes equation. Our main
results involve the existence of extremal solutions in presence of lower and
upper solutions. Some examples of application are provided too.
