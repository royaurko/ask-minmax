We consider the dynamical inverse problem for the Maxwell system on a
Riemannian 3-manifold with boundary in a time-optimal set-up. Using BC-method
we show that the data of the inverse problem (electromagnetic measurements on
the boundary) determine a $C$*-algebra, which has a spectrum homeomorphic to a
part of the manifold. This part depends on the duration of measurements.
