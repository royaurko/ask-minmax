Recently, Ghashghaie et al. have shown that some statistical aspects of fully
developed turbulence and exchange rate fluctuations exhibit striking
similarities (Nature 381, 767 (1996)). The contributors then suggested that the two
problems might be deeply connected, and speculated on the existence of an
`information cascade' which would play the role in finance of the well known
Kolmogorov energy cascade in turbulence. Here we want to convince the reader
that the two problems differ on a fundamental aspect, namely, correlations.
