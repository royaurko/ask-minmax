An exact analytic solution is obtained for a uniformly expanding, neutral,
infinitely conducting plasma sphere in an external dipole magnetic field. The
electrodynamical aspects related to the radiation and transformation of energy
were considered as well. The results obtained can be used in analyzing the
recent experimental and simulation data.
