Analysis and simulation of beaconless geo-routing protocols have been
traditionally conducted assuming equal communication ranges for the data and
control packets. In reality, this is not true since the communication range is
actually function of the packet length. Control packets are typically much
shorter than data packets. As a consequence, a substantial discrepancy exists
in practice between their respective communication ranges. In this paper, we
devise a practical link model for computing the effective communication range.
We further introduce two simple strategies for bridging the gap between the
control and data packet communication ranges. Our primary objective in this
paper is to construct a realistic analytical framework describing the
end-to-end performance of beaconless geo-routing protocols. Two flagship
protocols are selected in this paper for further investigation under the
developed framework. For a better perspective, the two protocols are actually
compared to a hypothetical limit case; one which offers optimal energy and
latency performance. Finally, we present four different application scenarios.
For each scenario, we highlight the geo-routing protocol which performs the
best and discuss the reasons behind it.
