Finding a match between partially available deformable shapes is a
challenging problem with numerous applications. The problem is usually
approached by computing local descriptors on a pair of shapes and then
establishing a point-wise correspondence between the two. In this paper, we
introduce an alternative correspondence-less approach to matching fragments to
an entire shape undergoing a non-rigid deformation. We use diffusion geometric
descriptors and optimize over the integration domains on which the integral
descriptors of the two parts match. The problem is regularized using the
Mumford-Shah functional. We show an efficient discretization based on the
Ambrosio-Tortorelli approximation generalized to triangular meshes. Experiments
demonstrating the success of the proposed method are presented.
