The logistic map is one of the simplest nonlinear dynamical systems that
clearly exhibit the route to chaos. In this paper, we explored the evolution of
the logistic map using an open-source microcontroller connected to an array of
light emitting diodes (LEDs). We divided the one-dimensional interval $[0,1]$
into ten equal parts, and associated and LED to each segment. Every time an
iteration took place a corresponding LED turned on indicating the value
returned by the logistic map. By changing some initial conditions of the
system, we observed the transition from order to chaos exhibited by the map.
