Using first principles calculations, we investigate the electronic and
magnetic properties of the trigonally distorted (R-3c) perovskite-derived
NiCrO$_3$. Within the local spin density approximation (LSDA), our calculations
show that this system is an exactly compensated half-metal (CHM). The local
spin moments of Cr 2.04, and antialigned Ni -1.41 and three oxygens -0.63 (in
the units of $\mu_B$), indicate high spin S=3/2 Cr$^{3+}$ and S=3/2
(NiO$_3$)$^{3-}$ units. Considering reasonable values of the on-site Coulomb
repulsion U on both Ni and Cr ions with LDA+U approach, this system becomes an
insulator (as reported by Chamberland and Cloud) having a narrow gap in the
spin-up channel, whereas the other channel has a large gap of ~3 eV. Although
inclusion of U seemingly leads to the transition Ni$^{2+} --> high spin S=3/2
Ni$^{3+}$, consistent with the experimentally observed effective moment, the
zero net moment remains unchanged due to either reduction of oxygen local
moments or enhancement of Cr local moment. Compression of volume by 10% leads
to CHM even when correlation effects are included.These results suggest the
possibility of a CHM state in NiCrO$_3$ and provide another route to search for
CHM, which is a property sought by many.
