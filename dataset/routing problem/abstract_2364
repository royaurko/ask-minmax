Role of 'O' defects in sensing pollutant with nanostructured SnO_2 is not
well understood, especially at low temperatures. SnO_2 nanoparticles were grown
by soft chemistry route followed by subsequent annealing treatment under
specific conditions. Nanowires were grown by chemical vapor deposition
technique. A systematic photoluminescence (PL) investigation of 'O' defects in
SnO_2 nanostructures revealed a strong correlation between shallow donors
created by the in-plane and the bridging 'O' vacancies and gas sensing at low
temperatures. These SnO_2 nanostructures detected methane (CH_4), a reducing
and green house gas at a low temperature of 50 ^oC. Response of CH_4 was found
to be strongly dependent on surface defect in comparison to surface to volume
ratio. Control over 'O' vacancies during the synthesis of SnO2 nanomaterials,
as supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and subsequent elucidation for
low temperature sensing are demonstrated.
