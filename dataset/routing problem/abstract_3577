The Douglas-Rachford reflection method is a general purpose algorithm useful
for solving the feasibility problem of finding a point in the intersection of
finitely many sets. In this chapter we demonstrate that applied to a specific
problem, the method can benefit from heuristics specific to said problem which
exploit its special structure. In particular, we focus on the problem of
protein conformation determination formulated within the framework of matrix
completion, as was considered in a recent paper of the present contributors.
