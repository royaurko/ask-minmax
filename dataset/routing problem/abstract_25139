In 1998, Blaze, Bleumer, and Strauss suggested a cryptographic primitive
named proxy re-signatures where a proxy turns a signature computed under
Alice's secret key into one from Bob on the same message. The semi-trusted
proxy does not learn either party's signing key and cannot sign arbitrary
messages on behalf of Alice or Bob. At CCS 2005, Ateniese and Hohenberger
revisited the primitive by providing appropriate security definitions and
efficient constructions in the random oracle model. Nonetheless, they left open
the problem of designing a multi-use unidirectional scheme where the proxy is
able to translate in only one direction and signatures can be re-translated
several times.
  This paper solves this problem, suggested for the first time 10 years ago,
and shows the first multi-hop unidirectional proxy re-signature schemes. We
describe a random-oracle-using system that is secure in the
Ateniese-Hohenberger model. The same technique also yields a similar
construction in the standard model (i.e. without relying on random oracles).
Both schemes are efficient and require newly defined -- but falsifiable --
Diffie-Hellman-like assumptions in bilinear groups.
