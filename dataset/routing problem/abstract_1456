A novel sol-gel route to c-axis orientated undoped and Co, Fe, Mn and V doped
ZnO films is reported. Sols were prepared from a hydrated zinc acetate
precursor and dimethyl formamide (DMF) solvent. Films were spin-coated on to
hydrophilic sapphire substrates then dried, annealed and post-annealed,
producing almost purely uniaxial ZnO crystallites and a high degree of
long-range structural order. Specific orientation of hexagonal crystallites is
demonstrated both perpendicular and parallel to the substrate surface. Cobalt
doping resulted in the formation of columnar ZnO nanocrystals. Vanadium doped
films formed the spinel oxide ZnAl2O4, resulting from the reaction between ZnO
and the sapphire substrate. Structural, optical and morphological
characterisation demonstrated the high quality of the films.
