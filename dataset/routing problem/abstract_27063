Low-rank modeling generally refers to a class of methods that solve problems
by representing variables of interest as low-rank matrices. It has achieved
great success in various fields including computer vision, data mining, signal
processing and bioinformatics. Recently, much progress has been made in
theories, algorithms and applications of low-rank modeling, such as exact
low-rank matrix recovery via convex programming and matrix completion applied
to collaborative filtering. These advances have brought more and more
attentions to this topic. In this paper, we review the recent advance of
low-rank modeling, the state-of-the-art algorithms, and related applications in
image analysis. We first give an overview to the concept of low-rank modeling
and challenging problems in this area. Then, we summarize the models and
algorithms for low-rank matrix recovery and illustrate their advantages and
limitations with numerical experiments. Next, we introduce a few applications
of low-rank modeling in the context of image analysis. Finally, we conclude
this paper with some discussions.
