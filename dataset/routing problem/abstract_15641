The planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect
gravitational wave signals from a wide range of sources. However, disentangling
individual signals from the source-dominated data stream is a challenging
problem and the focus of much current research. The problems are particularly
acute for detection of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), for which the
instantaneous signal amplitude is an order of magnitude below the level of the
instrumental noise, and the parameter space of possible signals is too large to
permit fully-coherent matched filtering. One possible approach is to attempt to
identify sources in a time-frequency spectrogram of the LISA data. This is a
computationally cheap method that may be useful as a first stage in a
hierarchical analysis. Initial results, evaluated using a significantly
simplified model of the LISA data stream, suggest that time-frequency
techniques might be able to detect the nearest few tens of EMRI events. In this
proceedings article, we briefly outline the methods that have so far been
applied to the problem, initial results and possible future directions for the
research.
