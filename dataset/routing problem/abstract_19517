We address the problem of map-making with data from the Planck Surveyor High
Frequency Instrument, with an emphasis on the understanding and modelling of
instrumental effects, and in particular that of sidelobe straylight. We propose
a map-making method which takes advantage of the very special properties of the
Planck scanning strategy along circular scans.
