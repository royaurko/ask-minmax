We establish a variant, which has the advantage of introducing only physical
characteristics, of the symmetric quasi linear first order system given by H.\
Friedrich for the evolution equations of gravitating fluid bodies in General
Relativity which can be important to solve realistic problems. We explicit the
conditions under which the system is hyperbolic and admits a well posed Cauchy
problem.
