The Cauchy problem for the hyperbolic Monge-Ampere equation is considered.
The equation has the most general form. Coefficients are arbitrary functions
depending on two independent variables, unknown function, and first order
derivatives. Sufficient conditions on the existence of a (unique) C^3-solution
on the whole plain are formulated.
