This paper is dedicated to the problem of verification of matrices for
unitary similarity. For the case of nonderogatory matrices, we have been able
to present the new solution for this problem based on geometric approach. The
main advantage of this approach is stability with respect to errors in the
initial upper triangular matrix. Since an upper triangular form is usually
obtained by approximate methods (e.g. by QR algorithm), the mentioned advantage
seems even more significant and allows us to propose the numerically stable and
efficient method for verification of matrices for unitary similarity.
