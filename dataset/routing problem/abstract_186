LDPC (Low Density Parity Check) codes are among the most powerful and widely
adopted modern error correcting codes. The iterative decoding algorithms
required for these codes involve high computational complexity and high
processing throughput is achieved by allocating a sufficient number of
processing elements (PEs). Supporting multiple heterogeneous LDPC codes on a
parallel decoder poses serious problems in the design of the interconnect
structure for such PEs. The aim of this work is to explore the feasibility of
NoC (Network on Chip) based decoders, where full flexibility in terms of
supported LDPC codes is obtained resorting to an NoC to connect PEs. NoC based
LDPC decoders have been previously considered unfeasible because of the cost
overhead associated to packet management and routing. On the contrary, the
designed NoC adopts a low complexity routing, which introduces a very limited
cost overhead with respect to architectures dedicated to specific classes of
codes. Moreover the paper proposes an efficient configuration technique, which
allows for fast on--the--fly switching among different codes. The decoder
architecture is scalable and VLSI synthesis results are presented for several
cases of study, including the whole set of WiMAX LDPC codes, WiFi codes and
DVB-S2 standard.
