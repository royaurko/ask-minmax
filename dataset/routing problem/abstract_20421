A non-empirical minimal atomic multipole expansion (MAME) defines atomic
charges or higher multipoles that reproduce electrostatic potential outside
molecules. MAME eliminates problems associated with redundancy and with
statistical sampling, and produces atomic multipoles in line with chemical
intuition.
