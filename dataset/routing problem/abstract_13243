Simulations - utilizing computers to solve complicated science and
engineering problems - are a key ingredient of modern science. The U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE) is a world leader in the development of
high-performance computing (HPC), the development of applied math and
algorithms that utilize the full potential of HPC platforms, and the
application of computing to science and engineering problems. An interesting
general question is whether the DOE can strategically utilize its capability in
simulations to advance innovation more broadly. In this article, I will argue
that this is certainly possible.
