A new class of exact solutions to the axisymmetric and stationary vacuum
Einstein equations containing n arbitrary complex parameters and one arbitrary
real solution of the axisymmetric three-dimensional Laplace equation is
presented. The solutions are related to Jacobi's inversion problem for
hyperelliptic Abelian integrals.
