This paper presents a method for inducing logic programs from examples that
learns a new class of concepts called first-order decision lists, defined as
ordered lists of clauses each ending in a cut. The method, called FOIDL, is
based on FOIL (Quinlan, 1990) but employs intensional background knowledge and
avoids the need for explicit negative examples. It is particularly useful for
problems that involve rules with specific exceptions, such as learning the
past-tense of English verbs, a task widely studied in the context of the
symbolic/connectionist debate. FOIDL is able to learn concise, accurate
programs for this problem from significantly fewer examples than previous
methods (both connectionist and symbolic).
