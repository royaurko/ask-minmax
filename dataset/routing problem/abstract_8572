A reconstruction problem is formulated for Sperner systems, and infinite
families of nonreconstructible Sperner systems are presented. This has an
application to a reconstruction problem for functions of several arguments and
identification minors. Sperner systems being representations of certain
monotone functions, infinite families of nonreconstructible functions are thus
obtained. The clones of Boolean functions are completely classified in regard
to reconstructibility.
