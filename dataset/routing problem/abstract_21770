We study asymptotics of eigenvalues, eigenfunctions and norming constants of
singular energy-dependent Sturm--Liouville equations with complex-valued
potentials. The analysis essentially exploits the integral representation of
solutions, which we derive using the connection of the problem under study and
a Dirac system of a special form.
