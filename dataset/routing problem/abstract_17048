In this paper we present an informal description of the Cyclic Inflation
scenario which allows our universe to "start" with a negative potential energy,
inflate, and then gracefully exit to a positive potential energy universe. We
discuss how this scenario fares in comparison with the standard inflationary
paradigm with respect to the classic cosmological puzzles associated with the
horizon, flatness and isotropy of our current universe. We also discuss some of
the most debilitating problems of cyclic cosmologies, Tolman's entropy problem,
and the problem with the overproduction of blackholes. We also sketch the
calculation of the primordial spectrum in these models and possible observable
signatures. We end with a special focus on the exit mechanism where the
universe can transition from the negative to a positive potential region. The
treatise is based on an ongoing collaboration between the contributors and closely
follows conference presentations given on the subject by TB.
