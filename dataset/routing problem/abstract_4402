We study the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem for the Stokes system on Lipschitz
domains. For any fixed $p>2$, we show that a reverse H\"{o}lder condition with
exponent $p$ is sufficient for the solvability of the Dirichlet problem with
boundary data in $L^p_N(\partial\Omega,\rn{d})$. Then we obtain a much simpler
condition which implies the reverse H\"{o}lder condition. Finally, we establish
the solvability ofthe $L^p$ Dirichlet problem for $d\geq 4$ and
$2-\varepsilon<p<\frac{2(d-1)}{d-3}+\varepsilon$.
