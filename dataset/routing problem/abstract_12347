A short review about vacuum energy and the cosmological constant is
presented. The observed acceleration of the universe introduces a new meV
energy scale. The problem is that, theoretically, the predicted vacuum energy
is many orders of magnitude larger than $10^{-3}$ eV. The problem is a link
between two Standard Models, namely the Standard Model of Particles and their
Interactions (where the vacuum energy appears) and the Standard Cosmological
Model (where a cosmological constant is a good fit to data), and perhaps it is
a clue in our search for new physics.
