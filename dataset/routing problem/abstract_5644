We discuss a basis set developed to calculate perturbation coefficients in an
expansion of the general N-body problem. This basis has two advantages. First,
the basis is complete order-by-order for the perturbation series. Second, the
number of independent basis tensors spanning the space for a given order does
not scale with N, the number of particles, despite the generality of the
problem. At first order, the number of basis tensors is 23 for all N although
the problem at first order scales as N^6. The perturbation series is expanded
in inverse powers of the spatial dimension. This results in a maximally
symmetric configuration at lowest order which has a point group isomorphic with
the symmetric group, S_N. The resulting perturbation series is order-by-order
invariant under the N! operations of the S_N point group which is responsible
for the slower than exponential growth of the basis. In this paper, we perform
the first test of this formalism including the completeness of the basis
through first order by comparing to an exactly solvable fully-interacting
problem of N particles with a two-body harmonic interaction potential.
