The tensor complementarity problem is a specially structured nonlinear
complementarity problem, then it has its particular and nice properties other
than ones of the classical nonlinear complementarity problem. In this paper, it
is proved that a tensor is an S-tensor if and only if the tensor
complementarity problem is feasible, and each Q-tensor is an S-tensor.
Furthermore, the boundedness of solution set of the tensor complementarity
problem is equivalent to the uniqueness of solution for such a problem with
zero vector. For the tensor complementarity problem with a strictly
semi-positive tensor, we proved the global upper bounds for solution of such a
problem. In particular, the upper bounds keep in close contact with the
smallest Pareto $H-$($Z-$)eigenvalue.
