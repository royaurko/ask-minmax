A mobile ad-hoc network is an autonomous system of mobile nodes connected by
wireless links in which nodes cooperate by forwarding packets for each other
thereby enabling communication beyond direct wireless transmission range. The
wireless and dynamic nature of ad-hoc networks makes them vulnerable to attacks
especially in routing protocols. Providing security in mobile ad-hoc networks
has been a major issue over the recent years. One of the prominent mesh base
reactive multicast routing protocols used in ad-hoc networks is On Demand
Multicast Routing protocol (ODMRP). The security of ODMRP is compromised by a
primary routing attack called black hole attack. In this attack a malicious
node advertises itself as having the shortest path to the node whose packets it
wants to intercept. This paper discusses the impact of black hole attack on
ODMRP under various scenarios. The performance is evaluated using metrics such
as packet delivery ratio and end to end delay for various numbers of senders
and receivers via simulation. Simulations are carried out using network
simulator ns-2. The results enable us to propose solutions to counter the
effect of black hole attack.
