We study the new problem of Huffman-like codes subject to individual
restrictions on the code-word lengths of a subset of the source words. These
are prefix codes with minimal expected code-word length for a random source
where additionally the code-word lengths of a subset of the source words is
prescribed, possibly differently for every such source word. Based on a
structural analysis of properties of optimal solutions, we construct an
efficient dynamic programming algorithm for this problem, and for an integer
programming problem that may be of independent interest.
