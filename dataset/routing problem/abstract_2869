Geometric programming problem is a powerful tool for solving some special
type non-linear programming problems. It has a wide range of applications in
optimization and engineering for solving some complex optimization problems.
Many applications of geometric programming are on engineering design problems
where parameters are estimated using geometric programming. When the parameters
in the problems are imprecise, the calculated objective value should be
imprecise as well. In this paper we have developed a method to solve geometric
programming problems where the exponent of the variables in the objective
function, cost coefficients and right hand side are multiple parameters. The
equivalent mathematical programming problems are formulated to find their
corresponding value of the objective function based on the duality theorem. By
applying a variable separable technique the multi-choice mathematical
programming problem is transformed into multiple one level geometric
programming problem which produces multiple objective values that helps
engineers to handle more realistic engineering design problems.
