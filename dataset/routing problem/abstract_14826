The uniqueness question of the multivariate moment problem is studied by
different methods: Hilbert space operators, complex function theory, polynomial
approximation, disintegration, integral geometry. Most of the known results in
the multi-dimensional case are reviewed and reproved, and a number of new
determinacy criteria are developed.
