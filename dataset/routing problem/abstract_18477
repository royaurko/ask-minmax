We re-analyse the resonant spin-flavour (RSF) solutions to the solar neutrino
problem in the framework of analytic solutions to the solar
magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) equations. By substantially eliminating the
arbitrariness associated to the magnetic field profile due to both mathematical
consistency and physical requirements we propose the simplest scheme (MHD-RSF,
for short) for solar neutrino conversion using realistic static MHD solutions.
Using such effective two-parameter scheme we perform the first global fit of
the recent solar neutrino data, including event rates as well as zenith angle
distributions and recoil electron spectra induced by solar neutrino
interactions in Superkamiokande. We compare quantitatively our simplest MHD-RSF
fit with vacuum oscillation (VAC) and MSW-type (SMA, LMA and LOW) solutions to
the solar neutrino problem using a common well-calibrated theoretical
calculation and fit procedure. We find our MHD-RSF fit to be somewhat better
than those obtained for the favored neutrino oscillation solutions, though not
in a statistically significant way. We briefly discuss the prospects to
disentangle our MHD-RSF scenario at future solar neutrino experiments, giving
some predictions for the SNO experiment.
