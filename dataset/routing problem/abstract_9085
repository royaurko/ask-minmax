The present lectures were prepared for the Faro International Summer School
on Factorization and Integrable Systems in September 2000. They were intended
for participants with the background in Analysis and Operator Theory but
without special knowledge of Geometry and Lie Groups. In order to make the main
ideas reasonably clear, I tried to use only matrix algebras such as
$\frak{gl}(n)$ and its natural subalgebras; Lie groups used are either GL(n)
and its subgroups, or loop groups consisting of matrix-valued functions on the
circle (possibly admitting an extension to parts of the Riemann sphere). I hope
this makes the environment sufficiently easy to live in for an analyst. The
main goal is to explain how the factorization problems (typically, the matrix
Riemann problem) generate the entire small world of Integrable Systems along
with the geometry of the phase space, Hamiltonian structure, Lax
representations, integrals of motion and explicit solutions. The key tool will
be the \emph{% classical r-matrix} (an object whose other guise is the
well-known Hilbert transform). I do not give technical details, unless they may
be exposed in a few lines; on the other hand, all motivations are given in full
scale whenever possible.
