This work consists in the asymptotic analysis of the solution of Poisson
equation in a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^{P}$ $(P=2,3)$ with a thin layer.
We use a method based on hierarchical variational equations to derive
asymptotic expansion of the solution with respect to the thickness of the thin
layer. We determine the first three terms of the expansion and prove the error
estimate made by truncating the expansion after a finite number of terms. Next,
using the first two terms of the asymptotic expansion, we show that we can
model the effect of the thin layer by a problem with transmission conditions of
order two.
