We consider the nonlinear problem \[(P) \;\; I u=f(x,u) \text{ in $\Omega$,}
\;\; u=0 \text{ on $\mathbb{R}^{N}\setminus\Omega$ }\] in an open bounded set
$\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{N}$, where $I$ is a nonlocal operator which may be
anisotropic and may have varying order. We assume mild symmetry and
monotonicity assumptions on $I$, $\Omega$ and the nonlinearity $f$ with respect
to a fixed direction, say $x_1$, and we show that any nonnegative weak solution
$u$ of $(P)$ is symmetric in $x_1$. Moreover, we have the following
alternative: Either $u\equiv 0$ in $\Omega$, or $u$ is strictly decreasing in
$|x_1|$. The proof relies on new maximum principles for antisymmetric
supersolutions of an associated class of linear problems.
