To prove liveness properties of concurrent systems, it is often necessary to
postulate progress, fairness and justness properties. This paper investigates
how the necessary progress, fairness and justness assumptions can be added to
or incorporated in a standard process-algebraic specification formalism. We
propose a formalisation that can be applied to a wide range of process
algebras. The presented formalism is used to reason about route discovery and
packet delivery in the setting of wireless networks.
