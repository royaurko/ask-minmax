In the contributor's article "Algebraic unsolvability of problem of absolute
stability of desynchronized systems" (Automat. Remote Control 51 (1990), no. 6,
pp. 754--759), it was shown that in general for linear desynchronized systems
there are no algebraic criteria of absolute stability. In this paper, a few
misprints occurred in the original version of the article are corrected, and
two figures are added.
