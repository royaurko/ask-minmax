The problem of two electrons in a two-dimensional random potential is
addressed numerically. Specifically, the role of the Coulomb interaction
between electrons on localization is investigated by writing the Hamiltonian on
a localized basis and diagonalizing it exactly. The result of that procedure is
discussed in terms of level statistics, the expectation value of the
electron-electron separation, and a configuration-space inverse participation
number. We argue that, in the interacting problem, a
localization-delocalization crossover in real space does not correspond exactly
to a Poisson-Wigner crossover in level statistics.
