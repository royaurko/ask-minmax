We use X^{s,b}-inspired spaces to prove a uniqueness result for Calderon's
problem in a Lipschitz domain under the assumption that the conductivity is
Lipschitz. For Lipschitz conductivities, we obtain uniqueness for
conductivities close to the identity in a suitable sense. We also prove
uniqueness for arbitrary C^1 conductivities.
