In this work, we solve a long-standing open problem: Is it true that the
convergence rate of the Lions' Robin-Robin nonoverlapping domain
decomposition(DD) method can be constant, independent of the mesh size $h$? We
closed this twenty-year old problem with a positive answer. Our theory is also
verified by numerical tests.
