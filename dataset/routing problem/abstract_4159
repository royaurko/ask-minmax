This paper presents a new approach to the two-interval Sturm-Liouville
eigenfunction expansions, based essentially on the method of integral
equations. We consider the Sturm-Liouville problem together with two
supplementary transmission conditions at one interior point. Further we develop
Green's function method for spectral analysis of the considered problem in
modified Hilbert space.
