We discuss the status of the Gribov-Pontecorvo (GP) solution to the solar
neutrino problem. This solution naturally appears in bimaximal neutrino mixing
and reduces the solar and atmospheric neutrino problems to vacuum oscillations
of three active neutrinos. The GP solution predicts an energy-independent
suppression of the solar neutrino flux. It is disfavoured by the rate of the
Homestake detector, but its statistical significance greatly improves, when the
chlorine rate and the boron neutrino flux are slightly rescaled, and when the
Super-Kamiokande neutrino spectrum is included in the analysis. Our results
show that rescaling of the chlorine signal by only 10% is sufficient for the GP
solution to exist, if the boron-neutrino flux is taken 10 -- 20% lower than
the SSM prediction. The regions allowed for the GP solution in the parameter
space are found and observational signatures of this solution are discussed.
