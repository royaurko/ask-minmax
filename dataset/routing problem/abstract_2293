MANET is a kind of Ad hoc network with mobile, wireless nodes. Because of its
special characteristics like dynamic topology, hop-by-hop communications and
easy and quick setup, MANET faced lots of challenges allegorically routing,
security and clustering. The security challenges arise due to MANETs
self-configuration and self-maintenance capabilities. In this paper, we present
an elaborate view of issues in MANET security. Based on MANETs special
characteristics, we define three security parameters for MANET. In addition we
divided MANET security into two different aspects and discussed each one in
details. A comprehensive analysis in security aspects of MANET and defeating
approaches is presented. In addition, defeating approaches against attacks have
been evaluated in some important metrics. After analyses and evaluations,
future scopes of work have been presented.
