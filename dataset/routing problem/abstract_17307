We study the computational complexity of controlling the result of an
election by breaking ties strategically. This problem is equivalent to the
problem of deciding the winner of an election under parallel universes
tie-breaking. When the chair of the election is only asked to break ties to
choose between one of the co-winners, the problem is trivially easy. However,
in multi-round elections, we prove that it can be NP-hard for the chair to
compute how to break ties to ensure a given result. Additionally, we show that
the form of the tie-breaking function can increase the opportunities for
control. Indeed, we prove that it can be NP-hard to control an election by
breaking ties even with a two-stage voting rule.
