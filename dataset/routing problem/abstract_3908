There is a connection between *-representations of algebras associated with
graphs and the problem about the spectrum of a sum of Hermitian operators
(spectral problem). For algebras associated with extended Dynkin graphs we give
an explicit description of the parameters for which there are
$*$-representations and an algorithm for constructing these representations.
