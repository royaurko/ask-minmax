In this paper we consider the rate distortion problem of discrete-time,
ergodic, and stationary sources with feed forward at the receiver. We derive a
sequence of achievable and computable rates that converge to the feed-forward
rate distortion. We show that, for ergodic and stationary sources, the rate
{align} R_n(D)=\frac{1}{n}\min I(\hat{X}^n\rightarrow X^n){align} is achievable
for any $n$, where the minimization is taken over the transition conditioning
probability $p(\hat{x}^n|x^n)$ such that $\ex{}{d(X^n,\hat{X}^n)}\leq D$. The
limit of $R_n(D)$ exists and is the feed-forward rate distortion. We follow
Gallager's proof where there is no feed-forward and, with appropriate
modification, obtain our result. We provide an algorithm for calculating
$R_n(D)$ using the alternating minimization procedure, and present several
numerical examples. We also present a dual form for the optimization of
$R_n(D)$, and transform it into a geometric programming problem.
