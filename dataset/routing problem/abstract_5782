In this paper we present an Action Language-Answer Set Programming based
approach to solving planning and scheduling problems in hybrid domains -
domains that exhibit both discrete and continuous behavior. We use action
language H to represent the domain and then translate the resulting theory into
an A-Prolog program. In this way, we reduce the problem of finding solutions to
planning and scheduling problems to computing answer sets of A-Prolog programs.
We cite a planning and scheduling example from the literature and show how to
model it in H. We show how to translate the resulting H theory into an
equivalent A-Prolog program. We compute the answer sets of the resulting
program using a hybrid solver called EZCSP which loosely integrates a
constraint solver with an answer set solver. The solver allows us reason about
constraints over reals and compute solutions to complex planning and scheduling
problems. Results have shown that our approach can be applied to any planning
and scheduling problem in hybrid domains.
