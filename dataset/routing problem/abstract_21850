The paper presents some bipartite graph $L_{k,n}$, so called $(k,n)$-level
graph, that arise by taking $k$-th and $(n-k)$-th levels of $n$-dimensional
Boolean algebra. Two results are establised: (1) precise description of a
distance (a shotest path) beteen arbitrary vertices and (2) solution of the
problem how many vertices may be reached in $i$ steps starting from some intial
point.
