We prove $C^{2,\alpha}$ regularity of sufficiently flat free boundaries, for
the thin one-phase problem in which the free boundary occurs on a lower
dimensional subspace. This problem appears also as a model of a one-phase free
boundary problem in the context of the fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{1/2}$.
