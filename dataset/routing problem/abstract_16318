A numerical solution to the problem of wave scattering by many small
particles is studied under the assumption k<<1, d>>a, where a is the size of
the particles and d is the distance between the neighboring particles.
Impedance boundary conditions are assumed on the boundaries of small particles.
The results of numerical simulation show good agreement with the theory. They
open a way to numerical simulation of the method for creating materials with a
desired refraction coefficient.
