The parameter synthesis problem for timed automata is undecidable in general
even for very simple reachability properties. In this paper we introduce
restrictions on parameter valuations under which the parameter synthesis
problem is decidable for LTL properties. The proposed problem could be solved
using an explicit enumeration of all possible parameter valuations. However, we
introduce a symbolic zone-based method for synthesising bounded integer
parameters of parametric timed automata with an LTL specification. Our method
extends the ideas of the standard automata-based approach to LTL model checking
of timed automata. Our solution employs constrained parametric difference bound
matrices and a suitable notion of extrapolation.
