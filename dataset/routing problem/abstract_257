Transmission of high-definition (HD) video is a promising application for 60
GHz wireless links, since very high transmission rates (up to several Gbit/s)
are possible. In particular we consider a sports stadium broadcasting system
where signals from multiple cameras are transmitted to a central location. Due
to the high pathloss of 60 GHz radiation over the large distances encountered
in this scenario, the use of relays might be required. The current paper
analyzes the joint selection of the routes (relays) and the compression rates
from the various sources for maximization of the overall video quality. We
consider three different scenarios: (i) each source transmits only to one relay
and the relay can receive only one data stream, and (ii) each source can
transmit only to a single relay, but relays can aggregate streams from
different sources and forward to the destination, and (iii) the source can
split its data stream into parallel streams, which can be transmitted via
different relays to the destination. For each scenario, we derive the
mathematical formulations of the optimization problem and re-formulate them as
convex mixed-integer programming, which can guarantee optimal solutions.
Extensive simulations demonstrate that high-quality transmission is possible
for at least ten cameras over distances of 300 m. Furthermore, optimization of
the video quality gives results that can significantly outperform algorithms
that maximize data rates.
