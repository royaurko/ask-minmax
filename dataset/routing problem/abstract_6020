Given an $\mathcal{H}$-polytope $P$ and a $\mathcal{V}$-polytope $Q$, the
decision problem whether $P$ is contained in $Q$ is co-NP-complete. This
hardness remains if $P$ is restricted to be a standard cube and $Q$ is
restricted to be the affine image of a cross polytope. While this hardness
classification by Freund and Orlin dates back to 1985, there seems to be only
limited progress on that problem so far.
  Based on a formulation of the problem in terms of a bilinear feasibility
problem, we study sum of squares certificates to decide the containment
problem. These certificates can be computed by a semidefinite hierarchy. As a
main result, we show that under mild and explicitly known preconditions the
semidefinite hierarchy converges in finitely many steps. In particular, if $P$
is contained in a large $\mathcal{V}$-polytope $Q$ (in a well-defined sense),
then containment is certified by the first step of the hierarchy.
