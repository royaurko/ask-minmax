Formal specification languages have long languished, due to the grave
scalability problems faced by complete verification methods. Runtime
verification promises to use formal specifications to automate part of the more
scalable art of testing, but has not been widely applied to real systems, and
often falters due to the cost and complexity of instrumentation for online
monitoring. In this paper we discuss work in progress to apply an event-based
specification system to the logging mechanism of the Mars Science Laboratory
mission at JPL. By focusing on log analysis, we exploit the "instrumentation"
already implemented and required for communicating with the spacecraft. We
argue that this work both shows a practical method for using formal
specifications in testing and opens interesting research avenues, including a
challenging specification learning problem.
