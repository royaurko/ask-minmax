Motivated by applications in grid computing and project management, we study
multiprocessor scheduling in scenarios where there is uncertainty in the
successful execution of jobs when assigned to processors. We consider the
problem of multiprocessor scheduling under uncertainty, in which we are given n
unit-time jobs and m machines, a directed acyclic graph C giving the
dependencies among the jobs, and for every job j and machine i, the probability
p_{ij} of the successful completion of job j when scheduled on machine i in any
given particular step. The goal of the problem is to find a schedule that
minimizes the expected makespan, that is, the expected completion time of all
the jobs.
  The problem of multiprocessor scheduling under uncertainty was introduced by
Malewicz and was shown to be NP-hard even when all the jobs are independent. In
this paper, we present polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the
problem, for special cases of the dag C. We obtain an O(log(n))-approximation
for the case of independent jobs, an
O(log(m)log(n)log(n+m)/loglog(n+m))-approximation when C is a collection of
disjoint chains, an O(log(m)log^2(n))-approximation when C is a collection of
directed out- or in-trees, and an
O(log(m)log^2(n)log(n+m)/loglog(n+m))-approximation when C is a directed
forest.
