We apply the method of correlation functions to the coefficient problem in
stochastic geometry. In particular, we give a proof for some universal patterns
conjectured by M. Zinsmeister for the second moments of the Taylor coefficients
for special values of kappa in the whole-plane Schramm-Loewner evolution
(SLE_kappa). We propose to use multi-point correlation functions for the study
of higher moments in coefficient problem. Generalizations related to the
Levy-type processes are also considered. The exact multifractal spectrum of
considered version of the whole-plane SLE_kappa is discussed.
