For a finite state automaton, a synchronizing sequence is an input sequence
that takes all the states to the same state. Checking the existence of a
synchronizing sequence and finding a synchronizing sequence, if one exists, can
be performed in polynomial time. However, the problem of finding a shortest
synchronizing sequence is known to be NP-hard. In this work, the usefulness of
Answer Set Programming to solve this optimization problem is investigated, in
comparison with brute-force algorithms and SAT-based approaches.
