Given a Boolean formula and a satisfying assignment, a flip is an operation
that changes the value of a variable in the assignment so that the resulting
assignment remains satisfying. We study the problem of computing the shortest
sequence of flips (if one exists) that transforms a given satisfying assignment
$s$ to another satisfying assignment $t$ of a Boolean formula. Earlier work
characterized the complexity of finding any (not necessarily the shortest)
sequence of flips from one satisfying assignment to another using Schaefer's
framework for classification of Boolean formulas. We build on it to provide a
trichotomy for the complexity of finding the shortest sequence of flips and
show that it is either in P, NP-complete, or PSPACE-complete.
  Our result adds to the small set of complexity results known for shortest
reconfiguration sequence problems by providing an example where the shortest
sequence can be found in polynomial time even though its length is not equal to
the symmetric difference of the values of the variables in $s$ and $t$. This is
in contrast to all reconfiguration problems studied so far, where polynomial
time algorithms for computing the shortest path were known only for cases where
the path modified the symmetric difference only.
