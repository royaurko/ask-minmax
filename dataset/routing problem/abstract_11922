We introduce a generalization of the Dobinski relation through which we
define a family of Bell-type numbers and polynomials. For all these sequences
we find the weight function of the moment problem and give their generating
functions. We provide a physical motivation of this extension in the context of
the boson normal ordering problem and its relation to an extension of the Kerr
Hamiltonian.
