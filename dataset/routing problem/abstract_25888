Suppose $B_i:= B(p,r_i)$ are nested balls of radius $r_i$ about a point $p$
in a dynamical system $(T,X,\mu)$. The question of whether $T^i x\in B_i$
infinitely often (i. o.) for $\mu$ a.e.\ $x$ is often called the shrinking
target problem. In many dynamical settings it has been shown that if
$E_n:=\sum_{i=1}^n \mu (B_i)$ diverges then there is a quantitative rate of
entry and $\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{1}{E_n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} 1_{B_i} (T^i x) \to
1$ for $\mu$ a.e. $x\in X$. This is a self-norming type of strong law of large
numbers. We establish self-norming central limit theorems (CLT) of the form
$\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{1}{a_n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} [1_{B_i} (T^i x)-\mu(B_i)] \to
N(0,1)$ (in distribution) for a variety of hyperbolic and non-uniformly
hyperbolic dynamical systems, the normalization constants are $a^2_n \sim E
[\sum_{i=1}^n 1_{B_i} (T^i x)-\mu(B_i)]^2$. Dynamical systems to which our
results apply include smooth expanding maps of the interval, Rychlik type maps,
Gibbs-Markov maps, rational maps and, in higher dimensions, piecewise expanding
maps. For such central limit theorems the main difficulty is to prove that the
non-stationary variance has a limit in probability.
