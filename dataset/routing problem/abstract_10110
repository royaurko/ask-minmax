Primal-dual splitting schemes are a class of powerful algorithms that solve
complicated monotone inclusions and convex optimization problems that are built
from many simpler pieces. They decompose problems that are built from sums,
linear compositions, and infimal convolutions of simple functions so that each
simple term is processed individually via proximal mappings, gradient mappings,
and multiplications by the linear maps. This leads to easily implementable and
highly parallelizable or distributed algorithms, which often obtain nearly
state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we analyze a monotone inclusion
problem that captures a large class of primal-dual splittings as a special
case. We introduce a unifying scheme and use some abstract analysis of the
algorithm to prove convergence rates of the proximal point algorithm,
forward-backward splitting, Peaceman-Rachford splitting, and
forward-backward-forward splitting applied to the model problem. Our ergodic
convergence rates are deduced under variable metrics, stepsizes, and
relaxation. Our nonergodic convergence rates are the first shown in the
literature. Finally, we apply our results to a large class of primal-dual
algorithms that are a special case of our scheme and deduce their convergence
rates.
