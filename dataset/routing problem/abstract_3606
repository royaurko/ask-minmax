In this paper, we present the controllability properties of Keplerian motion
controlled by low-thrust control systems. The low-thrust control system,
compared with high or even impulsive control system, provide a fuel-efficient
means to control the Keplerian motion of a satellite in restricted two-body
problem. We obtain that, for any positive value of maximum thrust, the motion
is controllable for orbital transfer problems. For two other typical problems:
de-orbit problem and orbital insertion problem, which have state constraints,
the motion is controllable if and only if the maximum thrust is bigger than a
limiting value. Finally, two numerical examples are given to show the numerical
method to compute the limiting value.
