A new route to the sintering of MgB2 has been identified, based on a reactive
infiltration of liquid Mg on a powdered B preform. The technique allows to
obtain large bulk manufacts in an inexpensive way, without the need of high
pressure apparatus. The best of the obtained samples shows a transport current
density of 3 kA/cm2 at 4.2K and 9 T. The critical aspects of the technology are
presented, together with the recent achievements and the perspective
applications.
