We review the basic ideas and results on the vortex dynamics in clean
superfluid Fermi systems. The forces acting on moving vortices are discussed
including the problem of the transverse force which was a matter of confusion
for quite a time. Finally, we formulate the equations of the vortex dynamics
which include all the forces and the inertial term associated with excitations
bound to the moving vortex.
