By analyzing the experimental data for various glass-forming liquids and
polymers, we find that non-exponentiality $\beta$ and the relaxation time
$\tau$ are uniquely related: $\log(\tau)$ is an approximately linear function
of $1/\beta$, followed by a crossover to a higher linear slope. We rationalize
the observed relationship using a recently developed approach, in which the
problem of the glass transition is discussed as the elasticity problem.
