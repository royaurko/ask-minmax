In this paper we show that (a) all the known exact solutions of the problem
of N-anyons in oscillator potential precisely arise from the collective degrees
of freedom, (b) the system is pseudo-integrable ala Richens and Berry. We
conclude that the exact solutions are trivial thermodynamically as well as
dynamically.
