We consider the direct and inverse spectral problems for Dirac operators on
$(0,1)$ with matrix-valued potentials whose entries belong to $L_p(0,1)$,
$p\in[1,\infty)$. We give a complete description of the spectral data
(eigenvalues and suitably introduced norming matrices) for the operators under
consideration and suggest a method for reconstructing the potential from the
corresponding spectral data.
