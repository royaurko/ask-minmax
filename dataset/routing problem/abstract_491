We study a pricing game in multi-hop relay networks where nodes price their
services and route their traffic selfishly and strategically. In this game,
each node (1) announces pricing functions which specify the payments it demands
from its respective customers depending on the amount of traffic they route to
it and (2) allocates the total traffic it receives to its service providers.
The profit of a node is the difference between the revenue earned from
servicing others and the cost of using others' services. We show that the
socially optimal routing of such a game can always be induced by an equilibrium
where no node can increase its profit by unilaterally changing its pricing
functions or routing decision. On the other hand, there may also exist
inefficient equilibria. We characterize the loss of efficiency by deriving the
price of anarchy at inefficient equilibria. We show that the price of anarchy
is finite for oligopolies with concave marginal cost functions, while it is
infinite for general topologies and cost functions.
