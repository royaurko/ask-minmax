The concept of deformation of Riemannian geometry is reviewed, with
applications to gravitation and cosmology. Starting with an analysis of the
cosmological constant problem, it is shown that space-times are deformable in
the sense of local change of shape. These deformations leave an observable
signature in the space-time, characterized by a conserved tensor, associated
with a tangent acceleration, defined by the extrinsic curvature of the
space-time. In the applications to cosmology, we find that the accelerated
expansion of the universe is the observable effect of the deformation,
dispensing with the cosmological constant and its problems.
