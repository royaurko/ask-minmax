The improvements of the observations of the solar system allowed by the use
of probes and big instruments let appear several problems: The frequencies of
the radio signals received from the probes sent over 5 UA from the Sun are too
high; the explanation by spicules or siphon-flows of the frequency shifts of UV
emissions observed on the surface of the sun by SOHO is not satisfactory; the
anisotropy of the CMB seems bound to the ecliptic.
  This problems are solved using a coherent optical effect, deduced from
standard spectroscopy and easily observed with lasers. In a gas containing
atomic hydrogen in states 2S and (or) 2P, transfers of energy between light
beams, allowed by thermodynamics, produce the required frequency shifts or
amplifications.
