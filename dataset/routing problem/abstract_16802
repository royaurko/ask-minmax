This paper deals with a problem in which two players share a previously
sliced pizza and try to eat as much amount of pizza as they can. It takes time
to eat each piece of pizza and both players eat pizza at the same rate. One is
allowed to take a next piece only after the person has finished eating the
piece on hand. Also, after the first piece is taken, one can only take a piece
which is adjacent to already-taken piece. This paper shows that, in this real
time setting, the starting player can always eat at least two-fifth of the
total size of the pizza. However, this may not be the best possible amount the
starting player can eat. It is a modified problem from an original one where
two players takes piece alternatively instead.
