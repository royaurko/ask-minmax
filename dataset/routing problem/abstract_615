The aim of this work is to change the routing strategy of AODV protocol (Ad
hoc On Demand Vector) in order to improve the energy consumption in mobile ad
hoc networks (MANET). The purpose is to minimize the regular period of HELLO
messages generated by the AODV protocol used for the research, development and
maintenance of routes. This information is useful to have an idea about battery
power levels of different network hosts. After storing this information, the
node elect the shortest path following the classical model used this
information to elect safest path (make a compromise) in terms of energy.
Transmitter node does not select another node as its battery will be exhausted
soon. Any node of the network can have the same information's about the
neighborhoods as well as other information about the energy level of the
different terminal to avoid routing using a link that will be lost due to an
exhausted battery of a node in this link. Analytical study and simulations by
Jist/SWANS have been conducted to note that no divergence relatively to the
classical AODV, a node can have this type of information that improves the
energy efficiency in ad hoc networks.
