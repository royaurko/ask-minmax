After introducing the sub-Riemannian geometry of the Heisenberg group Hn, n
\geq 1, we recall some basics about hypersurfaces endowed with the H-perimeter
measure and horizontal Green's formulas. Then, we describe a class of compact
closed hypersurfaces of constant horizontal mean curvature called
"Isoperimetric Profiles"(they are not CC-balls!); see Section 2.1. Our main
purpose is to study a closed eigenvalue problem on Isoperimetric Profiles, i.e.
LHS \phi + {\lambda}\phi = 0, where LHS is a 2nd order horizontal tangential
operator analogous to the Laplace-Beltrami operator; see Section 1.5. This is
done starting from the radial symmetry of Isoperimetric Profiles with respect
to a barycentric axis parallel to the center T of the Lie algebra hn. An
interesting feature of radial eigenfunctions is in that they are hypergeometric
functions; see Theorem 2.10. Finally, in Section 2.3 we shall begin the study
of the general case.
