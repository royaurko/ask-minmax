We consider a characteristic initial value problem for a class of symmetric
hyperbolic systems with initial data given on two smooth null intersecting
characteristic surfaces. We prove existence of solutions on a future
neighborhood of the initial surfaces. The general result is applied to general
semilinear wave equations, as well as the Einstein equations with or without
sources, and conformal variations thereof.
