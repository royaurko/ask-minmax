We study double integral representations of Christoffel-Darboux kernels
associated with two examples of Hermite-type matrix orthogonal polynomials. We
show that the Fredholm determinants connected with these kernels are related
through the Its-Izergin-Korepin-Slavnov (IIKS) theory with a certain
Riemann-Hilbert problem. Using this Riemann-Hilbert problem we obtain a Lax
pair whose compatibility conditions lead to a non-commutative version of the
Painleve' IV differential equation for each family.
