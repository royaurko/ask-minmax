We discuss the problem of the large discrepancy between the observed lifetime
ratio of $\Lambda_b$ to $B_d$ and the theoretical prediction obtained by the
heavy quark effective theory. A new possibility of solving this problem is
proposed from the viewpoint of operator product expansion and the lifetime
ratio of $\Omega_b$ to $B_d$ is predicted.
