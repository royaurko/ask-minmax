Algorithms for the computation of the forward and inverse geodesic problems
for an ellipsoid of revolution are derived. These are accurate to better than
15 nm when applied to the terrestrial ellipsoids. The solutions of other
problems involving geodesics (triangulation, projections, maritime boundaries,
and polygonal areas) are investigated.
