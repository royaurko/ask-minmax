This paper describes a new Spiral Dynamic Task Mapping heuristic for mapping
applications onto NoC-based Heterogeneous MPSoC. The heuristic proposed in this
paper attempts to map the tasks of an applications that are most related to
each other in spiral manner and to find the best possible path load that
minimizes the communication overhead. In this context, we have realized a
simulation environment for experimental evaluations to map applications with
varying number of tasks onto an 8x8 NoC-based Heterogeneous MPSoCs platform, we
demonstrate that the new mapping heuristics with the new modified dijkstra
routing algorithm proposed are capable of reducing the total execution time and
energy consumption of applications when compared to state-of the-art run-time
mapping heuristics reported in the literature.
