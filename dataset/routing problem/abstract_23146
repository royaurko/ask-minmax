The scattering process of a dynamic perturbation impinging on a draining-tub
model of an acoustic black hole is numerically solved in the time domain.
Analogies with real black holes of General Relativity are explored by using
recently developed mathematical tools involving finite elements methods,
excision techniques, and constrained evolution schemes for strongly hyperbolic
systems. In particular it is shown that superradiant scattering of a
quasi-monochromatic wavepacket can produce strong amplification of the signal,
offering the possibility of a significant extraction of rotational energy at
suitable values of the angular frequency of the vortex and of the central
frequency of the wavepacket. The results show that theoretical tools recently
developed for gravitational waves can be brought to fruition in the study of
other problems in which strong anisotropies are present.
