There are two main directions in this paper. One is to find sufficient
conditions to ensure the existence of weak solutions to thermoelectric
problems. At the steady-state, these problems consist by a coupled system of
elliptic equations of the divergence form, commonly accomplished with nonlinear
radiation-type conditions on at least on a nonempty part of the boundary of a
$C^1$ domain. The model under study takes the thermoelectric Peltier and
Seebeck effects into account, whose describe the Joule-Thomson effect. The
proof method makes recourse of a fixed point argument. To this end,
well-determined estimates are our main concern. The paper is in the second
direction for the derivation of explicit $W^{1,p}$-estimates $(p>2)$ for
solutions of nonlinear radiation-type problems, where the leading coefficient
is assumed to be a discontinuous function on the space variable. In particular,
the behavior of the leading coefficient is conveniently explicit on the
estimate of any solution. This regularity result is sufficiently general to
contribute to other problems, in which the dependence on the values of the
involved constants is essential, instead of the problem under study only.
