In this paper we show that the Mastermind Satisfiability Problem (MSP) is
NP-complete. The Mastermind is a popular game which can be turned into a
logical puzzle called Mastermind Satisfiability Problem in a similar spirit to
the Minesweeper puzzle. By proving that MSP is NP-complete, we reveal its
intrinsic computational property that makes it challenging and interesting.
This serves as an addition to our knowledge about a host of other puzzles, such
as Minesweeper, Mah-Jongg, and the 15-puzzle.
