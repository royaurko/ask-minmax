In the present work the mathematical apparatus necessary for solving of
second Stokes problem is developed. Second Stokes problem is the problem about
behavior of rarefied gas filling half-space. A plane, limiting half-space,
makes harmonious oscillations in this plane. At the heart of the analytical
decision the homogeneous Riemann boundary value problem lays. The decision of
homogeneous Riemann problem is function, factorizing problem. Integral
representations for factorizing function is deduced. With the help of
factorizing function the factorization formula for dispersion function is
proved. Zero of dispersion function are searched by means of the factorization
formula of dispersion function.
