This is an updated and expanded version of our earlier survey article
\cite{Gut5}. Section $\S 1$ introduces the subject matter. Sections $\S 2 - \S
4$ expose the basic material following the paradigm of elliptic, hyperbolic and
parabolic billiard dynamics. In section $\S 5$ we report on the recent work
pertaining to the problems and conjectures exposed in the survey \cite{Gut5}.
Besides, in section $\S 5$ we formulate a few additional problems and
conjectures. The bibliography has been updated and considerably expanded.
