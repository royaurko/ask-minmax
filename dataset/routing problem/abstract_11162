In this paper we consider three deeply connected classificational problems on
four-dimensional manifolds. First we consider and describe locally regular
distributions. Second we give a classification of almost complex structures of
general position in terms of distributions. Finally we classify nondegenerate
Monge-Ampere equations with two variables in terms of e-structures.
