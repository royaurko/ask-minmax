We prove the $C^{2,\alpha}$-regularity of the solution $u$ of the equation
[\det(u_{\bar{k} j}) = f, \quad f^{1/n} \in C^{\alpha}, \quad f \geq \lambda]
under the assumption in upper bound of $\Delta u$. Our result settles down the
regularity problem related to the paper \cite{Tian} (also see \cite{Zhang}).
