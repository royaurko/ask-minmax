As the amount of linked data published on the web grows, attempts are being
made to describe and measure it. However even basic statistics about a graph,
such as its size, are difficult to express in a uniform and predictable way. In
order to be able to sensibly interpret a statistic it is necessary to know how
it was calculate. In this paper we survey the nature of the problem and outline
a strategy for addressing it.
