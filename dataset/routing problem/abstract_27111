In this work we analyze the variational problem emerging from the Gutzwiller
approach to strongly correlated systems. This problem comprises the two main
steps: evaluation and minimization of the ground state energy $W$ for the
postulated Gutzwiller Wave Function (GWF). We discuss the available methods for
evaluating $W$, in particular the recently proposed diagrammatic expansion
method. We compare the two existing approaches to minimize $W$: the standard
approach based on the effective single-particle Hamiltonian (EH) and the
so-called Statistically-consistent Gutzwiller Approximation (SGA). On the
example of the superconducting phase analysis we show that these approaches
lead to the same minimum as it should be. However, the calculations within the
SGA method are easier to perform and the two approaches allow for a simple
cross-check of the obtained results. Finally, we show two ways of solving the
equations resulting from the variational procedure, as well as how to
incorporate the condition for a fixed number of particles.
