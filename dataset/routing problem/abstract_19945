Split Supersymmetry does not attempt to solve the hierarchy problem, but it
assumes a tuning condition for the electroweak scale. We clarify the meaning of
this condition and show how it is related to the underlying parameters. Simple
assumptions on the structure of the soft terms lead to predictions on tan beta
and on the physical Higgs mass.
