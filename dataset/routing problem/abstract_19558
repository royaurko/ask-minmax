We discuss different aspects of modern cosmology through a scalar field
potential construction method. We discuss the case of negative potential
cosmologies and its relation with oscillatory cosmic evolution, models with a
explicit interaction between dark energy and dark matter which address the
coincidence problem and also the case of non-zero curvature space.
