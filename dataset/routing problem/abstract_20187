We establish a characterization of the class of the simplest nearest neighbor
spin systems possesing the mean coverage function (mcf) that obeys a second
order differential equation, and derive explicit expressions for the mcf's of
the above models. Based on these expressions, the problem of ergodicity of the
models is studied and bounds for their spectral gaps are obtained.
