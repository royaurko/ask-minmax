In the cancerology domain, we were brought to make periodic mammography
images to monitor tumor patients. Oracle Database Management system (DBMS) is a
solution to manage these images with patient's data recorder. Knowing the large
size of medical images of mammograms, the Oracle DBMS saves these images
outside the Oracle database using external LOBs. The link between these images
and Oracle is done through the BFILE. At this level, two problems are raised:
the first problem is that access to these images can become impossible because
the link is likely to be broken. The second problem is security, the fact that
the images are saved outside the Oracle database, they do not benefit from its
powerful security. The protection of the integrity and confidentiality of data
and patient images are a necessity defended by laws and they must be preserved
against any uncontributorized access, alteration or destruction. In this paper, we
propose the method of reversible watermarking technique based on the difference
expansion to resolve these two problems and explore its use in search and
retrieval strategy of images.
