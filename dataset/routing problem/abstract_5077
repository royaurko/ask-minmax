Motivated by applications to social network analysis (SNA), we study the
problem of finding the maximum number of disjoint uni-color paths in an
edge-colored graph. We show the NP-hardness and the approximability of the
problem, and both approximation and exact algorithms are proposed. Since short
paths are much more significant in SNA, we also study the length-bounded
version of the problem, in which the lengths of paths are required to be upper
bounded by a fixed integer $l$. It is shown that the problem can be solved in
polynomial time for $l=3$ and is NP-hard for $l\geq 4$. We also show that the
problem can be approximated with ratio $(l-1)/2+\epsilon$ in polynomial time
for any $\epsilon >0$. Particularly, for $l=4$, we develop an efficient
2-approximation algorithm.
