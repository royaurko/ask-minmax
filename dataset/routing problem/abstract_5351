We study the complexity of a group of distance-constrained graph labeling
problems when parameterized by the neighborhood diversity ($nd$), which is a
natural graph parameter between vertex cover and clique width. Neighborhood
diversity has been used to generalize and speed up \sf{FPT} algorithms
previously parameterized by vertex cover, as is also demonstrated by our paper.
  We show that the {\sc Uniform Channel Assignment} problem is fixed parameter
tractable when parameterized by $nd$ and the largest weight and that every {\sc
$L(p_1, p_2,\dots, p_k)$-labeling} problem is \sf{FPT} when parameterized by
$nd$, maximum $p_i$ and $k$.
  These results furthermore yield an \sf{FPT} algorithms for {\sc $L(p_1,
p_2,\dots, p_k)$-labeling} and {\sc Channel Assignment} problems when
parameterized by vertex cover size, answering an open question of Fiala et al.:
{\emph Parameterized complexity of coloring problems: Treewidth versus vertex
cover}, generalizing their results beyond $L(2,1)$-labeling, and tightening the
complexity gap to clique width, where the problems are already hard for
constant clique width.
