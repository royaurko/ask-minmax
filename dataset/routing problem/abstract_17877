It has been widely known that performance of algorithms for NP-Hard problems
varies from instance to instance. This phenomenon has been observed, when we
comprehensively studied multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) on a
six benchmark instances of discrete time-cost trade-off problem (DTCTP).
Instead of using single algorithm to solve DTCTP, we use a portfolio approach
that takes multiple algorithms as its constituent. In this paper, we proposed
portfolio comprising of four MOEAs, Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm 2
(NSGA 2), the strength Pareto EA 2 (SPEA 2), Pareto archive evolutionary
strategy (PAES) and Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm 2 (NPGA 2) to solve DTCTP.
The result shows that the portfolio approach is computationally fast and
qualitatively superior than its constituent algorithms for all benchmark
instances. Moreover, portfolio approach provides an insight in selecting the
best algorithm for all instances of DTCTP.
