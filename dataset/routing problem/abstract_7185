We present and discuss a selected set of problems of classical mechanics and
thermodynamics. The discussion is based on the use of the impulse-momentum
equation simultaneously with the centre-of-mass (pseudo-work) equation or with
the first law of thermodynamics, depending on the nature of the problem.
Thermodynamical aspects of classical mechanics, namely problems involving
non-conservative forces or variation of mechanical energy are discussed, in
different reference frames, in connection with the use of one or the other
energy equation, and with the compliance of the Principle of Relativity.
