In this paper, we study the nonnegative matrix factorization problem under
the separability assumption (that is, there exists a cone spanned by a small
subset of the columns of the input nonnegative data matrix containing all
columns), which is equivalent to the hyperspectral unmixing problem under the
linear mixing model and the pure-pixel assumption. We present a family of fast
recursive algorithms, and prove they are robust under any small perturbations
of the input data matrix. This family generalizes several existing
hyperspectral unmixing algorithms and hence provides for the first time a
theoretical justification of their better practical performance.
