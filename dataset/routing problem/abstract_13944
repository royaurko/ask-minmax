Polynomial chaos expansions are used to reduce the computational cost in the
Bayesian solutions of inverse problems by creating a surrogate posterior that
can be evaluated inexpensively. We show, by analysis and example, that when the
data contain significant information beyond what is assumed in the prior, the
surrogate posterior can be very different from the posterior, and the resulting
estimates become inaccurate. One can improve the accuracy by adaptively
increasing the order of the polynomial chaos, but the cost may increase too
fast for this to be cost effective compared to Monte Carlo sampling without a
surrogate posterior.
