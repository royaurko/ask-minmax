We present a detailed analysis of how a mixed-anomaly-free U(1) symmetry can
be used to both resolve the slepton mass problem associated with Anomaly
Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking and generate the fermion mass hierarchy via the
Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism. Flavour changing neutral currents problems are
evaded by a specific form of the Yukawa textures.
