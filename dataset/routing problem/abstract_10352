In this paper, we study the cooperative robust output regulation problem for
linear uncertain multi-agent systems with both communication delay and input
delay by the distributed internal model approach. The problem includes the
leader-following consensus problem of linear multi-agent systems with
time-delay as a special case. We first generalize the internal model design
method to systems with both communication delay and input delay. Then, under a
set of standard assumptions, we have obtained the solution of the problem via
both the state feedback control and the output feedback control. In contrast
with the existing results, our results apply to general uncertain linear
multi-agent systems, accommodate a large class of leader signals, and achieve
the asymptotic tracking and disturbance rejection at the same time.
