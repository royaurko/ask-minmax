We present a local routing algorithm which guarantees delivery in all
connected graphs embedded on a known surface of genus $g$. The algorithm
transports $O(g\log n)$ memory and finishes in time $O(g^2n^2)$, where $n$ is
the size of the graph. It requires access to a homology basis for the surface.
This algorithm, GFR, may be viewed as a suitable generalization of Face Routing
(FR), the well-known algorithm for plane graphs, which we previously showed
does {\it not} guarantee delivery in graphs embedded on positive genus
surfaces. The problem for such surfaces is the potential presence of
homologically non-trivial closed walks which may be traversed by the right-hand
rule. We use an interesting mathematical property of homology bases (proven in
Lemma \ref{lem:connectFaceBdr}) to show that such walks will not impede GFR. FR
is at the base of most routing algorithms used in modern (2D) ad hoc networks:
these algorithms all involve additional local techniques to deal with
edge-crossings so FR may be applied. GFR should be viewed in the same light, as
a base algorithm which could for example be tailored to sensor networks on
surfaces in 3D. Currently there are no known efficient local, logarithmic
memory algorithms for 3D ad hoc networks. From a theoretical point of view our
work suggests that the efficiency advantages from which FR benefits are related
to the codimension one nature of an embedded graph in a surface rather than the
flatness of that surface (planarity).
