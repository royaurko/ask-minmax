We survey some known facts and open questions concerning the global
properties of 3+1 dimensional spacetimes containing a compact Cauchy surface.
We consider spacetimes with an $\ell$-dimensional Lie algebra of space-like
Killing fields. For each $\ell \leq 3$, we give some basic results and
conjectures on global existence and cosmic censorship.
