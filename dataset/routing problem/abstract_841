We present four different ways of deriving the Oseen tensor which is the
fundamental solution to the Stokes equations for an incompressible viscous
fluid. This solution corresponds to a point force acting on an infinite fluid.
The derivations follow the books of Kim & Karilla, Zapryanov & Tabakova, Dhont,
and Pozrikidis.
