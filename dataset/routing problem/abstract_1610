For technical applications thermoelectric materials with a high figure of
merit are desirable, and strongly correlated electron systems are very
promising in this respect. Since effects of bandstructure_and_ electronic
correlations play an important role for getting large figure of merits, the
combination of local density approximation_and_ dynamical mean field theory is
an ideal tool for the computational materials design of new thermoelectrics as
well as to help us understand the mechanisms leading to large figures of merits
in certain materials. This conference proceedings provides for a brief
introduction to the method and reviews recent results for LiRh_2O_4.
