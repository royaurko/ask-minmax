The nonlocal spin injection in lateral spin valves is highly expected to be
an effective method to generate a pure spin current for potential spintronic
application. However, the spin valve voltage, which decides the magnitude of
the spin current flowing into an additional ferromagnetic wire, is typically of
the order of 1 {\mu}V. Here we show that lateral spin valves with low resistive
NiFe/MgO/Ag junctions enable the efficient spin injection with high applied
current density, which leads to the spin valve voltage increased hundredfold.
Hanle effect measurements demonstrate a long-distance collective 2-pi spin
precession along a 6 {\mu}m long Ag wire. These results suggest a route to
faster and manipulable spin transport for the development of pure spin current
based memory, logic and sensing devices.
