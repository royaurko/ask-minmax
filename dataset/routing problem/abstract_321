We present a generalization of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (NMSSM), with an explicit mu-term and a supersymmetric mass for the
singlet superfield, as a route to alleviating the little hierarchy problem of
the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Though this model does not
address the mu-problem of the MSSM, we are able to generate masses for the
lightest neutral Higgs boson up to 140 GeV with top squarks below the TeV
scale, all couplings perturbative to the gauge unification scale, and with no
need to fine tune parameters in the scalar potential. This model, which we call
the S-MSSM, more closely resembles the MSSM phenomenologically than the NMSSM
as usually defined.
