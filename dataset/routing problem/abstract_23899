Given standard angular momentum and boost matrices, the commutation rules for
vector and momentum matrices are solved. The resulting matrix components are
displayed as detailed functions of spin with factors such as the square root of
(2A+1). For comparison and as an alternative, Lyubarskii's formulas in terms of
Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are recalled from the literature and displayed. A
set of these momentum matrices combined with the corresponding set of six
angular momentum and boost matrices form the generators of a nonunitary finite
dimensional representation of the Poincare group of translations, rotations and
boosts. A problem set is included.
