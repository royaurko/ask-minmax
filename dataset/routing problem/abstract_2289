We examine the electronic properties of newly discovered "ferroelectric"
metal LiOsO$_3$ combining density-functional and dynamical mean-field theories.
We show that the material is close to a Mott transition and that electronic
correlations can be tuned to engineer a Mott multiferroic state in 1/1
superlattice of LiOsO$_3$ and LiNbO$_3$. We use electronic structure
calculations to predict that the (LiOsO$_3$)$_1$/(LiNbO$_3$)$_1$ superlattice
is a type-I multiferroic material with a ferrolectric polarization of
41.2~$\mu$C cm$^{-2}$, Curie temperature of 927\,K, and N\'eel temperature of
671\,K. Our results support a route towards high-temperature multiferroics,
\emph{i.e.}, driving non-magnetic \emph{polar metals} into correlated
insulating magnetic states.
