The nature of gravity is fundamental to understand the scaffolding of the
Universe and its evolution. Einstein's general theory of relativity has been
scrutinized for over ninety five years and shown to describe accurately all
phenomena from the solar system to the Universe. However, this success is
achieved in the case of the largest scales provided one admits contributions to
energy-momentum tensor involving dark components such as dark energy and dark
matter. Moreover, the theory has well known shortcomings, such as the problem
of singularities, the cosmological constant problem and the well known initial
conditions problems for the cosmological description. Furthermore, general
relativity also does not fit the well known procedures that allow for the
quantization of the other fundamental interactions. In this discussion we
briefly review the experimental bounds on the foundational principles of
general relativity, and present three recent proposals to extend general
relativity or, at least, to regard it under different perspectives.
