The problem of finding the shortest linear shift-register capable of
generating t finite length sequences over some field F is considered. A similar
problem was already addressed by Feng and Tzeng. They presented an iterative
algorithm for solving this multi-sequence shift-register synthesis problem,
which can be considered as generalization of the well known Berlekamp-Massey
algorithm. The Feng-Tzeng algorithm works indeed, if all t sequences have the
same length. This paper focuses on multi-sequence shift-register synthesis for
generating sequences of varying length. It is exposed, that the Feng-Tzeng
algorithm does not always give the correct solution in this case. A modified
algorithm is proposed and formally proved, which overcomes this problem.
