Cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) is a key tool for solving problems
in real algebraic geometry and beyond. In recent years a new approach has been
developed, where regular chains technology is used to first build a
decomposition in complex space. We consider the latest variant of this which
builds the complex decomposition incrementally by polynomial and produces CADs
on whose cells a sequence of formulae are truth-invariant. Like all CAD
algorithms the user must provide a variable ordering which can have a profound
impact on the tractability of a problem. We evaluate existing heuristics to
help with the choice for this algorithm, suggest improvements and then derive a
new heuristic more closely aligned with the mechanics of the new algorithm.
