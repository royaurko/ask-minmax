The fractional Yamabe problem, proposed by Gonz\'{a}lez-Qing (2013, Anal.
PDE) is a geometric question which concerns the existence of metrics with
constant fractional scalar curvature. It extends the phenomena which were
discovered in the classical Yamabe problem and the boundary Yamabe problem to
the realm of nonlocal conformally invariant operators. We investigate a
non-compactness property of the fractional Yamabe problem by constructing
bubbling solutions to its small perturbations.
