We show how to determine the $k$-th bit of Chaitin's algorithmically random
real number $\Omega$ by solving $k$ instances of the halting problem. From this
we then reduce the problem of determining the $k$-th bit of $\Omega$ to
determining whether a certain Diophantine equation with two parameters, $k$ and
$N$, has solutions for an odd or an even number of values of $N$. We also
demonstrate two further examples of $\Omega$ in number theory: an exponential
Diophantine equation with a parameter $k$ which has an odd number of solutions
iff the $k$-th bit of $\Omega$ is 1, and a polynomial of positive integer
variables and a parameter $k$ that takes on an odd number of positive values
iff the $k$-th bit of $\Omega$ is 1.
