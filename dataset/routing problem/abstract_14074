Mass discrepancy is one of the problems that is pending a solution in
(massive) binary star research field. The problem is often solved by
introducing an additional near core mixing into evolutionary models, which
brings theoretical masses of individual stellar components into an agreement
with the dynamical ones. In the present study, we perform a detailed analysis
of two massive binary systems, V380 Cyg and Sigma Sco, to provide an
independent, asteroseismic measurement of the overshoot parameter, and to test
state-of-the-art stellar evolution models.
