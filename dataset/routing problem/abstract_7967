We consider Hamiltonian with $N$ point interactions in $\R^d, d=2,3,$ all
with the same coupling constant, placed at vertices of an equilateral polygon
$\PP_N$. It is shown that the ground state energy is locally maximized by a
regular polygon. The question whether the maximum is global is reduced to an
interesting geometric problem.
