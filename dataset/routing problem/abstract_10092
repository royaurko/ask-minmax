We present a new problem on configurations of points, which is a new version
of a similar problem by Atiyah and Sutcliffe, except it is related to the Lie
group $\operatorname{Sp}(n)$, instead of the Lie group $\operatorname{U}(n)$.
Denote by $\mathfrak{h}$ a Cartan algebra of $\operatorname{Sp}(n)$, and
$\Delta$ the union of the zero sets of the roots of $\operatorname{Sp}(n)$
tensored with $\mathbb{R}^3$, each being a map from $\mathfrak{h} \otimes
\mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3$. We wish to construct a map $(\mathfrak{h}
\otimes \mathbb{R}^3) \backslash \Delta \to \operatorname{Sp}(n)/T^n$ which is
equivariant under the action of the Weyl group $W_n$ of $\operatorname{Sp}(n)$
(the symplectic Berry-Robbins problem). Here, the target space is the flag
manifold of $\operatorname{Sp}(n)$, and $T^n$ is the diagonal $n$-torus. The
existence of such a map was proved by Atiyah and Bielawski in a more general
context. We present an explicit smooth candidate for such an equivariant map,
which would be a genuine map provided a certain linear independence conjecture
holds. We prove the linear independence conjecture for $n=2$.
