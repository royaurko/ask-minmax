Transform coding is routinely used for lossy compression of discrete sources
with memory. The input signal is divided into N-dimensional vectors, which are
transformed by means of a linear mapping. Then, transform coefficients are
quantized and entropy coded. In this paper we consider the problem of
identifying the transform matrix as well as the quantization step sizes. We
study the challenging case in which the only available information is a set of
P transform decoded vectors. We formulate the problem in terms of finding the
lattice with the largest determinant that contains all observed vectors. We
propose an algorithm that is able to find the optimal solution and we formally
study its convergence properties. Our analysis shows that it is possible to
identify successfully both the transform and the quantization step sizes when P
>= N + d where d is a small integer, and the probability of failure decreases
exponentially to zero as P - N increases.
