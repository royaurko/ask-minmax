Human activities comprise several sub-activities performed in a sequence and
involve interactions with various objects. This makes reasoning about the
object affordances a central task for activity recognition. In this work, we
consider the problem of jointly labeling the object affordances and human
activities from RGB-D videos. We frame the problem as a Markov Random Field
where the nodes represent objects and sub-activities, and the edges represent
the relationships between object affordances, their relations with
sub-activities, and their evolution over time. We formulate the learning
problem using a structural SVM approach, where labeling over various alternate
temporal segmentations are considered as latent variables. We tested our method
on a dataset comprising 120 activity videos collected from four subjects, and
obtained an end-to-end precision of 81.8% and recall of 80.0% for labeling the
activities.
