The ternary Goldbach conjecture, or three-primes problem, asserts that every
odd integer $n$ greater than $5$ is the sum of three primes. The present paper
proves this conjecture.
  Both the ternary Goldbach conjecture and the binary, or strong, Goldbach
conjecture had their origin in an exchange of letters between Euler and
Goldbach in 1742. We will follow an approach based on the circle method, the
large sieve and exponential sums. Some ideas coming from Hardy, Littlewood and
Vinogradov are reinterpreted from a modern perspective. While all work here has
to be explicit, the focus is on qualitative gains.
  The improved estimates on exponential sums are proven in the contributor's papers
on major and minor arcs for Goldbach's problem. One of the highlights of the
present paper is an optimized large sieve for primes. Its ideas get reapplied
to the circle method to give an improved estimate for the minor-arc integral.
