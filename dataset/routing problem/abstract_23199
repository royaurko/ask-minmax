In nuclear many-body problems the short-range correlation between two
nucleons is well described by the corresponding correlation in the {two}-body
problem. Therefore, as a first step in any attempt at an analogous description
of many-quark systems, it is necessary to know the two-quark correlation. With
this in mind, we study the light quark distribution in a heavy-light meson with
a static heavy quark. The charge and matter radial distributions of these
heavy-light mesons are measured on a lattice with a light quark mass about that
of the strange quark. Both distributions can be well fitted upto r approx 0.7
fm with the exponential form w_i^2(r), where w_i(r)=A exp(-r/r_i). For the
charge(c) and matter(m) distributions r_c approx 0.32(2) fm and r_m \approx
0.24(2) fm. We also discuss the normalisation of the total charge (defined to
be unity in the continuum limit) and matter integrated over all space, finding
1.30(5) and 0.4(1) respectively for a lattice spacing approx 0.17 fm.
