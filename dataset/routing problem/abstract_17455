Bisimulation equivalence (or bisimilarity) of first-order grammars is
decidable, as follows from the decidability result by Senizergues (1998, 2005)
that has been given in an equivalent framework of equational graphs with finite
out-degree, or of pushdown automata (PDA) with only deterministic and popping
epsilon-transitions. Benedikt, Goeller, Kiefer, and Murawski (2013) have shown
that the bisimilarity problem for PDA (even) without epsilon-transitions is
nonelementary. Here we show Ackermann-hardness for bisimilarity of first-order
grammars. The grammars do not use explicit epsilon-transitions, but they
correspond to the above mentioned PDA with (deterministic and popping)
epsilon-transitions, and this feature is substantial in the presented
lower-bound proof. The proof is based on a (polynomial) reduction from the
reachability problem of reset (or lossy) counter machines, for which the
Ackermann-hardness has been shown by Schnoebelen (2010); in fact, this
reachability problem is known to be Ackermann-complete in the hierarchy of
fast-growing complexity classes defined by Schmitz (2013).
