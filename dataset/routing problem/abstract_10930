We demonstrate that the free motion of any two-dimensional rigid body colliding
elastically with two parallel, flat walls is equivalent to a billiard system.
Using this equivalence, we analyze the integrable and chaotic properties of
this new class of billiards. This provides a demonstration that coin tossing,
the prototypical example of an independent random process, is a completely
chaotic (Bernoulli) problem. The related question of which billiard geometries
can be represented as rigid body systems is examined.
