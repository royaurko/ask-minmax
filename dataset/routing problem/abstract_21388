We introduce in this paper a new approach to the problem of the convergence
to equilibrium for kinetic equations. The idea of the approach is to prove a
'weak' coercive estimate, which implies exponential or polynomial convergence
rate. Our method works very well not only for hypocoercive systems in which the
coercive parts are degenerate but also for the linearized Boltzmann equation.
