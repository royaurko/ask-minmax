We review three Li problems. First, the Li problem in the Sun, for which some
previous studies have argued that it may be Li-poor compared to other Suns.
Second, we discuss the Li problem in planet hosting stars, which are claimed to
be Li-poor when compared to field stars. Third, we discuss the cosmological Li
problem, i.e. the discrepancy between the Li abundance in metal-poor stars
(Spite plateau stars) and the predictions from standard Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis. In all three cases we find that the "problems" are naturally
explained by non-standard mixing in stars.
