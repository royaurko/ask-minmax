In this correspondence, we introduce a minimax regret criteria to the least
squares problems with bounded data uncertainties and solve it using
semi-definite programming. We investigate a robust minimax least squares
approach that minimizes a worst case difference regret. The regret is defined
as the difference between a squared data error and the smallest attainable
squared data error of a least squares estimator. We then propose a robust
regularized least squares approach to the regularized least squares problem
under data uncertainties by using a similar framework. We show that both
unstructured and structured robust least squares problems and robust
regularized least squares problem can be put in certain semi-definite
programming forms. Through several simulations, we demonstrate the merits of
the proposed algorithms with respect to the the well-known alternatives in the
literature.
