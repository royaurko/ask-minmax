This article concerns the question: which subsets of ${\mathbb R}^m$ can be
represented with Linear Matrix Inequalities, LMIs? This gives some perspective
on the scope and limitations of one of the most powerful techniques commonly
used in control theory. Also before having much hope of representing
engineering problems as LMIs by automatic methods one needs a good idea of
which problems can and cannot be represented by LMIs. Little is currently known
about such problems. In this article we give a necessary condition, we call
"rigid convexity", which must hold for a set ${\cC} \in {\mathbb R}^m$ in order
for ${\cC}$ to have an LMI representation. Rigid convexity is proved to be
necessary and sufficient when $m=2$. This settles a question formally stated by
Pablo Parrilo and Berndt Sturmfels in [PSprep].
