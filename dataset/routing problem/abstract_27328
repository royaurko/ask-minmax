This paper proposes a new cooperative protocol which involves cooperation
between primary and secondary users. We consider a cognitive setting with one
primary user and multiple secondary users. The time resource is partitioned
into discrete time slots. Each time slot, a secondary user is scheduled for
transmission according to time division multiple access, and the remainder of
the secondary users, which we refer to as secondary relays, attempt to decode
the primary packet. Afterwards, the secondary relays employ cooperative
beamforming to forward the primary packet and to provide protection to the
secondary destination of the secondary source scheduled for transmission from
interference. We characterize the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of the
primary source under the proposed protocol. We consider certain quality of
service for each user specified by its required throughput. The optimization
problem is stated under such condition. It is shown that the optimization
problem is linear and can be readily solved. We show that the sum of the
secondary required throughputs must be less than or equal to the probability of
correct packets reception.
