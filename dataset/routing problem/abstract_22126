Information-theoretic work for wiretap channels is mostly based on random
coding schemes. Designing practical coding schemes to achieve
information-theoretic security is an important problem. By applying the two
recently developed techniques for polar codes, we propose a polar coding scheme
to achieve the secrecy capacity of the general wiretap channel.
