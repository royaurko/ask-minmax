We study the finite temperature statistical mechanics of Hamiltonian paths
between a set of N quenched randomly distributed points in a finite domain D.
The energy of the path is a function of the distance between neighboring points
on the path, an example is the traveling salesman problem where the energy is
the total distance between neighboring points on the path. We show how the
system can be analyzed in the limit of large N without using the replica
method.
