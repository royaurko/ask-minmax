We consider a size-structured model for cell division and address the
question of determining the division (birth) rate from the measured stable size
distribution of the population. We formulate such question as an inverse
problem for an integro-differential equation posed on the half line. We develop
firstly a regular dependency theory for the solution in terms of the
coefficients and, secondly, a novel regularization technique for tackling this
inverse problem which takes into account the specific nature of the equation.
Our results rely also on generalized relative entropy estimates and related
Poincar\'e inequalities.
