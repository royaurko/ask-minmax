The theory of weak measurement, proposed by Aharonov and coworkers, has been
applied by Steinberg to the long-discussed traversal time problem. The
uncertainty and ambiguity that characterize this concept from the perspective
of von Neumann measurement theory apparently vanish, and joint probabilities
and conditional averages become meaningful concepts. We express the Larmor
clock and some other well-known methods in the weak measurement formalism. We
also propose a method to determine higher moments of the traversal time
distribution in terms of the outcome of a gedanken experiment, by introducing
an appropriate operator. Since the weak measurement approach can sometimes lead
to unphysical results, for example average negative reflection times and higher
moments, the interpretation of the results obtained remains an open problem.
