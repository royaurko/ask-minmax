We consider a quadratic matrix boundary value problem with equations and
boundary conditions dependent on a spectral parameter. We study an inverse
problem that consists in recovering the differential pencil by the so-called
Weyl matrix. We obtain asymptotic formulas for the solutions of the considered
matrix equation. Using the ideas of the method of spectral mappings, we prove
the uniqueness theorem for this inverse problem.
