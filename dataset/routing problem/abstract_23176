A novel way of defining limits in classical statistics is proposed. This is a
natural extension of the original Neyman's method, and has the desirable
property that only information relevant to the problem is used in making
statistical inferences. The result is a strong restriction on the allowed
confidence bands, excluding in full generality pathologies as empty confidence
regions or unstable solutions. The method is completely general and directly
applicable to all problems of limits.
