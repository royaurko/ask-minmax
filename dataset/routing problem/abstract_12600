We consider zeta functions: $Z(f ;P ;s)=\sum_{\m \in \N^{n}} f(m_1,..., m_n)
P(m_1,..., m_n)^{-s/d}$ where $P \in \R [X_1,..., X_n]$ has degree $d$ and $f$
is a function arithmetic in origin, e.g. a multiplicative function. In this
paper, I study the meromorphic continuation of such series beyond an a priori
domain of absolute convergence when $f$ and $P$ satisfy properties one
typically meets in applications. As a result, I prove an explicit asymptotic
for a general class of lattice point problems subject to arithmetic
constraints.
