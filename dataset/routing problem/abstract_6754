The Muskat problem models the evolution of the interface given by two
different fluids in porous media. The Rayleigh-Taylor condition is natural to
reach the linear stability of the Muskat problem. We show that the
Rayleigh-Taylor condition may hold initially but break down in finite time. As
a consequence of the method used, we prove the existence of water waves
turning.
