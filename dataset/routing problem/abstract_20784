We address the problem of estimating the Weibull tail-coefficient which is
the regular variation exponent of the inverse failure rate function. We propose
a family of estimators of this coefficient and an associate extreme quantile
estimator. Their asymptotic normality are established and their asymptotic
mean-square errors are compared. The results are illustrated on some finite
sample situations.
