In the k-arc connected subgraph problem, we are given a directed graph G and
an integer k and the goal is the find a subgraph of minimum cost such that
there are at least k-arc disjoint paths between any pair of vertices. We give a
simple (1 + 1/k)-approximation to the unweighted variant of the problem, where
all arcs of G have the same cost. This improves on the 1 + 2/k approximation of
Gabow et al. [GGTW09].
  Similar to the 2-approximation algorithm for this problem [FJ81], our
algorithm simply takes the union of a k in-arborescence and a k
out-arborescence. The main difference is in the selection of the two
arborescences. Here, inspired by the recent applications of the rounding by
sampling method (see e.g. [AGM+ 10, MOS11, OSS11, AKS12]), we select the
arborescences randomly by sampling from a distribution on unions of k
arborescences that is defined based on an extreme point solution of the linear
programming relaxation of the problem. In the analysis, we crucially utilize
the sparsity property of the extreme point solution to upper-bound the size of
the union of the sampled arborescences.
  To complement the algorithm, we also show that the integrality gap of the
minimum cost strongly connected subgraph problem (i.e., when k = 1) is at least
3/2 - c, for any c > 0. Our integrality gap instance is inspired by the
integrality gap example of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem [CGK06],
hence providing further evidence of connections between the approximability of
the two problems.
