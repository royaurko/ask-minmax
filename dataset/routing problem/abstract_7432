In this work, we explore how probabilistic programs can be used to represent
policies in sequential decision problems. In this formulation, a probabilistic
program is a black-box stochastic simulator for both the problem domain and the
agent. We relate classic policy gradient techniques to recently introduced
black-box variational methods which generalize to probabilistic program
inference. We present case studies in the Canadian traveler problem, Rock
Sample, and a benchmark for optimal diagnosis inspired by Guess Who. Each study
illustrates how programs can efficiently represent policies using moderate
numbers of parameters.
