Motivated both by considerations of the generation of large-scale
astrophysical magnetic fields and by potential problems with mean magnetic
field generation by turbulent convection, we investigate the mean electromotive
force (emf) resulting from the magnetic buoyancy instability of a rotating
layer of stratified magnetic field, considering both unidirectional and sheared
fields. We discuss why the traditional decomposition into $\alpha$ and $\beta$
effects is inappropriate in this case, and that it is only consideration of the
entire mean emf that is meaningful. By considering a weighted average of the
unstable linear eigenmodes, and averaging over the horizontal plane, we obtain
depth-dependent emfs. For the simplified case of isothermal, ideal MHD we are
able to obtain an analytic expression for the emf; more generally the emf has
to be determined numerically. We calculate how the emf depends on the various
parameters of the problem, particularly the rotation rate and the latitude of
the magnetic layer.
