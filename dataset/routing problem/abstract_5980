We consider elliptic equations of order $2m$ in a domain $G\subset\mathbb
R^n$ with nonlocal conditions that connect the values of the unknown function
and its derivatives on $(n-1)$-dimensional submanifolds $\Upsilon_i$ (where
$\bigcup_i\Upsilon_i=\partial G$) with the values on
$\omega_{is}(\overline\Upsilon_i)\subset\overline G$. Nonlocal elliptic
problems in dihedral angles arise as model problems near the conjugation points
$g\in\overline\Upsilon_i\cap\Upsilon_j\ne\varnothing$, $i\ne j$. We study the
case where the transformations $\omega_{is}$ correspond to nonlinear
transformations in the model problems. It is proved that the operator of the
problem remains Fredholm and its index does not change as we pass from linear
argument transformations to nonlinear ones.
