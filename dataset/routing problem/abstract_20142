We study the lift-and-project procedures of Lov\'asz and Schrijver for 0-1
integer programming problems. We prove that the procedure using the positive
semidefiniteness constraint is not better than the one without it, in the worst
case. Various examples are considered. We also provide geometric conditions
characterizing when the positive semidefiniteness constraint does not help.
