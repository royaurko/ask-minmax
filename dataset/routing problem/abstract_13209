The gravitation theory is modified on the base of geometric identity and
equivalence principle. This makes it possible to generalize the geodesics and
solve several problems of classical GRT such as flat rotation curves of the
spiral galaxies, Tully-Fisher law and some others and reveal the fundamental
(geometrical) origin of the cH acceleration value. The developed approach
contains all the results of the classical GRT and has promising cosmological
consequences.
