A consistent geometrical approach to EPR non-locality as well as other
non-local effects in QM like the Aharanov-Bohm effect, Berry phase, Gauge
theories within Yang-Mills theory etc. is possible within the framework of
sheaf cohomology. This sheds new light on our understanding on non-local
correlations in QM, and provides a fundamental mathematical approach to
fundamental problems in physics.
