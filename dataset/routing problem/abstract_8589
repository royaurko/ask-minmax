We derive a second order estimate for the first m eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions of the linearized Gel'fand problem associated to solutions which
blow-up at m points. This allows us to determine, in some suitable situations,
some qualitative properties of the first m eigenfunctions as the number of
points of concentration or the multiplicity of the eigenvalue .
