Adding 3 right-handed (sterile) neutrino to the Standard Model (SM) can solve
several "beyond the Standard Model" problems within one consistent framework:
explain neutrino oscillations and baryon asymmetry of the Universe and provide
a dark matter (DM) candidate. In this talk I will present current status of
astrophysical searches for the DM sterile neutrino.
