We consider a generalization of the Lotka-McKendrick problem describing the
dynamics of an age-structured population with time-dependent vital rates.
  The generalization consists in allowing the initial and the boundary
conditions to be derivatives of the Dirac measure. We construct a unique
$\D'$-solution in the framework of intrinsic multiplication of distributions.
We also investigate the regularity of this solution.
