In this paper, we study the problem of finding the largest possible set of s
points and s lines in a projective plane of order q, such that that none of the
s points lie on any of the s lines. We prove that s <= 1+(q+1)(\sqrt{q}-1). We
also show that equality can be attained in this bound whenever q is an even
power of two.
