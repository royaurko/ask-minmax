We investigate control problems for wave-Petrovsky coupled systems in the
presence of memory terms. By writing the solutions as Fourier series, we are
able to prove Ingham type estimates, and hence reachability results. Our
findings have applications in viscoelasticity theory and linear acoustic
theory.
