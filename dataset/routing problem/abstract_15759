String theoretic axion is a prime candidate for the QCD axion solving the
strong CP problem. For a successful realization of the QCD axion in string
theory, one needs to stabilize moduli including the scalar partner (saxion) of
the QCD axion, while keeping the QCD axion unfixed until the low energy QCD
instanton effects are turned on. We note that a simple generalization of KKLT
moduli stabilization provides such set-up realizing the axion solution to the
strong CP problem. Although some details of moduli stabilization are different
from the original KKLT scenario, this set-up leads to the mirage mediation
pattern of soft SUSY breaking terms as in the KKLT case, preserving flavor and
CP as a consequence of approximate scaling and axionic shift symmetries. The
set-up also gives an interesting pattern of moduli masses which might avoid the
cosmological moduli, gravitino and axion problems.
