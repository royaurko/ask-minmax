The exponential growth of Internet traffic has made public servers
increasingly vulnerable to uncontributorized accesses and intrusions. In addition to
maintaining low latency for the client, filtering uncontributorized accesses has
become one of the major concerns of a server maintainer. This implementation of
an Intrusion Detection System distinguishes between the traffic coming from
clients and the traffic originated from the attackers, in an attempt to
simultaneously mitigate the problems of both latency and security. We then
present the results of a series of stress and scalability tests, and suggest a
number of potential uses for such a system. As computer attacks are becoming
more and more difficult to identify the need for better and more efficient
intrusion detection systems increases. The main problem with current intrusion
detection systems is high rate of false alarms. Using honeypots provides
effective solution to increase the security.
