We present a probabilistic approach to the obstacle problem for for the
$p$-Laplace operator. The solutions are approximated by running processes
determined by tug-of-war games plus noise, and letting the step size go to
zero, not unlike the case when Brownian motion is approximated by random walks.
Rather than stopping the process when the boundary is reached, the value
function is obtained by maximizing over all possible stopping times that are
smaller than the exit time of the domain.
