One of the major problems in biology is related to protein folding. The
folding process is known to depend on both the protein's sequence (1-D) and
structure (3-D). Both these properties need to be considered when aligning two
proteins; they are also influenced by the evolutionary distance between the
proteins to be aligned. We propose a Bayesian method to align proteins using
both the sequence and 3-D structure of the proteins. The problem involves what
are known as "gaps" in the sequence, which we incorporate in our model, and an
MCMC implementation is provided. Also, we show that the procedure can be used
to give insight into evolutionary distances between proteins. Various
illustrative examples from protein bioinformatics are studied.
