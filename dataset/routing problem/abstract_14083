A known first order method to find a feasible solution to a conic problem is
an adapted von Neumann algorithm. We improve the distance reduction step there
by projecting onto the convex hull of previously generated points using a
primal active set quadratic programming (QP) algorithm. The convergence theory
is improved when the QPs are as large as possible. For problems in R^2, we
analyze our algorithm by epigraphs and the monotonicity of subdifferentials.
Logically, the larger the set to project onto, the better the performance per
iteration, and this is indeed seen in our numerical experiments.
