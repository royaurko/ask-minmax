We give necessary and sufficient inequalities for the existence of long exact
sequences of m finite abelian p-groups with fixed isomorphy types. This problem
is related to some generalized Littlewood-Richardson coefficients that we
define in this paper. We also show how this problem is related to eigenvalues
of Hermitian matrices satisfying certain (in)equalities. When m=3, we recover
the Horn type inequalities that solve the saturation conjecture for
Littlewood-Richardson coefficients and Horn's conjecture.
