In this work, we study a basic and practically important strategy to help
prevent and/or delay an outbreak in the context of network: limiting the
contact between individuals. In this paper, we introduce the average
neighborhood size as a new measure for the degree of being small-world and
utilize it to formally define the desmall- world network problem. We also prove
the NP-hardness of the general reachable pair cut problem and propose a greedy
edge betweenness based approach as the benchmark in selecting the candidate
edges for solving our problem. Furthermore, we transform the de-small-world
network problem as an OR-AND Boolean function maximization problem, which is
also an NP-hardness problem. In addition, we develop a numerical relaxation
approach to solve the Boolean function maximization and the de-small-world
problem. Also, we introduce the short-betweenness, which measures the edge
importance in terms of all short paths with distance no greater than a certain
threshold, and utilize it to speed up our numerical relaxation approach. The
experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our
approaches.
