We tackle the problem of robust dialogue processing from the perspective of
language engineering. We propose an agent-oriented architecture that allows us
a flexible way of composing robust processors. Our approach is based on
Shoham's Agent Oriented Programming (AOP) paradigm. We will show how the AOP
agent model can be enriched with special features and components that allow us
to deal with classical problems of dialogue understanding.
