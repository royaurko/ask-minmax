We use the gauge/gravity duality to study a model of walking technicolor. The
latter is a phenomenologically promising framework for dynamical electroweak
symmetry breaking. A traditional problem for technicolor models has been the
need to address gauge theories at strong coupling. Recent developments in
gauge/gravity duality provide a powerful tool for handling this problem. First,
we revisit previously considered holographic models of QCD-like technicolor
from D-branes. In particular, we develop analytical understanding of earlier
numerical computations of the Peskin-Takeuchi S-parameter. Then we apply this
method to the investigation of a model of walking technicolor, obtained by
embedding D7 - anti-D7 probe branes in a recently discovered type IIB
background dual to walking behaviour. As a necessary step, we also show that
there is an embedding of the techniflavor branes, that realizes chiral symmetry
breaking. Finally, we show that the divergences that appear in the S-parameter
can be removed by using holographic renormalization.
