This article proposes a stochastic model to obtain the end-to-end delay law
between two nodes of a Delay Tolerant Network (DTN). We focus on the commonly
used Binary Spray and Wait (BSW) routing protocol and propose a model that can
be applied to homogeneous or heterogeneous networks (i.e. when the
inter-contact law parameter takes one or several values). To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first model allowing to estimate the delay distribution
of Binary Spray and Wait DTN protocol in heterogeneous networks. We first
detail the model and propose a set of simulations to validate the theoretical
results.
