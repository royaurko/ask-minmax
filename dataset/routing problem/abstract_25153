A channel machine consists of a finite controller together with several fifo
channels; the controller can read messages from the head of a channel and write
messages to the tail of a channel. In this paper, we focus on channel machines
with insertion errors, i.e., machines in whose channels messages can
spontaneously appear. Such devices have been previously introduced in the study
of Metric Temporal Logic. We consider the termination problem: are all the
computations of a given insertion channel machine finite? We show that this
problem has non-elementary, yet primitive recursive complexity.
