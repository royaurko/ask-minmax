We solve the eigenvalue problem of general relativity for the case of charged
black holes in two-dimensional heterotic string theory, derived by McGuigan et
al. For the case of $m^{2}>q^{2}$, we find a physically acceptable
time-dependent growing mode; thus the black hole is unstable. The extremal case
$m^{2}=q^{2}$ is stable.
