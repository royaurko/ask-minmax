In this paper we study the global existence of small data solutions to the
Cauchy problem for the semilinear wave equation with scale-invariant damping.
We obtain estimates for the solution and its energy with the same decay rate of
the linear problem. We extend our results to a model with polynomial speed of
propagation and to a model with an exponential speed of propagation.
