In this paper, we are interested in the classical problem of restoring data
degraded by a convolution and the addition of a white Gaussian noise. The
originality of the proposed approach is two-fold. Firstly, we formulate the
restoration problem as a nonlinear estimation problem leading to the
minimization of a criterion derived from Stein's unbiased quadratic risk
estimate. Secondly, the deconvolution procedure is performed using any analysis
and synthesis frames that can be overcomplete or not. New theoretical results
concerning the calculation of the variance of the Stein's risk estimate are
also provided in this work. Simulations carried out on natural images show the
good performance of our method w.r.t. conventional wavelet-based restoration
methods.
