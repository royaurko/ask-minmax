We give a deterministic 2^{O(n)} algorithm for computing an M-ellipsoid of a
convex body, matching a known lower bound. This has several interesting
consequences including improved deterministic algorithms for volume estimation
of convex bodies and the shortest and closest lattice vector problems under
general norms.
