Let V be a finite faithful completely reducible FG-module for a finite field
F and a finite group G. In various cases explicit linear bounds in |V| are
given for the numbers of conjugacy classes k(GV) and k(G) of the semidirect
product GV and of the group G respectively. These results concern the so-called
non-coprime k(GV)-problem.
