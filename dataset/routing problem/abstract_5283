Let us consider the singularly perturbed model problem
$Lu:=-\varepsilon\Delta u-bu_x+c u =f$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
conditions on $\Gamma=\partial\Omega$ $u|_\Gamma =0$ on the unit-square
$\Omega=(0,1)^2$. Assuming that $b>0$ is of order one, the small perturbation
parameter $0<\varepsilon\ll 1$ causes boundary layers in the solution. In order
to solve above problem numerically, it is beneficial to resolve these layers.
On properly layer-adapted meshes we can apply finite element methods and
observe convergence.
  We will consider standard Galerkin and stabilised FEM applied to above
problem. Therein the polynomial order $p$ will be usually greater then two,
i.e. we will consider higher-order methods. Most of the analysis presented here
is done in the standard energy norm.
  Nevertheless, the question arises: Is this the right norm for this kind of
problem, especially if characteristic layers occur? We will address this
question by looking into a balanced norm.
  Finally, a-posteriori error analysis is an important tool to construct
adapted meshes iteratively by solving discrete problems, estimating the error
and adjusting the mesh accordingly. We will present estimates on the Green's
function associated with $L$, that can be used to derive pointwise error
estimators.
