Let K be a number field. A finite group G is called K-admissible if there
exists a G-crossed product K-division algebra. K-admissibility has a necessary
condition called K-preadmissibility that is known to be sufficient in many
cases. It is a 20 year old open problem to determine whether two number fields
K and L with different degrees over Q can have the same admissible groups. We
construct infinitely many pairs of number fields (K,L) such that K is a proper
subfield of L and K and L have the same preadmissible groups. This provides
evidence for a negative answer to the problem. In particular, it follows from
the construction that K and L have the same odd order admissible groups.
