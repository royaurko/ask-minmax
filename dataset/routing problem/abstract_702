This paper is focused on a discussion of parameters and heuristics that are
expected to assist multihop routing in becoming more sensitive to node
mobility. We provide a discussion concerning existing and a few proposed
parameters. Moreover, the work also discusses two new heuristics based on the
notion of link duration. The heuristics are compared based on a meaningful set
of scenarios that attain different mobility aspects.
