We investigate power allocation for users in a spectrum underlay cognitive
network. Our objective is to find a power control scheme that allocates
transmit power for both primary and secondary users so that the overall network
throughput is maximized while maintaining the quality of service (QoS) of the
primary users greater than a certain minimum limit. Since an optimum solution
to our problem is computationally intractable, as the optimization problem is
non-convex, we propose an iterative algorithm based on sequential geometric
programming, that is proved to converge to at least a local optimum solution.
We use the proposed algorithm to show how a spectrum underlay network would
achieve higher throughput with secondary users operation than with primary
users operating alone. Also, we show via simulations that the loss in primary
throughput due to the admission of the secondary users is accompanied by a
reduction in the total primary transmit power.
