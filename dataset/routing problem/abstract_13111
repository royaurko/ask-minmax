Let n_\delta be the number of \delta-nodal curves lying in a suitably ample
complete linear system |L| and passing through appropriately many points on a
smooth projective complex algebraic surface. A major open problem is to
understand the behavior of n_\delta, specifically to finish off Lothar
G\"ottsche's mostly proved 1997 conjectures and then go on to treat the new
refinements by G\"ottsche and Vivek Shende. Five subproblems are explained, and
work on them is surveyed.
