In this paper we perform a full gauge-fixing of the phase space of four
dimensional General Relativity (GR) of Lorentzian signature for the time
symmetric case, using the CDJ variables. In particular, the Gauss' law
constraint in the chosen gauge meets the conditions of the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya
theorem for first order, quasilinear PDEs. This implies the existence of a
unique analytic solution to the initial value constraints problem in some
region of 3-space, featuring four free functions per spacetime point. This
result constitutes a step toward addressal of the reduced phase space problem
of GR.
