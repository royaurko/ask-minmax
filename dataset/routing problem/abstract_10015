A Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) finite element method for
transient convection-diffusion-reaction equation in time-dependent domains is
proposed. In particular, a convection dominated transient scalar problem is
considered. The time-dependent domain is handled by the arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach, whereas the SUPG finite element method is
used for the spatial discretization. Further, the first order backward Euler
and the second order Crank-Nicolson methods are used for the temporal
discretization. It is shown that the stability of the semidiscrete (continuous
in time) conservative ALE-SUPG equation is independent of the mesh velocity,
whereas the stability of the fully discrete problem is unconditionally stable
for implicit Euler method and is only conditionally stable for Crank-Nicolson
time discretization. Numerical results are presented to show the influence of
the SUPG stabilization parameter in a time-dependent domain. Further, the
proposed numerical scheme is applied to a boundary/layer problem in a
time-dependent domain.
