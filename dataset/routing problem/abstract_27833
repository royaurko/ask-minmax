In this paper we consider the problem of generating arbitrary three-party
correlations from a combination of public and secret correlations. Two parties
-- called Alice and Bob -- share perfectly correlated bits that are secret from
a collaborating third party, Charlie. At the same time, all three parties have
access to a separate source of correlated bits, and their goal is to convert
these two resources into multiple copies of some given tripartite distribution
$P_{XYZ}$. We obtain a single-letter characterization of the trade-off between
public and private bits that are needed to achieve this task. The rate of
private bits is shown to generalize Wyner's classic notion of common
information held between a pair of random variables. The problem we consider is
also closely related to the task of secrecy formation in which $P_{XYZ}$ is
generated using public communication and local randomness but with Charlie
functioning as an adversary instead of a collaborator. We describe in detail
the differences between the collaborative and adversarial scenarios.
