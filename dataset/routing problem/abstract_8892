We prove regularity results such as interior Lipschitz regularity and
boundary continuity for the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem associated to a class of
parabolic equations inspired by the evolutionary $p$-Laplacian, but extending
it at a wide scale. We employ a regularization technique of viscosity-type that
we find interesting in itself.
