Mobile phones have developed into complex platforms with large numbers of
installed applications and a wide range of sensitive data. Application security
policies limit the permissions of each installed application. As applications
may interact, restricting single applications may create a false sense of
security for the end users while data may still leave the mobile phone through
other applications. Instead, the information flow needs to be policed for the
composite system of applications in a transparent and usable manner. In this
paper, we propose to employ static analysis based on the software architecture
and focused data flow analysis to scalably detect information flows between
components. Specifically, we aim to reveal transitivity of trust problems in
multi-component mobile platforms. We demonstrate the feasibility of our
approach with Android applications, although the generalization of the analysis
to similar composition-based architectures, such as Service-oriented
Architecture, can also be explored in the future.
