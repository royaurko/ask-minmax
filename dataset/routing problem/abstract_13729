Case-based planning can take advantage of former problem-solving experiences
by storing in a plan library previously generated plans that can be reused to
solve similar planning problems in the future. Although comparative worst-case
complexity analyses of plan generation and reuse techniques reveal that it is
not possible to achieve provable efficiency gain of reuse over generation, we
show that the case-based planning approach can be an effective alternative to
plan generation when similar reuse candidates can be chosen.
