Two Delone sets are called homometric when they share the same
autocorrelation or Patterson measure. A model set LAMBDA within a given cut and
project scheme is a Delone set that is defined through a window W in internal
space. The autocorrelation measure of LAMBDA is a pure point measure whose
coefficients can be calculated via the so-called covariogram of W. Two windows
with the same covariogram thus result in homometric model sets. On the other
hand, the inverse problem of determining LAMBDA from its diffraction image
ultimately amounts to reconstructing W from its covariogram. This is also known
as Matheron's covariogram problem. It is well studied in convex geometry, where
certain uniqueness results have been obtained in recent years. However, for
non-convex windows, uniqueness fails in a relevant way, so that interesting
applications to the homometry problem emerge. We discuss this in a simple
setting and show a planar example of distinct homometric model sets.
