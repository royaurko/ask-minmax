In this paper we study one dimensional parabolic free boundary value problem
with a nonlocal (integro-differential) condition on the free boundary. We
establish global existence-uniqueness of classical solutions assuming that the
initial-boundary data are sufficiently smooth and satisfy some compatibility
conditions. Our approach is based on analysis of an equivalent system of
nonlinear integral equations.
