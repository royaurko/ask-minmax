The problem of fast computation of multivariate density estimation is still
an open research problem. In our view, the existing solutions don't resolve
this matter in a satisfactory way. One of the most elegant and efficient
approach utilizes fast Fourier transform. Unfortunately, the existing FFT-based
solution suffers a serious bottleneck, as it can accurately operate only with
constrained (that is diagonal) multivariate bandwidth matrices. This seams a
quite serious limitation. In this paper we describe the problem and give a
satisfactory solution.
