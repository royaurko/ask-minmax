Space and time dependent temepreture correlation fucntions in the Hiesenberg
XXO chain are evaluated in the magnetic field. The other name of the model is
isotropic xy model in the transverse magnetic field. In the thermodynamic limit
correlations in the model are represented as Fredhom determinanat. We expect
this to to solve the problem of evaluation of asymptotics of temperature
correlations.
