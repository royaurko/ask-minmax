This is an updated version of the NOvA proposal. The detector is a 30 kiloton
tracking calorimeter, 15.7 m by 15.7 m by 132 m long, with alternating
horizontal and vertical rectangular cells of liquid scintillator contained in
PVC extrusion modules. Light from each 15.7 m long cell of liquid scintillator
filled PVC is collected by a wavelength shifting fiber and routed to an
avalanche photodiode pixel. The reach of NOvA for sin^2(2_theta_13) and related
topics is increased relative to earlier versions of the proposal with the
assumption of increased protons available from the Fermilab Main Injector
following the end of Tevatron Collider operations in 2009.
