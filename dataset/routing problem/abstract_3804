In the present paper we show that the normal contact problem between two
elastic bodies in the halfspace approximation can always be transformed to an
equivalent problem of the indentation of a profile into an elastic Winkler
foundation. Once determined, the equivalent profile can be used also for
tangential contact problems and arbitrary superimposed normal and tangential
loading histories as well as for treating of contact problems with linearly
viscoelastic bodies. In the case of axis-symmetric shapes, the equivalent
profile is given by the MDR integral transformation. For all other shapes, the
profile is deduced from the solution of the elastic contact normal problem,
which can be obtained numerically or experimentally.
