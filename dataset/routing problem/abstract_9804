This article, written to appear as a chapter in "The Springer Handbook of
Spacetime", is a review of the initial value problem for Einstein's
gravitational field theory in general relativity. Designed to be accessible to
graduate students who have taken a first course in general relativity, the
article first discusses how to reformulate the spacetime fields and spacetime
covariant field equations of Einstein's theory in terms of fields and field
equations compatible with a 3+1 foliation of spacetime with spacelike
hypersurfaces. It proceeds to discuss the arguments which show that the initial
value problem for Einstein's theory is well-posed, in the sense that for any
given set of initial data satisfying the Einstein constraint equations, there
is a (maximal) spacetime solution of the full set of Einstein equations,
compatible with the given set of data. The article then describes how to
generate initial data sets which satisfy the Einstein constraints, using the
conformal (and conformal thin sandwich) method, and using gluing techniques.
The article concludes with comments regarding stability and long term behavior
of solutions of Einstein's equations generated via the initial value problem.
