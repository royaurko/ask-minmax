Many physical problems can be formulated as operator equations of the form Au
= f. If these operator equations are ill-posed, we then resort to finding the
approximate solutions numerically. Ill-posed problems can be found in the ?elds
of mathematical analysis, mathematical physics, geophysics, medicine,
tomography, technology and ecology. The theory of ill-posed problems was
developed in the 1960's by several mathematicians, mostly Soviet and American.
In this report we review the methods of solving ill-posed problems and recent
developments in this ?eld. We review the variational regularization method, the
method of quasi-solution, iterative regularization method and the dynamical
systems method. We focus mainly on the dynamical systems method as it is found
that the dynamical systems method is more effi?cient than the regularization
procedure.
