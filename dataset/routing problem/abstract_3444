Inspired by Quantum Mechanics, we reformulate Hilbert's tenth problem in the
domain of integer arithmetics into either a problem involving a set of
infinitely coupled differential equations or a problem involving a Shr\"odinger
propagator with some appropriate kernel. Either way, Mathematics and Physics
could be combined for Hilbert's tenth problem and for the notion of effective
computability.
