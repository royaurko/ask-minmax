We mainly explore the linear algebraic structure like SU(2) or SU(1,1) of the
shift operators for some one-dimensional exactly solvable potentials in this
paper. During such process, a set of method based on original diagonalizing
technique is presented to construct those suitable operator elements, J0, J_\pm
that satisfy SU(2) or SU(1,1) algebra. At last, the similarity between radial
problem and one-dimensional potentials encourages us to deal with the radial
problem in the same way.
