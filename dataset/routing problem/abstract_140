In most of the shortest path problems like vehicle routing problems and
network routing problems, we only need an efficient path between two points
source and destination, and it is not necessary to calculate the shortest path
from source to all other nodes. This paper concentrates on this very idea and
presents an algorithm for calculating shortest path for (i) nonnegative
weighted undirected graphs (ii) unweighted undirected graphs. The algorithm
completes its execution in O(E) for all graphs except few in which longer path
(in terms of number of edges) from source to some node makes it best selection
for that node. The main advantage of the algorithms is its simplicity and it
does not need complex data structures for implementations.
