The problem of the divergences which arise in beyond mean-field calculations,
when a zero-range effective interaction is employed, has not been much
considered so far. Some of us have proposed, quite recently, a scheme to
regularize a zero-range Skyrme-type force when it is employed to calculate the
total energy, at second-order perturbation theory level, in uniform matter.
Although this scheme looked promising, the extension for finite nuclei is not
straightforward. We introduce such procedure in the current paper, by proposing
a regularization procedure that is similar, in spirit, to the one employed to
extract the so-called V_{\rm low-k} from the bare force. Although this has been
suggested already by B.G. Carlsson and collaborators, the novelty of our work
consists in setting on equal footing uniform matter and finite nuclei; in
particular, we show how the interactions that have been regularized in uniform
matter behave when they are used in a finite nucleus with the corresponding
cutoff. We also address the problem of the validity of the perturbative
approach in finite nuclei for the total energy.
