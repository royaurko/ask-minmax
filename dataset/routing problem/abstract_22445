We consider the problem of minimizing the bending or elastic energy among
Jordan curves confined in a given open set $\Omega$. We prove existence,
regularity and some structural properties of minimizers. In particular, when
$\Omega$ is convex we show that a minimizer is necessarily a convex curve. We
also provide an example of a minimizer with self-intersections.
