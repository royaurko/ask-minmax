In this paper, the initial and boundary problem of the difference equation
which is a discretization of the semi-linear heat equation. The difference
equation derived by discretizing the semi-linear heat equation has solutions
which show characteristics corresponding to the characteristics of the blow-up
solutions for the original equation. The initial and boundary problem for the
original equation has blow-up solutions when a certain condition is met. We
prove that when a similar condition as that of the original solution is met in
the initial and boundary problem for the difference equation, the difference
equation has blow-up solutions having characteristics corresponding to the
characteristics of the blow-up solutions for the original equation.
