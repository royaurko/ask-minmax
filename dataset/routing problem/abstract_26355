The main aim of this paper is to document the performance of $p$-refinement
with respect to maximum principles and the non-negative constraint. The model
problem is (steady-state) anisotropic diffusion with decay (which is a
second-order elliptic partial differential equation). We considered the
standard single-field formulation (which is based on the Galerkin formalism)
and two least-squares-based mixed formulations. We have employed non-uniform
Lagrange polynomials for altering the polynomial order in each element, and we
have used $p = 1, ..., 10$.
  It will be shown that the violation of the non-negative constraint will not
vanish with $p$-refinement for anisotropic diffusion. We shall illustrate the
performance of $p$-refinement using several representative problems. The
intended outcome of the paper is twofold. Firstly, this study will caution the
users of high-order approximations about its performance with respect to
maximum principles and the non-negative constraint. Secondly, this study will
help researchers to develop new methodologies for enforcing maximum principles
and the non-negative constraint under high-order approximations.
