We show that the gravitino-overproduction problem is prevalent among
inflation models in supergravity. An inflaton field \phi generically acquires
(effective) non-vanishing auxiliary field G_\phi, if the K\"ahler potential is
non-minimal. The inflaton field then decays into a pair of the gravitinos. We
extensively study the cosmological constraints on G_\phi for a wide range of
the gravitino mass. For many inflation models we explicitly estimate G_\phi,
and show that the gravitino-overproduction problem severely constrains the
inflation models, unless such an interaction as K = \kappa/2 |\phi|^2 z^2 +
h.c. is suppressed (here z is the field responsible for the supersymmetry
breaking). We find that many of them are already excluded or on the verge of,
if \kappa \sim O(1).
