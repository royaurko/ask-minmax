Normalization constant in the eigenstate appearing in the eigenvalue problem
of the su(1,1)-algebra is discussed. This normalization constant is expressed
in terms of the Gauss' hypergeometric series which is not absolutely
convergent. It is proved that this series is obtained as a certain limit of an
absolutely convergent series, which was conjectured in the previous paper.
