This paper presents a concrete implementation of the feasible second order
bundle algorithm for nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization problems with inequality
constraints \cite{HannesPaperB}. It computes the search direction by solving a
convex quadratically constrained quadratic program. Furthermore, certain
versions of the search direction problem are discussed and the applicability of
this approach is justified numerically by using different solvers for the
computation of the search direction. Finally, the good performance of the
second order bundle algorithm is demonstrated by comparison with test results
of other solvers on examples of the Hock-Schittkowski collection, on custom
examples that arise in the context of finding exclusion boxes for quadratic
constraint satisfaction problems, and on higher dimensional piecewise quadratic
examples.
