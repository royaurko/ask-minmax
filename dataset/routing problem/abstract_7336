Hexagonal tortoise problem (HTP), also known as Jisuguimundo or Jisugwimundo,
is a magic square variety which was invented by medieval Korean Mathematician
and minister Suk-Jung Choi (1646-1715).[1] Choi showed pattern 30 vertices 3 by
3 diagonal shape which has 93 as its magic constant. Unlike magic square,
vertices in Jisugwimundo counted one times, twice or three times. This change
makes magic constant of Hexagonal Tortoise Problem could be vary. We consider a
range of hexagonal sums in various Jisugwimundo. In this paper, we decomposed
vertices on Jisugwimundo to some groups. by this way we found the range of
magic constant on several HTP.
