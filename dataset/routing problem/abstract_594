We report on new routes to generating a train of attosecond pulses. The
methods are extremely simple and robust; we need to place only a few thin
dispersive materials in the optical path. We numerically demonstrate the
generation of a train of attosecond pulses with a transform-limited pulse
duration of 728 as and a repetition period of 8.03 fs in gaseous parahydrogen.
