We consider projection algorithms for solving (nonconvex) feasibility
problems in Euclidean spaces. Of special interest are the Method of Alternating
Projections (MAP) and the Douglas-Rachford or Averaged Alternating Reflection
Algorithm (AAR). In the case of convex feasibility, firm nonexpansiveness of
projection mappings is a global property that yields global convergence of MAP
and for consistent problems AAR. Based on (\epsilon, \delta)-regularity of sets
developed by Bauschke, Luke, Phan and Wang in 2012, a relaxed local version of
firm nonexpansiveness with respect to the intersection is introduced for
consistent feasibility problems. Together with a coercivity condition that
relates to the regularity of the intersection, this yields local linear
convergence of MAP for a wide class of nonconvex problems,
