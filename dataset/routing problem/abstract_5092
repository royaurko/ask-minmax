Given natural numbers $n$ and $k$, with $n>k$, the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott (PTE)
problem asks for distinct subsets of $\Z$, say $X=\{x_1,...,x_n\}$ and
$Y=\{y_1,...,y_n\}$, such that \[x_1^i+...+x_n^i=y_1^i+...+y_n^i\] for
$i=1,...,k$. Many partial solutions to this problem were found in the late 19th
century and early 20th century.
  When $n=k-1$, we call a solution $X=_{n-1}Y$ ideal. This is considered to be
the most interesting case. Ideal solutions have been found using elementary
methods, elliptic curves, and computational techniques. In 2007, Alpers and
Tijdeman gave examples of solutions to the PTE problem over the Gaussian
integers. This paper extends the framework of the problem to this setting. We
prove generalizations of results from the literature, and use this information
along with computational techniques to find ideal solutions to the PTE problem
in the Gaussian integers.
