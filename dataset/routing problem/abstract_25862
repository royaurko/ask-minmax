Astrophysical plasmas can have parameters vastly different from the more
studied laboratory and space plasmas. In particular, the magnetic fields can be
the dominant component of the plasma, with energy-density exceeding the
particle rest-mass energy density. Magnetic fields then determine the plasma
dynamical evolution, energy dissipation and acceleration of non-thermal
particles. Recent data coming from astrophysical high energy missions, like
magnetar bursts and Crab nebula flares, point to the importance of magnetic
reconnection in these objects.
  In this review we outline a broad spectrum of problems related to the
astrophysical relevant processes in magnetically dominated relativistic
plasmas. We discuss the problems of large scale dynamics of relativistic
plasmas, relativistic reconnection and particle acceleration at reconnecting
layers, turbulent cascade in force-fee plasmas. A number of astrophysical
applications are also discussed.
