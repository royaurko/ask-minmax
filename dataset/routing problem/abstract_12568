We consider the problem of approximating two, possibly unrelated probability
distributions from a single complex-valued function $\psi$ and its Fourier
transform. We show that this problem always has a solution within a specified
degree of accuracy, provided the distributions satisfy the necessary regularity
conditions. We describe the algorithm and construction of $\psi$ and provide
examples of approximating several pairs of distributions using the algorithm.
