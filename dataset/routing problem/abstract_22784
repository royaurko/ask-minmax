There exist methods to reformulate in an exact way the many-body problem of
interacting bosons in terms of the stochastic evolution of single particle wave
functions. For one such reformulation, the so-called simple Fock scheme, we
present an elementary derivation, much simpler than the original one.
Furthermore, we show that two other schemes, based on coherent states of the
matter field rather than on Fock states, lead to an infinite statistical
uncertainty in the continuous time limit. The simple Fock scheme is therefore,
up to now, the only one that was proved to lead to a convergent Monte Carlo
simulation scheme at all times.
