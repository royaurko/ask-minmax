This paper considers the k-sink location problem in dynamic path networks. In
our model, a dynamic path network consists of an undirected path with positive
edge lengths, uniform edge capacity, and positive vertex supplies. Here, each
vertex supply corresponds to a set of evacuees. Then, the problem requires to
find the optimal location of $k$ sinks in a given path so that each evacuee is
sent to one of k sinks. Let x denote a k-sink location. Under the optimal
evacuation for a given x, there exists a (k-1)-dimensional vector d, called
(k-1)-divider, such that each component represents the boundary dividing all
evacuees between adjacent two sinks into two groups, i.e., all supplies in one
group evacuate to the left sink and all supplies in the other group evacuate to
the right sink. Therefore, the goal is to find x and d which minimize the
maximum cost or the total cost, which are denoted by the minimax problem and
the minisum problem, respectively. We study the k-sink location problem in
dynamic path networks with continuous model, and prove that the minimax problem
can be solved in O(kn) time and the minisum problem can be solved in O(n^2
min{k, 2^{sqrt{log k log log n}}}) time, where n is the number of vertices in
the given network. Note that these improve the previous results by [6].
