I review various proposals for the nature of black hole entropy and for the
mechanism behind the operation of the generalized second law. I stress the
merits of entanglement entropy {\tenit qua\/} black hole entropy, and point out
that, from an operational viewpoint, entanglement entropy is perfectly finite.
Problems with this identification such as the multispecies problem and the
trivialization of the information puzzle are mentioned. This last leads me to
associate black hole entropy rather with the multiplicity of density operators
which describe a black hole according to exterior observers. I relate this
identification to Sorkin's proof of the generalized second law. I discuss in
some depth Frolov and Page's proof of the same law, finding it relevant only
for scattering of microsystems by a black hole. Assuming that the law is
generally valid I make evident the existence of the universal bound on entropy
regardless of issues of acceleration buoyancy, and discuss the question of why
macroscopic objects cannot emerge in the Hawking radiance.
