It is shown that the three-magnon problem for $S=1$ isotropic ferromagnetic
infinite chain is exactly solvable by a generalized version of Bethe Ansatz.
The corresponding wave functions consists of the so called diffraction terms
inherent in non-integrable systems. The four-magnon problem is briefly
discussed.
