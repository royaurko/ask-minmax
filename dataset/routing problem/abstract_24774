Power series expansions naturally arise whenever solutions of ordinary
differential equations are studied in the regime of perturbation theory. In the
case of quasi-periodic solutions the issue of convergence of the series is
plagued of the so-called small divisor problem. In this paper we review a
method recently introduced to deal with such a problem, based on
renormalisation group ideas and multiscale techniques. Applications to both
quasi-integrable Hamiltonian systems (KAM theory) and non-Hamiltonian
dissipative systems are discussed. The method is also suited to situations in
which the perturbation series diverges and a resummation procedure can be
envisaged, leading to a solution which is not analytic in the perturbation
parameter: we consider explicitly examples of solutions which are only
infinitely differentiable in the perturbation parameter, or even defined on a
Cantor set.
