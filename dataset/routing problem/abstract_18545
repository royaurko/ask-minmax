This manuscript originated from the discussion at the workshop on the "Future
of Few-body Low Energy Experimental Physics" (FFLEEP), which was held at the
University of Trento on December 4-7, 2002 and has been written in its present
form on March 19, 2003. It illustrates a selection of theoretical advancements
in the nuclear few-body problem, including two- and many-nucleon interactions,
the three-nucleon bound and scattering system, the four-body problem, the
A-body (A$>$4) problem, and fields of related interest, such as reactions of
astrophysical interest and few-neutron systems. Particular attention is called
to the contradictory situation one experiences in this field: while theory is
currently advancing and has the potential to inspire new experiments, the
experimental activity is nevertheless rapidly phasing out. If such a trend will
continue, advancements in this area will become critically difficult.
