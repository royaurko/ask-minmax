We present an approach based on the dynamical mean field theory which is able
to give the excitation spectrum of a triply degenerate Hubbard model with a
Hund's exchange invariant under spin rotation. The lattice problem can be
mapped onto a local Anderson model containing 64 local eigenstates. This local
problem is solved by a generalized non-crossing approximation. The influence of
Hund's coupling J is examined in detail for metallic states close to the metal
insulator transition. The band-filling is shown to play a crucial role
concerning the effect of J on the low energy dynamics.
