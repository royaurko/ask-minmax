We study a 2-parameter family of enumerative problems over the reals. Over
the complex field, these problems can be solved by Schubert calculus. In the
real case the number of solutions can be different on the distinct connected
components of the configuration space, resulting in a solution function. The
cohomology calculation in the real case only gives the signed sum of the
solutions, therefore in general it only gives a lower bound on the range of the
solution function. We calculate the solution function for the 2-parameter
family and we show that in the even cases the solution function is constant
modulo 4. We show how to determine the sign of a solution and describe the
connected components of the configuration space. We translate the problem to
the language of quivers and also give a geometric interpretation of the sign.
Finally, we discuss what aspects might be considered when solving other real
enumerative problems.
