Let $S$ be a hyperbolic Riemann surface. In a finite-dimensional
Teichm\"uller space $T(S)$, it is still an open problem whether the geodesic
disk passing through two points is unique. In an infinite-dimensional
Teichm\"uller space it is also unclear how many geodesic disks pass through a
Strebel point and the basepoint while we know that there are always geodesic
disks passing through a non-Strebel point and the basepoint. In this paper, we
answer the problem arising in the universal asymptotic Teichm\"uller space and
prove that there are always infinitely many geodesic disks passing through two
points.
