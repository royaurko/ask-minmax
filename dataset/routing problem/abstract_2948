A regular realizability (RR) problem is testing nonemptiness of intersection
of some fixed language (filter) with given regular language. We study here
complexity of RR problems. It appears that for any language L there exists RR
problem equivalent to L under disjunctive reductions on nondeterministic log
space. It implies that for any level of polynomial hierarchy there exists
complete RR problem under polynomial reductions.
