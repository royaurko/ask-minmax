This tutorial provides an exposition of a flexible geometric framework for
high dimensional estimation problems with constraints. The tutorial develops
geometric intuition about high dimensional sets, justifies it with some results
of asymptotic convex geometry, and demonstrates connections between geometric
results and estimation problems. The theory is illustrated with applications to
sparse recovery, matrix completion, quantization, linear and logistic
regression and generalized linear models.
