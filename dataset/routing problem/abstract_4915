Sitnikov problem, consisting two close binaries and a third small body is
considered, leading to a rapid ejection of the small body from the binaries.
This mechanism is proposed as an explanation of jets in many astrophysical
systems. Choosing appropriate initial condition relativistic final velocities
can be achieved.
