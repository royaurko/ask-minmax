In this paper we study the following
nonlinear Maxwell's equations \\ $\varepsilon \E_{t}+\sigma(x,|\E|)\E= \g \vh
+\F,\, \vh_{t}+\g \E=0$, where $\sigma(x,s)$ is a monotone graph of $s$. It is
shown that the system has a unique weak solution. Moreover, the limit of the
solution as $\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$ converges to the solution of
quasi-stationary Maxwell's equations.
