We consider a one-phase free boundary problem with variable coefficients and
non-zero right hand side. We prove that flat free boundaries are $C^{1,\alpha}$
using a different approach than the classical supconvolution method of
Caffarelli. We use this result to obtain that Lipschitz free boundaries are
$C^{1,\alpha}$.
