Using a simple ansatz for the solutions of the three dimensional
generalization of the sine--Gordon and Toda model introduced by Konopelchenko
and Rogers, a class of solutions is found by elementary methods. It is also
shown that these equations are not evolution equations in the sense that
solution to the initial value problem is not unique.
