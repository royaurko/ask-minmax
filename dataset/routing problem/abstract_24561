The one-dimensional propagation of seismic waves with constant Q is shown to
be governed by an evolution equation of fractional order in time, which
interpolates the heat equation and the wave equation. The fundamental solutions
for the Cauchy and Signalling problems are expressed in terms of entire
functions (of Wright type) in the similarity variable and their behaviours turn
out to be intermediate between those for the limiting cases of a perfectly
viscous fluid and a perfectly elastic solid. In view of the small dissipation
exhibited by the seismic pulses, the nearly elastic limit is considered.
Furthermore, the fundamental solutions for the Cauchy and Signalling problems
are shown to be related to stable probability distributions with index of
stability determined by the order of the fractional time derivative in the
evolution equation.
