We develop a systematic procedure of finding integrable ''relativistic''
(regular one-parameter) deformations for integrable lattice systems. Our
procedure is based on the integrable time discretizations and consists of three
steps. First, for a given system one finds a local discretization living in the
same hierarchy. Second, one considers this discretization as a particular
Cauchy problem for a certain 2-dimensional lattice equation, and then looks for
another meaningful Cauchy problems, which can be, in turn, interpreted as new
discrete time systems. Third, one has to identify integrable hierarchies to
which these new discrete time systems belong. These novel hierarchies are
called then ''relativistic'', the small time step $h$ playing the role of
inverse speed of light. We apply this procedure to the Toda lattice (and
recover the well-known relativistic Toda lattice), as well as to the Volterra
lattice and a certain Bogoyavlensky lattice, for which the ''relativistic''
deformations were not known previously.
