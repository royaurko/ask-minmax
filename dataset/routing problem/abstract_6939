In this survey we discuss some of the classical and modern methods in
studying the (Riemann-)Schottky problem, the problem of characterizing
Jacobians of curves among principally polarized abelian varieties. We present
many of the recent results in this subject, and describe some directions of
current research. This paper is based on the talk given at the "Classical
algebraic geometry today" workshop at MSRI in January 2009.
