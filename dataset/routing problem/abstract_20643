The limiting shape of the random Young diagrams associated with an
inhomogeneous random word is identi?ed as a multidimensional Brownian
functional. This functional is identical in law to the spectrum of a random
matrix. The Poissonized word problem is also briefy studied, and the asymptotic
behavior of the shape analyzed.
