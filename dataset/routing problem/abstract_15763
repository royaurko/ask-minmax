We study the average case complexity of a linear multivariate problem
$(\lmp)$ defined on functions of $d$ variables. We consider two classes of
information. The first $\lstd$ consists of function values and the second
$\lall$ of all continuous linear functionals. Tractability of $\lmp$ means
that the average case complexity is $O((1/\e)^p)$ with $p$ independent of $d$.
We prove that tractability of an $\lmp$ in $\lstd$ is equivalent to
tractability in $\lall$, although the proof is {\it not} constructive. We
provide a simple condition to check tractability in $\lall$. We also address
the optimal design problem for an $\lmp$ by using a relation to the worst case
setting. We find the order of the average case complexity and optimal sample
points for multivariate function approximation. The theoretical results are
illustrated for the folded Wiener sheet measure.
