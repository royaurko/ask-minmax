We explore via density functional calculations the magnetic doping of a
topological ferroelectric as an unconventional route to multiferroicity.
Vanadium doping of the layered perovskite La$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$O$_{7}$ largely
preserves electric polarization and produces robust ferromagnetic order, hence
proper multiferroicity. The marked tendency of dopants to cluster into chains
results in an insulating character at generic doping. Ferromagnetism stems from
the symmetry breaking of the multi-orbital V system via an unusual
"antiferro"-orbital order, and from the host's low-symmetry layered structure.
