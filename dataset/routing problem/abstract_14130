We investigate a class of nonlinear nonautonomous scalar field equations with
fractional diffusion, critical power nonlinearity and a subcritical term. The
involved potentials are allowed for vanishing behavior at infinity. The problem
is set on the whole space and compactness issues have to be tackled.
