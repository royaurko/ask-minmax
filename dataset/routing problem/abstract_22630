The strong CP problem was solved by Peccei & Quinn by introducing axions, a
viable candidate for Dark Matter (DM). Here the PQ approach is modified so to
yield also Dark Energy (DE). DM and DE arise, in fai proportions, from a single
scalar field, without tuning any extra parameter. In the present epoch, they
are weakly coupled. Fluctuations have a fair evolution. The model is also
fitted to the WMAP1 release, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique, and
performs as well as $\Lambda$CDM, coupled or uncoupled DE. Best--fit
cosmological parameters for different models are mostly within 2--$\sigma$
level. Here, the main peculiarity of the model is to favor high values of the
Hubble parameter.
