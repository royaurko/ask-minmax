We present a conundrum that results from the imprecise use of notation for
partial derivatives. Taking an example from mechanics, we show that lack of
proper care in representing partial derivatives in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
formulations paradoxically leads to two different values for the time
derivative of the canonical momentum. This problem also exists in other areas
of physics, such as thermodynamics.
