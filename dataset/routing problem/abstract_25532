We study a problem of detecting priming events based on a time series index
and an evolving document stream. We define a priming event as an event which
triggers abnormal movements of the time series index, i.e., the Iraq war with
respect to the president approval index of President Bush. Existing solutions
either focus on organizing coherent keywords from a document stream into events
or identifying correlated movements between keyword frequency trajectories and
the time series index. In this paper, we tackle the problem in two major steps.
(1) We identify the elements that form a priming event. The element identified
is called influential topic which consists of a set of coherent keywords. And
we extract them by looking at the correlation between keyword trajectories and
the interested time series index at a global level. (2) We extract priming
events by detecting and organizing the bursty influential topics at a micro
level. We evaluate our algorithms on a real-world dataset and the result
confirms that our method is able to discover the priming events effectively.
