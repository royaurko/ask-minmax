RuSr2(LnCe2)Cu2O12.25 (Ru-1232) compounds with Ln = Y and Dy being
synthesized by high pressure high temperature (6GPa, 12000C) solid state
synthesis route do crystallize in space group P4/mmm in near single phase form
with small quantities of SrRuO3 and RuSr2(RE1.5Ce0.5)Cu2O10 (Ru-1222). Both
samples exhibit magnetic transitions (Tmag.) at ~90 K with significant
branching of zfc (zero-field-cooled) and fc (field-cooled) magnetization and a
sharp cusp in zfc at ~ 70 K, followed by superconducting transitions at ~ 30 K.
Both compounds show typical ferromagnetic hysteresis loops in magnetic moment
(M) versus field (H) magnetization right upto Tmag. i.e. < 90K. To our
knowledge these are the first successfully synthesized Ru-1232 compounds in
near single phase with lanthanides including Y and Dy. The results are compared
with widely reported Gd/Ru-1222 and Ru-1212 (RuSr2GdCu2O8) compounds. In
particular, it seems that the Ru moments magnetic ordering temperature (Tmag.)
scales with the c-direction distance between magnetic RuO6 octahedras in
Ru-1212/1222 or 1232 systems.
