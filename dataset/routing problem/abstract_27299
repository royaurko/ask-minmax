In this paper, we are concerned with the reliability assessment of redundant
multi-channel systems having multiple controllers with overlapping
functionality -- where all controllers are required to respond optimally to the
non-faulty controllers so as to ensure or maintain some system properties. In
particular, for such redundant systems with small random perturbation, we study
the relationships between the exit probabilities with which the
state-trajectories exit from a given bounded open domain and the value
functions corresponding to a family of stochastic exit-time control problems on
the boundary of the given domain. Moreover, as the random perturbation
vanishes, such relationships provide useful information concerning the
reliability of the redundant multi-channel systems arising from the large
deviations problem in connection with the asymptotic estimates of exit
probabilities with respect to some portions of the boundary of the given
domain. Finally, we briefly comment on the implication of our results on a
co-design technique using multi-objective optimization frameworks for
evaluating the performance of the redundant multi-channel systems.
