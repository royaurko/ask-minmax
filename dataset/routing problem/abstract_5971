As robots are being integrated into our daily lives, it becomes necessary to
provide guarantees on the safe and provably correct operation. Such guarantees
can be provided using automata theoretic task and mission planning where the
requirements are expressed as temporal logic specifications. However, in
real-life scenarios, it is to be expected that not all user task requirements
can be realized by the robot. In such cases, the robot must provide feedback to
the user on why it cannot accomplish a given task. Moreover, the robot should
indicate what tasks it can accomplish which are as "close" as possible to the
initial user intent. This paper establishes that the latter problem, which is
referred to as the minimal specification revision problem, is NP complete. A
heuristic algorithm is presented that can compute good approximations to the
Minimal Revision Problem (MRP) in polynomial time. The experimental study of
the algorithm demonstrates that in most problem instances the heuristic
algorithm actually returns the optimal solution. Finally, some cases where the
algorithm does not return the optimal solution are presented.
