Explicit analytical expression is derived for mixing matrix of three
neutrinos in matter using a set of direct vacuum physical parameters. Results
are presented in simple, symmetrical form. The physical contents are more clear
than using of traditional mixing angles. There is no problem about mixing
orders.
