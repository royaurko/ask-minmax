In a quasiclassical framework, we formulate the double energy differential
cross sections for the Coulomb four-body problem. We present results for the
triple photoionization from the Li ground state at 220.5, 115, 50 and 3.8 eV
excess energies. With the energy of one of the electrons kept fixed, the double
energy differential cross sections at 220.5 and 115 excess energies are found
to be of "U-shape" (unequal energy sharing), with those at 115 eV being in very
good agreement with ab-initio results. At 50 eV, it seems that a transition
starts taking place to more equal energy sharing configurations. Close to
threshold, at 3.8 eV excess energy, the equal energy sharing configurations are
the dominant ones.
