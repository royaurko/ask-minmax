We address the question of whether the superconducting transition temperature
(Tc) of high-Tc cuprates is enhanced when randomly distributed dopant atoms
form an ordered array in the charge reservoir layers. This study is possible
for the Sr2CuO3+d superconductor with K2NiF4-type structure in which oxygen
atoms only partially occupy the apical sites next to the CuO2 planes and act as
hole-dopants. We show that remarkable Tc enhancement up to 95K in this mono
CuO2 layered HTS is associated with the apical oxygen ordering, not to the hole
concentration change. The result points a route toward further enhancement of
Tc in cuprate superconductors.
