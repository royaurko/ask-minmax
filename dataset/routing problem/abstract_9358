The paper is concerned with the completeness problem of root functions of
general boundary value problems for first order systems of ordinary
differential equations. Namely, we introduce and investigate the class of
\emph{weakly regular boundary conditions}. We show that this class is much
broader than the class of {\em regular boundary conditions} introduced by G.D.
Birkhoff and R.E. Langer. Our main result states that the system of root
functions of a boundary value problem is complete and minimal provided that the
boundary conditions are weakly regular. Moreover, we show that in some cases
\emph{the weak regularity} of boundary conditions \emph{is also necessary} for
the completeness. Also we investigate the completeness for $2\times 2$ Dirac
and Dirac type equations subject to irregular or even to degenerate boundary
conditions.
  We emphasize that our results are the first results on the completeness
problem for general first order systems even in the case of regular boundary
conditions.
