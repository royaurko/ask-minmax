A new approach is laid out to investigate the two photon atomic transitions.
It is based on application of the finite basis solutions constructed from the
Bernstein Polynomial (B-Polynomial) sets. We show that such an approach
provides a very promising route for the relativistic second- (and even
higher-order) calculations since it allows for analytical evaluation of the
involved matrices elements. In order to illustrate possible applications of the
method and to verify its accuracy, detailed calculations are performed for the
2s_{1/2}-1s_{1/2} transition in neutral hydrogen and hydrogen-like ions, and
are compared with the theoretical predictions based on the well-established
B-spline-basis-set approach.
