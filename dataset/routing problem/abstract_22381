In this paper the problem of persistence of invariant tori under small
perturbations of integrable Hamiltonian systems is considered. The existence of
one-to-one correspondence between hyperbolic invariant tori and critical points
of the function $\Psi$ of two variables defined on semi-cylinder is
established. It is proved that if unperturbed Hamiltonian has a saddle point,
then under arbitrary perturbations there persists at least one hyperbolic
torus.
