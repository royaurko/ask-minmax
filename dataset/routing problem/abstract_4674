Solutions of the Dirichlet and Robin boundary value problems for the
multi-term variable-distributed order diffusion equation are studied. A priori
estimates for the corresponding differential and difference problems are
obtained by using the method of the energy inequalities. The stability and
convergence of the difference schemes follow from these a priory estimates. The
credibility of the obtained results is verified by performing numerical
calculations for test problems.
