A weak Galerkin (WG) method is introduced and numerically tested for the
Helmholtz equation. This method is flexible by using discontinuous piecewise
polynomials and retains the mass conservation property. At the same time, the
WG finite element formulation is symmetric and parameter free. Several test
scenarios are designed for a numerical investigation on the accuracy,
convergence, and robustness of the WG method in both inhomogeneous and
homogeneous media over convex and non-convex domains. Challenging problems with
high wave numbers are also examined. Our numerical experiments indicate that
the weak Galerkin is a finite element technique that is easy to implement, and
provides very accurate and robust numerical solutions for the Helmholtz problem
with high wave numbers.
