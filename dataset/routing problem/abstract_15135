We consider the problems of estimation and selection of parameters endowed
with a known group structure, when the groups are assumed to be sign-coherent,
that is, gathering either nonnegative, nonpositive or null parameters. To
tackle this problem, we propose the cooperative-Lasso penalty. We derive the
optimality conditions defining the cooperative-Lasso estimate for generalized
linear models, and propose an efficient active set algorithm suited to
high-dimensional problems. We study the asymptotic consistency of the estimator
in the linear regression setup and derive its irrepresentable conditions, which
are milder than the ones of the group-Lasso regarding the matching of groups
with the sparsity pattern of the true parameters. We also address the problem
of model selection in linear regression by deriving an approximation of the
degrees of freedom of the cooperative-Lasso estimator. Simulations comparing
the proposed estimator to the group and sparse group-Lasso comply with our
theoretical results, showing consistent improvements in support recovery for
sign-coherent groups. We finally propose two examples illustrating the wide
applicability of the cooperative-Lasso: first to the processing of ordinal
variables, where the penalty acts as a monotonicity prior; second to the
processing of genomic data, where the set of differentially expressed probes is
enriched by incorporating all the probes of the microarray that are related to
the corresponding genes.
