We study an abstract linear operator equation on a Banach space by using the
inverse of the sum of two sectorial operators. We prove that the boundedness of
a special type of operator valued $H^\infty$-calculus is sufficient for maximal
regularity of the solution. We apply the result to the abstract parabolic
problem, to give a maximal $L^{p}$-regularity condition. We also study the
abstract hyperbolic problem and give a sufficient condition for the existence
of solution.
