We present a convergence analysis of the penalty method applied to unilateral
contact problems in two and three space dimensions. We first consider, under
various regularity assumptions on the exact solution to the unilateral contact
problem, the convergence of the continuous penalty solution as the penalty
parameter $\varepsilon$ vanishes. Then, the analysis of the finite element
discretized penalty method is carried out. Denoting by $h$ the discretization
parameter, we show that the error terms we consider give the same estimates as
in the case of the constrained problem when the penalty parameter is such that
$\varepsilon = h$.
