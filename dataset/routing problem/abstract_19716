In the standard model of universe the increase in mass of our observed
expansive Universe is explained by the assumption of emerging the matter
objects on the horizon (of the most remote visibility). However, the physical
analysis of the influence of this assumption on the velocity of matter objects
shows unambiguously that this hypothetical assumption contradicts the theory of
gravity.
