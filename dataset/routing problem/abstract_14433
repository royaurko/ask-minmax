Let $\Omega$ be a bounded open interval, let $p>1$ and $\gamma>0$, and let
$m:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be a function that may change sign in $\Omega
$. In this article we study the existence and nonexistence of positive
solutions for one-dimensional singular problems of the form $-(\left\vert
u^{\prime}\right\vert ^{p-2}u^{\prime})^{\prime}=m\left( x\right) u^{-\gamma}$
in $\Omega$, $u=0$ on $\partial\Omega$. As a consequence we also derive
existence results for other related nonlinearities.
