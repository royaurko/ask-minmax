In this work we investigate the rainbows appearing in channeling of 1 GeV
protons through the long (11, 9) single-wall carbon nanotubes. The nanotube
length is varied from 10 to 500 micrometers. The angular distributions of
channeled protons are computed using the numerical solution of the proton
equations of motion in the transverse plane and the Monte Carlo method. Each
rainbow is characterized by a sharp decrease of the proton yield on its large
angle side. As the nanotube length increases, the number of rainbows increases
and the average distance between them decreases in an easily predictable way.
When the average distance between the rainbows becomes smaller than the
resolution of the angular distribution, one cannot distinguish between the
adjacent rainbows, and the angular distribution becomes equilibrated. We call
this route to equilibration the rainbow route to equilibration. This work is a
demonstration of how a simple one-dimensional bound dynamic system can exhibit
a complex collective behavior.
