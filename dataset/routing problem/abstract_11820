There are reasons to believe that implications of a certain paradox
introduced by Ginzburg and related problems have not been fully recognized.
Pertinent issues remain open and unresolved. There are instances when the
current widely used theory yields results having no physical meaning. As a
result, the current widely used theory is not equipped to cope with some of the
most fundamental problems in physics. In the present investigation, a new
formulation is proposed based on certain non-Maxwellian quantities which occur
whenever there is absorption. In the proposed formulation, the inconsistencies
and contradictions disclosed by the Ginzburg Paradox have been removed.
