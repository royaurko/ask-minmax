We study an asymptotic Dirichlet problem for Weyl structures on
asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds. By the bulk-boundary correspondence, or
more precisely by the Fefferman-Graham theorem on Poincar\'e metrics, this
leads to a natural extension of the notion of Branson's $Q$-curvature to Weyl
structures on even-dimensional conformal manifolds.
