In this paper we survey recent work on the use of statistical model checking
techniques for biological applications. We begin with an overview of the basic
modelling techniques for biochemical reactions and their corresponding
stochastic simulation algorithm - the Gillespie algorithm. We continue by
giving a brief description of the relation between stochastic models and
continuous (ordinary differential equation) models. Next we present a
literature survey, divided in two general areas. In the first area we focus on
works addressing verification of biological models, while in the second area we
focus on papers tackling the parameter synthesis problem. We conclude with some
open problems and directions for further research.
