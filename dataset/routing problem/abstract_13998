This paper revisits the solution of the word problem for $\omega$-terms
interpreted over finite aperiodic semigroups, obtained by J. McCammond. The
original proof of correctness of McCammond's algorithm, based on normal forms
for such terms, uses McCammond's solution of the word problem for certain
Burnside semigroups. In this paper, we establish a new, simpler, correctness
proof of McCammond's algorithm, based on properties of certain regular
languages associated with the normal forms. This method leads to new
applications.
