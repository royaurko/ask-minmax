We develop a theory of Hilbert $\widetilde{\C}$-modules by investigating
their structural and functional analytic properties. Particular attention is
given to finitely generated submodules, projection operators, representation
theorems for $\widetilde{\C}$-linear functionals and
$\widetilde{\C}$-sesquilinear forms. By making use of a generalized Lax-Milgram
theorem, we provide some existence and uniqueness theorems for variational
problems involving a generalized bilinear or sesquilinear form.
