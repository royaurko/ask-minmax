In this work we focus on efficient heuristics for solving a class of
stochastic planning problems that arise in a variety of business, investment,
and industrial applications. The problem is best described in terms of future
buy and sell contracts. By buying less reliable, but less expensive, buy
(supply) contracts, a company or a trader can cover a position of more reliable
and more expensive sell contracts. The goal is to maximize the expected net
gain (profit) by constructing a dose to optimum portfolio out of the available
buy and sell contracts. This stochastic planning problem can be formulated as a
two-stage stochastic linear programming problem with recourse. However, this
formalization leads to solutions that are exponential in the number of possible
failure combinations. Thus, this approach is not feasible for large scale
problems. In this work we investigate heuristic approximation techniques
alleviating the efficiency problem. We primarily focus on the clustering
approach and devise heuristics for finding clusterings leading to good
approximations. We illustrate the quality and feasibility of the approach
through experimental data.
