We study the isoperimetric problem in Euclidean space endowed with a density.
We first consider piecewise constant densities and examine particular cases
related to the characteristic functions of half-planes, strips and balls. We
also consider continuous modification of Gauss density in $\R^2$. Finally, we
give a list of related open questions.
