In this paper, we have developed new multistage tests which guarantee
prescribed level of power and are more efficient than previous tests in terms
of average sampling number and the number of sampling operations. Without
truncation, the maximum sampling numbers of our testing plans are absolutely
bounded. Based on geometrical arguments, we have derived extremely tight bounds
for the operating characteristic function. To reduce the computational
complexity for the relevant integrals, we propose adaptive scanning algorithms
which are not only useful for present hypothesis testing problem but also for
other problem areas.
