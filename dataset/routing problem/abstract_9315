We study the conjugacy problem in the automorphism group $Aut(T)$ of a
regular rooted tree $T$ and in its subgroup $FAut(T)$ of finite-state
automorphisms. We show that under the contracting condition and the finiteness
of what we call the orbit-signalizer, two finite-state automorphisms are
conjugate in $Aut(T)$ if and only if they are conjugate in $FAut(T)$, and that
this problem is decidable. We prove that both these conditions are satisfied by
bounded automorphisms and establish that the (simultaneous) conjugacy problem
in the group of bounded automata is decidable.
