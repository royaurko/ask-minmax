This paper deals with a coding problem called complementary delivery, where
messages from two correlated sources are jointly encoded and each decoder
reproduces one of two messages using the other message as the side information.
Both lossless and lossy universal complementary delivery coding schemes are
investigated. In the lossless case, it is demonstrated that a universal
complementary delivery code can be constructed by only combining two
Slepian-Wolf codes. Especially, it is shown that a universal lossless
complementary delivery code, for which error probability is exponentially
tight, can be constructed from two linear Slepian-Wolf codes. In the lossy
case, a universal complementary delivery coding scheme based on Wyner-Ziv codes
is proposed. While the proposed scheme cannot attain the optimal
rate-distortion trade-off in general, the rate-loss is upper bounded by a
universal constant under some mild conditions. The proposed schemes allows us
to apply any Slepian-Wolf and Wyner-Ziv codes to complementary delivery coding.
