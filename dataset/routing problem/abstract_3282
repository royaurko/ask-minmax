The purpose of this research is to 1) design of an Ubiquitous Scaffold
Learning Environment Using Problem-based Learning model to enhance
problem-solving skills and context awareness, and 2) evaluate the developed
model. The research procedures divide into two phases. The first phase is to
design of Ubiquitous Scaffold Learning Environment Using Problem-based Learning
model, and the second phase is to evaluate the developed model. The sample
group in this study consists of five experts selected by purposive sampling
method. Data were analyzed by arithmetic mean and standard deviation. The
research findings are as follows: 1. The developed model consist of three
components is 1) principles of ubiquitous learning environment (ULE),
problem-based learning with scaffolding in ULE, problem solving skill and
context awareness 2) objectives of the model are to enhance problem solving
skill and context awareness and 3) Process of the instructional model 2. The
experts agree Ubiquitous Scaffold Learning Environment Using Problem-based
Learning model model is high level of appropriateness.
