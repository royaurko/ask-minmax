This paper reports a versatile, roll-to-roll and backend compatible technique
for the fabrication of high-index-contrast photonic structures on both silicon
and plastic substrates. The fabrication technique combines low-temperature
chalcogenide glass film deposition and resist-free single-step thermal
nanoimprint to process low-loss (1.6 dB/cm), sub-micron single-mode waveguides
with a smooth surface finish using simple contact photolithography. Using this
approach, the first chalcogenide glass micro-ring resonators are fabricated by
thermal nanoimprint. The devices exhibit an ultra-high quality-factor of
400,000 near 1550 nm wavelength, which represents the highest value reported in
chalcogenide glass micro-ring resonators. Furthermore, sub-micron nanoimprint
of chalcogenide glass films on non-planar plastic substrates is demonstrated,
which establishes the method as a facile route for monolithic fabrication of
high-index-contrast devices on a wide array of unconventional substrates.
