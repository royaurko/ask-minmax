The present paper establishes a connection between the Lie algebra
W_{1+infty} and the bispectral problem. We show that the manifolds of
bispectral operators obtained by Darboux transformations on powers of Bessel
operators are in one to one correspondence with the manifolds of tau-functions
lying in the W_{1+infty}-modules M_beta introduced in our previous paper
hep-th/9510211. An immediate corollary is that they are preserved by
hierarchies of symmetries generated by subalgebras of W_{1+infty}.
  This paper is the last of a series of papers (hep-th/9510211, q-alg/9602010,
q-alg/9602011) on the bispectral problem.
