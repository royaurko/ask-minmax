We present a domain decomposition method (DDM) devoted to the iterative
solution of time-harmonic electromagnetic scattering problems, involving large
and resonant cavities. This DDM uses the electric field integral equation
(EFIE) for the solution of Maxwell problems in both interior and exterior
subdomains, and we propose a simple preconditioner for the global method, based
on the single layer operator restricted to the fictitious interface between the
two subdomains.
