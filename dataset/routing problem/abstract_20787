A simple quark-diquark model for the baryons is constructed as a partial
solution to the well known missing resonances problem. A complete
classification of the baryonic states in the quark-diquark framework is given
and the spectrum is calculated through a mass formula built to reproduce the
rotational and vibrational Regge trajectories.
