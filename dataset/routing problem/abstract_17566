In graph theory, Courcelle's theorem essentially states that, if an
algorithmic problem can be formulated in monadic second-order logic, then it
can be solved in linear time for graphs of bounded treewidth. We prove such a
metatheorem for a general class of triangulations of arbitrary fixed dimension
d, including all triangulated d-manifolds: if an algorithmic problem can be
expressed in monadic second-order logic, then it can be solved in linear time
for triangulations whose dual graphs have bounded treewidth.
  We apply our results to 3-manifold topology, a setting with many difficult
computational problems but very few parameterised complexity results, and where
treewidth has practical relevance as a parameter. Using our metatheorem, we
recover and generalise earlier fixed-parameter tractability results on taut
angle structures and discrete Morse theory respectively, and prove a new
fixed-parameter tractability result for computing the powerful but complex
Turaev-Viro invariants on 3-manifolds.
