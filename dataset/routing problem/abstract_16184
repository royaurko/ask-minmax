We use supersymmetry to address the little hierarchy problem in
Randall-Sundrum models by naturally generating a hierarchy between the IR scale
and the electroweak scale. Supersymmetry is broken on the UV brane which
triggers the stabilization of the warped extra dimension at an IR scale of
order 10 TeV. The Higgs and top quark live near the IR brane whereas light
fermion generations are localized towards the UV brane. Supersymmetry breaking
causes the first two sparticle generations to decouple, thereby avoiding the
supersymmetric flavour and CP problems, while an accidental R-symmetry protects
the gaugino mass. The resulting low-energy sparticle spectrum consists of
stops, gauginos and Higgsinos which are sufficient to stabilize the little
hierarchy between the IR scale and the electroweak scale. Finally, the
supersymmetric little hierarchy problem is ameliorated by introducing a singlet
Higgs field on the IR brane.
