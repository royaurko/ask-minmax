For analytic functions f(z) in the open unit disk U with f(0)=f'(0)-1=0, S.
S. Miller and P. T. Mocanu (Integral Transform. Spec. Funct. 19(2008)) have
considered some sufficient problems for starlikeness. The object of the present
paper is to discuss some sufficient problems for f(z) to be in some classes of
order \alpha.
