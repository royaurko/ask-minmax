The problem of the scattering of a charged test particle in the gravitational
background of axially symmetrical wormhole in the presence of the Aharonov-Bohm
type magnetic field is considered. It is shown that the natural mathematical
framework appropriate for the problem is the scattering theory in the pair of
Hilbert spaces. Both relevant modified wave operators and $S$-matrices are
found.
