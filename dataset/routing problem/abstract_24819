A software agent may be a member of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) which is
collectively performing a range of complex and intelligent tasks. In the
hospital, scheduling decisions are finding difficult to schedule because of the
dynamic changes and distribution. In order to face this problem with dynamic
changes in the hospital, a new method, Distributed Optimized Patient Scheduling
with Grouping (DOPSG) has been proposed. The goal of this method is that there
is no necessity for knowing patient agents information globally. With minimal
information this method works effectively. Scheduling problem can be solved for
multiple departments in the hospital. Patient agents have been scheduled to the
resource agent based on the patient priority to reduce the waiting time of
patient agent and to reduce idle time of resources.
