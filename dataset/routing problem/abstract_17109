We consider degenerate Kirchhoff equations with a small parameter epsilon in
front of the second-order time-derivative. It is well known that these
equations admit global solutions when epsilon is small enough, and that these
solutions decay as t -> +infinity with the same rate of solutions of the limit
problem (of parabolic type).
  In this paper we prove decay-error estimates for the difference between a
solution of the hyperbolic problem and the solution of the corresponding
parabolic problem. These estimates show in the same time that the difference
tends to zero both as epsilon -> 0, and as t -> +infinity. Concerning the decay
rates, it turns out that the difference decays faster than the two terms
separately (as t -> +infinity).
  Proofs involve a nonlinear step where we separate Fourier components with
respect to the lowest frequency, followed by a linear step where we exploit
weighted versions of classical energies.
