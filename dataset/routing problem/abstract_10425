The density of states for the Schroedinger equation with a Gaussian random
potential is determined by the functional integral corresponding to the phi^4
theory with a `wrong' sign of the interaction constant. The special role of the
dimension d=4 for such a problem can be seen from different viewpoints but is
fundamentally determined by the renormalizability of the theory. The
construction of an epsilon-expansion in direct analogy with the
phase-transition theory gives rise to the problem of a `spurious' pole. To
solve this problem, a proper treatment of the factorial divergency of the
perturbation series is necessary. Simplifications arising in high dimensions
can be used for the development of a (4-epsilon)-dimensional theory, but this
requires successive consideration of four types of theories: a
nonrenormalizable theory for d>4, nonrenormalizable and renormalizable theories
in the logarithmic situation (d=4), and a super-renormalizable theory for d<4.
An approximation is found for each type of theory giving asymptotically exact
results. The qualitative effect is the same in all four cases and consists in a
shifting of the phase transition point in the complex plane. This results in
the elimination of the `spurious' pole and in regularity of the density of
states for all energies. A discussion is given of the calculation of high
orders of perturbation theory and a perspective of the epsilon-expansion for
the problem of conductivity near the Anderson transition.
