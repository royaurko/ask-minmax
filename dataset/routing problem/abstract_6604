In the past few years we have derived asymptotic expansions for lambda_d of
the dimer problem and lambda_d(p) of the monomer-dimer problem. The many
expansions so far computed are collected herein. We shine a light on results in
two dimensions inspired by the work of M. E. Fisher. Much of the work reported
here was joint with Shmuel Friedland.
