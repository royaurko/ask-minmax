We study the Bipartite Unconstrained 0-1 Quadratic Programming Problem (BQP)
which is a relaxation of the Unconstrained 0-1 Quadratic Programming Problem
(QP). Applications of the BQP include mining discrete patterns from binary
data, approximating matrices by rank-one binary matrices, computing cut-norm of
a matrix, and solving optimization problems such as maximum weight biclique,
bipartite maximum weight cut, maximum weight induced subgraph of a bipartite
graph, etc. We propose several classes of heuristic approaches to solve the BQP
and discuss a number of construction algorithms, local search algorithms and
their combinations. Results of extensive computational experiments are reported
to establish the practical performance of our algorithms. For this purpose, we
propose several sets of test instances based on various applications of the
BQP. Our algorithms are compared with state-of-the-art heuristics for QP which
can also be used to solve BQP with reformulation. We also study theoretical
properties of the neighborhoods and algorithms. In particular, we establish
complexity of all neighborhood search algorithms and establish tight worst-case
performance ratio for the greedy algorithm.
