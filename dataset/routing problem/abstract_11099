A statistical classification algorithm and its application to language
identification from noisy input are described. The main innovation is to
compute confidence limits on the classification, so that the algorithm
terminates when enough evidence to make a clear decision has been made, and so
avoiding problems with categories that have similar characteristics. A second
application, to genre identification, is briefly examined. The results show
that some of the problems of other language identification techniques can be
avoided, and illustrate a more important point: that a statistical language
process can be used to provide feedback about its own success rate.
