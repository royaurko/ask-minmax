The appearance of new fundamental forces and extra-dimensional modifications
to gravity in extensions of the Standard Model has motivated considerable
interest in testing Newtonian gravity at short distances (<10^-3 m). Presently
a number of new gravity experiments are searching for non-Newtonian effects in
the ranges 10^-4 m -- 10^-3 m. However, as challenging as these experiments
are, formidable new obstacles await the next generation of experiments which
will probe gravity at distances <10^-4 m where Casimir/van der Waals forces
become dominant. Here we will review the motivation for conducting such very
short distance gravity experiments, and discuss some of the new problems that
may arise in future experiments. Finally, we suggest schematic designs for null
experiments which would address some of these problems using the
``iso-electronic'' and ``finite-size'' effects.
