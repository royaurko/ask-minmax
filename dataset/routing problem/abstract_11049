We consider the statistical mechanics of interfering transmissions in a
wireless communications protocol. In this case, a connection between two nodes
requires all other nodes within communication distance of the given two nodes
to remain quiet on the given channel. This leads to an interesting problem of
dimers on a lattice, with a restriction that no two dimers can overlap or be
nearest neighbors. We consider both an equilibrium and a non-equilibrium,
"greedy" dynamics for the links; the equilibrium properties of the model are
found to exhibit an interesting spin glass transition at maximum density on
certain lattices, while the greedy construction is related to the problem of
random sequential adsorption.
