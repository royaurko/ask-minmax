We consider the Landau-Zener problem for a Bose-Einstein condensate in a
linearly varying two-level system, for the full many-particle system as well
and in the mean-field approximation. The many-particle problem can be solved
approximately within an independent crossings approximation, which yields an
explicit Landau-Zener formula.
