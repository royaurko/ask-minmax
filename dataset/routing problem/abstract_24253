We prove that the number of limit cycles generated by a small
non-conservative perturbation of a Hamiltonian polynomial vector field on the
plane, is bounded by a double exponential of the degree of the fields. This
solves the long-standing tangential Hilbert 16th problem. The proof uses only
the fact that Abelian integrals of a given degree are horizontal sections of a
regular flat meromorphic connection (Gauss-Manin connection) with a
quasiunipotent monodromy group.
