The problem of evaluating the information associated with Fredholm integral
equations of the first kind, when the integral operator is self-adjoint and
compact, is considered here. The data function is assumed to be perturbed
gently by an additive noise so that it still belongs to the range of the
operator. First we estimate upper and lower bounds for the epsilon-capacity
(and then for the metric information), and explicit computations in some
specific cases are given; then the problem is reformulated from a probabilistic
viewpoint and use is made of the probabilistic information theory. The results
obtained by these two approaches are then compared.
