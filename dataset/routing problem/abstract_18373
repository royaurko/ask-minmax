We consider the galactic evolutionary history of \he3 in models which deplete
deuterium by as much as a factor of 2 to $\sim$ 15 from its primordial value to
its present day observed value in the ISM. We show that when \he3 production in
low mass stars (1 -- 3 $M_\odot$) is included over the history of the galaxy,
\he3 is greatly over-produced and exceeds the inferred solar values and the
abundances determined in galactic \hii regions. Furthermore, the ISM abundances
show a disturbing dispersion which is difficult to understand from the point of
view of standard chemical evolution models. In principle, resolution of the
problem may lie in either 1) the calculated \he3 production in low mass stars;
2) the observations of the \he3 abundance; or 3) an observational bias towards
regions of depleted \he3. Since \he3 observations in planetary nebula support
the calculated \he3 production in low mass stars, option (1) is unlikely. We
will argue for option (3) since the \he3 interstellar observations are indeed
made in regions dominated by massive stars in which \he3 is destroyed. In
conclusion, we note that the problem with \he3 seems to be galactic and not
cosmological.
