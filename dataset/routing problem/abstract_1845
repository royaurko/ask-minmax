We demonstrate the code-division multiplexed (CDM) readout of eight
transition-edge sensor microcalorimeters. The energy resolution is 3.0 eV (full
width at half-maximum) or better at 5.9 keV, with a best resolution of 2.3 eV
and a mean of 2.6 eV over the seven modulated detectors. The flux-summing CDM
system is described and compared with similar time-division multiplexed (TDM)
readout. We show that the sqrt(Npixels) multiplexing disadvantage associated
with TDM is not present in CDM. This demonstration establishes CDM as both a
simple route to higher performance in existing TDM microcalorimetric
experiments and a long-term approach to reaching higher multiplexing factors.
