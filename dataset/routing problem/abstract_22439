The core of this work is an old and broadly discussed problem of the
electromagnetic radiation in the case of the hyperbolic motion. We prove that
the radiation is non-zero in the lab (Minkowski) frame. Further, we attempt to
understand this subject better by using co-moving non-inertial frames of
reference, investigating other types of uniformly accelerated motion and,
finally, using scalar waves instead of point-like particles as sources of
radiation.
