We present a variational approach to evaluate relativistic corrections of
order \alpha^2 to the Bethe logarithm for the ground electronic state of the
Coulomb two center problem. That allows to estimate the radiative contribution
at m\alpha^7 order in molecular-like three-body systems such as hydrogen
molecular ions H_2^+ and HD^+, or antiprotonic helium atoms. While we get 10
significant digits for the nonrelativistic Bethe logarithm, calculation of the
relativistic corrections is much more involved especially for small values of
bond length R. We were able to achieve a level of 3-4 significant digits
starting from R=0.2 bohr, that will allow to reach 10^{-10} relative
uncertainty on transition frequencies.
