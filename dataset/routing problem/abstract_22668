Statistical methods for automatically identifying dependent word pairs (i.e.
dependent bigrams) in a corpus of natural language text have traditionally been
performed using asymptotic tests of significance. This paper suggests that
Fisher's exact test is a more appropriate test due to the skewed and sparse
data samples typical of this problem. Both theoretical and experimental
comparisons between Fisher's exact test and a variety of asymptotic tests (the
t-test, Pearson's chi-square test, and Likelihood-ratio chi-square test) are
presented. These comparisons show that Fisher's exact test is more reliable in
identifying dependent word pairs. The usefulness of Fisher's exact test extends
to other problems in statistical natural language processing as skewed and
sparse data appears to be the rule in natural language. The experiment
presented in this paper was performed using PROC FREQ of the SAS System.
