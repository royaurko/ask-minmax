We introduce the synthesis problem for Halpern and Shoham's modal logic of
intervals extended with an equivalence relation over time points, abbreviated
HSeq. In analogy to the case of monadic second-order logic of one successor,
the considered synthesis problem receives as input an HSeq formula phi and a
finite set Sigma of propositional variables and temporal requests, and it
establishes whether or not, for all possible evaluations of elements in Sigma
in every interval structure, there exists an evaluation of the remaining
propositional variables and temporal requests such that the resulting structure
is a model for phi. We focus our attention on decidability of the synthesis
problem for some meaningful fragments of HSeq, whose modalities are drawn from
the set A (meets), Abar (met by), B (begins), Bbar (begun by), interpreted over
finite linear orders and natural numbers. We prove that the fragment ABBbareq
is decidable (non-primitive recursive hard), while the fragment AAbarBBbar
turns out to be undecidable. In addition, we show that even the synthesis
problem for ABBbar becomes undecidable if we replace finite linear orders by
natural numbers.
