We consider co-rotational wave maps from (3+1) Minkowski space into the
three-sphere. This is an energy supercritical model which is known to exhibit
finite time blow up via self-similar solutions. The ground state self-similar
solution $f_0$ is known in closed form and based on numerics, it is supposed to
describe the generic blow up behavior of the system. In this paper we develop a
rigorous linear perturbation theory around $f_0$. This is an indispensable
prerequisite for the study of nonlinear stability of the self-similar blow up
which is conducted in a companion paper. In particular, we prove that $f_0$ is
linearly stable if it is mode stable. Furthermore, concerning the mode
stability problem, we prove new results that exclude the existence of unstable
eigenvalues with large imaginary parts and also, with real parts larger than
1/2. The remaining compact region is well-studied numerically and all available
results strongly suggest the nonexistence of unstable modes.
