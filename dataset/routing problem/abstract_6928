I discuss how the solution of the $U(1)_A$ problem of QCD through the
existence of the $\theta$-vacuum gave rise to the strong CP problem. After
examining various suggested solutions to this problem, I conclude that the only
viable solution still is the one that involves the existence of a spontaneously
broken chiral symmetry: $U(1)_{PQ}$
