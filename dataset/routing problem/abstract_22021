In this paper, we study the computation of curvatures at the singular points
of algebraic curves and surfaces. The idea is to convert the problem to compute
the curvatures of the corresponding regular parametric curves and surfaces,
which have intersections with the original curves and surfaces at the singular
points. Three algorithms are presented for three cases of plane curves, space
curves and surfaces.
