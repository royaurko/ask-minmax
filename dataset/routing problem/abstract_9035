The problem of a fermion subject to a convenient mixing of vector and scalar
potentials in a two-dimensional space-time is mapped into a Sturm-Liouville
problem. For a specific case which gives rise to an exactly solvable effective
modified P\"{o}schl-Teller potential in the Sturm-Liouville problem,
bound-state solutions are found. The behaviour of the upper and lower
components of the Dirac spinor is discussed in detail and some unusual results
are revealed. The Dirac delta potential as a limit of the modified P%
\"{o}schl-Teller potential is also discussed. The problem is also shown to be
mapped into that of massless fermions subject to classical topological scalar
and pseudoscalar potentials.
