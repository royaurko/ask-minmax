We develop a spectral formulation and a stationary WKB approximation for
calculating the probabilities of rare events (large deviations from the mean)
in systems of reacting particles with infinite-range interaction, describable
by a master equation. We compare the stationary WKB approximation with a recent
time-dependent semiclassical approximation developed, for the same class of
problems, by Elgart and Kamenev. As a benchmark we use an exactly solvable
problem of the binary annihilation reaction 2A -> 0.
