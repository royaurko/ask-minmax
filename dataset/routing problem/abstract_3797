The Continuous Skolem Problem asks whether a real-valued function satisfying
an ordinary linear differential equation has a zero in a given interval of real
numbers. This is a fundamental reachability problem arising in the analysis of
continuous linear dynamical systems, including linear hybrid automata and
continuous-time Markov chains. Not only is decidability of this problem open,
but decidability is open even for the sub-problem in which a zero is sought in
a bounded interval. In this paper we show decidability of the bounded problem
subject to Schanuel's conjecture, a central conjecture in transcendental number
theory. Regarding the unbounded case, by way of hardness we show that
decidability of the Continuous Skolem Problem would entail a major new
effectiveness result in Diophantine approximation, namely computability of the
Diophantine-approximation types of all real algebraic numbers.
