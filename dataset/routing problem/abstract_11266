We examine a recent suggestion by Milburn that slightly massive electron
neutrinos, produced left-handed at the core of the sun, suffer geodetic
precession adequate to render them right-handed (and therefore sterile) in
sufficient numbers to solve the solar neutrino problem. In that light, we
perform a complete, general-relativistic calculation of the geodetic spin
precession of an ultrarelativistic particle in the Schwartzschild metric. We
conclude that the effect is negligible, in disagreement with Milburn's
analysis.
