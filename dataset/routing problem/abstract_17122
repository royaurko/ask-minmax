Regular expressions provide a flexible means for matching strings and they
are often used in data-intensive applications. They are formally equivalent to
either deterministic finite automata (DFAs) or nondeterministic finite automata
(NFAs). Both DFAs and NFAs are affected by two problems known as amnesia and
acalculia, and DFAs are also affected by a problem known as insomnia. Existing
techniques require an automata conversion and compaction step that prevents the
use of existing automaton databases and hinders the maintenance of the
resulting compact automata. In this paper, we propose Parallel Finite State
Machines (PFSMs), which are able to run any DFA- or NFA-like state machines
without a previous conversion or compaction step. PFSMs report, online, all the
matches found within an input string and they solve the three aforementioned
problems. Parallel Finite State Machines require quadratic time and linear
memory and they are distributable. Parallel Finite State Machines make very
fast distributed regular expression matching in data-intensive applications
feasible.
