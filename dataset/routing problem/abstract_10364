We study from the perspective of Borel complexity theory the classification
problem for multiplier algebras associated with operator algebraic varieties.
These algebras are precisely the multiplier algebras of irreducible complete
Nevanlinna-Pick spaces. We prove that these algebras are not classifiable up to
algebraic isomorphism using countable structures as invariants. In order to
prove such a result, we develop the theory of turbulence for Polish groupoids,
which generalizes Hjorth's turbulence theory for Polish group actions. We also
prove that the classification problem for multiplier algebras associated with
varieties in a finite dimensional ball up to isometric isomorphism has maximum
complexity among the essentially countable classification problems. In
particular, this shows that Blaschke sequences are not smoothly classifiable up
to conformal equivalence via automorphisms of the disc.
