To make a joint decision, agents (or voters) are often required to provide
their preferences as linear orders. To determine a winner, the given linear
orders can be aggregated according to a voting protocol. However, in realistic
settings, the voters may often only provide partial orders. This directly leads
to the Possible Winner problem that asks, given a set of partial votes, whether
a distinguished candidate can still become a winner. In this work, we consider
the computational complexity of Possible Winner for the broad class of voting
protocols defined by scoring rules. A scoring rule provides a score value for
every position which a candidate can have in a linear order. Prominent examples
include plurality, k-approval, and Borda. Generalizing previous NP-hardness
results for some special cases, we settle the computational complexity for all
but one scoring rule. More precisely, for an unbounded number of candidates and
unweighted voters, we show that Possible Winner is NP-complete for all pure
scoring rules except plurality, veto, and the scoring rule defined by the
scoring vector (2,1,...,1,0), while it is solvable in polynomial time for
plurality and veto.
