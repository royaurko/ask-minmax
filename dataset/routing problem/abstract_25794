The general theory of boundary value problems for linear elliptic wedge
operators (on smooth manifolds with boundary) leads naturally, even in the
scalar case, to the need to consider vector bundles over the boundary together
with general smooth fiberwise multiplicative group actions. These actions,
essentially trivial (and therefore invisible) in the case of regular boundary
value problems, are intimately connected with what passes for Poisson and trace
operators, and to pseudodifferential boundary conditions in the more general
situation. Here the part of the theory pertaining pseudodifferential operators
is presented in its entirety. The symbols for the latter operators are defined
with the aid of an intertwining of the actions. Also presented here are the
ancillary Sobolev spaces, an index theorem for the elliptic elements of the
pseudodifferential calculus, and the essential ingredients of the APS boundary
condition in the more general theory.
