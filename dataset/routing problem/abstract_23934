We present a finite element algorithm that computes eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator for two-dimensional problems with
homogeneous Neumann or Dirichlet boundary conditions or combinations of either
for different parts of the boundary. In order to solve the generalized
eigenvalue problem, we use an inverse power plus Gauss-Seidel algorithm. For
Neumann boundary conditions the method is much more efficient than the
equivalent finite difference algorithm. We have cheked the algorithm comparing
the cumulative level density of the espectrum obtained numerically, with the
theoretical prediction given by the Weyl formula. A systematic deviation was
found. This deviation is due to the discretisation and not to the algorithm. As
an application we calculate the statistical properties of the eigenvalues of
the acoustic Bunimovich stadium and compare them with the theoretical results
given by random matrix theory.
