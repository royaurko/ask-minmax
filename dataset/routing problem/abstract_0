In this paper, we present a detailed framework consisting of modeling of
routing overhead generated by three widely used proactive routing protocols;
Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV), Fish-eye State Routing (FSR) and
Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR). The questions like, how these protocols
differ from each other on the basis of implementing different routing
strategies, how neighbor estimation errors affect broadcast of route requests,
how reduction of broadcast overhead achieves bandwidth, how to cope with the
problem of mobility and density, etc, are attempted to respond. In all of the
above mentioned situations, routing overhead and delay generated by the chosen
protocols can exactly be calculated from our modeled equations. Finally, we
analyze the performance of selected routing protocols using our proposed
framework in NS-2 by considering different performance parameters; Route
REQuest (RREQ) packet generation, End-to-End Delay (E2ED) and Normalized
Routing Load (NRL) with respect to varying rates of mobility and density of
nodes in the underlying wireless network.
