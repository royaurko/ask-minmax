In this note we study the Dirichlet problem associated with a version of
prime end boundary of a bounded domain in a complete metric measure space
equipped with a doubling measure supporting a Poincare inequality. We show the
resolutivity of functions that are continuous on the prime end boundary and are
Lipschitz regular when restricted to the subset of all prime ends whose
impressions are singleton sets. We also consider a new notion of capacity
adapted to the prime end boundary, and show that bounded perturbations of such
functions on subsets of the prime end boundary with zero capacity are
resolutive and that their Perron solutions coincide with the Perron solution of
the original functions. We also describe some examples which demonstrate the
efficacy of the prime end boundary approach in obtaining new results even for
the classical Dirichlet problem for some Euclidean domains.
