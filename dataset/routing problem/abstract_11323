The main statement of the nucleon constituent quark model with a fixed number
of particles as basic ansatz are considered in a framework of the single-time
(quasipotential) approach to the bound state problem. The scaling law breacking
for the proton form factor is investigated for Q^2 = 0 -- 2 Gev^2.
