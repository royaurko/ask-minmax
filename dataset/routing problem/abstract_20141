We deal with a family of functionals depending on curvatures and we prove for
them compactness and semicontinuity properties in the class of closed and
bounded sets which satisfy a uniform exterior and interior sphere condition. We
apply the results to state an existence theorem for the Nitzberg and Mumford
problem under this additional constraint.
