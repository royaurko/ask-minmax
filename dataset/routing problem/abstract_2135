The crystal structures of superconducting LaO1-xFxBiS2 (x ~ 0.23, 0.46) were
determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Their space group was
P4/nmm. Distortion of the Bi-S plane changed when the F content was increased
from 0.23 to 0.46, and a nearly flat Bi-S plane was formed at x ~ 0.46.
Computational calculations supported this effect of F doping on distortion of
Bi-S plane. LaO1-xFxBiS2 with higher F contents were computationally predicted
to be thermodynamically more unstable under ambient pressure. We discussed the
bonding, conductivities, and synthetic routes of LaO1-xFxBiS2.
