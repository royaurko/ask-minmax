Nonlinear elliptic Neumann problems, possibly in irregular domains and with
data affected by low integrability properties, are taken into account.
Existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence on the data of generalized
solutions are established under a suitable balance between the integrability of
the datum and the (ir)regularity of the domain. The latter is described in
terms of isocapacitary inequalities. Applications to various classes of domains
are also presented.
