Contextuality is the leading notion of non-classicality for a single system.
However, experimental demonstrations of contextuality have generally been
limited by conceptual difficulties. Here I focus on the simplest non-trivial
case, four preparations and two tomographically complete binary measurements.
Exploiting a subtle connection to the CHSH scenario gives eight non-linear
inequalities which are together necessary and sufficient for the experimental
statistics to admit a preparation noncontextual model. No fixed "operational
equivalences" are required. Violating such an inequality is therefore arguably
the most direct route to an experimental refutation of noncontextuality.
