The primary objective of this research work is to study and investigate the
performance measures of Gossip Routing protocol and Energy Efficient and
Reliable Adaptive Gossip routing protocols. We use TCP and CBR based traffic
models to analyze the performance of above mentioned protocols based on the
parameters of Packet Delivery Ratio, Average End-to-End Delay and Throughput.
We will investigate the effect of change in the simulation time and Number of
nodes for the MANET routing protocols. For Simulation, we have used ns-2
simulator.
