We compare numerically the effectiveness of three recently proposed
algorithms, multicanonical simulations, simulations in a 1/k-ensemble, and
simulated tempering for the protein folding problem. For this we perform
simulations with high statistics for one of the simplest peptides,
Met-enkephalin. While the performances of all three approaches is much better
than traditional methods, we find that the differences among the three are only
marginal.
