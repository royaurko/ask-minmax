We construct a finitely presented group with coNP-complete word problem, and
a finitely generated simple group with coNP-complete word problem. These groups
are represented as Thompson groups, hence as partial transformation groups of
strings. The proof provides a simulation of combinational circuits by elements
of the Thompson-Higman group G_{3,1}.
