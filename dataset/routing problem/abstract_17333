This paper studies the large time behavior of solutions to semi-linear Cauchy
problems with quadratic nonlinearity in gradients. The Cauchy problem
considered has a general state space and may degenerate on the boundary of the
state space. Two types of large time behavior are obtained: i) pointwise
convergence of the solution and its gradient; ii) convergence of solutions to
associated backward stochastic differential equations. When the state space is
R^d or the space of positive definite matrices, both types of convergence are
obtained under growth conditions on model coefficients. These large time
convergence results have direct applications in risk sensitive control and long
term portfolio choice problems.
