In this article we establish $C^{3,\alpha}$-regularity of the reduced
boundary of stationary points of a nonlocal isoperimetric problem in a domain
$\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. In particular, stationary points satisfy the
corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation classically on the reduced boundary.
Moreover, we show that the singular set has zero $(n-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff
measure. This complements the results in Choksi & Sternberg, in which the
Euler-Lagrange equation was derived under the assumption of $C^2$-regularity of
the topological boundary and the results in Sternberg & Topaloglu in which the
contributors assume local minimality. In case $\Omega$ has non-empty boundary, we
show that stationary points meet the boundary of $\Omega$ orthogonally in a
weak sense, unless they have positive distance to it.
