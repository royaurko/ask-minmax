We study an inverse scattering problem for a pair of Hamiltonians $(H(h),
H\_0 (h))$ on $L^2 (\r^n)$, where $H\_0 (h) = -h^2 \Delta$ and $H (h)= H\_0 (h)
+V$, $V$ is a short-range potential with a regular behaviour at infinity and
$h$ is the semiclassical parameter. We show that, in dimension $n \geq 3$, the
knowledge of the scattering operators $S(h)$, $h \in ]0, 1]$, up to
$O(h^\infty)$ in ${\cal{B}} (L^2(\r^n))$, and which are localized near a fixed
energy $\lambda >0$, determine the potential $V$ at infinity.
