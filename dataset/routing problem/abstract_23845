We consider a general discrete-time financial market with proportional
transaction costs as in [Kabanov, Stricker and R\'{a}sonyi Finance and
Stochastics 7 (2003) 403--411] and [Schachermayer Math. Finance 14 (2004)
19--48]. In addition to the usual investment in financial assets, we assume
that the agents can invest part of their wealth in industrial projects that
yield a nonlinear random return. We study the problem of maximizing the utility
of consumption on a finite time period. The main difficulty comes from the
nonlinearity of the nonfinancial assets' return. Our main result is to show
that existence holds in the utility maximization problem. As an intermediary
step, we prove the closedness of the set $A_T$ of attainable claims under a
robust no-arbitrage property similar to the one introduced in [Schachermayer
Math. Finance 14 (2004) 19--48] and further discussed in [Kabanov, Stricker and
R\'{a}sonyi Finance and Stochastics 7 (2003) 403--411]. This allows us to
provide a dual formulation for $A_T$.
