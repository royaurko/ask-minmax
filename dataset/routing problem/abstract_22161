In the paper we show the equality between the Lempert function and the Green
function with two poles with equal weights in the bidisc thus giving the
positive answer to a conjecture of Coman in the simplest unknown case.
Actually, a slightly more general equality is proven which in some sense is
natural when studied from the point of view of the Nevanlinna-Pick problem in
the bidisc.
