An Inverse Scattering Method is developed for the Camassa-Holm equation. As
an illustration of our approach the solutions corresponding to the
reflectionless potentials are explicitly constructed in terms of the scattering
data. The main difference with respect to the standard Inverse Scattering
Transform lies in the fact that we have a weighted spectral problem. We
therefore have to develop different asymptotic expansions.
