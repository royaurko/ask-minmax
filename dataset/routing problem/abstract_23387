This paper discusses a general class of ladder resummation inspired hadronic
approximations. It is found that this approach naturally reproduces many
successes of single meson per channel saturation models (e.g. VMD) and NJL
based models. In particular the existence of a constituent quark mass and a gap
equation follows naturally. We construct an approximation that satisfies a
large set of QCD short-distance and large $N_c$ constraints and reproduces many
hadronic observables.
  We show how there exists in general a problem between QCD short-distance
constraints for Green Functions and those for form factors and cross-sections
following from the quark-counting rule. This problem while expected for Green
functions that do not vanish in purely perturbative QCD also persists for many
Green functions that are order parameters.
