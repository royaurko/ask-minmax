The spectral problem of thin elastic shells in membrane approximation does
not satisfy the classical properties of compactness and so there exists an
essential spectrum. In the first part, we propose to determinate this spectrum
and the weakness directions in the shell. We particularly study the case of
homogeneous and isotropic shells with some examples. In the second part, we
consider an elementary model problem to study the propagation of singularities
and their reflections at the boundary of the domain. In the last, we study the
problem of propagation for an isotropic cylindrical shell and we show that the
equation of propagation does not depend on the Poisson coefficient.
