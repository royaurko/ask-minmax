The paper consists of lecture notes for a mini-course given by the contributors at
the G\"okova Geometry \& Topology conference in May 2014. We start the
exposition with tropical curves in the plane and their applications to problems
in classical enumerative geometry, and continue with a look at more general
tropical varieties and their homology theories.
