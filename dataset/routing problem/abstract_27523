Increasingly complex generative models are being used across the disciplines
as they allow for realistic characterization of data, but a common difficulty
with them is the prohibitively large computational cost to perform
likelihood-based statistical inference. We consider here a likelihood-free
framework where inference is done by identifying parameter values which
generate simulated data adequately resembling the observed data. A major
difficulty is how to measure the discrepancy between the simulated and observed
data. Transforming the original problem into a problem of classifying the data
into simulated versus observed, we find that classification accuracy can be
used to assess the discrepancy. The complete arsenal of classification methods
becomes thereby available for inference of intractable generative models.
