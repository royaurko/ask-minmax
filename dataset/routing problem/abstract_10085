In the present scenario the recent engineering and industrial built-up units
are facing hodgepodge of problems in a lot of aspects such as machining time,
electricity, man power, raw material and customers constraints. The job-shop
scheduling is one of the most significant industrial behaviours, particularly
in manufacturing planning. This paper proposes the permutation flow shop
sequencing problem with the objective of makespan minimization using the new
modified proposed method of johnsons algorithm as well as the guptas heuristic
algorithm. This paper involves the determination of the order of processing of
n jobs in m machines. Although since the problem is known to be np-hard for
three or more machines, that produces near optimal solution of the given
problem. The proposed method is very simple and easy to understand followed by
a numerical illustration is given.
