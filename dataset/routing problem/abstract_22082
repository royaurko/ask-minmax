This article provides a novel framework to evaluate limit order tactics that
highlights expected fill price, adverse price selection cost, and opportunity
cost. We formulate the problem of optimal execution of market orders with
nonlinear market impact, power law decay kernel, and stochastic and
deterministic liquidity constraints. We demonstrate how these tactics can be
incorporated in the uncertainty bands framework.
