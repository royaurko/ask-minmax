We estimate the baryonic (stellar+cold gas) mass function of galaxies in the
local Universe by assigning a complete sample of Two Micron All Sky Survey and
Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies a gas fraction based on a statistical sample
of the entire population, under the assumption of a universally-applicable
stellar initial mass function. The baryonic mass function is similar to the
stellar mass function at the high mass end, and has a reasonably steep
faint-end slope owing to the typically high cold gas fractions and low stellar
mass-to-light ratios characteristic of low-mass galaxies. The Schechter
Function fit parameters are phi* = 0.0108(6) per cubic Mpc per dex of mass, M*
= 5.3(3)x10^10 solar masses, and alpha = -1.21(5), with formal error estimates
given in parentheses (for a Hubble constant of 100 km/s per Mpc). We show that
the neutral and molecular hydrogen mass functions derived using this indirect
route are in agreement with direct estimates, validating our indirect method.
Integrating under the baryonic mass function and incorporating all sources of
uncertainty, we find that the baryonic (stellar+cold gas) mass density implied
by this estimate is Omega_cold baryon = 0.0024+0.0007-0.0014, or 8% +4% -5% of
the Big Bang nucleosynthesis expectation.
