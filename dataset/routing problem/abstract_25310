There are two main reasons why relative equilibria of N point masses under
the influence of Newton attraction are mathematically more interesting to study
when space dimension is at least 4: On the one hand, in a higher dimensional
space, a relative equilibrium is determined not only by the initial
configuration but also by the choice of a complex structure on the space where
the motion takes place; in particular, its angular momentum depends on this
choice; On the other hand, relative equilibria are not necessarily periodic: if
the configuration is "balanced" but not central, the motion is in general
quasi-periodic. In this exploratory paper we address the following question,
which touches both aspects: what are the possible frequencies of the angular
momentum of a given central (or balanced) configuration and at what values of
these frequencies bifurcations from periodic to quasi-periodic relative
equilibria do occur ? We give a full answer for relative equilibrium motions in
dimension 4 and conjecture that an analogous situation holds true for higher
dimensions. A refinement of Horn's problem given by Fomin, Fulton, Li and Poon
plays an important role.
  P.S. The conjecture is now proved (see Alain Chenciner and Hugo Jimenez
Perez, Angular momentum and Horn's problem, arXiv:1110.5030v1 [math.DS]).
