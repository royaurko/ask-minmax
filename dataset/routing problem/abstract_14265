We consider the Savage-Hutter system consisting of two-dimensional
depth-integrated shallow water equations for the incompressible fluid with the
Coulomb-type friction term. Using the method of convex integration we show that
the associated initial-value problem possesses infinitely many weak solutions
for any finite-energy initial data. On the other hand, the problem enjoys the
weak-strong uniqueness property provided the system of equations is
supplemented with the energy inequality.
