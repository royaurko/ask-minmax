We study the inverse scattering problem for the three dimensional nonlinear
Schroedinger equation with the Yukawa potential. The nonlinearity of the
equation is nonlocal. We reconstruct the potential and the nonlinearity by the
knowledge of the scattering states. Our result is applicable to reconstructing
the nonlinearity of the semi-relativistic Hartree equation.
