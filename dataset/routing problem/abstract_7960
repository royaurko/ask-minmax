I offer a simple and useful formula for the resolvent of a small rank
perturbation of large matrices. I discuss applications of this formula, in
particular, to analytical and numerical solving of difference boundary value
problems. I present examples connected with such problems for the difference
Laplacian and estimate numerical efficiency of the corresponding algorithms.
