We study gauge theories in the context of a gravitational theory without the
cosmological constant problem (CCP). The theory is based on the requirement
that the measure of integration in the action is not necessarily $\sqrt{-g}$
but it is determined dynamically through additional degrees of freedom.
Realization of these ideas in the framework of the first order formalism solves
the CCP. Incorporation of a condensate of a four index field strength allows,
after a conformal transformation to the Einstein frame, to represent the system
of gravity and matter in the standard GR form. Now, however, the effective
potential vanishes at a vacuum state due to the exact balance to zero of the
gauge fields condensate and the original scalar fields potential. As a result
it is possible to combine the solution of the CCP with: a) inflation and
transition to a $\Lambda =0$ phase without fine tuning after a reheating
period; b) spontaneously broken gauge unified theories (including fermions).
The model opens new possibilities for a solution of the hierarchy problem.
