We consider the problem of list edge coloring for planar graphs. Edge
coloring is the problem of coloring the edges while ensuring that two edges
that are incident receive different colors. A graph is k-edge-choosable if for
any assignment of k colors to every edge, there is an edge coloring such that
the color of every edge belongs to its color assignment. Vizing conjectured in
1965 that every graph is (D+1)-edge-choosable, where D is the maximum degree.
In 1990, Borodin solved the conjecture for planar graphs with maximum degree at
least 9, and asked whether the bound could be lowered to 8. We prove here that
planar graphs with maximum degree D at least 8 are (D+1)-edge-choosable.
