The contributor would like to propose a simple but yet effective method, convex
layers, nearest neighbor and triangle inequality, to approach the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP). No computer is needed in this method. This method is
designed for plain folks who faced the TSP everyday but do not have the
sophisticated knowledge of computer science, programming language or applied
mathematics. The contributor also hopes that it would give some insights to
researchers who are interested in the TSP.
