We consider the shape-topological control of a singularly perturbed
variational inequality. As the reference geometry-dependent state problem the
paper addresses a heterogeneous medium with a micro-object (defect) and a
macro-object (crack) modeled in 2d and illustrated analytically in 1d.
  The corresponding nonlinear optimization problem subject to inequality
constraints at the crack is considered within a general variational framework.
For the reason of asymptotic analysis, singular perturbation theory is applied
resulting in topological sensitivity of an objective function representing the
release rate of the strain energy. In the vicinity of the nonlinear crack, the
anti-plane strain energy release rate is expressed by means of the mode-III
stress intensity factor, that is examined with respect to small defects like
micro-cracks, holes, and inclusions of varying stiffness. The result of
shape-topological control is useful either for arrests or rise of crack growth.
