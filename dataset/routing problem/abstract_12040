We analyze the systematic errors made when using the generalized eigenvalue
problem to extract energies and matrix elements in lattice gauge theory.
Effective theories such as HQET are also discussed. Numerical results are shown
for the extraction of ground-state and excited B-meson masses and the
ground-state decay constant in the static approximation.
