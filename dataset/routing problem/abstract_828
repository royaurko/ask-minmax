The staged commissioning of the Large Hadron Collider presents an opportunity
to map gross features of particle production over a significant energy range. I
suggest a visual tool - event displays in (pseudo)rapidity-transverse-momentum
space - as a scenic route that may help sharpen intuition, identify interesting
classes of events for further investigation, and test expectations about the
underlying event that accompanies large-transverse-momentum phenomena.
