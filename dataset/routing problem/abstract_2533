We study simple lattice systems to demonstrate the influence of
interpenetrating bond networks on phase behavior. We promote interpenetration
by using a Hamiltonian with a weakly repulsive interaction with nearest
neighbors and an attractive interaction with second-nearest neighbors. In this
way, bond networks will form between second-nearest neighbors, allowing for two
(locally) distinct networks to form. We obtain the phase behavior from analytic
solution in the mean-field approximation and exact solution on the Bethe
lattice. We compare these results with exact numerical results for the phase
behavior from grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations on square, cubic, and
tetrahedral lattices. All results show that these simple systems exhibit rich
phase diagrams with two fluid-fluid critical points and three thermodynamically
distinct phases. We also consider including third-nearest-neighbor
interactions, which give rise to a phase diagram with four critical points and
five thermodynamically distinct phases. Thus the interpenetration mechanism
provides a simple route to generate multiple liquid phases in single-component
systems, such as hypothesized in water and observed in several model and
experimental systems. Additionally, interpenetration of many such networks
appears plausible in a recently considered material made from nanoparticles
functionalized by single strands of DNA.
