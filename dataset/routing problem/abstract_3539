The fundamental elements of evidential reasoning problems are described,
followed by a discussion of the structure of various types of problems.
Bayesian inference networks and state space formalism are used as the tool for
problem representation.
  A human-oriented decision making cycle for solving evidential reasoning
problems is described and illustrated for a military situation assessment
problem. The implementation of this cycle may serve as the basis for an expert
system shell for evidential reasoning; i.e. a situation assessment processor.
