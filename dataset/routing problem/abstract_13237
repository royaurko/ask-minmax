We discuss an extension of our method Image Inpainting Based on Coherence
Transport. For the latter method the pixels of the inpainting domain have to be
serialized into an ordered list. Up till now, to induce the serialization we
have used the distance to boundary map. But there are inpainting problems where
the distance to boundary serialization causes unsatisfactory inpainting
results. In the present work we demonstrate cases where we can resolve the
difficulties by employing other distance functions which better suit the
problem at hand.
