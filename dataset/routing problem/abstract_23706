This note is concerned with the study of the initial boundary value problem
for systems of conservation laws from the point of view of control theory,
where the initial data is fixed and the boundary data are regarded as control
functions. We first consider the problem of controllability at a fixed time for
genuinely nonlinear Temple class systems, and present a description of the set
of attainable configurations of the corresponding solutions in terms of
suitable Oleinik-type estimates. We next present a result concerning the
asymptotic stabilization near a constant state for general $n\times n$ systems.
Finally we show with an example that in general one cannot achieve exact
controllability to a constant state in finite time.
