Most work on surgeries in contact 3-manifolds has focused upon determining
the situations where tightness is preserved. We will discuss an approach to
this problem from the reverse angle: when negative surgery on a fibred knot in
an overtwisted contact manifold produces a tight one. We will examine the
various phenomena that occur, and discuss a characterisation that uses Heegaard
Floer homology.
