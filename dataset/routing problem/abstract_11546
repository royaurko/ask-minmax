Let $X$ be a complex manifold, $V$ a smooth involutive submanifold of $T^*X$,
$\cal M$ a microdifferential system regular along $V$, and $F$ an
$\mathbb{R}$-constructible sheaf on $X$.
  The complex of temperate microfunction solutions of $\cal M$ associated with
$F$ is now well understood. In this paper we study the temperate case and give
a bound to the micro-support of the temperate microfunction solution sheaves
and solve the Cauchy problem under suitable hyperbolicity conditions.
