We provide criteria for deciding whether a given planar curve is an image of
a given spatial curve, obtained by a central or a parallel projection with
unknown parameters. These criteria reduce the projection problem to a certain
modification of the equivalence problem of planar curves under affine and
projective transformations. The latter problem can be addressed using Cartan's
moving frame method. This leads to a novel algorithmic solution of the
projection problem for curves. The computational advantage of the algorithms
presented here, in comparison to algorithms based on a straightforward
solution, lies in a significant reduction of a number of real parameters that
has to be eliminated in order to establish existence or non-existence of a
projection that maps a given spatial curve to a given planar curve. The same
approach can be used to decide whether a given finite set of ordered points on
a plane is an image of a given finite set of ordered points in R^3. The
motivation comes from the problem of establishing a correspondence between an
object and an image, taken by a camera with unknown position and parameters.
