The fine calibration of the ISO-SWS detectors (Infrared Space Observatory -
Short Wavelength Spectrometer) has proven to be a delicate problem. We
therefore present a detailed spectroscopic study in the 2.38 -- 12 micron
wavelength range of a sample of 16 A0 -- M2 stars used for the calibration of
ISO-SWS. By investigating the discrepancies between the ISO-SWS data of these
sources, the theoretical predictions of their spectra, the high-resolution
FTS-KP (Kitt Peak) spectrum of Alpha Boo and the solar FTS-ATMOS (Atmospheric
Trace Molecule Spectroscopy) spectrum, both calibration problems and problems
in computing the theoretical models and the synthetic spectra are revealed. The
underlying reasons for these problems are sought for and the impact on the
further calibration of ISO-SWS and on the theoretical modelling is discussed
extensively.
