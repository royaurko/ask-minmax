The large error of the DFT+U method on metal oxides or ionic solid compounds
is shown to arise from the self-energy of the localized d/f orbitals and p
orbitals of the anions, being much evident in electronic structure
calculations. These semicore orbitals leads the Janak theorem that
$\partial$E/$\partial$ni={\epsilon}i invalid inasmuch as the residue by orbital
self-energy. The improved band structures based on relaxed lattices are shown
based on minimization of this error, which is a possible route for accurate
excited state studies.
