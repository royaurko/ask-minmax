There exist huge problems in the current practice of crisis response
operations. Response problems are projected as a combination of failure in
communication, failure in technology, failure in methodology, failure of
management, and finally failure of observation. In this paper we compare eight
crisis response systems namely: DrillSim [2, 13], DEFACTO [12, 17], ALADDIN [1,
6], RoboCup Rescue [11, 15], FireGrid [3, 8, 18], WIPER [16], D-AESOP [4], and
PLAN C [14]. Comparison results will disclose the cause of failure of current
crisis response operations (the response gap). Based on comparison results; we
provide recommendations for bridging this gap between response operations and
systems.
