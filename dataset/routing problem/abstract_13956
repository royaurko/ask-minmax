In this note, we discuss the problem of consensus finding in communication
networks of agents with dynamically switching topologies. In particular, we
consider the case of directed networks with unbalanced matrices of
communication rates. We formulate sufficient conditions for consensus finding
in terms of strong connectivity of the underlying directed graphs and prove
that, given these conditions, consensus is found asymptotically. Moreover, we
show that this consensus is an emergent property of the system, being encoded
in its dynamics and not just an invariant of its initial configuration.
