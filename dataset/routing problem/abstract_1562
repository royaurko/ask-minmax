For the first time, ordered polar molecules confined in monolayer-deep
rectangular pits produced on an alkali halide surface by electron irradiation
have been resolved at room temperature by non-contact atomic force microscopy.
Molecules self-assemble in a specific fashion inside pits of width smaller than
15 nm. By contrast no ordered aggregates of molecules are observed on flat
terraces. Conclusions regarding nucleation and ordering mechanisms are drawn.
Trapping in pits as small as 2 nm opens a route to address single molecules.
