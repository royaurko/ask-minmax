We discuss baryogenesis using the flipped $SU(5)$ model for lepton mass
matrices. We show that the generalized see-saw mechanism in this model can not
only provide MSW neutrino mixing suitable for solving the solar neutrino
problem, and supply a hot dark matter candidate ($\nu_\tau$) with mass
$0(10)eV$ as indicated by recent COBE results, but can also naturally account
for the baryon asymmetry of the universe. Heavy singlet neutrino decay
generates a net lepton asymmetry which is subsequently reprocessed by
nonperturbative electroweak interactions. We evaluate the baryon asymmetry so
produced in light of the constraints that the COBE observations put on
inflationary cosmologies, finding it comfortably consistent with observation.
