Solar model independent tests of the vacuum oscillation and MSW solutions of
the solar neutrino problem are considered. Detailed predictions for time
(seasonal) variations of the signals in the future solar neutrino detectors
(SNO, Super Kamiokande, BOREXINO, HELLAZ), if solar neutrinos take part in
vacuum oscillations, are given. Results on the distortions of the spectra of
boron neutrinos, and of electrons from the neutrino-electron scattering induced
by boron neutrinos, in the cases of vacuum oscillations or MSW transitions are
presented for a large number of values of the relevant parameters. The
possibilities to distinguish between the vacuum oscillation, the MSW adiabatic,
and the MSW nonadiabatic transitions (solutions) in the future solar neutrino
experiments are discussed.
