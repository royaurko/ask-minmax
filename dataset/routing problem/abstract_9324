Knowledge is attributed to human whose problem-solving behavior is subjective
and complex. In today's knowledge economy, the need to manage knowledge
produced by a community of actors cannot be overemphasized. This is due to the
fact that actors possess some level of tacit knowledge which is generally
difficult to articulate. Problem-solving requires searching and sharing of
knowledge among a group of actors in a particular context. Knowledge expressed
within the context of a problem resolution must be capitalized for future
reuse. In this paper, an approach that permits dynamic capitalization of
relevant and reliable actors' knowledge in solving decision problem following
Economic Intelligence process is proposed. Knowledge annotation method and
temporal attributes are used for handling the complexity in the communication
among actors and in contextualizing expressed knowledge. A prototype is built
to demonstrate the functionalities of a collaborative Knowledge Management
system based on this approach. It is tested with sample cases and the result
showed that dynamic capitalization leads to knowledge validation hence
increasing reliability of captured knowledge for reuse. The system can be
adapted to various domains
