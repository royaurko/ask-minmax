In the description of the production properties of gauge bosons (W+/W-, Z0,
gamma) at colliders, the lowest-order graph normally is not sufficient. The
contributions of higher orders can be introduced either by an explicit
order-by-order matrix-element calculation, by a resummation procedure or by a
parton-shower algorithm. Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages. We
here introduce a method that allows the parton-shower algorithm to be augmented
by higher-order information, thereby offering an economical route to a
description of all event properties. It is tested by comparing with the pT
spectrum of W bosons at the Tevatron.
