We solve Einstein's equation with Robertson-Walker metric as an initial-value
problem, using as the source of gravity a Halpern-Huang real scalar field,
which was derived from renormalization-group analysis, with a potential that
exhibits asymptotic freedom and spontaneous symmetry breaking. Both properties
are crucial to the formulation of the problem. Numerical solutions show that
the universe expands at an accelerated rate, with the radius increasing like
the exponential of a power of the time. This is relevant to "dark energy" and
"cosmic inflation". Extension to the complex scalar field will make the
universe a superfluid. The vortex dynamics that emerges offers explanations for
other cosmological problems, namely, matter creation, galactic voids, and the
"dark mass".
