We show that the limiting polygon generated by the dimension elevation
algorithm with respect to the \muntz space
$span(1,t^{r_1},t^{r_2},...,t^{r_m},...)$, with $0 < r_1 < r_2 < ... < r_m <
...$ and $\lim_{n\to\infty}r_n = \infty$, over an interval
$[a,b]\subset]0,\infty[$ converges to the underlying Chebyshev-B\'ezier curve
if and only if the \muntz condition $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{r_i} =
\infty$ is satisfied. The surprising emergence of the \muntz condition in the
problem raises the question of a possible connection between the density
questions of nested Chebyshev spaces and the convergence of the corresponding
dimension elevation algorithms. The question of convergence with no condition
of monotonicity or positivity on the pairwise distinct real numbers $r_i$
remains an open problem.
