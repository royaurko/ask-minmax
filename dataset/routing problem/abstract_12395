The paper describes a novel technique that allows to reduce by half the
number of delta values that were required to be computed with complexity O(N)
in most of the heuristics for the quadratic assignment problem. Using the
correlation between the old and new delta values, obtained in this work, a new
formula of complexity O(1) is proposed. Found result leads up to 25%
performance increase in such well-known algorithms as Robust Tabu Search and
others based on it.
