We study the geodesic equation for the Dirichlet (gradient) metric in the
space of K\"ahler potentials as a dynamical system. We first solve the initial
value problem for the geodesic equation of the combination metric including the
gradient metric. We then discuss its application, such as energy identity,
Jacobi fields and comparison theorem, curvature and the stability problem of
the geodesic ray. As last, as the geometric motivation of the combination
metric, we find that the Ebin metric restricted to the space of type II
deformations of a Sasakian structure is the sum of the Calabi metric and the
gradient metric.
