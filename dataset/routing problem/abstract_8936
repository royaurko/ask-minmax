We study the structure of the solution space and behavior of local search
methods on random 3-SAT problems close to the SAT/UNSAT transition. Using the
overlap measure of similarity between different solutions found on the same
problem instance we show that the solution space is shrinking as a function of
alpha. We consider chains of satisfiability problems, where clauses are added
sequentially. In each such chain, the overlap distribution is first smooth, and
then develops a tiered structure, indicating that the solutions are found in
well separated clusters. On chains of not too large instances, all solutions
are eventually observed to be in only one small cluster before vanishing. This
condensation transition point is estimated to be alpha_c = 4.26. The transition
approximately obeys finite-size scaling with an apparent critical exponent of
about 1.7. We compare the solutions found by a local heuristic, ASAT, and the
Survey Propagation algorithm up to alpha_c.
