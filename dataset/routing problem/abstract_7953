We study the planar problem of two satellites attracted by a center of force.
Assuming that the center of mass of the two-satellite system is on a circular
orbit around the center of force and using Levi-Civita regularization we prove
the existence of an almost periodic orbit with an infinite number of collision
between the satellites.
