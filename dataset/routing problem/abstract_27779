With the recent emergence of 3D-supported TVs, video service providers now
face an opportunity to provide high resolution multi-view 3D videos over IP
networks. One simple way to support efficient communications between a video
server and multiple clients is to deliver each desired view in a multicast
stream. Nevertheless, it is expected that significantly increased bandwidth
will be required to support the transmission of all views in multi-view 3D
videos. However, the recent emergence of a new video synthesis technique called
Depth-Image-Based Rendering (DIBR) suggests that multi-view 3D video does not
necessarily require the transmission of all views. Therefore, we formulate a
new problem, named Multi-view and Multicast Delivery Selection Problem (MMDS),
and design an algorithm, called MMDEA, to find the optimal solution. Simulation
results manifest that using DIBR can effectively reduce bandwidth consumption
by 35% compared to the original multicast delivery scheme.
