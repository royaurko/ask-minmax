A hypergraph is 2-intersecting if any two edges intersect in at least two
vertices. Blais, Weinstein and Yoshida asked (as a first step to a more general
problem) whether every 2-intersecting hypergraph has a vertex coloring with a
constant number of colors so that each hyperedge e has at least min{|e|,3}
colors. We show that there is such a coloring with at most 5 colors (which is
best possible).
