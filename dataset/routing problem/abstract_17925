Direct device-to-device (D2D) communication has been proposed as a possible
enabler for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) applications, where the incurred
intra-cell interference and the stringent latency and reliability requirements
are challenging issues. In this paper, we investigate the radio resource
management problem for D2D-based V2V communications. Firstly, we analyze and
mathematically model the actual requirements for vehicular communications and
traditional cellular links. Secondly, we propose a problem formulation to
fulfill these requirements, and then a Separate Resource Block allocation and
Power control (SRBP) algorithm to solve this problem. Finally, simulations are
presented to illustrate the improved performance of the proposed SRBP scheme
compared to some other existing methods.
