This article is concerned with a system of semilinear parabolic equations
with two free boundaries describing the spreading fronts of the invasive
species in a mutualistic ecological model. The local existence and uniqueness
of a classical solution are obtained and the asymptotic behavior of the free
boundary problem is studied. Our results indicate that two free boundaries tend
monotonically to finite or infinite at the same time, and the free boundary
problem admits a global slow solution with unbounded free boundaries if the
inter-specific competitions are strong, while if the inter-specific
competitions are weak, there exist the blowup solution and global fast
solution.
