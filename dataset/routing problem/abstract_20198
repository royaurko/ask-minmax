Some basic notions of classical algebraic geometry can be defined in
arbitrary varieties of algebras $\Theta.$ For every algebra $H$ in $\Theta$ one
can consider algebraic geometry in $\Theta$ over $ H.$ Correspondingly,
algebras in $\Theta$ are considered with the emphasis on equations and
geometry. We give examples of geometric properties of algebras in $\Theta$ and
of geometric relations between them. The main problem considered in the paper
is when different $H_1$ and $H_2$ have the same geometry.
