The atomic force microscope is a versatile tool that allows many routes to be
used for investigating the mechanical properties of soft materials on the
nanometer scale. In the present work, experiments were performed on polystyrene
polymer films of various molecular weight by approaching a vibrating nanotip
towards the surface. The variation of the oscillating amplitude of the
cantilever is interpreted as the result of the growth process of a
nanoprotuberance. The growth rate is found to be dependent of the magnitude of
the oscillating amplitude and of the molecular weight. A model is developed
describing in a very simple way the action of the tip and a viscoelastic
response of the polymer. The numerical simulation helps in understanding the
nonlinear relation between the growth rate and the vibrating amplitude of the
microlever and describes qualitatively most of the experimental features. For
the softer material, experimental situations are found that allow the
experimental results to be amenable with an analytical solution. The analytical
solution provides a fruitful comparison with the experimental results showing
that some of the nanoprotuberance evolution cannot be explained with the
approximation used. The presents results show that there exists a new and
fascinating route to better understand the mechanical response at the local
scale.
