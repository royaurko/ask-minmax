In this paper, we discuss the state feedback output regulation problem (SFRP)
for infinite-dimensional linear control systems with infinite-dimensional
exosystems. Under the polynomial stabilizability assumption, sufficient and
necessary conditions are given for the solvability of the SFRP. The solvability
of this problem is characterized in terms of the solvability of a pair of
linear regulator equations. An application of the solvability of the SFRP for
polynomial stable SISO system is given.
