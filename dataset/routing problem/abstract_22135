The Berezinskii localization law \sigma(\omega) (-i\omega) for
frequency-dependent conductivity was never questioned from the theoretical
side, but never observed experimentally. In fact, this result is valid for
closed systems, while most of actual systems are open. We discuss several
possibilities for observation of this law and experimental difficulties arising
at this way.
