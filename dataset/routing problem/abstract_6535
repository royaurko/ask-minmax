In this paper we study the quasi-static problem for a viscoelastic fluid by
means of the concept of minimal state. This implies the use of a different free
energy defined in a wider space of data. The existence and uniqueness is proved
in this new space and the asymptotic decay for the problem with non vanishing
supplies is obtained for a large class of memory kernels, including those
presenting an exponential or polynomial decay.
