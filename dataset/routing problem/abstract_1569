Using self-organized polymer models, we predict mechanical unfolding and
refolding pathways of ribo-zymes, and the green fluorescent protein. In
agreement with experiments, there are between six and eight unfolding
transitions in the Tetrahymena ribozyme. Depending on the loading rate, the
number of rips in the force-ramp unfolding of the Azoarcus ribozymes is between
two and four. Force-quench refolding of the P4-P6 subdomain of the Tetrahymena
ribozyme occurs through a compact intermediate. Subsequent formation of
tertiary contacts between helices P5b-P6a and P5a/P5c-P4 leads to the native
state. The force-quench refolding pathways agree with ensemble experiments. In
the dominant unfolding route, the N-terminal a helix of GFP unravels first,
followed by disruption of the N terminus b strand. There is a third
intermediate that involves disruption of three other strands. In accord with
experiments, the force-quench refolding pathway of GFP is hierarchic, with the
rate-limiting step being the closure of the barrel.
