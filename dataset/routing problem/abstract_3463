We obtain estimates on the continuous dependence on the coefficient for
second order non-linear degenerate Neumann type boundary value problems. Our
results extend previous work of Cockburn et.al., Jakobsen-Karlsen, and
Gripenberg to problems with more general boundary conditions and domains. A new
feature here is that we account for the dependence on the boundary conditions.
As one application of our continuous dependence results, we derive for the
first time the rate of convergence for the vanishing viscosity method for such
problems. We also derive new explicit continuous dependence on the coefficients
results for problems involving Bellman-Isaacs equations and certain quasilinear
equation.
