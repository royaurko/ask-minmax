The purpose of this paper is to push forward the theory of operator-valued
Riemann Hilbert problems and demonstrate their effectiveness in respect to the
implementation of a non-linear steepest descent method \textit{\'{a} la}
Deift-Zhou. In the present paper, we demonstrate that the operator-valued
Riemann--Hilbert problem arising in the characterisation of so-called
$c$-shifted integrable integral operators allows one to extract the large-$x$
asymptotics of the Fredholm determinant associated with such operators.
