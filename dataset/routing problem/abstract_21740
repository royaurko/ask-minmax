We endow the set of complements of a fixed subspace of a projective space
with the structure of an affine space, and show that certain lines of such an
affine space are affine reguli or cones over affine reguli. Moreover, we apply
our concepts to the problem of describing dual spreads. We do not assume that
the projective space is finite-dimensional or pappian.
