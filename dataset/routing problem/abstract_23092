The various schemes for studying rigidly rotating perfect fluids in general
relativity are reviewed. General conclusions one may draw from these are: (i)
There is a need to restrict the scope of the possible ansatze, and (ii) the
angular behaviour is a valuable commodity. This latter observation follows from
a large number of analytic models exhibiting a NUT-like behaviour. A method of
getting around problem (ii) is presented on a simple example. To alleviate
problem (i) for rigidly rotating perfect fluids, approximation schemes based on
a series expansion in the angular velocity are suggested. A pioneering work,
due to Hartle, explores the global properties of matched space-times to
quadratic order in the angular velocity.
  As a first example of the applications, it is shown that the rigidly rotating
incompressible fluid cannot be Petrov type D.
