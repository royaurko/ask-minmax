Recently a novel dynamical state, called the {\it chimera death}, is
discovered in a network of non locally coupled identical oscillators [A.
Zakharova, M. Kapeller, and E. Sch\"oll, Phy.Rev.Lett. 112, 154101 (2014)],
which is defined as the coexistence of spatially coherent and incoherent
oscillation death state. This state arises due to the interplay of non locality
and symmetry breaking and thus bridges the gap between two important dynamical
states, namely the chimera and oscillation death. In this paper we show that
the chimera death can be induced in a network of generic identical oscillators
with mean-field diffusive coupling and thus we establish that a non local
coupling is not essential to obtain chimera death. We identify a new transition
route to the chimera death state, namely the transition from in-phase
synchronized oscillation to chimera death via global amplitude death state. We
ascribe the occurrence of chimera death to the bifurcation structure of the
network in the limiting condition and show that multi-cluster chimera death
states can be achieved by a proper choice of initial conditions.
