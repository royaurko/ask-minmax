We propose a fully discretised numerical scheme for the hyperelastic rod wave
equation on the line. The convergence of the method is established. Moreover,
the scheme can handle the blow-up of the derivative which naturally occurs for
this equation. By using a time splitting integrator which preserves the
invariants of the problem, we can also show that the scheme preserves the
positivity of the energy density.
