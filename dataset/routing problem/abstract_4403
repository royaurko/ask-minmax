This paper is devoted to provide some new results on Lyapunov type
inequalities for the periodic boundary value problem at higher eigenvalues. Our
main result is derived from a detailed analysis on the number and distribution
of zeros of nontrivial solutions and their first derivatives, together with the
study of some special minimization problems, where the Lagrange multiplier
Theorem plays a fundamental role. This allows to obtain the optimal constants.
Our applications include the Hill's equation where we give some new conditions
on its stability properties and also the study of periodic and nonlinear
problems at resonance where we show some new conditions which allow to prove
the existence and uniqueness of solutions.
