We present 2 recent results on the problems of time and observables in
canonical gravity. (1) We cannot use parametrized field theory to solve the
problem of time because, strictly speaking, general relativity is not a
parametrized field theory. (2) We show that there are essentially no local
observables for vacuum spacetimes.
