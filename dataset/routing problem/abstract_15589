Making statistical predictions requires tackling two problems: one must
assign appropriate probability distributions and then one must calculate a
variety of expected values. The method of maximum entropy is commonly used to
address the first problem. Here we explore its use to tackle the second
problem. We show how this use of maximum entropy leads to the Bogoliuvob
variational principle which we generalize, apply to density functional theory,
and use it to develop a mean field theory for classical fluids. Numerical
calculations for Argon gas are compared with experimental data.
