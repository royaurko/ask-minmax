In general-covariant theories the Hamiltonian is a constraint, and hence
there is no time evolution; this is the problem of time. In the subcritical
free string, the Hamiltonian ceases to be a constraint after quantization due
to conformal anomalies, and time evolution becomes non-trivial and unitary. It
is argued that the problem of time in four dimensions can be resolved by a
similar mechanism. This forces us to challenge some widespread beliefs, such as
the idea that every gauge symmetry is a redundancy of the description.
