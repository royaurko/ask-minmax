Let W be an associative PI algebra over a field F of characteristic zero,
graded by a finite group G. Let id_{G}(W) denote the T-ideal of G-graded
identities of W. We prove: 1. {[G-graded PI equivalence]} There exists a field
extension K of F and a finite dimensional Z/2ZxG-graded algebra A over K such
that id_{G}(W)=id_{G}(A^{*}) where A^{*} is the Grassmann envelope of A. 2.
{[G-graded Specht problem]} The T-ideal id_{G}(W) is finitely generated as a
T-ideal. 3. {[G-graded PI-equivalence for affine algebras]} Let W be a G-graded
affine algebra over F. Then there exists a field extension K of F and a finite
dimensional algebra A over K such that id_{G}(W)=id_{G}(A).
