The importance of a node in a directed graph can be measured by its PageRank.
The PageRank of a node is used in a number of application contexts - including
ranking websites - and can be interpreted as the average portion of time spent
at the node by an infinite random walk. We consider the problem of maximizing
the PageRank of a node by selecting some of the edges from a set of edges that
are under our control. By applying results from Markov decision theory, we show
that an optimal solution to this problem can be found in polynomial time. Our
core solution results in a linear programming formulation, but we also provide
an alternative greedy algorithm, a variant of policy iteration, which runs in
polynomial time, as well. Finally, we show that, under the slight modification
for which we are given mutually exclusive pairs of edges, the problem of
PageRank optimization becomes NP-hard.
