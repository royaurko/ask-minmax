Precanonical quantization of pure Yang-Mills fields, which is based on the
covariant De Donder-Weyl (DW) Hamiltonian formalism, and its connection with
the functional Schrodinger representation in the temporal gauge are discussed.
The YM mass gap problem is related to a finite dimensional spectral problem for
a generalized Clifford-valued magnetic Schr\"odinger operator in the space of
gauge potentials which represents the DW Hamiltonian operator.
