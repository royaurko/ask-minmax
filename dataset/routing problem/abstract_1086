The goal of this article is to motivate and describe how Gromov-Witten theory
can and has provided tools to understand the moduli space of curves. For
example, ideas and methods from Gromov-Witten theory have led to both
conjectures and theorems showing that the tautological part of the cohomology
ring has a remarkable and profound structure. As an illustration, we describe a
new approach to Faber's intersection number conjecture via branched covers of
the projective line (work with I.P. Goulden and D.M. Jackson, based on work
with T. Graber). En route we review the work of a large number of
mathematicians.
