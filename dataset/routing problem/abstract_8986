In this paper, our aim is to propose a model that helps in the efficient use
of an information system by users, within the organization represented by the
IS, in order to resolve their decisional problems. In other words we want to
aid the user within an organization in obtaining the information that
corresponds to his needs (informational needs that result from his decisional
problems). This type of information system is what we refer to as economic
intelligence system because of its support for economic intelligence processes
of the organisation. Our assumption is that every EI process begins with the
identification of the decisional problem which is translated into an
informational need. This need is then translated into one or many information
search problems (ISP). We also assumed that an ISP is expressed in terms of the
user's expectations and that these expectations determine the activities or the
behaviors of the user, when he/she uses an IS. The model we are proposing is
used for the conception of the IS so that the process of retrieving of
solution(s) or the responses given by the system to an ISP is based on these
behaviours and correspond to the needs of the user.
