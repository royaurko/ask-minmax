We extend the notion of numerical stability of finite difference
approximations to include hyperbolic systems that are first order in time and
second order in space, such as those that appear in Numerical Relativity. By
analyzing the symbol of the second order system, we obtain necessary and
sufficient conditions for stability in a discrete norm containing one-sided
difference operators. We prove stability for certain toy models and the
linearized Nagy-Ortiz-Reula formulation of Einstein's equations.
  We also find that, unlike in the fully first order case, standard
discretizations of some well-posed problems lead to unstable schemes and that
the Courant limits are not always simply related to the characteristic speeds
of the continuum problem. Finally, we propose methods for testing stability for
second order in space hyperbolic systems.
