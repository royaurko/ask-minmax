We propose a mechanism for solving the horizon and entropy problems of
standard cosmology which does not make use of cosmological inflation. Crucial
ingredients of our scenario are brane gases, extra dimensions, and a confining
potential due to string gas effects which becomes dominant at string-scale
brane separations. The initial conditions are taken to be a statistically
homogeneous and isotropic hot brane gas in a space in which all spatial
dimensions are of string scale. The extra dimensions which end up as the
internal ones are orbifolded. The hot brane gas leads to an initial phase
(Phase 1) of isotropic expansion. Once the bulk energy density has decreased
sufficiently, a weak confining potential between the two orbifold fixed planes
begins to dominate, leading to a contraction of the extra spatial dimensions
(Phase 2). String modes which contain momentum about the dimensions
perpendicular to the orbifold fixed planes provide a repulsive potential which
prevents the two orbifold fixed planes from colliding. The radii of the extra
dimensions stabilize, and thereafter our three spatial dimensions expand as in
standard cosmology. The energy density after the stabilization of the extra
dimensions is of string scale, whereas the spatial volume has greatly increased
during Phases 1 and 2, thus leading to a non-inflationary solution of the
horizon and entropy problems.
