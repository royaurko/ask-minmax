Employing probabilistic techniques we compute best possible upper and lower
bounds on the price of an option on one or two assets with continuous piecewise
linear payoff function based on prices of simple call options of possibly
distinct maturities and the no-arbitrage condition, but without any assumption
on the price dynamics of underlying assets. We show that the problem reduces to
solving linear optimization problems that we explicitly characterize. We report
numerical results that illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithms we
develop.
