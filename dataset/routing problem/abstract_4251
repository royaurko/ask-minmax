Let $X=(X_1,X_2, X_3)$ be a Gaussian random vector such that $X\sim
\mathcal{N} (0,\Sigma)$. We consider the problem of determining the matrix
$\Sigma$, up to permutation, based on the knowledge of the distribution of
$X_{\mathrm{min}}:=\min(X_1, X_2, X_3)$. Particularly, we establish a
connection between this identification problem and a geometric identification
problem in the context of Circular Radon Transforms.
