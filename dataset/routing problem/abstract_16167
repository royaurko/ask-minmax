Let $\mu$ be a finite positive measure on the real line. For $a>0$ denote by
$\EE_a$ the family of exponential functions $$\EE_a=\{e^{ist}| \ s\in[0,a]\}.$$
The exponential type of $\mu$ is the infimum of all numbers $a$ such that the
finite linear combinations of the exponentials from $\EE_a$ are dense in
$L^2(\mu)$. If the set of such $a$ is empty, the exponential type of $\mu$ is
defined as infinity. The well-known type problem asks to find the exponential
type of $\mu$ in terms of $\mu$.
  \ms\no In this note we present a solution to the type problem and discuss its
relations with known results.
