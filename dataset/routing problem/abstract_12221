The finite element solution of two-dimensional anisotropic diffusion problems
is considered. A Delaunay-type mesh condition is developed for linear finite
element approximations to satisfy a discrete maximum principle. The condition
is shown to be weaker than the existing anisotropic non-obtuse angle condition.
It reduces to the well known Delaunay condition for the special case with the
identity diffusion matrix. Numerical results are presented to verify the
theoretical findings.
