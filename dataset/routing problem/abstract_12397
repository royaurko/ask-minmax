This paper is devoted to the study of the Cauchy problem for the stratified
Navier-Stokes system in space dimension three. In the first part of the paper,
we prove the existence of a unique global solution $(v_\nu,\rho_\nu)$ for this
system with axisymmetric initial data belonging to the Sobolev spaces
$H^{s}\times H^{s-2}$ with $s>5/2.$ The bounds of the solution are uniform with
respect to the viscosity. In the second part, we analyse the inviscid limit
problem. We prove the strong convergence in the space
$L^{\infty}_{\text{loc}}(\RR_+; H^{s}\times H^{s-2})$ of the viscous solutions
$(v_\nu,\rho_\nu)_{\nu>0}$ to the solution $(v,\rho)$ of the stratified Euler
system.
