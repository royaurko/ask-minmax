Given $n$ point masses turning in a plane at a constant speed, this paper
deals with the global bifurcation of periodic solutions for the masses, in that
plane and in space. As a special case, one has a complete study of n identical
masses on a regular polygon and a central mass. The symmetries of the problem
are used in order to find the irreducible representations, the linearization,
and with the help of the orthogonal degree theory, all the symmetries of the
bifurcating branches.
