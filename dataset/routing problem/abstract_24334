We consider the problem of determining the closure of a quadratic module M in
a commutative R-algebra with respect to the finest locally convex topology.
This is of interest in deciding when the moment problem is solvable and in
analyzing algorithms for polynomial optimization involving semidefinite
programming. The closure of a semiordering is also considered, and it is shown
that the space of all semiorderings lying over M plays an important role in
understanding the closure of M. The fibre theorem of Schmuedgen for
preorderings is strengthened and extended to quadratic modules. The extended
result is used to construct an example of a non-archimedean quadratic module
describing a compact semialgebraic set that has the strong moment property. The
same result is used to obtain a recursive description of the closure of M which
is valid in many cases.
