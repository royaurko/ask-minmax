We consider the problem of maximizing the algebraic connectivity of the
communication graph in a network of mobile robots by moving them into
appropriate positions. We define the Laplacian of the graph as dependent on the
pairwise distance between the robots and we approximate the problem as a
sequence of Semi-Definite Programs (SDP). We propose a distributed solution
consisting of local SDP's which use information only from nearby neighboring
robots. We show that the resulting distributed optimization framework leads to
feasible subproblems and through its repeated execution, the algebraic
connectivity increases monotonically. Moreover, we describe how to adjust the
communication load of the robots based on locally computable measures.
Numerical simulations show the performance of the algorithm with respect to the
centralized solution.
