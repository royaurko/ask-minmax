In this work, we study the downlink linear precoder design problem in a
multi-cell heterogeneous network (HetNet), in which macro/pico base stations
(BSs) are densely deployed within each cell. The problem is formulated in a
very general setting as the users' sum-utility maximization problem. Our
formulation includes many practical precoder design problems such as multi-cell
coordinated linear precoding, full and partial per-cell coordinated multi-point
(ComP) transmission, zero-forcing precoding and joint BS clustering and
beamforming/precoding as special cases.
  The sum-utility maximization problem is difficult due to its non-convexity
and the tight coupling of the users' precoders. We propose a novel convex
approximation technique to approximate the original problem by a series of
convex subproblems, each of which decomposes across all the cells. The
convexity of the subproblems allows for efficient computation, while their
decomposability leads to distributed implementation. Our approach is made
possible by the identification of certain key convexity properties of the
sum-utility objective. Simulation experiments show that the proposed framework
is quite effective for solving interference management problems in many
practical settings.
