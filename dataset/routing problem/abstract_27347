Abductive logic programs offer a formalism to declaratively represent and
reason about problems in a variety of areas: diagnosis, decision making,
hypothetical reasoning, etc. On the other hand, logic program updates allow us
to express knowledge changes, be they internal (or self) and external (or
world) changes. Abductive logic programs and logic program updates thus
naturally coexist in problems that are susceptible to hypothetical reasoning
about change. Taking this as a motivation, in this paper we integrate abductive
logic programs and logic program updates by jointly exploiting tabling features
of logic programming. The integration is based on and benefits from the two
implementation techniques we separately devised previously, viz., tabled
abduction and incremental tabling for query-driven propagation of logic program
updates. A prototype of the integrated system is implemented in XSB Prolog.
