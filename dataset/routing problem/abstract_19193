This paper considers the discrete convexity of a cross-layer on-off
transmission control problem in wireless communications. In this system, a
scheduler decides whether or not to transmit in order to optimize the long-term
quality of service (QoS) incurred by the queueing effects in the data link
layer and the transmission power consumption in the physical (PHY) layer
simultaneously. Using a Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, we show that
the optimal policy can be determined by solving a minimization problem over a
set of queue thresholds if the dynamic programming (DP) is submodular. We prove
that this minimization problem is discrete convex. In order to search the
minimizer, we consider two discrete stochastic approximation (DSA) algorithms:
discrete simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (DSPSA) and
L-natural-convex stochastic approximation (L-natural-convex SA). Through
numerical studies, we show that the two DSA algorithms converge significantly
faster than the existing continuous simultaneous perturbation stochastic
approximation (CSPSA) algorithm in multi-user systems. Finally, we compare the
convergence results and complexity of two DSA and CSPSA algorithms where we
show that DSPSA achieves the best trade-off between complexity and accuracy in
multi-user systems.
