We discuss the problem of the stability of the isotropy of the universe in
the space of ever-expanding spatially homogeneous universes with a compact
spatial topology. The anisotropic modes which prevent isotropy being
asymptotically stable in Bianchi-type $VII_h$ universes with non-compact
topologies are excluded by topological compactness. Bianchi type $V$ and type
$VII_h$ universes with compact topologies must be exactly isotropic. In the
flat case we calculate the dynamical degrees of freedom of Bianchi-type $I$ and
$VII_0$ universes with compact 3-spaces and show that type $VII_0$ solutions
are more general than type $I$ solutions for systems with perfect fluid,
although the type $I$ models are more general than type $VII_0$ in the vacuum
case. For particular topologies the 4-velocity of any perfect fluid is required
to be non-tilted. Various consequences for the problems of the isotropy,
homogeneity, and flatness of the universe are discussed.
