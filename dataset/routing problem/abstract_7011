In this paper has been considered probability-one global convergence of NFPH
(Newton-Fixed Point Homotopy) algorithm for system of nonlinear equations and
has been proposed a probability-one homotopy algorithm to solve a regularized
smoothing equation for NCP with generalized monotonicity. Our results provide a
theoretical basis to develop a new computational method for nonlinear equation
systems and complementarity problems. Some preliminary numerical experiments
shows that our NFPH method is useful and promissing for difficult nonlinear
problems.
