A simple proof of the classical subconvexity bound $\zeta(1/2+it)
\ll_\epsilon t^{1/6+\epsilon}$ for the Riemann zeta-function is given, and
estimation by more refined techniques is discussed. The connections between the
Dirichlet divisor problem and the mean square of $|\zeta(1/2+it)|$ are
analysed.
