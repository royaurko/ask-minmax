This paper presents two new results on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
Gaussian broadcast channels with confidential messages. First, the problem of
the MIMO Gaussian wiretap channel is revisited. A matrix characterization of
the capacity-equivocation region is provided, which extends the previous result
on the secrecy capacity of the MIMO Gaussian wiretap channel to the general,
possibly imperfect secrecy setting. Next, the problem of MIMO Gaussian
broadcast channels with two receivers and three independent messages: a common
message intended for both receivers, and two confidential messages each
intended for one of the receivers but needing to be kept asymptotically
perfectly secret from the other, is considered. A precise characterization of
the capacity region is provided, generalizing the previous results which
considered only two out of three possible messages.
