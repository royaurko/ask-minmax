The customized multiple arrays are becoming vastly used in microarray
experiments for varies purposes, mainly for its ability to handle a large
quantity of data and output high quality results. However, experimenters who
use customized multiple arrays still face many problems, such as the cost and
time to manufacture the masks, and the cost for production of the multiple
arrays by costly machines. Although there is some research on the multiple
arrays, there is little concern on the manufacture time and cost, which is
actually important to experimenters. In this paper, we have proposed methods to
reduce the time and cost for the manufacture of the customized multiple arrays.
We have first introduced a heuristic algorithm for the mask decomposition
problem for multiple arrays. Then a streamline method is proposed for the
integration of different steps of manufacture on a higher level. Experiments
show that our methods are very effective in reduction of the time and cost of
manufacture of multiple arrays.
