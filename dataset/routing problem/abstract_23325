Neutrino oscillations as solutions of the solar neutrino problems and the
atmospheric neutrino deficits may restrict neutrino mass squared differences
and mixing angles in three-neutrino mixing scheme. Currently we have several
solutions depending on the interpretations of the solar neutrino problems.
Combining the neutrino oscillation solutions and a mass matrix ansatz, we
investigated the neutrino mass bounds and found possible leptonic CP-violating
rephasing-invariant quantity $J^{l}_{\tiny CP} \leq 0.012$ for large mixing
angle MSW and just-so vacuum oscillations solutions, and $J^{l}_{\tiny CP} \leq
0.0013$ for small mixing angle MSW solution.
