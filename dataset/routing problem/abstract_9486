In application of the Balancing Domain Decomposition by Constraints (BDDC) to
a case with many substructures, solving the coarse problem exactly becomes the
bottleneck which spoils scalability of the solver. However, it is
straightforward for BDDC to substitute the exact solution of the coarse problem
by another step of BDDC method with subdomains playing the role of elements. In
this way, the algorithm of three-level BDDC method is obtained. If this
approach is applied recursively, multilevel BDDC method is derived. We present
a detailed description of a recently developed parallel implementation of this
algorithm. The implementation is applied to an engineering problem of linear
elasticity and a benchmark problem of Stokes flow in a cavity. Results by the
multilevel approach are compared to those by the standard (two-level) BDDC
method.
