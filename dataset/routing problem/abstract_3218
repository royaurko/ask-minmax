We show that many classical decision problems about 1-counter
omega-languages, context free omega-languages, or infinitary rational
relations, are $\Pi_2^1$-complete, hence located at the second level of the
analytical hierarchy, and "highly undecidable". In particular, the universality
problem, the inclusion problem, the equivalence problem, the determinizability
problem, the complementability problem, and the unambiguity problem are all
$\Pi_2^1$-complete for context-free omega-languages or for infinitary rational
relations. Topological and arithmetical properties of 1-counter
omega-languages, context free omega-languages, or infinitary rational
relations, are also highly undecidable. These very surprising results provide
the first examples of highly undecidable problems about the behaviour of very
simple finite machines like 1-counter automata or 2-tape automata.
