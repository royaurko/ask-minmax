We consider a family of integral operators which appears when analyzing
layered equilibria and front dynamics of a phase kinetics equation with a
conservation law. We study the spectra of these operators in $L^2$ and derive a
lower bound for the associated quadratic forms in terms of the $H^{-1}$ norm.
