We study the iterated quasi-reversibility method to regularize ill-posed
elliptic and parabolic problems: data completion problems for Poisson's and
heat equations. We define an abstract setting to treat both equations at once.
We demonstrate the convergence of the regularized solution to the exact one,
and propose a strategy to deal with noise on the data. We present numerical
experiments for both problems: a two-dimensional corrosion detection problem
and the one-dimensional heat equation with lateral data. In both cases, the
method prove to be efficient even with highly corrupted data.
