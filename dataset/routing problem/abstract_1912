Glasses exhibit spatially inhomogeneous elastic properties, which can be
investigated by measuring their elastic moduli at a local scale. Various
methods to evaluate the local elastic modulus have been proposed in the
literature. A first possibility is to measure the local stress-local strain
curve and to obtain the local elastic modulus from the slope of the curve, or
equivalently to use a local fluctuation formula. Another possible route is to
assume an affine strain and to use the applied global strain instead of the
local strain for the calculation of the local modulus. Most recently a third
technique has been introduced, which is easy to be implemented and has the
advantage of low computational cost. In this contribution, we compare these
three approaches by using the same model glass and reveal the differences among
them caused by the non-affine deformations.
