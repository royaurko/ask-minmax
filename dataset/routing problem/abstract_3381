In this paper we study extension problems, averaging problems, and
generalized Erdos-Falconer distance problems associated with arbitrary
homogeneous varieties in three dimensional vector space over finite fields. In
the case when homogeneous varieties in three dimension do not contain any plane
passing through the origin, we obtain the general best possible results on
aforementioned three problems. In particular, our results on extension problems
recover and generalize the work due to Mockenhaupt and Tao who completed the
particular conical extension problems in three dimension. Investigating the
Fourier decay on homogeneous varieties, we give the complete mapping properties
of averaging operators over homogeneous varieties in three dimension. In
addition, studying the generalized Erd\H os-Falconer distance problems related
to homogeneous varieties in three dimensions, we improve the cardinality
condition on sets where the size of distance sets is nontrivial. Finally, we
address a question of our problems for homogeneous varieties in higher odd
dimensions.
