We discuss whether the (MSSM) unification of gauge couplings can be
accommodated in string theories with a low (TeV) string scale. This requires
either power law running of the couplings or logarithmic running extremely far
above the string scale. In both cases it is difficult to arrange for the
multiplet structure to give the MSSM result. For the case of power law running
there is also enhanced sensitivity to the spectrum at the unification scale.
For the case of logarithmic running there is a fine tuning problem associated
with the light closed string Kaluza Klein spectrum which requires gauge
mediated supersymmetry breaking on the ``visible'' brane with a dangerously low
scale of supersymmetry breaking. Evading these problems in low string scale
models requires a departure from the MSSM structure, which would imply that the
success of gauge unification in the MSSM is just an accident.
