Mathematical treatment of massive wall systems is a useful tool for
investigation of these solar applications. The objectives of this work are to
develop (and validate) a numerical solution model for predication the thermal
behaviour of passive solar systems with massive wall, to improve knowledge of
using indirect passive solar systems and assess its energy efficiency according
to climatic conditions in Bulgaria. The problem of passive solar systems with
massive walls is modelled by thermal and mass transfer equations. As a boundary
conditions for the mathematical problem are used equations, which describe
influence of weather data and constructive parameters of building on the
thermal performance of the passive system. The mathematical model is solved by
means of finite differences method and improved solution procedure. In article
are presented results of theoretical and experimental study for developing and
validating a numerical solution model for predication the thermal behaviour of
passive solar systems with massive wall.
