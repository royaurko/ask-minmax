Cut vertices, a generalization of matrix elements of local operators, are
revisited, and an expansion in terms of minimally subtracted cut vertices is
formulated. An extension of the formalism to deal with semi-inclusive deep
inelastic processes in the target fragmentation region is explicitly
constructed. The problem of factorization is discussed in detail.
