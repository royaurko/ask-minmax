Some principal problems of general relativity theory and attempts of their
solution are discussed. The Poincare gauge theory of gravity as natural
generalization of Einsteinian gravitation theory is considered. The changes of
gravitational interaction in the frame of this theory leading to the solution
of principal problems of general relativity theory are analyzed.
