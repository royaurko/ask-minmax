Let $\mathbb{Z}_n$ denote the ring of integers modulo $n$. In this paper we
consider two extremal problems on permutations of $\mathbb{Z}_n$, namely, the
maximum size of a collection of permutations such that the sum of any two
distinct permutations in the collection is again a permutation, and the maximum
size of a collection of permutations such that the sum of any two distinct
permutations in the collection is not a permutation. Let the sizes be denoted
by $s(n)$ and $t(n)$ respectively. The case when $n$ is even is trivial in both
the cases, with $s(n)=1$ and $t(n)=n!$. For $n$ odd, we prove $s(n)\geq
(n\phi(n))/2^k$ where $k$ is the number of distinct prime divisors of $n$. When
$n$ is an odd prime we prove $s(n)\leq \frac{e^2}{\pi} n
((n-1)/e)^\frac{n-1}{2}$. For the second problem, we prove
$2^{(n-1)/2}.(\frac{n-1}{2})!\leq t(n)\leq 2^k.(n-1)!/\phi(n)$ when $n$ is odd.
