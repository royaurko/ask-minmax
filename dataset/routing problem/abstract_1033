In this contribution to the special issue of the Journal of Statistical
Physics dedicated to Michael Fisher on his 70'th birthday, I shall review two
thermodynamically distinct routes for obtaining the interfacial tension of
liquid-vapor interfaces in mixtures. A specific application to the calculation
of the excess surface tension of aqueous electrolyte solutions will be
presented.
