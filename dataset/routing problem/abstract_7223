We consider the state-minimisation problem for weighted and probabilistic
automata. We provide a numerically stable polynomial-time minimisation
algorithm for weighted automata, with guaranteed bounds on the numerical error
when run with floating-point arithmetic. Our algorithm can also be used for
"lossy" minimisation with bounded error. We show an application in image
compression. In the second part of the paper we study the complexity of the
minimisation problem for probabilistic automata. We prove that the problem is
NP-hard and in PSPACE, improving a recent EXPTIME-result.
