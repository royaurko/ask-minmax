We calculate predictions from wide class of `active' models of cosmic
structure formation which allows us to scan the space of possible defect
models. We calculate the linear cold dark matter power spectrum and Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies over all observable scales using a full
linear Einstein-Boltzmann code. Our main result, which has already been
reported, points to a serious problem reconciling the observed amplitude of the
large-scale galaxy distribution with the COBE normalization. Here, we describe
our methods and results in detail. The problem is present for a wide range of
defect parameters, which can be used to represent potential differences among
defect models, as well as possible systematic numerical errors. We explicitly
examine the impact of varying the defect model parameters and we show how the
results substantiate these conclusions. The standard scaling defect models are
in serious conflict with the current data, and we show how attempts to resolve
the problem by considering non-scaling defects or modified stress-energy
components would require radical departures from what has become the standard
picture.
