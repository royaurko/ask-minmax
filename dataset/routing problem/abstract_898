The Biham, Middleton and Levine (BML) model is extended to describe dynamic
route choices between the residence and workplace in cities. The traffic
dynamic in the city with a single workplace is studied from the velocity
diagram, arrival time probability distribution, destination arrival rate and
convergence time. The city with double workplaces is also investigated to
compared with a single workplace within the framework of four modes of urban
growth. The transitional region is found in the velocity diagrams where the
system undergoes a continuous transition from a moving phase to a completely
jamming phase. We perform a finite-size scaling analysis of the critical
density from a statistical point of view and the order parameter of this
jamming transition is estimated. It is also found that statistical properties
of urban traffic are greatly influenced by the urban area, workplace area and
urban layout.
