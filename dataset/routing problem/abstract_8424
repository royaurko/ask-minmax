Given multivariate time series, we study the problem of forming portfolios
with maximum mean reversion while constraining the number of assets in these
portfolios. We show that it can be formulated as a sparse canonical correlation
analysis and study various algorithms to solve the corresponding sparse
generalized eigenvalue problems. After discussing penalized parameter
estimation procedures, we study the sparsity versus predictability tradeoff and
the impact of predictability in various markets.
