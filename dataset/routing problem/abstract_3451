Inverse problems of recovering the coefficients of Sturm-Liouville problems
with the eigenvalue parameter linearly contained in one of the boundary
conditions are studied: (1) from the sequences of eigenvalues and norming
constants; (2) from two spectra. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the
solvability of these inverse problems are obtained.
