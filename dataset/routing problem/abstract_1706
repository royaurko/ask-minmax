The induction of dc electronic transport in rigid and flexible
trans-polyacetylene oligomers according to the $\omega$ vs. $2\omega$ coherent
control scenario is investigated using a quantum-classical mean field
approximation. The approach involves running a large ensemble of mixed
quantum-classical trajectories under the influence of $\omega+2\omega$ laser
fields, and choosing the initial conditions by sampling the ground-state Wigner
distribution function for the nuclei. The vibronic couplings are shown to
change the mean single-particle spectrum, introduce ultrafast decoherence, and
enhance intramolecular vibrational and electronic relaxation. Nevertheless,
even in the presence of significant couplings, limited coherent control of the
electronic dynamics is still viable, the most promising route involving the use
of fs pulses with a duration that is comparable to the electronic dephasing
time. The simulations offer a realistic description of the behavior of a simple
coherent control scenario in a complex system, and provide a detailed account
of the femtosecond photoinduced vibronic dynamics of a conjugated polymer.
