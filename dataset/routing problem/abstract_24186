This paper considers gossiping among mobile agents in graphs: agents move on
the graph and have to disseminate their initial information to every other
agent. We focus on self-stabilizing solutions for the gossip problem, where
agents may start from arbitrary locations in arbitrary states.
Self-stabilization requires (some of the) participating agents to keep moving
forever, hinting at maximizing the number of agents that could be allowed to
stop moving eventually. This paper formalizes the self-stabilizing agent gossip
problem, introduces the quiescence number (i.e., the maximum number of
eventually stopping agents) of self-stabilizing solutions and investigates the
quiescence number with respect to several assumptions related to agent
anonymity, synchrony, link duplex capacity, and whiteboard capacity.
