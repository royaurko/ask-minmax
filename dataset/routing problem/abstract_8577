We study general Hilbert modules over the disc algebra and exhibit necessary
spectral conditions for the vanishing of certain associated extension groups.
In particular, this sheds some light on the problem of identifying the
projective Hilbert modules. Part of our work also addresses the classical
derivation problem.
