As a fundamental problem in many different fields, link prediction aims to
estimate the likelihood of an existing link between two nodes based on the
observed information. Since this problem is related to many applications
ranging from uncovering missing data to predicting the evolution of networks,
link prediction has been intensively investigated recently and many methods
have been proposed so far. The essential challenge of link prediction is to
estimate the similarity between nodes. Most of the existing methods are based
on the common neighbor index and its variants. In this paper, we propose to
calculate the similarity between nodes by the correlation coefficient. This
method is found to be very effective when applied to calculate similarity based
on high order paths. We finally fuse the correlation-based method with the
resource allocation method, and find that the combined method can substantially
outperform the existing methods, especially in sparse networks.
