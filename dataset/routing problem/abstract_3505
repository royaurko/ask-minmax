In this paper we discuss fractional generalizations of the filtering problem.
The "fractional" nature comes from time-changed state or observation processes,
basic ingredients of the filtering problem. The mathematical feature of the
fractional filtering problem emerges as the Riemann-Liouville fractional
derivative in the associated Zakai equation. We discuss fractional
generalizations of the filtering problem whose state and observation processes
are driven by time-changed Brownian motion or/and L\'evy process.
