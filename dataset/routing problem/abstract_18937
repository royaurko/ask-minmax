This article is an updated version of the article that was published in the
Electronic Journal of Differential Equations on 10. July 2010. Two footnotes
have been added. One corrects a minor error not influencing the proof, the
second is only a clarifying text to the existing proof. A discussion how the
published article solves the Clay Millennium Prize problem on the Navier-Stokes
equations is added, the critizism against the published article is answered and
a discussion how the Clay problem statement should be corrected is included.
The article gives explicit solutions to the space-periodic Navier-Stokes
problem with non-periodic pressure. These type of solutions are not unique and
by using such solutions one can construct a periodic, smooth, divergence-free
initial vector field allowing a space-periodic and time-bounded external force
such that there exists a smooth solution to the 3-dimensional Navier-Stokes
equations for incompressible fluid with those initial conditions, but the
solution cannot be continued to the whole space.
