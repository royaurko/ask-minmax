Biaxially textured MgO templates have been successfully fabricated on several
amorphous polymer films including Kapton tapes, polyimide, Poly(methyl
methacrylate) (PMMA), and photoresist films using ion-beam-assisted-deposition
(IBAD). With a Y2O3 buffer layer on polymer surfaces, roughening of the polymer
surfaces due to preferential ion beam sputtering can be effectively reduced to
meet the surface compatibility requirement for IBAD-MgO texturing. In-plane
full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of ~10.7 degrees and out-of-plane FWHM ~ 3.5
degrees have been obtained on homoepitaxial MgO films grown on top of the
IBAD-MgO template. This method provides a practical route for fabricating
epitaxial devices on polymers needed for flexible optoelectronics.
