This is a survey article on the theory of lattice points in large planar
domains and bodies of dimensions 3 and higher, with an emphasis on recent
developments and new methods, including a lot of results established only
during the last few years. It deals with the classic circle and sphere
problems, as well as with the present state-of-the-art concerning lattice
points in more general regions and bodies. Furthermore, a thorough account is
given on divisor problems and related arithmetic functions.
