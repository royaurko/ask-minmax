The ``first passage-time'' (FPT) problem is an important problem with a wide
range of applications in mathematics, physics, biology and finance.
Mathematically, such a problem can be reduced to estimating the probability of
a (stochastic) process first to reach a critical level or threshold. While in
other areas of applications the FPT problem can often be solved analytically,
in finance we usually have to resort to the application of numerical
procedures, in particular when we deal with jump-diffusion stochastic processes
(JDP). In this paper, we develop a Monte-Carlo-based methodology for the
solution of the FPT problem in the context of a multivariate jump-diffusion
stochastic process. The developed methodology is tested by using different
parameters, the simulation results indicate that the developed methodology is
much more efficient than the conventional Monte Carlo method. It is an
efficient tool for further practical applications, such as the analysis of
default correlation and predicting barrier options in finance.
