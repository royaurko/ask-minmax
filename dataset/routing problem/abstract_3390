We solve a spectral and an inverse spectral problem arising in the
computation of peakon solutions to the two-component PDE derived by Geng and
Xue as a generalization of the Novikov and Degasperis-Procesi equations. Like
the spectral problems for those equations, this one is of a 'discrete cubic
string' type -- a nonselfadjoint generalization of a classical inhomogeneous
string -- but presents some interesting novel features: there are two Lax
pairs, both of which contribute to the correct complete spectral data, and the
solution to the inverse problem can be expressed using quantities related to
Cauchy biorthogonal polynomials with two different spectral measures. The
latter extends the range of previous applications of Cauchy biorthogonal
polynomials to peakons, which featured either two identical, or two closely
related, measures. The method used to solve the spectral problem hinges on the
hidden presence of oscillatory kernels of Gantmacher-Krein type implying that
the spectrum of the boundary value problem is positive and simple. The inverse
spectral problem is solved by a method which generalizes, to a nonselfadjoint
case, M. G. Krein's solution of the inverse problem for the Stieltjes string.
