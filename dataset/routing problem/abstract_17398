Second-price auctions with reserve play a critical role for modern search
engine and popular online sites since the revenue of these companies often
directly de- pends on the outcome of such auctions. The choice of the reserve
price is the main mechanism through which the auction revenue can be influenced
in these electronic markets. We cast the problem of selecting the reserve price
to optimize revenue as a learning problem and present a full theoretical
analysis dealing with the complex properties of the corresponding loss
function. We further give novel algorithms for solving this problem and report
the results of several experiments in both synthetic and real data
demonstrating their effectiveness.
