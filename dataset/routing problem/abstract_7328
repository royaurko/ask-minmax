We study the problem of nonparametric estimation of the fractional derivative
of unknown distribution function and of spectral function and show that these
problems are well posed when the order of derivative is less than 0.5.
  We prove also the unbiaseness and asymptotical normality of offered estimates
with optimal speed of convergence. For the construction of the confidence
region in some functional norm we establish the Central Limit Theorem in
correspondent Lebesgue-Riesz space for offered estimates, and deduce also the
non-asymptotical deviation of our estimates in these spaces.
