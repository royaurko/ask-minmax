In this paper we introduce the concept of transmission lines with inherent
bi-anisotropy and establish an analogy between these lines and volumetric
bi-anisotropic materials. In particular, we find under what conditions a
periodically loaded transmission line can be treated as an effective omega
medium. Two example circuits are introduced and analyzed. The results have
two-fold implications: opening a route to emulate electromagnetic properties of
bi-anisotropic omega media using transmission-line meshes and understanding and
improving effective medium models of composite materials with the use of
effective circuit models of unit cells.
