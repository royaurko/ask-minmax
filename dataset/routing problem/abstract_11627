After a long break, we are back with some very interesting research
announcements and an open problem which is one of the most difficult, long
lasting, and important problems in the field.
  A major change in this bulletin is that from now on it will usually not
appear monthly, but more close to quarterly. Special announcements (if urgent)
will be made by text emails. Contributions to the next issue are, as always,
welcome.
