In a recent work, H.Narita presented problems concerning the strict
positivity of central values of certain automorphic $L$-functions in the form
of questions regarding special values of the hypergeometric series. In this
paper, we present partial answers to these questions using the theory of
orthogonal polynomials and three term relations of the hypergeometric series.
