Recent advances on the quest to determine the primordial or pregalactic
helium abundance, Yp, are reviewed. There are seven problems affecting the He/H
abundance determinations of H II regions that are briefly discussed: the
underlying absorption lines in the observed spectra, the ionization,
temperature, and density structures of each object, the collisional
contribution to the intensity of the He I and H I lines, the optical thickness
of the He I lines, and the extrapolation to derive Yp based on the Y and O/H
values.
