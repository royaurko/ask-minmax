We consider the Dirichlet problem for the nonlinear $p(x)$-Laplacian
equation. For axially symmetric domains we prove that, under suitable
assumptions, there exist Mountain-pass solutions which exhibit partial
symmetry. Furthermore, we show that Semi-stable or non-degenerate smooth
solutions need to be radially symmetric in the ball.
