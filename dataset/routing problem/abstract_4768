We show that the pointlike and the idempotent pointlike problems are
reducible with respect to natural signatures in the following cases: the
pseudovariety of all finite semigroups in which the order of every subgroup is
a product of elements of a fixed set of primes; the pseudovariety of all finite
semigroups in which every regular J-class is the product of a rectangular band
by a group from a fixed pseudovariety of groups that is reducible for the
pointlike problem, respectively graph reducible. Allowing only trivial groups,
we obtain omega-reducibility of the pointlike and idempotent pointlike
problems, respectively for the pseudovarieties of all finite aperiodic
semigroups (A) and of all finite semigroups in which all regular elements are
idempotents (DA).
