We use the frustrated XY model approximation of BEC in a rotating optical
lattice and formulate the problem of the ground state in terms of eigenvectors
and eigenvalues of frustrated adjacency matrix (coupling matrix). By using this
formulation, we show that there is a lower bound for ground state energy in
terms of maximum eigenvalue of this matrix.
