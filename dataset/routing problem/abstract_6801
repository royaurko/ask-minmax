We establish a Lipschitz stability estimate for the inverse problem
consisting in the determination of the coefficient $\sigma(t)$, appearing in a
Dirichlet initial-boundary value problem for the parabolic equation
$\partial_tu-\Delta_x u+\sigma(t)f(x)u=0$, from Neumann boundary data. We
extend this result to the same inverse problem when the previous linear
parabolic equation in changed to the semi-linear parabolic equation
$\partial_tu-\Delta_x u=F(t,x,\sigma(t),u(x,t))$.
