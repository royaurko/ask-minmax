The correspondence between right triangles with rational sides, triplets of
rational squares in arithmetic succession and integral solutions of certain
quadratic forms is well known. We show how this correspondence can be extended
to the generalized notions of rational $\theta$-triangles, rational squares
occurring in arithmetic progressions and concordant forms. In our approach we
establish one-to-one mappings to rational points on certain elliptic curves and
examine in detail the role of solutions of the $\theta$-congruent number
problem and the concordant form problem associated with nontrivial torsion
points on the corresponding elliptic curves. This approach allows us to combine
and extend some disjoint results obtained by a number of contributors, to clarify
some statements in the literature and to answer some hitherto open questions.
