We present a new formulation to deal with the consistency problem of a
massive spin-2 field in a curved spacetime. Using Fierz variables to represent
the spin-2 field, we show how to avoid the arbitrariness and inconsistency that
exists in the standard formulation of spin-2 field coupled to gravity. The
superiority of the Fierz frame appears explicitly in the combined set of
equations for spin-2 field and gravity: it preserves the standard Einstein
equations of motion.
