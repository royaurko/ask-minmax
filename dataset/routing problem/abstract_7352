We consider the Cauchy problem for the two-dimensional Novikov-Veselov
equation integrable via the inverse scattering problem for the Schr\"odinger
operator with fixed negative energy. The associated linear equation is
characterized by a rational symbol which is not a polynomial, except when the
energy parameter is zero. With the help of a complex analysis point of view of
the problem, we establish uniform decay estimates for the linear solution with
gain of almost one derivative, and we use this result together with Fourier
decomposition methods and $X^{s,b}$ spaces to prove local well-posedness in
$H^s$, $s>\frac12$.
