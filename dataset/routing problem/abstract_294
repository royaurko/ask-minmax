Please Note: This document was written to summarize and facilitate discussion
regarding (1) the benefits of changing the way BGP selects routes to selecting
the most preferred route allowed by export policies, or more generally, to
selecting BGP routes on a per-neighbor basis, (2) the safety condition that
guarantees global routing stability under the Neighbor-Specific BGP model, and
(3) ways of deploying this model in practice. A paper presenting the formal
model and proof of the stability conditions was published at SIGMETRICS 2009
and is available online.
