An inverse problem of identifying locations and certain properties of small
dielectric inhomogeneities in a homogeneous background medium from boundary
measurements on a part of the boundary is studied. Using as weights particular
background solutions constructed by solving a minimization problem, an
asymptotic (variational) method based on appropriate averaging of the partial
boundary measurements is developed.
