We generalize the classical knapsack and subset sum problems to arbitrary
groups and study the computational complexity of these new problems. We show
that these problems, as well as the bounded submonoid membership problem, are
P-time decidable in hyperbolic groups and give various examples of finitely
presented groups where the subset sum problem is NP-complete.
