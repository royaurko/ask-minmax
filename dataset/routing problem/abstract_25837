An ordinal view of independence is studied in the framework of possibility
theory. We investigate three possible definitions of dependence, of increasing
strength. One of them is the counterpart to the multiplication law in
probability theory, and the two others are based on the notion of conditional
possibility. These two have enough expressive power to support the whole
possibility theory, and a complete axiomatization is provided for the strongest
one. Moreover we show that weak independence is well-suited to the problems of
belief change and plausible reasoning, especially to address the problem of
blocking of property inheritance in exception-tolerant taxonomic reasoning.
