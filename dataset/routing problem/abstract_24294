Although prone to fabrication error, the nanowire crossbar is a promising
candidate component for next generation nanometer-scale circuits. In the
nanowire crossbar architecture, nanowires are addressed by controlling voltages
on the mesowires. For area efficiency, we are interested in the maximum number
of nanowires $N(m,e)$ that can be addressed by $m$ mesowires, in the face of up
to $e$ fabrication errors. Asymptotically tight bounds on $N(m,e)$ are
established in this paper. In particular, it is shown that $N(m,e) = \Theta(2^m
/ m^{e+1/2})$. Interesting observations are made on the equivalence between
this problem and the problem of constructing optimal EC/AUED codes,
superimposed distance codes, pooling designs, and diffbounded set systems.
Results in this paper also improve upon those in the EC/AUEC codes literature.
