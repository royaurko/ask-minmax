The paper presents TrustMAS - Trusted Communication Platform for Multi-Agent
Systems, which provides trust and anonymity for mobile agents. The platform
includes anonymous technique based on random-walk algorithm for providing
general purpose anonymous communication for agents. All agents, which take part
in the proposed platform, benefit from trust and anonymity that is provided for
their interactions. Moreover, in TrustMAS there are StegAgents (SA) that are
able to perform various steganographic communication. To achieve that goal, SAs
may use methods in different layers of TCP/IP model or specialized middleware
enabling steganography that allows hidden communication through all layers of
mentioned model. In TrustMAS steganographic channels are used to exchange
routing tables between StegAgents. Thus all StegAgents in TrustMAS with their
ability to exchange information by using hidden channels form distributed
steganographic router (Stegrouter).
