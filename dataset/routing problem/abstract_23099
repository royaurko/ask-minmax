A family of spacetimes suitable for describing the interior of a
non-rotational black hole is constructed. The stress-energy tensor is that of a
spherically symmetric vacuum, as commonly assumed nowadays. The problem of
matching the exterior with the interior region is solved exactly, without using
any massive shell nor having to restrict oneself to only asymptotically
well-behaved solutions, whatsoever. The main physical and geometrical
properties of the resulting black hole solutions are described. As models for
the interior the general solution found includes, in particular, two known
previous atttempts at solving the problem. Finally, effective macroscopic
properties of the solution are linked with quantization issues of the
corresponding spacetime.
