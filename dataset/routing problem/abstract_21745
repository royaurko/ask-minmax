We construct efficient robust truncated sequential estimators for the
pointwise estimation problem in nonparametric autoregression models with smooth
coefficients. For Gaussian models we propose an adaptive procedure based on the
constructed sequential estimators. The minimax nonadaptive and adaptive
convergence rates are established. It turns out that in this case these rates
are the same as for regression models.
