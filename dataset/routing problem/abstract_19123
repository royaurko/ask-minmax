The density functional theory (DFT) in electronic structure calculations can
be formulated as either a nonlinear eigenvalue or direct minimization problem.
The most widely used approach for solving the former is the so-called
self-consistent field (SCF) iteration. A common observation is that the
convergence of SCF is not clear theoretically while approaches with convergence
guarantee for solving the latter are often not competitive to SCF numerically.
In this paper, we study gradient type methods for solving the direct
minimization problem by constructing new iterations along the gradient on the
Stiefel manifold. Global convergence (i.e., convergence to a stationary point
from any initial solution) as well as local convergence rate follows from the
standard theory for optimization on manifold directly. A major computational
advantage is that the computation of linear eigenvalue problems is no longer
needed. The main costs of our approaches arise from the assembling of the total
energy functional and its gradient and the projection onto the manifold. These
tasks are cheaper than eigenvalue computation and they are often more suitable
for parallelization as long as the evaluation of the total energy functional
and its gradient is efficient. Numerical results show that they can outperform
SCF consistently on many practically large systems.
