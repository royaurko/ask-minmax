By the method of discrete transformation equations of 3-th wave hierarchy are
constructed. We present in explicit form two Poisson structures, which allow to
construct Hamiltonian operator consequent application of which leads to all
equations of this hierarchy. For calculations it will be necessary results of
previous paper \cite{1}, which for convenience of the reader we present in
corresponding place of the text. The obtained formulae are checked by
independent calculations.
