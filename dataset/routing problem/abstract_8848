We consider the nonstationary linearized Navier-Stokes equations in a bounded
domain and first we prove a Carleman estimate with a regular weight function.
Second we apply the Carleman estimate to a lateral Cauchy problem for the
Navier-Stokes equations and prove the H\"older stability in determining the
velocity and pressure field in an interior domain.
