Orthogonal Polynomials in Quantum Mechanics. Exact solutions of the
Schrodinger equation with the hyperbolic Scarf potential (Scarf II) in terms of
Romanovski polynomials. Among the applications included is the solution of the
problem of an electron within a particular potential leading to the definition
of new non-spherical angular functions.
