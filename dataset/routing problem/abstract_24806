We consider the convex feasibility problem (CFP) in Hilbert space and
concentrate on the study of string-averaging projection (SAP) methods for the
CFP, analyzing their convergence and their perturbation resilience. In the
past, SAP methods were formulated with a single predetermined set of strings
and a single predetermined set of weights. Here we extend the scope of the
family of SAP methods to allow iteration-index-dependent variable strings and
weights and term such methods dynamic string-averaging projection (DSAP)
methods. The bounded perturbation resilience of DSAP methods is relevant and
important for their possible use in the framework of the recently developed
superiorization heuristic methodology for constrained minimization problems.
