Many-one reductions between search problems (i.e. multi-valued functions)
play a crucial part in both algorithmic game theory (via classes such as PLS or
PPAD) and the study of incomputability in analysis. While the formal setting
differs significantly, the present papers offers a unifying approach in terms
of category theory that allows to deduce that any degree structure arising from
such reducibilities is a distributive lattice. Moreover, it is a
Kleene-algebra, which allows to consider wtt-degrees, too. We discuss some
specific examples and study degree-theoretic properties that do depend on the
specific reducibility.
