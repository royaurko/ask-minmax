We demonstrate full integration of vertical optical ring resonators with
silicon nanophotonic waveguides on silicon-on-insulator substrates to
accomplish a significant step towards 3D photonic integration. The on-chip
integration is realized by rolling up 2D differentially strained TiO2
nanomembranes into 3D microtube cavities on a nanophotonic microchip. The
integration configuration allows for out of plane optical coupling between the
in-plane nanowaveguides and the vertical microtube cavities as a compact and
mechanically stable optical unit, which could enable refined vertical light
transfer in 3D stacks of multiple photonic layers. In this vertical
transmission scheme, resonant filtering of optical signals at telecommunication
wavelengths is demonstrated based on subwavelength thick walled microcavities.
Moreover, an array of microtube cavities is prepared and each microtube cavity
is integrated with multiple waveguides which opens up interesting perspectives
towards parallel and multi-routing through a single cavity device as well as
high-throughput optofluidic sensing schemes.
