The observed rotation curves of dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxies indicate
low density cores, contrary to the predictions of CDM models. A possible
solution of this problem involves stellar feedback. A strong baryonic wind
driven by vigorous star formation can remove a large fraction of the gas,
causing the dark matter to expand. We explore the maximum effect of the
feedback with an instantaneous removal of the gaseous disk. The energy input
depends on the compactness of the disk, hence the specific angular momentum of
the disk. For the plausible cosmological parameters and a large range of the
disk angular momentum, the feedback is insufficient to destroy the central halo
cusp, while the inner density is lowered only by a modest factor of 2 to 6. Any
realistic modeling of the feedback would have even lesser impact on dark
matter. We find that no star formation effect can resolve the problems of CDM
cusps.
