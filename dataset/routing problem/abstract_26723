We present ReAct!, an interactive tool for high-level reasoning for cognitive
robotic applications. ReAct! enables robotic researchers to describe robots'
actions and change in dynamic domains, without having to know about the
syntactic and semantic details of the underlying formalism in advance, and
solve planning problems using state-of-the-art automated reasoners, without
having to learn about their input/output language or usage. In particular,
ReAct! can be used to represent sophisticated dynamic domains that feature
concurrency, indirect effects of actions, and state/transition constraints. It
allows for embedding externally defined calculations (e.g., checking for
collision-free continuous trajectories) into representations of hybrid domains
that require a tight integration of (discrete) high-level reasoning with
(continuous) geometric reasoning. ReAct! also enables users to solve planning
problems that involve complex goals. Such variety of utilities are useful for
robotic researchers to work on interesting and challenging domains, ranging
from service robotics to cognitive factories. ReAct! provides sample
formalizations of some action domains (e.g., multi-agent path planning, Tower
of Hanoi), as well as dynamic simulations of plans computed by a
state-of-the-art automated reasoner (e.g., a SAT solver or an ASP solver).
