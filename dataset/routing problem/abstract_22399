We propose a novel proof technique that can be applied to attack a broad
class of problems in computational complexity, when switching the order of
universal and existential quantifiers is helpful. Our approach combines the
standard min-max theorem and convex approximation techniques, offering
quantitative improvements over the standard way of using min-max theorems as
well as more concise and elegant proofs.
