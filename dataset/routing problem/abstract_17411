In this paper we provide a detailed analysis of the analytic continuation of
the spectral zeta function associated with one-dimensional regular
Sturm-Liouville problems endowed with self-adjoint separated and coupled
boundary conditions. The spectral zeta function is represented in terms of a
complex integral and the analytic continuation in the entire complex plane is
achieved by using the Liouville-Green (or WKB) asymptotic expansion of the
eigenfunctions associated with the problem. The analytically continued
expression of the spectral zeta function is then used to compute the functional
determinant of the Sturm-Liouville operator and the coefficients of the
asymptotic expansion of the associated heat kernel.
