The problem of unification of electro-magnetism and gravitation in four
dimensions; some new ideas involving torsion. A metric consisting of a
combination of symmetric and anti-symmetric parts is postulated and, in the
framework of general covariance, used to derive the free-field electro-magnetic
stress-energy tensor and the source tensor.
