Alder and Wainwright discovered the slow power decay $\sim t^{-d/2}$
($d$:dimension) of the velocity autocorrelation function in moderately dense
hard sphere fluids using the event-driven molecular dynamics simulations. In
the two-dimensional case, the diffusion coefficient derived using the time
correlation expression in linear response theory shows logarithmic divergence,
which is called the ``2D long-time-tail problem''. We revisited this problem to
perform a large-scale, long-time simulation with one million hard disks using a
modern efficient algorithm and found that the decay of the long tail in
moderately dense fluids is slightly faster than the power decay ($\sim 1/t$).
We also compared our numerical data with the prediction of the self-consistent
mode-coupling theory in the long time limit ($\sim 1/(t\sqrt{\ln{t}})$).
