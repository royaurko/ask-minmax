We present a concise review of models for neutrino masses and mixings with
particular emphasis on recent developments and current problems. We discuss in
detail attempts at reproducing approximate tri-bimaximal mixing starting from
discrete symmetry groups, notably A4. We discuss the problems encountered when
trying to extend the symmetry to the quark sector and to construct Grand
Unified versions.
