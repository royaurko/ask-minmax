We give a short proof of the (known) result that there are no Kaehler
structures on exotic tori. This yields a negative solution to a problem posed
by Benson and Gordon. W discuss the symplectic version of the problem and
analyze results which yield an evidence for the conjecture that there are no
symplectic structures on exotic tori.
