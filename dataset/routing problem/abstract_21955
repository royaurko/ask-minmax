We obtain a sharp lower bound on the isoperimetric deficit of a general
polygon in terms of the variance of its side lengths, the variance of its
radii, and its deviation from being convex. Our technique involves a functional
minimization problem on a suitably constructed compact manifold and is based on
the spectral theory for circulant matrices.
