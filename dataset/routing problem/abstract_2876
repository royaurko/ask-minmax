A Geometric programming (GP) is a type of mathematical problem characterized
by objective and constraint functions that have a special form. Many methods
have been developed to solve large scale engineering design GP problems. In
this paper GP technique has been used to solve multi-objective GP problem as a
vector optimization problem. The duality theory for lexicographic geometric
programming has been developed to solve the problems with posynomial in
objectives and constraints.
