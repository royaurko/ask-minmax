For any smooth projective variety with a C* action, we reduce the problem of
computing its Gromov-Witten invariants to the similar problem for its fixed
locus. Starting from the stacky version of variation of GIT for our variety, we
construct the building blocks for the fixed loci of the moduli space of stable
maps. We use this construction to compute their contribution to the virtual
fundamental class.
