We discuss the decoupling solution to SUSY flavor problem in the fat brane
scenario. We present a simple model to yield the decoupling sfermion spectrum
in a five dimensional theory. Sfermion masses are generated by the overlap
between the wave functions of the matter fields and the chiral superfields on
the SUSY breaking brane. Two explicit examples of the spectrum are given.
