The recognition of the agency of the knower has enormously enriched our
understanding of knowledge production. There is a growing realization that what
we know about how we know affects our interpretation of reality. This
realization informs the perspective of this paper. As a case study, the paper
looks at the problem of randomness vs. determinism. It argues that this problem
is not intrinsic to nature but is rather a product of the epistemological
approach that does not pay attention to the process of the construction of
knowledge. In contrast to the current one-sided solutions of the problem that
represent reality as either random or deterministic, this paper argues that
reality is neither random nor deterministic. Neither randomness nor determinism
exists on its own. Rather, randomness and determinism are ways in which reality
appears to us as a result of a one-sided view of the relationship between
systems and subsystems in the process of construction.
