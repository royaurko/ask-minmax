Under suitable assumptions of regularity and non-degeneracy on the covariance
of the driving additive noise, any Markov solution to the stochastic
Navier-Stokes equations has an associated generator of the diffusion and is the
unique solution to the corresponding martingale problem. Some elementary
examples are discussed to interpret these results.
