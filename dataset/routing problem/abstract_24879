This paper is the continuation of [H. Kn\"upfer and C. B. Muratov, Commun.
Pure Appl. Math. (2012, to be published)]. We investigate the classical
isoperimetric problem modified by an addition of a non-local repulsive term
generated by a kernel given by an inverse power of the distance. In this work,
we treat the case of general space dimension. We obtain basic existence results
for minimizers with sufficiently small masses. For certain ranges of the
exponent in the kernel we also obtain non-existence results for sufficiently
large masses, as well as a characterization of minimizers as balls for
sufficiently small masses and low spatial dimensionality. The physically
important special case of three space dimensions and Coulombic repulsion is
included in all the results mentioned above. In particular, our work yields a
negative answer to the question if stable atomic nuclei at arbitrarily high
atomic numbers can exist in the framework of the classical liquid drop model of
nuclear matter. In all cases the minimal energy scales linearly with mass for
large masses, even if the infimum of energy may not be attained.
