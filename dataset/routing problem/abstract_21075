This short note presents a peculiar generalization of the Riemann hypothesis,
as the action of the permutation group on the elements of continued fractions.
The problem is difficult to attack through traditional analytic techniques, and
thus this note focuses on providing a numerical survey. These results indicate
a broad class of previously unexamined functions may obey the Riemann
hypothesis in general, and even share the non-trivial zeros in particular.
