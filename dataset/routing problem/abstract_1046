We propose a new route to achieve the superconducting state in Boron-rich
solids, the hole doping of B$_{12}$ icosahedra. For this purpose we consider a
prototype metallic phase of B$_{13}$C$_2$. We show that in this compound the
Boron icosahedral units are mainly responsible for the large phonon frequencies
logarithmic average, 65.8 meV, and the moderate electron-phonon coupling 0.8.
We suggest that this high critical temperature could be a general feature of
hole doped boron icosahedral solids.
