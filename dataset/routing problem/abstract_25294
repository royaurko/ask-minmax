We examine a bidirectional propositional dynamic logic (PDL) for finite and
infinite message sequence charts (MSCs) extending LTL and TLC-. By this kind of
multi-modal logic we can express properties both in the entire future and in
the past of an event. Path expressions strengthen the classical until operator
of temporal logic. For every formula defining an MSC language, we construct a
communicating finite-state machine (CFM) accepting the same language. The CFM
obtained has size exponential in the size of the formula. This synthesis
problem is solved in full generality, i.e., also for MSCs with unbounded
channels. The model checking problem for CFMs and HMSCs turns out to be in
PSPACE for existentially bounded MSCs. Finally, we show that, for PDL with
intersection, the semantics of a formula cannot be captured by a CFM anymore.
