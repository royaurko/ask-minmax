We discuss design techniques for catadioptric sensors that realize given
projections. In general, these problems do not have solutions, but approximate
solutions may often be found that are visually acceptable. There are several
methods to approach this problem, but here we focus on what we call the
``vector field approach''. An application is given where a true panoramic
mirror is derived, i.e. a mirror that yields a cylindrical projection to the
viewer without any digital unwarping.
