We discuss how under certain conditions the black hole information puzzle and
the (related) arguments that firewalls are a typical feature of black holes can
break down. We first review the arguments of AMPS favoring firewalls, focusing
on entanglements in a simple toy model for a black hole and the Hawking
radiation. By introducing a large and inaccessible system entangled with the
black hole (representing perhaps a de Sitter stretched horizon or inaccessible
part of a landscape) we show complementarity can be restored and firewalls can
be avoided throughout the black hole's evolution. Under these conditions black
holes do not have an "information problem". We point out flaws in some of our
earlier arguments that such entanglement might be generically present in some
cosmological scenarios, and call out certain ways our picture may still be
realized.
