Using ideas from continuum mechanics we construct a theory of gravity. We
show that this theory is equivalent to Einstein's theory of general relativity;
it is also a much faster way of reaching general relativity than the
conventional route. Our approach is simple and natural: we form a very general
model and then apply two physical assumptions supported by experimental
evidence. This easily reduces our construction to a model equivalent to general
relativity. Finally, we suggest a simple way of modifying our theory to
investigate non-standard space-time symmetries.
