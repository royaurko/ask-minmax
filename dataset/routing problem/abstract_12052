A general new technique to solve the two-center problem with
arbitrarily-orientated deformed realistic potentials is demonstrated, which is
based on the powerful potential separable expansion method. As an example,
molecular single-particle spectra for $^{12}$C + $^{12}$C $\to$ $^{24}$Mg are
calculated using deformed Woods-Saxon potentials. These clearly show that
non-axial symmetric configurations play a crucial role in molecular resonances
observed in reaction processes for this system at low energy.
