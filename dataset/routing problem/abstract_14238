We prove a duality theorem the computation of certain Bellman functions is
usually based on. As a byproduct, we obtain sharp results about the norms of
monotonic rearrangements. The main novelty of our approach is a special class
of martingales and an extremal problem on this class, which is dual to the
minimization problem for locally concave functions.
