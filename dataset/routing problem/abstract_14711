Boundary integral methods for the solution of boundary value PDEs are an
alternative to `interior' methods, such as finite difference and finite element
methods. They are attractive on domains with corners, particularly when the
solution has singularities at these corners. In these cases, interior methods
can become excessively expensive, as they require a finely discretised 2D mesh
in the vicinity of corners, whilst boundary integral methods typically require
a mesh discretised in only one dimension, that of arc length.
  Consider the Dirichlet problem. Traditional boundary integral methods applied
to problems with corner singularities involve a (real) boundary integral
equation with a kernel containing a logarithmic singularity. This is both
tedious to code and computationally inefficient. The CBIEM is different in that
it involves a complex boundary integral equation with a smooth kernel. The
boundary integral equation is approximated using a collocation technique, and
the interior solution is then approximated using a discretisation of Cauchy's
integral formula, combined with singularity subtraction.
  A high order quadrature rule is required for the solution of the integral
equation. Typical corner singularities are of square root type, and a
`geometrically graded h-p' composite quadrature rule is used. This yields
efficient, high order solution of the integral equation, and thence the
Dirichlet problem.
  Implementation and experimental results in \textsc{matlab} code are
presented.
