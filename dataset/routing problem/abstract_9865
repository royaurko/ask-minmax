In the deletion version of the list homomorphism problem, we are given graphs
G and H, a list L(v) that is a subset of V(H) for each vertex v of G, and an
integer k. The task is to decide whether there exists a subset W of V(G) of
size at most k such that there is a homomorphism from G \ W to H respecting the
lists. We show that DL-Hom(H), parameterized by k and |H|, is fixed-parameter
tractable for any (P6, C6)-free bipartite graph H; already for this restricted
class of graphs, the problem generalizes Vertex Cover, Odd Cycle Transversal,
and Vertex Multiway Cut parameterized by the size of the cutset and the number
of terminals. We conjecture that DL-Hom(H) is fixed-parameter tractable for the
class of graphs H for which the list homomorphism problem (without deletions)
is polynomial-time solvable; by a result of Feder, Hell and Huang (1999), a
graph H belongs to this class precisely if it is a bipartite graph whose
complement is a circular arc graph. We show that this conjecture is equivalent
to the fixed-parameter tractability of a single fairly natural satisfiability
problem, Clause Deletion Chain-SAT.
