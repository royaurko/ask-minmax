Given a conformal mapping $f$ of the unit disk $\mathbb D$ onto a simply
connected domain $D$ in the complex plane bounded by a closed Jordan curve, we
consider the problem of constructing a matching conformal mapping, i.e., the
mapping of the exterior of the unit disk $\mathbb D^*$ onto the exterior domain
$D^*$ regarding to $D$. The answer is expressed in terms of a linear
differential equation with a driving term given as the kernel of an operator
dependent on the original mapping $f$. Examples are provided. This study is
related to the problem of conformal welding and to representation of the
Virasoro algebra in the space of univalent functions.
