We prove regularity for a class of boundary value problems for first order
elliptic systems, with boundary conditions determined by spectral
decompositions, under coefficient differentiability conditions weaker than
previously known. We establish Fredholm properties for Dirac-type equations
with these boundary conditions. Our results include sharp solvability criteria,
over both compact and non-compact manifolds; weighted Poincare and
Schroedinger-Lichnerowicz inequalities provide asymptotic control in the
non-compact case. One application yields existence of solutions for the Witten
equation with a spectral boundary condition used by Herzlich in his proof of a
geometric lower bound for the ADM mass of asymptotically flat 3-manifolds.
