Electrical conductivity (sigma_dc) of the cellular Si/SiC ceramic composites
has been measured over a temperature range 25-1073 K while the thermoelectric
power (S) has been measured over 25-300 K. Remarkably, these cellular compounds
developed through biomimetic route - where the ceramic system grows within a
plant bio-template retaining the structural intricacies of the native templates
- are found to exhibit excellent mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties
quite comparable to or even better than those of the systems prepared through
conventional ceramic route. The electrical conductivity measured parallel
(sigma||) and perpendicular (sigma+) to the growth axes of the native plants,
depicts nearly temperature-independent anisotropy (sigma+/sigma||) of the order
\~2 while the thermoelectric power is nearly isotropic. The charge conduction
across the entire temperature range is found to follow closely the variable
range hopping (VRH) mechanism. The conductivity anisotropy appears to be driven
primarily by the unique microcellular morphology of the bio-templates which can
be exploited in many electrical applications.
