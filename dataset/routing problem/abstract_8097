We exhibit stable finite time blow up regimes for the energy critical
co-rotational Wave Map with the S^2 target in all homotopy classes and for the
critical equivariant SO(4) Yang-Mills problem. We derive sharp asymptotics on
the dynamics at the blow up time and prove quantization of the energy focused
at the singularity.
