We present an efficient and parsimonious algorithm to solve mixed
initial/final-value problems. The algorithm optimally limits the memory storage
and the computational time requirements: with respect to a simple forward
integration, the cost factor is only logarithmic in the number of time-steps.
As an example, we discuss the solution of the final-value problem for a
Fokker-Planck equation whose drift velocity solves a different initial-value
problem -- a relevant issue in the context of turbulent scalar transport.
