We calculate the energy-momentum tensor due to electromagnetic vacuum
fluctuations between two parallel hyperplanes in more than four dimensions,
considering both metallic and MIT boundary conditions. Using the axial gauge,
the problem can be mapped upon the corresponding problem with a massless,
scalar field satisfying respectively Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions.
The pressure between the plates is constant while the energy density is found
to diverge at the boundaries when there are extra dimensions. This can be
related to the fact that Maxwell theory is then no longer conformally
invariant. A similar behavior is known for the scalar field where a constant
energy density consistent with the pressure can be obtained by improving the
energy-momentum tensor with the Huggins term. This is not possible for the
Maxwell field. However, the change in the energy-momentum tensor with distance
between boundaries is finite in all cases.
