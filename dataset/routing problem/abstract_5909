We consider a new type of optimal stopping problems where the absorbing
boundary moves as the state process X attains new maxima S. More specifically,
we set the absorbing boundary as S-b where b is a certain constant. This
problem is naturally connected with excursions from zero of the reflected
process S-X. We examine this constrained optimization with the state variable X
as a spectrally negative Levy process. The problem is in nature a
two-dimensional one. The threshold strategy given by the path of X is not in
fact optimal. It turns out, however, that we can reduce the original problem to
an infinite number of one-dimensional optimal stopping problems, and we find
explicit solutions. This work is motivated by the bank's profit maximization
with the constraint that it maintain a certain level of leverage ratio. When
the bank's asset value severely deteriorates, the bank's required capital
requirement shall be violated. This situation corresponds to X<S-b in our
setting. This model may well describe a real-life situation where even a big
bank can fail because the absorbing boundary is keeping up with the size of the
bank.
