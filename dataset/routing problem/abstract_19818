We study the role of direct (i.e. small-scale) instantons in QCD correlation
functions for the nucleon. They generate sizeable, nonperturbative corrections
to the conventional operator product expansion, which improve the quality of
both QCD nucleon sum rules and cure the long-standing stability problem, in
particular, of the chirally odd sum-rule.
