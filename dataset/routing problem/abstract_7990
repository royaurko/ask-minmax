We propose a three-potential formalism for the three-body Coulomb scattering
problem. The corresponding integral equations are mathematically well-behaved
and can succesfully be solved by the Coulomb-Sturmian separable expansion
method. The results show perfect agreements with existing low-energy $n-d$ and
$p-d$ scattering calculations.
