In the $k$-median problem, given a set of locations, the goal is to select a
subset of at most $k$ centers so as to minimize the total cost of connecting
each location to its nearest center. We study the uniform hard capacitated
version of the $k$-median problem, in which each selected center can only serve
a limited number of locations.
  Inspired by the algorithm of Charikar, Guha, Tardos and Shmoys, we give a
$(6+10\alpha)$-approximation algorithm for this problem with increasing the
capacities by a factor of $2+\frac{2}{\alpha}, \alpha\geq 4$, which improves
the previous best $(32 l^2+28 l+7)$-approximation algorithm proposed by Byrka,
Fleszar, Rybicki and Spoerhase violating the capacities by factor
$2+\frac{3}{l-1}, l\in \{2,3,4,\dots\}$.
