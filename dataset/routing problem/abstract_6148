We study the clustering properties of particles sliding downwards on a
fluctuating surface evolving through the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, a
problem equivalent to passive scalars driven by a Burgers fluid. Monte Carlo
simulations on a discrete version of the problem in one dimension reveal that
particles cluster very strongly: the two point density correlation function
scales with the system size with a scaling function which diverges at small
argument. Analytic results are obtained for the Sinai problem of random walkers
in a quenched random landscape. This equilibrium system too has a singular
scaling function which agrees remarkably with that for advected particles.
