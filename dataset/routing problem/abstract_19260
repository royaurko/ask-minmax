In systems with hard real-time constraints, it is necessary to compute upper
bounds on the worst-case execution time (WCET) of programs; the closer the
bound to the real WCET, the better. This is especially the case of synchronous
reactive control loops with a fixed clock; the WCET of the loop body must not
exceed the clock period. We compute the WCET (or at least a close upper bound
thereof) as the solution of an optimization modulo theory problem that takes
into account the semantics of the program, in contrast to other methods that
compute the longest path whether or not it is feasible according to these
semantics. Optimization modulo theory extends satisfiability modulo theory
(SMT) to maximization problems. Immediate encodings of WCET problems into SMT
yield formulas intractable for all current production-grade solvers; this is
inherent to the DPLL(T) approach to SMT implemented in these solvers. By
conjoining some appropriate "cuts" to these formulas, we considerably reduce
the computation time of the SMT-solver. We experimented our approach on a
variety of control programs, using the OTAWA analyzer both as baseline and as
underlying microarchitectural analysis for our analysis, and show notable
improvement on the WCET bound on a variety of benchmarks and control programs.
