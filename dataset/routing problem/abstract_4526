It was recently demonstrated that time-dependent PDE problems can numerically
be solved with a fully pseudospectral scheme, i.e. using spectral expansions
with respect to both spatial and time directions (Hennig and Ansorg, 2009
[15]). This was done with the example of simple scalar wave equations in
Minkowski spacetime. Here we show that the method can be used to study
interesting physical problems that are described by systems of nonlinear PDEs.
To this end we consider two 1+1 dimensional problems: radial oscillations of
spherically symmetric Newtonian stars and time evolution of Gowdy spacetimes as
particular cosmological models in general relativity.
