We report here synthesis, structural, DC magnetization, and transport studies
of new BiS2 based layered LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor [1]. The sample was
synthesized by conventional solid state route via vacuum encapsulation
technique at 800oC for 12h. LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 crystallizes in tetragonal P4/nmm
space group with lattice parameters a = 4.0703(5){\AA}, c = 13.3902(4){\AA}.
Bulk superconductivity is confirmed with superconducting transition temperature
(Tc) of 2.7K by DC magnetization measurements. The Isothermal magnetization
(MH) measurements showed closed loops with clear signatures of flux pinning and
irreversible behavior. The resistivity measurements confirmed an onset Tc of
2.7K. The magneto-transport {\rho}(T,H) measurements showed a resistive
broadening and decrease in Tc ({\rho}=0) to lower temperatures with increasing
magnetic field. The magnetic phase diagram involving upper critical and
irreversibility fields as a function of temperature has been ascertained. Our
DC magnetization and electrical transport measurements confirm the appearance
of bulk superconductivity in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor.
