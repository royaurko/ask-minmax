An edge xy is relating in the graph G if there is an independent set S,
containing neither x nor y, such that S_{x} and S_{y} are both maximal
independent sets in G. It is an NP-complete problem to decide whether an edge
is relating (Brown, Nowakowski, Zverovich, 2007). We show that the problem
remains NP-complete even for graphs without cycles of length 4 and 5. On the
other hand, for graphs without cycles of length 4 and 6, the problem can be
solved in polynomial time.
