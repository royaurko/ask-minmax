The cosmological gamma-ray burst (GRB) phenomenon is reviewed. The broad
observational facts and empirical phenomenological relations of the GRB prompt
emission and afterglow are outlined. A well-tested, successful fireball shock
model is introduced in a pedagogical manner. Several important uncertainties in
the current understanding of the phenomenon are reviewed, and prospects of how
future experiments and extensive observational and theoretical efforts may
address these problems are discussed.
