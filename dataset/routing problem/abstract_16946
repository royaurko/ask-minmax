This research will be helpful for people to display the 2-dimensiona
projective models of 4-variable actual problems in many fields, in order to
investigate deeply those actual problems. By using the theory of N-dimensional
finite rotation group of the regular polytopes, the contributor established the
2-dimensional projective model of 4-dimensional rectangular coordinate system,
and deduced a transformation matrix, and adopt it to display successfully the
2-dimensional overall shapes of two most complicated regular polytopes 120-Cell
and 600-Cell. In the meantime, the contributor calculated all the vertex coordinates
and determine the joint relationships between adjacent vertices of the regular
polytopes 120-Cell and 600-Cell. Also, this provided a pattern for displaying
the 2-dimensional projective model of 4-variable actual problem.
  (The tables of vertex coordinates of the 120-Cell and the 600-Cell and the
table of joint relationship between adjacent vertices of the 120-Cell and the
600-Cell are listed below)
