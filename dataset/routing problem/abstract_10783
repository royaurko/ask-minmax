The paper has a technical character in which we extend Mackey theory of
induced representations so as to embrace representations of the covering of the
Poincar\'e group in Krein spaces (with Gupta-Bleuler operator) such as the
{\L}opusza\'nski representation encountered in construction of free fields with
non trivial gauge freedom, e. g. electromagnetic field. Proposed extension
allows us to pursue explicit spectral-operator construction of space-time in
the Fock space of free fields -- a crucial point in the solution of the
representation problem (viz. convergence problem of the formal perturbation
series) in the perturbative algebraic QFT (developed mainly by D\"utsch,
Fredenhagen and Brunetti) which we have proposed in our previous paper. The
proposal of our previous paper is in fact an extension of the general program
proposed by Fredenhagen, D\"utsch and Brunetti whose main point lies in
separating the algebraic aspect -- by interpreting the perturbation series as a
formal deformation from the analytic aspect tied to the representation problem.
  The representation problem cited to above is immediately connected to the
general problem in QFT of proving the existence of interacting fields with non
trivial gauge freedom.
  Presented generalization of Mackey theory is given an independent character
so as the "subgroup theorem" and "the Kronecker product theorem' are proved for
general separable locally compact groups and for their Krein-isometric not
necessary bounded representations induced by Krein-unitary (bounded)
representations.
