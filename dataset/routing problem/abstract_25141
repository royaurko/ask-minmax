We investigate the validity of an idea that the $B_{\mu}$ problem is solvable
via the renormalization effect in the strongly interacting hidden sector within
the gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking scenario. Our analysis starts with a
naive boundary condition, which is that the squared scalar masses experience
$16\pi^2$ suppression. We use \texttt{softsusy} to get the low energy spectra
of superparticles with the boundary condition at the scale ($\Lambda_{CFT}$)
where the hidden sector is integrated out. We visit the low energy spectra and
return to $\Lambda_{CFT}$ where the boundary conditions are given. We find that
there is a sign problem, which seems to be generic.
