We study existence, uniqueness and regularity of solutions for ordinary
differential equations with infinitely many derivatives such as (linearized
versions of) nonlocal field equations of motion appearing in particle physics,
nonlocal cosmology and string theory. We develop an appropriate Lorentzian
functional calculus via Laplace transform which allows us to interpret
rigorously an operator of the form $f(\partial_t)$ on the half line, in which
$f$ is an analytic function. We find the most general solution to the equation
$f(\partial_t) \phi = J(t)$ (t greater or equal to 0) in the space of
exponentially bounded functions, and we also analyze in full detail the
delicate issue of the initial value problem. In particular, we state conditions
under which the solution $\phi$ admits a finite number of derivatives, and we
prove rigorously that if an a priori data directly connected with our
Lorentzian calculus is specified, then the initial value problem is well-posed
and it requires only a finite number of initial conditions.
