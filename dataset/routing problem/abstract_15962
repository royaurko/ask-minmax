We present a review of the application of numerical methods to solve the
problem of the stellar/solar wind with the local interstellar medium. Most of
approaches described are developed by the contributors. They include both purely gas
dynamic and magnetohydrodynamic methods. Some attention is given to the
influence of the neutral component of the interstellar medium on the flow
structure. Far-field boundary conditions are formulated which are usually
required in astrophyscal application owing to the extremely large length scale
of these problems. Results are presented of the stationary and nonstationary,
axisymmetric and geniunly three-dimensional calculations. Newly developed
high-resolution numerical methods are discussed which can be applied to a large
variety of astrophysical problems. The bibliography includes 113 references.
The review will be published in ``CFD Review 97'' by John Wiley.
