A central problem in the theory of Gorenstein dimensions over commutative
noetherian rings is to find resolution-free characterizations of the modules
for which these invariants are finite. Over local rings, this problem was
recently solved for the Gorenstein flat and the Gorenstein projective
dimensions; here we give a solution for the Gorenstein injective dimension.
Moreover, we establish two formulas for the Gorenstein injective dimension of
modules in terms of the depth invariant; they extend formulas for the injective
dimension due to Bass and Chouinard.
