The known families of difference sets can be subdivided into three classes:
difference sets with Singer parameters, cyclotomic difference sets, and
difference sets with gcd$(v,n)>1$. It is remarkable that all the known
difference sets with gcd$(v,n)>1$ have the so-called character divisibility
property. In 1997, Jungnickel and Schmidt posed the problem of constructing
difference sets with gcd$(v,n)>1$ that do not satisfy this property. In an
attempt to attack this problem, we use difference sets with three nontrivial
character values as candidates, and get some necessary conditions.
