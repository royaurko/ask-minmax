We propose an birefringence route to perfect electromagnetic (EM) wave
tunneling through a metallic film which relies on homogeneous birefringent
coatings with moderate and positive parameters only. EM transparency is
achieved in such an birefringent-metal-birefringent (BMB) structure for both
polarizations and over nearly all incident angles. The stringent restrictions
in conventional dielectric-metal-dielectric media, i.e., dielectrics with
extremely negative permittivity, high magnetic field and polarization
dependence (only for TE waves), are not required in our method. The criterion
for perfect transmission is obtained by analyzing the effective medium theory
and EM fields of such a birefringent structure. The solutions hold for lossless
and lossy cases in a quite large frequency range.
