We transform an inverse scattering problem to be an interior transmission
problem. We find an inverse uniqueness on the scatterer with a knowledge of a
fixed interior transmission eigenvalue. By examining the solution in a series
of spherical harmonics at far fields, we can decide the perturbation uniquely
for the radially symmetric perturbations.
