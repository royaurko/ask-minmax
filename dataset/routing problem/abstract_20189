The main result of this paper is the existence and uniqueness of solution of
the Dirichlet problem for quaternionic Monge-Ampere equations in quaternionic
strictly pseudoconvex bounded domains in H^n. We continue the study of the
theory of plurisubharmonic functions of quaternionic variables started by the
contributor at [2].
