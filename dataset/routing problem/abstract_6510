This paper presents a fuzzy queuing location model for congested system. In a
queuing system there are different criteria that are not constant such as
service rate, service rate demand, queue length, the occupancy probability of a
service center and Probability of joining the queue line. In this paper with
fuzzifying all of these variables, will try to reach an accurate real problem.
Finally we change the problem to a single objective function and as far as this
model is in NP-Hard classification we will use genetic algorithm for solving it
and ant colony for comparison is used for their results and run time.
