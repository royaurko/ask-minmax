Effects of interaction of graphene with electron donor and acceptor molecules
have been investigated by employing Raman spectroscopy. The G band softens
progressively with the increasing concentration of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)
which is an electron donor while the band stiffens with increasing
concentration of tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) which is an electron-acceptor
molecule. Both TTF and TCNE broaden the G-band. The 2D band position is also
affected by interaction with TTF and TCNE. The intensity of the 2D-band
decreases markedly with the concentration of either. The ratio of intensities
of the 2D and G bands decreases with increase in TTF and TCNE concentrations.
The electrical resistivity of graphene varies in opposite directions on
interaction with TTF and TCNE. All these effects occur due to molecular
charge-transfer, as evidenced by the observation of charge-transfer bands in
the electronic absorption spectra.
