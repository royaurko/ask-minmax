Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) is a successful technique in multi-class
classification, which is a core problem in Pattern Recognition and Machine
Learning. A major advantage of ECOC over other methods is that the multi- class
problem is decoupled into a set of binary problems that are solved
independently. However, literature defines a general error-correcting
capability for ECOCs without analyzing how it distributes among classes,
hindering a deeper analysis of pair-wise error-correction. To address these
limitations this paper proposes an Error-Correcting Factorization (ECF) method,
our contribution is three fold: (I) We propose a novel representation of the
error-correction capability, called the design matrix, that enables us to build
an ECOC on the basis of allocating correction to pairs of classes. (II) We
derive the optimal code length of an ECOC using rank properties of the design
matrix. (III) ECF is formulated as a discrete optimization problem, and a
relaxed solution is found using an efficient constrained block coordinate
descent approach. (IV) Enabled by the flexibility introduced with the design
matrix we propose to allocate the error-correction on classes that are prone to
confusion. Experimental results in several databases show that when allocating
the error-correction to confusable classes ECF outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches.
