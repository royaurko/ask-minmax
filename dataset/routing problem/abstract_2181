A novel route to instabilities and turbulence in fluid and plasma flows is
presented in kinetic Vlasov-Maxwell model. New kind of flow instabilities is
shown to arise due to the availability of new kinetic energy sources which are
absent in conventional treatments. The present approach is based on a scale
invariant nonlinear analytic formalism developed to address irregular motions
on a chaotic attractor or in turbulence in a more coherent manner. We have
studied two specific applications of this turbulence generating mechanism. The
warm plasma Langmuir wave dispersion relation is shown to become unstable in
the presence of these multifractal measures. In the second application, these
multifractal measures are shown to induce naturally non-Gaussian i.e. a
stretched -Gaussian distribution and anomalous transport for tracer particles
from the turbulent advection-diffusion transport equation in a Vlasov plasma
flow.
