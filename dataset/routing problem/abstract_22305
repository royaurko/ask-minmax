In this paper we consider a semilinear parabolic equation with nonlinear and
nonlocal boundary condition and nonnegative initial datum. We prove some global
existence results. Criteria on this problem which determine whether the
solutions blow up in finite time for large or for all nontrivial initial data
are also given.
