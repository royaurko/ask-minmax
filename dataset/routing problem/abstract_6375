We employ the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and the wave
function factorization method for the numerical solution of large scale nuclear
structure problems. The DMRG exhibits an improved convergence for problems with
realistic interactions due to the implementation of the finite algorithm. The
wave function factorization of fpg-shell nuclei yields rapidly converging
approximations that are at the present frontier for large-scale shell model
calculations.
