I consider the problem of the vortex contribution to quasiparticle transport
in unconventional superconductors with line nodes, a nd argue that the magnetic
field dependence of transport coefficients is fixed by the same scattering
processes which limit low-temperature transport. I give no detailed
calculations, but show that qualitatively correct results may be obtained in
the limit of low temperatures and fields by simple physical arguments, based on
estimates of the density of states and relaxation time in analogy with the
zero-field case. I conclude with a brief discussion of the problem of
anisotropy of the field dependence and influence of experimental geometry.
