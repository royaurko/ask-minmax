We study the problem of generating monomials of a polynomial in the context
of enumeration complexity. In this setting, the complexity measure is the delay
between two solutions and the total time. We present two new algorithms for
restricted classes of polynomials, which have a good delay and the same global
running time as the classical ones. Moreover they are simple to describe, use
little evaluation points and one of them is parallelizable. We introduce three
new complexity classes, TotalPP, IncPP and DelayPP, which are probabilistic
counterparts of the most common classes for enumeration problems, hoping that
randomization will be a tool as strong for enumeration as it is for decision.
Our interpolation algorithms proves that a lot of interesting problems are in
these classes like the enumeration of the spanning hypertrees of a 3-uniform
hypergraph.
  Finally we give a method to interpolate a degree 2 polynomials with an
acceptable (incremental) delay. We also prove that finding a specified monomial
in a degree 2 polynomial is hard unless RP = NP. It suggests that there is no
algorithm with a delay as good (polynomial) as the one we achieve for
multilinear polynomials.
