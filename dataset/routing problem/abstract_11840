We consider the problem of statistical inference for the S distribution and
introduce new minimum distance estimators for the four parameters of the S
distribution using Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramer-von Mises and related distance
metrics. Approximate goodness-of-fit and confidence intervals for parameters
are calculated using bootstrap methods. We discuss further how the S
distribution can be used to solve various problems of statistical modeling
associated with parameter inference, including goodness-of-fit tests, Monte
Carlo simulations and modeling trends in the distributions.
