The number partitioning problem consists of partitioning a sequence of
positive numbers ${a_1,a_2,..., a_N}$ into two disjoint sets, ${\cal A}$ and
${\cal B}$, such that the absolute value of the difference of the sums of $a_j$
over the two sets is minimized. We use statistical mechanics tools to study
analytically the Linear Programming relaxation of this NP-complete integer
programming. In particular, we calculate the probability distribution of the
difference between the cardinalities of ${\cal A}$ and ${\cal B}$ and show that
this difference is not self-averaging.
