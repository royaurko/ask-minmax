A new class of geometric query problems are studied in this paper. We are
required to preprocess a set of geometric objects $P$ in the plane, so that for
any arbitrary query point $q$, the largest circle that contains $q$ but does
not contain any member of $P$, can be reported efficiently. The geometric sets
that we consider are point sets and boundaries of simple polygons.
