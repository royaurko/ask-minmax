In this study, we address the problem of answering queries over a
peer-to-peer system of taxonomy-based sources. A taxonomy states subsumption
relationships between negation-free DNF formulas on terms and negation-free
conjunctions of terms. To the end of laying the foundations of our study, we
first consider the centralized case, deriving the complexity of the decision
problem and of query evaluation. We conclude by presenting an algorithm that is
efficient in data complexity and is based on hypergraphs. More expressive forms
of taxonomies are also investigated, which however lead to intractability. We
then move to the distributed case, and introduce a logical model of a network
of taxonomy-based sources. On such network, a distributed version of the
centralized algorithm is then presented, based on a message passing paradigm,
and its correctness is proved. We finally discuss optimization issues, and
relate our work to the literature.
