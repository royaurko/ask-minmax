In this paper we present necessary and sufficient conditions for the
existence of a unique solution to the relaxed commutant lifting problem. The
obtained conditions are more complicated than those for the classical commutant
lifting setting, and earlier obtained sufficient conditions turn out not to be
necessary conditions. It is also shown that these conditions simplify in
certain special cases.
