Aperture synthesis radio telescopes generate images of celestial bodies from
data obtained from several radio antennas. Placement of these antennas has
always been a source of interesting problems. Often, several potentially
contradictory objectives like good image quality and low infra-structural cost
have to be satisfied simultaneously.
  In this paper, we propose a general Minimum Variance Method that focuses on
obtaining good images in the presence of limiting situations. We show its
versatility and goodness in three different situations: (a) Placing the
antennas on the ground to get a target Gaussian UV distribution (b) Staggering
the construction of a telescope in the event of staggered budgets and (c)
Whenever available, using the mobility of antennas to obtain a high degree of
fault tolerance.
