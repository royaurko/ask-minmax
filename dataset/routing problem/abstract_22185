Studying binary perfect codes we show the existence of homogeneous
nontransitive codes. Thus, as far as perfect codes are concerned, the
propelinear codes are strictly contained in transitive codes, wheresas
homogeneous codes form a strict subclass of transitive codes. In the work we
deduce a necessary and sufficient condition for transitivity of perfect binary
codes of rank one more than that of Hamming code. The paper is in Russian.
