We consider the Neumann problem in $C^2$ bounded domains for fully nonlinear
second order operators which are elliptic, homogenous with lower order terms.
Inspired by \cite{bnv}, we define the concept of principal eigenvalue and we
characterize it through the maximum principle. Moreover, Lipschitz regularity,
uniqueness and existence results for solutions of the Neumann problem are
given.
