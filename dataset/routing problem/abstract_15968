Proton linear accelerator is the base Accelerator Driven Power System (ADS).
Such ADS are dedicated to various purposes: weapon plutonium conversion,
"energy amplifier", transmutation of radionuclear wastes etc. Solution of these
tasks requires proton beams with energy 1 GeV and average current up to 30 mA.
At the moment there are no problems of fundamental nature in such linac
construction. The main problems have economic and technical aspects. Problems
of CW linac will be demonstrated on the base beam dynamics requirements. New
code package LIDOS.RFQ.Designer makes possible to simulate beam dynamics in RF
fields of real vane shape (including gaps between RFQ section) as well as to
determine channel parameters tolerances for reliable operation
