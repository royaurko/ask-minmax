Solvability and smoothness of generalized solutions to boundary value
problems for not self-adjoint differential-difference equations are studied.
Necessary and sufficient conditions of Fredholmian solvability (with index
zero) are established. Smoothness of generalized solutions is considered in
terms of index of the corresponding differential--difference operator.
