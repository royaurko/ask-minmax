Consider a clique of n nodes, where in each synchronous round each pair of
nodes can exchange O(log n) bits. We provide deterministic constant-time
solutions for two problems in this model. The first is a routing problem where
each node is source and destination of n messages of size O(log n). The second
is a sorting problem where each node i is given n keys of size O(log n) and
needs to receive the ith batch of n keys according to the global order of the
keys. The latter result also implies deterministic constant-round solutions for
related problems such as selection or determining modes.
