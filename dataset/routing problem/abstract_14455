This paper presents a spectral element finite element scheme that efficiently
solves elliptic problems on unstructured hexahedral meshes. The discrete
equations are solved using a matrix-free preconditioned conjugate gradient
algorithm. An additive Schwartz two-scale preconditioner is employed that
allows h-independence convergence. An extensible multi-threading programming
API is used as a common kernel language that allows runtime selection of
different computing devices (GPU and CPU) and different threading interfaces
(CUDA, OpenCL and OpenMP). Performance tests demonstrate that problems with
over 50 million degrees of freedom can be solved in a few seconds on an
off-the-shelf GPU.
