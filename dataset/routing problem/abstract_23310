We consider supersymmetric theories where the standard-model quark and lepton
fields are localized on a "3-brane" in extra dimensions, while the gauge and
Higgs fields propagate in the bulk. If supersymmetry is broken on another
3-brane, supersymmetry breaking is communicated to gauge and Higgs fields by
direct higher-dimension interactions, and to quark and lepton fields via
standard-model loops. We show that this gives rise to a realistic and
predictive model for supersymmetry breaking. The size of the extra dimensions
is required to be of order 10-100 times larger than fundamental scale (e.g. the
string scale). The spectrum is similar to (but distinguishable from) the
predictions of "no-scale" models. Flavor-changing neutral currents are
naturally suppressed. The \mu term can be generated by the Giudice-Masiero
mechanism. The supersymmetric CP problem is naturally solved if CP violation
occurs only on the observable sector 3-brane. These are the simplest models in
the literature that solve all supersymmetric naturalness problems.
