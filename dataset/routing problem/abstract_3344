We study the problem of anonymizing tables containing personal information
before releasing them for public use. One of the formulations considered in
this context is the $k$-anonymization problem: given a table, suppress a
minimum number of cells so that in the transformed table, each row is identical
to atleast $k-1$ other rows. The problem is known to be NP-hard and
MAXSNP-hard; but in the known reductions, the number of columns in the
constructed tables is arbitrarily large. However, in practical settings the
number of columns is much smaller. So, we study the complexity of the practical
setting in which the number of columns $m$ is small. We show that the problem
is NP-hard, even when the number of columns $m$ is a constant ($m=3$). We also
prove MAXSNP-hardness for this restricted version and derive that the problem
cannot be approximated within a factor of (6238/6237). Our reduction uses
alphabets $\Sigma$ of arbitrarily large size. A natural question is whether the
problem remains NP-hard when both $m$ and $|\Sigma|$ are small. We prove that
the $k$-anonymization problem is in $P$ when both $m$ and $|\Sigma|$ are
constants.
