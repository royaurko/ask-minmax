In this paper we give two characterizations of the class of reflexive graphs
admitting distributive lattice polymorphisms and use these characterizations to
attack the problem of finding a polynomial time recognition algorithm for these
graphs. We provide a polynomial time recognition algorithm for R-thin reflexive
graphs which admit what we call Type 2 distributive lattice polymorphisms.
