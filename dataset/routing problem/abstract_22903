Timetabling is a typical application of constraint programming whose task is
to allocate activities to slots in available resources respecting various
constraints like precedence and capacity. In this paper we present a basic
concept, a constraint model, and the solving algorithms for interactive
timetabling. Interactive timetabling combines automated timetabling (the
machine allocates the activities) with user interaction (the user can interfere
with the process of timetabling). Because the user can see how the timetabling
proceeds and can intervene this process, we believe that such approach is more
convenient than full automated timetabling which behaves like a black-box. The
contribution of this paper is twofold: we present a generic model to describe
timetabling (and scheduling in general) problems and we propose an interactive
algorithm for solving such problems.
