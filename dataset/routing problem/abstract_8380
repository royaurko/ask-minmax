We study the regularity of the solutions of the oblique derivative problem
for linear uniformly parabolic equations with VMO coefficients. We show that if
the right-hand side of the parabolic equation belongs to certain generalized
Morrey space than the strong solution belongs to the corresponding generalized
Sobolev-Morrey space.
