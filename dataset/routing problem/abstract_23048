Inflationary models and their claim to solve many of the outstanding problems
in cosmology have been the subject of a great deal of debate over the last few
years. A major sticking point has been the lack of both good observational and
theoretical arguments to single out one particular model out of the many that
solve these problems. Here we examine the degree of restrictiveness on the
dynamical relationship between the cosmological scale factor and the inflation
driving self-interaction potential of a minimally coupled scalar field, imposed
by the condition that the scalar field is required to be real during a
classical regime (the reality condition). We systema\-tically look at the
effects of this constraint on many of the inflationary models found in the
literature within the FLRW framework, and also look at what happens when
physically motivated perturbations such as shear and bulk viscosity are
introduced. We find that in many cases, either the models are totally excluded
or the reality condition gives rise to constraints on the scale factor and on
the various parameters of the model.
