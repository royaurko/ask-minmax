I present an overview of theoretical expectations for detection of dark
matter (DM) at the LHC, concentrating entirely on supersymmetric candidates. En
route, I present a unified theory which explains dark matter signals at
indirect and direct detection experiments. While direct DM detection is likely
impossible at LHC, detection of SUSY matter states is robust, where LHC with
\sqrt{s}=7 TeV and 1fb^{-1} can access m(gluino) 1 TeV for m(squark) m(gluino),
and m(gluino) 640 GeV for m(squark)>> m(gluino). Models with well-tempered
neutralinos will soon be tested by Xenon-100/LUX, and should provide a
distinctive mass edge at LHC in the m(l+l-) distribution. In the case of SUSY,
neutralino dark matter now seems highly disfavored by both the magnitude of the
dark matter density, and also the gravitino problem. Alternatively, the PQMSSM
yields a solution to the strong CP problem, provides all the benefits of SUSY,
and solves several cosmological problems. Predictions for SUSY particles at the
LHC from the PQMSSM are quite different from the case of neutralino dark
matter. Compelling models such as Yukawa-unifed SUSY or Effective SUSY, which
would be excluded with neutralino DM, are perfectly viable with mixed
axion/axino DM.
