The successive projection algorithm (SPA) works well for separable
nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) problems arising in applications, such
as topic extraction in documents and endmember detection in hyperspectral
images. One of the reasons is that it is robust to noise. Gillis and Vavasis
showed in [SIAM J. Optim., 25(1), pp. 677-698, 2015] that a preconditioner can
further enhance its noise robustness. The proof rested on the condition that
the dimension $d$ and factorization rank $r$ in the separable NMF problem
coincide with each other. However, it may be unrealistic to expect that the
condition holds in separable NMF problems in actual applications; in such
problems, $d$ is usually greater than $r$. This paper shows, without the
condition $d=r$, that the preconditioned SPA is robust to noise.
