We highlight ten key aspects of coronal heating that must be understood
before we can consider the problem to be solved. (1) All coronal heating is
impulsive. (2) The details of coronal heating matter. (3) The corona is filled
with elemental magnetic stands. (4) The corona is densely populated with
current sheets. (5) The strands must reconnect to prevent an infinite buildup
of stress. (6) Nanoflares repeat with different frequencies. (7) What is the
characteristic magnitude of energy release? (8) What causes the collective
behavior responsible for loops? (9) What are the onset conditions for energy
release? (10) Chromospheric nanoflares are not a primary source of coronal
plasma. Significant progress in solving the coronal heating problem will
require a coordination of approaches: observational studies, field-aligned
hydrodynamic simulations, large-scale and localized 3D MHD simulations, and
possibly also kinetic simulations. There is a unique value to each of these
approaches, and the community must strive to coordinate better.
