In theories of gravitation in which dimensional parameters are dynamically
induced, one can have non - topological - soliton solutions. This article
reviews related topics connected with such solutions. The existence of such
solutions in curved spacetime can give rise to halos of gravity (g-) balls with
gravitational ``constant" having different values inside and outside the ball.
Such g - balls can have quite interesting bearing on the dark matter problem
over galactic and cluster scales. We describe the origin of such solutions. We
speculate on related problems in Cosmology. Such objects would naturally occur
in a large class of induced gravity models in which we have scalar fields non
minimally coupled to the scalar curvature.
