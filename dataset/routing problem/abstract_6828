We give a new proof on the disk that a Pick problem can be solved by a
rational function that is unimodular on the unit circle and for which the
number of poles inside the disk is no more than the number of non-positive
eigenvalues of the Pick matrix. We use this method to find rational solutions
to Pick problems on the bidisk.
