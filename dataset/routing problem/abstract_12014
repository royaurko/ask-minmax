We deal with a problem of the reconstruction of any holomorphic function $f$
on the unit ball of $\mathbb{C}^2$ from its restricions on a union of complex
lines. We give an explicit formula of Lagrange interpolation's type that is
constructed from the knowledge of $f$ and its derivatives on these lines. We
prove that this formula approximates any function when the number of lines
increases. The motivation of this problem comes also from possible applications
in mathematical economics and medical imaging.
