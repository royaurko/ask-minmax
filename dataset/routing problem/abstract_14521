Pairwise comparisons between alternatives are a well-established tool to
decompose decision problems into smaller and more easily tractable
sub-problems. However, due to our limited rationality, the subjective
preferences expressed by decision makers over pairs of alternatives can hardly
ever be consistent. Therefore, several inconsistency indices have been proposed
in the literature to quantify the extent of the deviation from complete
consistency. Only recently, a set of axioms has been proposed to define a
family of functions representing inconsistency indices. The scope of this paper
is to expand the axiomatic framework by adding and justifying a new axiom.
