The model consists of a signal process $X$ which is a general Brownian
diffusion process and an observation process $Y$, also a diffusion process,
which is supposed to be correlated to the signal process. We suppose that the
process $Y$ is observed from time 0 to $s>0$ at discrete times and aim to
estimate, conditionally on these observations, the probability that the
non-observed process $X$ crosses a fixed barrier after a given time $t>s$. We
formulate this problem as a usual nonlinear filtering problem and use optimal
quantization and Monte Carlo simulations techniques to estimate the involved
quantities.
