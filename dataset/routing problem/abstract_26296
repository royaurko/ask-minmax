We propose an improved model explaining the occurrence of high stresses due
to the difference in specific volumes during phase transitions between water
and ice. The unknowns of the resulting evolution problem are the absolute
temperature, the volume increment, and the liquid fraction. The main novelty
here consists in including the dependence of the specific heat and of the speed
of sound upon the phase. These additional nonlinearities bring new mathematical
difficulties which require new estimation techniques based on Moser iteration.
We establish the existence of a global solution to the corresponding
initial-boundary value problem, as well as lower and upper bounds for the
absolute temperature. Assuming constant heat conductivity, we also prove
uniqueness and continuous data dependence of the solution.
