We consider three distinct and well studied problems concerning network
structure: community detection by modularity maximization, community detection
by statistical inference, and normalized-cut graph partitioning. Each of these
problems can be tackled using spectral algorithms that make use of the
eigenvectors of matrix representations of the network. We show that with
certain choices of the free parameters appearing in these spectral algorithms
the algorithms for all three problems are, in fact, identical, and hence that,
at least within the spectral approximations used here, there is no difference
between the modularity- and inference-based community detection methods, or
between either and graph partitioning.
