The spectral problem where the field satisfies Dirichlet conditions on one
part of the boundary of the relevant domain and Neumann on the remainder is
discussed. It is shown that there does not exist a classical asymptotic
expansion for short time in terms of fractional powers of $t$ with locally
computable coefficients.
