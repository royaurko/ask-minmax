Based on a stochastic geometry framework, we establish an analysis of the
multi-hop spatial reuse aloha protocol (MSR-Aloha) in ad hoc networks. We
compare MSR-Aloha to a simple routing strategy, where a node selects the next
relay of the treated packet as to be its nearest receiver with a forward
progress toward the final destination (NFP). In addition, performance gains
achieved by employing adaptive antenna array systems are quantified in this
paper. We derive a tight upper bound on the spatial density of progress of
MSR-Aloha. Our analytical results demonstrate that the spatial density of
progress scales as the square root of the density of users, and the optimal
contention density (that maximizes the spatial density of progress) is
independent of the density of users. These two facts are consistent with the
observations of Baccelli et al., established through an analytical lower bound
and through simulations.
