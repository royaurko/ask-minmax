We study the complexity of approximating the vertex expansion of graphs $G =
(V,E)$, defined as \[ \Phi^V := \min_{S \subset V} n \cdot \frac{|N(S)|}{|S| |V
\backslash S|}. \]
  We give a simple polynomial-time algorithm for finding a subset with vertex
expansion $O(\sqrt{OPT \log d})$ where $d$ is the maximum degree of the graph.
Our main result is an asymptotically matching lower bound: under the Small Set
Expansion (SSE) hypothesis, it is hard to find a subset with expansion less
than $C\sqrt{OPT \log d}$ for an absolute constant $C$. In particular, this
implies for all constant $\epsilon > 0$, it is SSE-hard to distinguish whether
the vertex expansion $< \epsilon$ or at least an absolute constant. The
analogous threshold for edge expansion is $\sqrt{OPT}$ with no dependence on
the degree; thus our results suggest that vertex expansion is harder to
approximate than edge expansion. In particular, while Cheeger's algorithm can
certify constant edge expansion, it is SSE-hard to certify constant vertex
expansion in graphs.
  Our proof is via a reduction from the {\it Unique Games} instance obtained
from the \SSE hypothesis to the vertex expansion problem. It involves the
definition of a smoother intermediate problem we call {\sf Analytic Vertex
Expansion} which is representative of both the vertex expansion and the
conductance of the graph. Both reductions (from the UGC instance to this
problem and from this problem to vertex expansion) use novel proof ideas.
