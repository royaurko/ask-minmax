In this paper we present the bilevel equilibrium problem under conditions of
pseudomonotonicity. Using Bregman distances on Hadamard manifolds we propose a
framework for to analyse the convergence of a proximal point algorithm to solve
this bilevel equilibrium problem. As an application, we consider the problem of
"how routines form and change" which is crucial for the dynamics of
organizations in Economics and Management Sciences.
