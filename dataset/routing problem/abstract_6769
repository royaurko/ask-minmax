We consider the initial boundary value problem of non-homogeneous stochastic
heat equation. The derivative of the solution with respect to time receives
heavy random perturbation. The space boundary is Lipschitz and we impose
non-zero cylinder condition. We prove a regularity result after finding
suitable spaces for the solution and the pre-assigned datum in the problem. The
tools from potential theory, harmonic analysis and probability are used. Some
Lemmas are as important as the main Theorem.
