Graphical models are used to describe the conditional independence relations
in multivariate data. They have been used for a variety of problems, including
log-linear models (Liu and Massam, 2006), network analysis (Holland and
Leinhardt, 1981; Strauss and Ikeda, 1990; Wasserman and Pattison, 1996;
Pattison and Wasserman, 1999; Robins et al., 1999);, graphical Gaussian models
(Roverato and Whittaker, 1998; Giudici and Green, 1999; Marrelec and Benali,
2006), and genetics (Dobra et al., 2004). A distribution that satisfies the
conditional independence structure of a graph is Markov. A graphical model is a
family of distributions that is restricted to be Markov with respect to a
certain graph. In a Bayesian problem, one may specify a prior over the
graphical model. Such a prior is called a hyper Markov law if the random
marginals also satisfy the independence constraints. Previous work in this area
includes (Dempster, 1972; Dawid and Lauritzen, 1993; Giudici and Green, 1999;
Letac and Massam, 2007). We explore graphical models based on a non-parametric
family of distributions, developed from Dirichlet processes.
