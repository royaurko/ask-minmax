In this paper we study conditions for the vanishing of Abelian integrals on
families of zero-dimensional cycles. That is, for any rational function $f(z)$,
characterize all rational functions $g(z)$ and zero-sum integers $\{n_i\}$ such
that the function $t\mapsto\sum n_ig(z_i(t))$ vanishes identically. Here
$z_i(t)$ are continuously depending roots of $f(z)-t$. We introduce a notion of
(un)balanced cycles. Our main result is an inductive solution of the problem of
vanishing of Abelian integrals when $f,g$ are polynomials on a family of
zero-dimensional cycles under the assumption that the family of cycles we
consider is unbalanced as well as all the cycles encountered in the inductive
process. We also solve the problem on some balanced cycles.
  The main motivation for our study is the problem of vanishing of Abelian
integrals on single families of one-dimensional cycles. We show that our
problem and our main result are sufficiently rich to include some related
problems, as hyper-elliptic integrals on one-cycles, some applications to
slow-fast planar systems, and the polynomial (and trigonometric) moment problem
for Abel equation. This last problem was recently solved by Pakovich and
Muzychuk (\cite{PM} and \cite{P}). Our approach is largely inspired by their
work, thought we provide examples of vanishing Abelian integrals on zero-cycles
which are not given as a sum of composition terms contrary to the situation in
the solution of the polynomial moment problem.
