The left-invariant sub-Riemannian problem on the group of motions of a plane
is considered. Sub-Riemannian geodesics are parametrized by Jacobi's functions.
Discrete symmetries of the problem generated by reflections of pendulum are
described. The corresponding Maxwell points are characterized, on this basis an
upper bound on the cut time is obtained.
