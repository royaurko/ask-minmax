In this paper, we consider a generalized longest common subsequence problem,
the string-excluding constrained LCS problem. For the two input sequences $X$
and $Y$ of lengths $n$ and $m$, and a constraint string $P$ of length $r$, the
problem is to find a common subsequence $Z$ of $X$ and $Y$ excluding $P$ as a
substring and the length of $Z$ is maximized. The problem and its solution were
first proposed by Chen and Chao\cite{1}, but we found that their algorithm can
not solve the problem correctly. A new dynamic programming solution for the
STR-EC-LCS problem is then presented in this paper. The correctness of the new
algorithm is proved. The time complexity of the new algorithm is $O(nmr)$.
