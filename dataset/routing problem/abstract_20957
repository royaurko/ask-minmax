We set up a general scheme to resum ladder diagrams for the quark-anti-quark
potential in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory, and do explicit calculations at the
next-to-leading order. The results perfectly agree with string theory in
AdS(5)xS(5) when continued to strong coupling, in spite of a potential
order-of-limits problem.
