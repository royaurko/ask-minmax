A simple sufficient condition on curved end of a straight cylinder is found
that provides a localization of the principal eigenfunction of the mixed
boundary value for the Laplace operator with the Dirichlet conditions on the
lateral side. Namely, the eigenfunction concentrates in the vicinity of the
ends and decays exponentially in the interior. Similar effects are observed in
the Dirichlet and Neumann problems, too.
