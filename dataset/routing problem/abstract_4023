A reduction of the transmission eigenvalue problem for multiplicative
sign-definite perturbations of elliptic operators with constant coefficients to
an eigenvalue problem for a non-selfadjoint compact operator is given.
Sufficient conditions for the existence of transmission eigenvalues and
completeness of generalized eigenstates for the transmission eigenvalue problem
are derived. In the trace class case, the generic existence of transmission
eigenvalues is established.
