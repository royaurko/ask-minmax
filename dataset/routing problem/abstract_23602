A brief overview of dimensional reductions for diffeomorphism invariant
theories is given. The distinction between the physical idea of
compactification and the mathematical problem of a consistent truncation is
discussed, and the typical ingredients of the latter --reduction of spacetime
dimensions and the introduction of constraints-- are examined. The consistency
in the case of of group manifold reductions, when the structure constants
satisfy the unimodularity condition, is shown in a clear way together with the
associated reduction of the gauge group. The problem of consistent truncations
on coset spaces is also discussed and we comment on examples of some remarkable
consistent truncations that have been found in this context.
