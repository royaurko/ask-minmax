We consider the problem of finding a minimum common partition of two strings
(MCSP). The problem has its application in genome comparison. MCSP problem is
proved to be NP-hard. In this paper, we develop an Integer Programming (IP)
formulation for the problem and implement it. The experimental results are
compared with the previous state-of-the-art algorithms and are found to be
promising.
