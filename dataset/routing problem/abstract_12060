We study gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild spacetime by solving a
hyperboloidal initial value problem for the Bardeen-Press equation.
Compactification along hyperboloidal surfaces in a scri-fixing gauge allows us
to have access to the gravitational waveform at null infinity in a general
setup. We argue that this hyperboloidal approach leads to a more accurate and
efficient calculation of the radiation signal than the common approach where a
timelike outer boundary is introduced. The method can be generalized to study
perturbations of Kerr spacetime using the Teukolsky equation.
