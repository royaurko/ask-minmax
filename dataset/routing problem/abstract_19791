Versions of GMRES with deflation of eigenvalues are applied to lattice QCD
problems. Approximate eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues
are generated at the same time that linear equations are solved. The
eigenvectors improve convergence for the linear equations, and they help solve
other right-hand sides.
