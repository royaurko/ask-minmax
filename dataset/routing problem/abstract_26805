We study the minimal payoff scenario for the holder of an American-style
option in the presence of regime-switching uncertainty, for a large class of
payoff functions. We assume that the transition rates are only known to lie
within level-dependent compact sets, and so the holder takes a worst-case
scenario position. We show that the minimal payoff identifies with the value
function of an optimal stopping problem associated with a certain extremal rate
matrix and characterized as the probabilistic solution of a free-boundary
problem. The approach is via time-change and classical PDE techniques. We apply
our results to the context of American option pricing under the
Markov-modulated constant elasticity of variance and Markov-modulated geometric
Brownian motion models.
