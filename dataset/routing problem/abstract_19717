In this letter we investigate whether the isotropy problem is naturally
solved in inflationary cosmologies inspired by string theory, so called
pre-big-bang cosmologies. We find that, in contrast to what happens in the more
common 'potential inflation' models, initial anisotropies do not decay during
pre-big-bang inflation.
