Control over molecular scale electrical properties within nano junctions is
demonstrated, utilizing site-directed C60 targeting into protein macromolecules
as a doping means. The protein molecules, self-assembled in a miniaturized
transistor device, yield robust and reproducible operation. Their device signal
is dominated by an active center that inverts affinity upon guest incorporation
and thus controls the properties of the entire macromolecule. We show how the
leading routs of electron transport can be drawn, spatially and energetically,
on the molecular level and, in particular, how the dopant effect is dictated by
its 'strategic' binding site. Our findings propose the extension of
microelectronic methodologies to the nanometer scale and further present a
promising platform for ex-situ studies of biochemical processes.
