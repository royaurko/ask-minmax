In this paper, we present a framework for shaping pulses to control
biological systems with synthetic biology as the main application in mind. By
shaping we mean computing the magnitude and the length of a pulse, application
of which results in reaching the desired control objective. One of the
advantages of applying this framework to biological systems is that pulses can
easily be implemented in a laboratory setting. We consider the problem of
switching between steady states in a bi-stable system. We show that it is
possible to estimate the set of the pulses fulfilling the objective, if the
trajectories of the controlled system can be bounded from above and below by
the trajectories of monotone systems. This result can be generalised to systems
with parametric uncertainty under some mild assumptions on the set of
admissible parameters. Hence, even with infinite sampling time (that is
open-loop control) some robustness guarantees can be provided. We illustrate
the results on some example genetic circuits. We also consider a problem of
inducing an oscillatory behaviour in an eight species generalised
repressilator, which is a monotone system. We provide an ad-hoc solution to
this problem, which is based on shaped pulses.
