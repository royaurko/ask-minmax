The problem of object restoration in the case of spatially incoherent
illumination is considered. A regularized solution to the inverse problem is
obtained through a probabilistic approach, and a numerical algorithm based on
the statistical analysis of the noisy data is presented. Particular emphasis is
placed on the question of the positivity constraint, which is incorporated into
the probabilistically regularized solution by means of a quadratic programming
technique. Numerical examples illustrating the main steps of the algorithm are
also given.
