An outstanding problem in the study of possible kaon condensation is the
striking discrepancy between the results of chiral perturbation theory and
those of the PCAC-plus-current-algebra approach. I discuss here what causes
this discrepancy and what needs to be done to solve the problem. In addition, I
point out the importance of examining the validity of the non-relativistic
approximation universally employed in the existing treatments of kaon
condensation.
