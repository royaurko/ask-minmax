This paper investigates the consensus problem in almost sure sense for
uncertain multi-agent systems with noises and fixed topology. By combining the
tools of stochastic analysis, algebraic graph theory, and matrix theory, we
analyze the convergence of a class of distributed stochastic type non-linear
protocols. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the results.
