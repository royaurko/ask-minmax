We prove that the partial $C^0$-estimate holds for metrics along Aubin's
continuity method for finding K\"ahler-Einstein metrics, confirming a special
case of a conjecture due to Tian. We use the method developed in recent work of
Chen-Donaldson-Sun on the analogous problem for conical K\"ahler-Einstein
metrics.
