We present a general procedure for obtaining the present density fluctuation
probability distribution given the statistics of the initial conditions. The
main difficulties faced with regard to this problem are those related to the
non-linear evolution of the density fluctuations and those posed by the fact
that the fields we are interested in are the result of filtering an underlying
field with structure down to scales much smaller than that of filtering. The
solution to the latter problem is discussed here in detail and the solution to
the former is taken from a previous work.
  We have checked the procedure for values of the rms density fluctuation as
large as 3/2 and several power spectra and found that it leads to results in
excellent agreement with those obtained in numerical simulations. We also
recover all available exact results from perturbation theory.
