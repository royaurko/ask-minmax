Many users would prefer the privacy of end-to-end encryption in their online
communications if it can be done without significant inconvenience. However,
because existing key distribution methods cannot be fully trusted enough for
automatic use, key management has remained a user problem. We propose a
fundamentally new approach to the key distribution problem by empowering
end-users with the capacity to independently verify the authenticity of public
keys using an additional media attestment. This permits client software to
automatically lookup public keys from a keyserver without trusting the
keyserver, because any attempted MITM attacks can be detected by end-users.
Thus, our protocol is designed to enable a new breed of messaging clients with
true end-to-end encryption built in, without the hassle of requiring users to
manually manage the public keys, that is verifiably secure against MITM
attacks, and does not require trusting any third parties.
