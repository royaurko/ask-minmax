We introduce a prime number generator in the form of a stochastic algorithm.
The character of such algorithm gives rise to a continuous phase transition
which distinguishes a phase where the algorithm is able to reduce the whole
system of numbers into primes and a phase where the system reaches a frozen
state with low prime density. In this paper we firstly pretend to give a broad
characterization of this phase transition, both in terms of analytical and
numerical analysis. Critical exponents are calculated, and data collapse is
provided. Further on we redefine the model as a search problem, fitting it in
the hallmark of computational complexity theory. We suggest that the system
belongs to the class NP. The computational cost is maximal around the
threshold, as common in many algorithmic phase transitions, revealing the
presence of an easy-hard-easy pattern. We finally relate the nature of the
phase transition to an average-case classification of the problem.
