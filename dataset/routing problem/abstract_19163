Collective, especially group-based, managerial decision making is crucial in
organizations. Using an evolutionary theory approach to collective decision
making, agent-based simulations were conducted to investigate how collective
decision making would be affected by the agents' diversity in problem
understanding and/or behavior in discussion, as well as by their social network
structure. Simulation results indicated that groups with consistent problem
understanding tended to produce higher utility values of ideas and displayed
better decision convergence, but only if there was no group-level bias in
collective problem understanding. Simulation results also indicated the
importance of balance between selection-oriented (i.e., exploitative) and
variation-oriented (i.e., explorative) behaviors in discussion to achieve
quality final decisions. Expanding the group size and introducing non-trivial
social network structure generally improved the quality of ideas at the cost of
decision convergence. Simulations with different social network topologies
revealed that collective decision making on small-world networks with high
local clustering tended to achieve highest decision quality more often than on
random or scale-free networks. Implications of this evolutionary theory and
simulation approach for future managerial research on collective, group, and
multi-level decision making are discussed.
