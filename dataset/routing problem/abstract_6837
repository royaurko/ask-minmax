We discuss a class of linear control problems in a Hilbert space setting,
which covers diverse systems such as hyperbolic and parabolic equations with
boundary control and boundary observation even including memory terms. We
introduce abstract boundary data spaces in which the control and observation
equations can be formulated without strong geometric constraints on the
underlying domain. The results are applied to a boundary control problem for
the equations of visco-elasticity.
