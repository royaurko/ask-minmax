We obtain nontrivial solutions of some elliptic interface problems with
nonhomogeneous jump conditions that arise in localized chemical reactions and
nonlinear neutral inclusions. Our proofs in bounded domains use Morse
theoretical arguments, in particular, critical group computations. An extension
to the whole space is proved using concentration compactness arguments.
