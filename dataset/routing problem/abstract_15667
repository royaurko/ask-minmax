In supersymmetric models a tree-level neutrino mass could originate from the
(weak-scale) superpotential. We propose and examine a realization of that idea,
which arises naturally in the framework of a spontaneously broken U(1)
R-symmetry. The solution to the neutrino mass problem could shed light in this
framework on the possible resolution of the $\mu$ problem. Furthermore, the
suppression of the neutrino mass in comparison to the weak scale arises
dynamically and need not be encoded in the superpotential. The latter mechanism
operates, for example, in universal models for the soft supersymmetry breaking
terms. Phenomenological and cosmological implications of the model are also
discussed, some of which are shown to hold more generally. We also note that
future signatures could include observable enhancement of dijet and multijet
production rates and a correlation between the supersymmetric and neutrino
spectra.
