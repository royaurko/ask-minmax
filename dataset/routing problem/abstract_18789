Let $(R, S,_R\negthinspace M_S,_S\negthinspace N_R, f, g)$ be a general
Morita context, and let $T=[{cc} R &_RM_S_SN_R & S]$ be the ring associated
with this context. Similarly, let $T'=[{cc} R' & M' N' & S']$ be another Morita
context ring. We study the set ${Iso}(T,T')$ of ring isomorphisms from $T$ to
$T'$. Our interest in this problem is motivated by: (i) the problem to
determine the automorphism group of the ring $T$, and (ii) the recovery of the
non-diagonal tiles problem for this type of generalized matrix rings.
  We introduce two classes of isomorphisms from $T$ to $T'$, the disjoint union
of which is denoted by ${Iso}_0(T,T')$. We describe ${Iso}_0(T,T')$ by using
the $\Z$-graded ring structure of $T$ and $T'$. Our main result characterizes
${Iso}_0(T,T')$ as the set consisting of all semigraded isomorphisms and all
anti-semigraded isomorphisms from $T$ to $T'$, provided that the rings $R'$ and
$S'$ are indecomposable and at least one of $M'$ and $N'$ is nonzero; in
particular ${Iso}_0(T,T')$ contains all graded isomorphisms and all anti-graded
isomorphisms from $T$ to $T'$. We also present a situation where
${Iso}_0(T,T')={Iso}(T,T')$. This is in the case where $R,S,R'$ and $S'$ are
rings having only trivial idempotents and all the Morita maps are zero. In
particular, this shows that the group of automorphisms of $T$ is completely
determined.
