This paper argues that the problem of identity is a critical challenge in
agents which are able to reason about stories. The Xapagy architecture has been
built from scratch to perform narrative reasoning and relies on a somewhat
unusual approach to represent instances and identity. We illustrate the
approach by a representation of the story of Little Red Riding Hood in the
architecture, with a focus on the problem of identity raised by the narrative.
