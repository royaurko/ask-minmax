We consider geometric instances of the Maximum Weighted Matching Problem
(MWMP) and the Maximum Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP) with up to 3,000,000
vertices. Making use of a geometric duality relationship between MWMP, MTSP,
and the Fermat-Weber-Problem (FWP), we develop a heuristic approach that yields
in near-linear time solutions as well as upper bounds. Using various
computational tools, we get solutions within considerably less than 1% of the
optimum.
  An interesting feature of our approach is that, even though an FWP is hard to
compute in theory and Edmonds' algorithm for maximum weighted matching yields a
polynomial solution for the MWMP, the practical behavior is just the opposite,
and we can solve the FWP with high accuracy in order to find a good heuristic
solution for the MWMP.
