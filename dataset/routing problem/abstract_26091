We discuss some aspects of the approach of the mass parameters by means of
the simple cranking model. In particular, it is well known that the numerical
application of this formula is often subject to ambiguities or contradictions.
It is found that these problems are induced by the presence of two derivatives
in the formula. To overcome these problems, we state a useful ansatz and we
develop a number of simple arguments which tend to justify the removal of these
terms. As soon as this is done, the formula becomes simpler and easier to
interpret. In this respect, it is shown how the shell effects affect the mass
parameters. A number of numerical tests help us in our conclusions.
