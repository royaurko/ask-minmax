Recent experiments have observed bulk superconductivity in doped topological
insulators. Here we ask whether vortex Majorana zero modes, previously
predicted to occur when superconductivity is induced on the surface of
topological insulators, survive even in these doped systems with metallic
normal states. Assuming inversion symmetry, we find that Majorana zero modes
indeed appear but only below a critical doping. The critical doping is
associated with a topological phase transition of the vortex line, where it
supports gapless excitations along its length. The critical point depends only
on the orientation of the vortex line, and a Berry phase property, the SU(2)
Berry phase of the Fermi surface in the metallic normal state. By calculating
this phase for available band structures we determine that materials candidates
like $p$-doped Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ under pressure supports vortex end Majorana
modes. Surprisingly, even superconductors derived from topologically trivial
band structures can support Majorana modes, providing a promising route to
realizing them.
