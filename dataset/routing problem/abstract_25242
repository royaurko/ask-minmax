We consider the problem of determining the proportion of edges that are
discovered in an Erdos-Renyi graph when one constructs all shortest paths from
a given source node to all other nodes. This problem is equivalent to the one
of determining the proportion of edges connecting nodes that are at identical
distance from the source node. The evolution of this quantity with the
probability of existence of the edges exhibits intriguing oscillatory behavior.
In order to perform our analysis, we introduce a new way of computing the
distribution of distances between nodes. Our method outperforms previous
similar analyses and leads to estimates that coincide remarkably well with
numerical simulations. It allows us to characterize the phase transitions
appearing when the connectivity probability varies.
