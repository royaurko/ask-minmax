Chiral anomaly is a non-conservation of chiral charge pumped by the
topological nontrivial gauge field. As an analogy to the similar phenomenon in
high-energy physics, the chiral anomaly in condensed matter is predicted to
exist in the emergent quasiparticle excitations in Dirac and Weyl semimetals.
However, the current understanding of such concept mostly remains in the
theoretical consideration, which lacks of convincing experimental
identification. Here, for the first time, we experimentally observe the
existence of the chiral anomaly and the related valley transport in Cd3As2. We
find that the chiral imbalance induced by external electric and magnetic fields
leads to a non-zero gyrotropic coefficient {\gamma}, which can be confirmed by
the field-generated Kerr effect. By applying B along the current direction, we
observe a negative magnetoresistance despite the giant positive one at other
directions, a clear indication of the chiral anomaly. Remarkably, a robust
nonlocal response from valley diffusion originated from the chiral anomaly is
observed up to room temperature when B is parallel to E. Our discovery of the
chiral anomaly in Cd3As2 Dirac semimetal opens up a brand-new route to
understand its fundamental properties with a controllable chiral imbalance
through external fields and utilize the chiral fermions in valleytronic
applications.
