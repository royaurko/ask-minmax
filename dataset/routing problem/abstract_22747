We consider classical N-particle system with arbitrary central pair
potential. Mechanical equilibrium condition in spherically-symmetric case leads
to a nonlinear integro-differential equation for concentration n(r). For
special state equation $p=an^{\gamma}(1+bn)$, original integro-differential
equation transforms into purely integral one. Its solution (under b=0) is
written through a row over interaction parameter. Physical conditions for its
convergency is discussed. For power-like potential kernal of integral operator
is calculated in apparent kind. The cases of Coulomb and harmonic potentials
are considered separately up to a third order. General scheme of application of
the theory for some astrophysical and cosmological problems is presented. Model
system with spherical potential pits is considered. By perturbation theory
first virial correction $\delta n$ is calculated.
