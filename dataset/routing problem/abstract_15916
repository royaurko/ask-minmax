An effective approach for solving the three-dimensional Dirac equation for
spherically symmetric local interactions, which we have introduced recently, is
reviewed and consolidated. The merit of the approach is in producing
Schrodinger-like equation for the spinor components that could simply be solved
by correspondence with well-known exactly solvable non-relativistic problems.
Taking the nonrelativistic limit will reproduce the nonrelativistic problem.
The approach has been used successfully in establishing the relativistic
extension of all classes of shape invariant potentials as well as other exactly
solvable nonrelativistic problems. These include the Coulomb, Oscillator,
Scarf, Poschl-Teller, Woods-Saxon, etc.
