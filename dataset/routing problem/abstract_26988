The standard algorithms for solving large-scale convex-concave saddle point
problems, or, more generally, variational inequalities with monotone operators,
are proximal type algorithms which at every iteration need to compute a
prox-mapping, that is, to minimize over problem's domain $X$ the sum of a
linear form and the specific convex distance-generating function underlying the
algorithms in question. Relative computational simplicity of prox-mappings,
which is the standard requirement when implementing proximal algorithms,
clearly implies the possibility to equip $X$ with a relatively computationally
cheap Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) able to minimize over $X$ linear forms.
There are, however, important situations where a cheap LMO indeed is available,
but where no proximal setup with easy-to-compute prox-mappings is known. This
fact motivates our goal in this paper, which is to develop techniques for
solving variational inequalities with monotone operators on domains given by
Linear Minimization Oracles. The techniques we develope can be viewed as a
substantial extension of the proposed in [5] method of nonsmooth convex
minimization over an LMO-represented domain.
