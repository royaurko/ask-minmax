Thick, high quality 4H-SiC epilayers have been grown in a vertical hot-wall
chemical vapor deposition system at a high growth rate on (0001) 80 off-axis
substrates. We discuss the use of dichlorosilane as the Si-precursor for 4H-SiC
epitaxial growth as it provides the most direct decomposition route into SiCl2,
which is the predominant growth species in chlorinated chemistries. A specular
surface morphology was attained by limiting the hydrogen etch rate until the
system was equilibrated at the desired growth temperature. The RMS roughness of
the grown films ranged from 0.5-2.0 nm with very few morphological defects
(carrots, triangular defects, etc.) being introduced, while enabling growth
rates of 30-100 \mum/hr, 5-15 times higher than most conventional growths.
Site-competition epitaxy was observed over a wide range of C/Si ratios, with
doping concentrations < 1x1014 cm-3 being recorded. X-ray rocking curves
indicated that the epilayers were of high crystallinity, with linewidths as
narrow as 7.8 arcsec being observed, while microwave photoconductive decay
(\muPCD) measurements indicated that these films had high injection (ambipolar)
carrier lifetimes in the range of 2 \mus.
