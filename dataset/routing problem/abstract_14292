We obtain relations among normal generation of perfect groups, Swan's
inequality involving partial Euler characteristic, and deficiency of finite
groups. The proof is based on the study of a stable version of Wall's D(2)
problem. Moreover, we prove that a finite 3-dimensional CW complex of
cohomological dimension at most 2 with fundamental group G is homotopy
equivalent to a 2-dimensional CW complex after wedging n copies of the 2-sphere
S^2, where n depends only on G.
