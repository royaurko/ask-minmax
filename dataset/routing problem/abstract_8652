In this work, we first define relations on the fuzzy parametrized soft sets
and study their properties. We also give a decision making method based on
these relations. In approximate reasoning, relations on the fuzzy parametrized
soft sets have shown to be of a primordial importance. Finally, the method is
successfully applied to a problems that contain uncertainties.
