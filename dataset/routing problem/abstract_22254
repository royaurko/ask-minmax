This is a survey of some recent applications of Boolean valued analysis to
operator theory and harmonic analysis. Under consideration are pseudoembedding
operators, the noncommutative Wickstead problem, the Radon-Nikodym Theorem for
JB-algebras, and the Bochner Theorem for lattice-valued positive definite
mappings on locally compact groups.
