Hanle-effect observations of forbidden coronal line transitions and recently
also longitudinal Zeeman-effect measurements of coronal lines show quantitative
signatures of the weak coronal magnetic field. The interpretation of these
observations is, however, complicated by the fact that they are the result of
line-of-sight integrations through the optically thin corona. We study by means
of simulated observations the possibility of applying tomographic techniques in
order to reconstruct the 3D magnetic field configuration in the solar corona
from these observations. The reconstruction problem relates to a family of
similar problems termed vector tomography. It is shown that Zeeman data and
Hanle data alone obtained from vantage points in the ecliptic plane alone are
sensitive only to certain magnetic field structures. For a full reconstruction
it is necessary to combine the longitudinal Zeeman and Hanle effect data.
