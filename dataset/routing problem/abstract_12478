In this note we prove that every metric space $(X, d)$ of asymptotic
dimmension at most $n$ is coarsely equivalent to a metric space $(Y, D)$ that
satisfies the following property of Nagata:
  For every $n+2$ points $y_1,..., y_{n+2}$ in $Y$ and for every $x$ in $Y$
there exist two different $i,j$ such that $D(y_i,y_j)\le D(x,y_i)$.
  This solves problem 1400 of the book Open problems in Topology II.
