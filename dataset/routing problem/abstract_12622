We consider the isomorphism problem for almost split Kac--Moody groups, which
have been constructed by R\'emy via Galois descent from split Kac-Moody groups
as defined by Tits. We show that under certain technical assumptions, any
isomorphism between two such groups must preserve the canonical subgroup
structure, i.e. the twin root datum associated to these groups, which
generalizes results of Caprace in the split case. An important technical tool
we use is the existence of maximal split subgroups inside almost split
Kac-Moody groups, which generalizes the corresponding result of Borel-Tits for
reductive algebraic groups.
