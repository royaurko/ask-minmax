In this paper we describe an approach to Casimir Force problems that is
ultimately generalizable to all fields, boundary conditions, and cavity
geometries. This approach utilizes locally defined reflection amplitudes to
express the energy per unit area of any Casimir interaction. To demonstrate
this approach we solve a number of Casimir Force problems including the case of
uniaxial boundary conditions in a parallel-plate cavity.
