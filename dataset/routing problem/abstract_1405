Five ultrahigh energy cosmic rays in the combined AGASA and HiRes stereo data
are analyzed to test whether they come from a single source. The quad above 37
EeV in the 94-event high energy dataset can be analyzed without considering
magnetic dispersion. The probability that it is a chance association is 10^-3.
Assuming the source is continuous, the random magnetic deflections these UHECRs
accumulated en route from their source can be used to estimate \sqrt{B^2
\lambda D} ~ 1 nG-Mpc. A quintuplet including a HiRes event between 10 and 30
EeV is well fit with this value. Galactic magnetic deflection appears to be
smaller than in some models.
