Spacelike surfaces in Generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes whose mean
curvature function satisfies a natural nonlinear inequality are analyzed.
Several uniqueness and nonexistence results for such compact spacelike surfaces
are proved. In the nonparametric case, new Calabi-Bernstein type problems are
solved as a consequence.
