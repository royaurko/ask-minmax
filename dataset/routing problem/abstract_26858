For the system with two degrees of freedom, which is an analogue of the 4th
Appelrot class for a gyrostat of the Kowalevski type in a double force field
the problem of the classification of bifurcation diagrams is solved. The
separating set is built and its completeness is proved. All transformations
taking place in the diagrams are shown. The results serve as a necessary part
of solving the problem of obtaining the topological invariants for the Reyman -
Semenov-Tian-Shansky system.
