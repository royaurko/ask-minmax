In this paper we present some compactness results, showing how they can be
applied in dealing with "zero mass" problems by a variational approach. In
particular we use our results in two different situations: we look for complex
valued solutions of a very classical elliptic equation, and we study an
elliptic problem on an axially symmetric unbounded domain.
