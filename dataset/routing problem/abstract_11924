In this work,We investigate the problem of secretly broadcasting of
three-qubit entangled state between two distant partners. The interesting
feature of this problem is that starting from two particle entangled state
shared between two distant partners we find that the action of local cloner on
the qubits and the measurement on the machine state vector generates
three-qubit entanglement between them. The broadcasting of entanglement is made
secret by sending the measurement result secretly using cryptographic scheme
based on orthogonal states. Further we show that this idea can be extended to
generate three particle entangled state between three distant partners.
