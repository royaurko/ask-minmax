This paper explores the problem of reaching approximate consensus in
synchronous point-to-point networks, where each directed link of the underlying
communication graph represents a communication channel between a pair of nodes.
We adopt the transient Byzantine link failure model [15, 16], where an
omniscient adversary controls a subset of the directed communication links, but
the nodes are assumed to be fault-free.
  Recent work has addressed the problem of reaching approximate consen- sus in
incomplete graphs with Byzantine nodes using a restricted class of iterative
algorithms that maintain only a small amount of memory across iterations [22,
21, 23, 12]. However, to the best of our knowledge, we are the fi?rst to
consider approximate consensus in the presence of Byzan- tine links. We extend
our past work that provided exact characterization of graphs in which the
iterative approximate consensus problem in the presence of Byzantine node
failures is solvable [22, 21]. In particular, we prove a tight necessary and
sufficient condition on the underlying com- munication graph for the existence
of iterative approximate consensus algorithms under transient Byzantine link
model. The condition answers (part of) the open problem stated in [16].
