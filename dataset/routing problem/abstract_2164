We theoretically study exotic superconducting phases with enhanced transition
temperature in a 2D hexagonal system doped to near its type-II Van Hove
singularity whose saddle point momenta are not time-reversal-invariant. From
renormalization group analysis and random phase approximation calculations we
show that the dominant superconducting instability induced by weak repulsive
interactions is in the triplet channel (either p+ip or f-wave) because of
strong ferromagnetic fluctuations. Interestingly, the graphenelike one-atom
thick material BC$_3$ can realize such type-II Van Hove singularity by doping
approximately 1/8 electrons per site, where we show that the leading
instability is superconductivity with time-reversal-invariant p+ip pairing
which carries nontrivial Z$_2$ topological invariant. It provides a promising
route to realize a genuine 2D helical p+ip superconductor in Nature.
