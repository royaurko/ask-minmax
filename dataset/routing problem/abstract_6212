Explicit general formulae for the tensor reduction of two-loop massive vacuum
diagrams are presented. The problem of calculating the corresponding
coefficients is shown to be equivalent to the problem of constructing
differential operators (projectors) extracting the coefficients of the momentum
expansion of massive scalar three-point functions (with any number of loops),
so the solution to the latter problem is also given.
