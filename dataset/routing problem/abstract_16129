In this report I discuss physical problems for future Photon Colliders (PLC),
which can be stated AFTER 10 years of work of LHC and few years of work of
e^+e^- ILC. I discuss mainly the unfavorable case when these colliders will
give us only Higgs boson(s) and perhaps some charged particles of unclear
nature. I focus my attention for the case of PLC based on the second stage of
ILC (about 1 TeV) or CLIC (1-3 TeV). It offers opportunity to study new series
of fundamental physical problems. Among them - multiple production of gauge
bosons, hunt for strong interaction in Higgs sector, search of exotic
interactions in the process $\gamma\gamma\to\gamma\gamma$ with final photons
having transverse momenta (0.5 - 0.7)E_e.
