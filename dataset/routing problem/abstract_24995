Let $E$ be a continuum in the closed unit disk $|z|\le 1$ of the complex
$z$-plane which divides the open disk $|z| < 1$ into $n\ge 2$ pairwise
non-intersecting simply connected domains $D_k,$ such that each of the domains
$D_k$ contains some point $a_k$ on a prescribed circle $|z| = \rho, 0 <\rho <1,
k=1,...,n\,. $ It is shown that for some increasing function $\Psi\,$
independent of $E$ and the choice of the points $a_k,$ the mean value of the
harmonic measures $$ \Psi^{-1}\[ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{k} \Psi(\omega(a_k,E,
D_k))] $$ is greater than or equal to the harmonic measure $\omega(\rho, E^*,
D^*)\,,$ where $E^* = \{z: z^n \in [-1,0] \}$ and $D^* =\{z: |z|<1, |{\rm arg}
z| < \pi/n\} \,.$ This implies, for instance, a solution to a problem of R.W.
Barnard, L. Cole, and A. Yu. Solynin concerning a lower estimate of the
quantity $\inf_{E} \max_{k=1,...,n} \omega(a_k,E, D_k)\,$ for arbitrary points
of the circle $|z| = \rho \,.$ These contributors stated this hypothesis in the
particular case when the points are equally distributed on the circle $|z| =
\rho \,.$
