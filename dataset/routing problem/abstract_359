Maximizing network lifetime is a very challenging issue in routing protocol
design for Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs), since mobile nodes are powered by
limited-capacity batteries. Furthermore, replacing or recharging batteries is
often impossible in critical environments (e.g. battlefields, disaster areas,
etc.) The proposed MEA-DSR (Multipath Energy-Aware on Demand Source Routing)
protocol uses a load distribution policy in order to maximize network lifetime.
The simulation results have shown the efficiency of the proposed protocol in
comparison to DSR routing protocol in many difficult scenarios
