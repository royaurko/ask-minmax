To date, the BaBar experiment has stored over 0.7PB of data in an
Objectivity/DB database. Approximately half this data-set comprises simulated
data of which more than 70% has been produced at more than 20 collaborating
institutes outside of SLAC. The operational aspects of managing such a large
data set and providing access to the physicists in a timely manner is a
challenging and complex problem. We describe the operational aspects of
managing such a large distributed data-set as well as importing and exporting
data from geographically spread BaBar collaborators. We also describe problems
common to dealing with such large datasets.
