We derive a formula for the non-coherent wave field propagation in terms of
the Fourier transformation. As a result, we find a theoretical solution of the
inverse problem of image propagation in non-coherent case. However, the
practical solution of the inverse problem in a numerical way leads to rapidly
decreasing SNR. We also discuss origin and behavior of that phenomenon. Some
numerical examples are presented.
