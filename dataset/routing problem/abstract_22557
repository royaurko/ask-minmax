Unified schemes of active galactic nuclei (AGN) require an obscuring dusty
torus around the central source, giving rise to Seyfert 1 line spectrum for
pole-on viewing and Seyfert 2 characteristics in edge-on sources. Although the
observed IR is in broad agreement with this scheme, the behavior of the 10
micron silicate feature and the width of the far-IR emission peak remained
serious problems in all previous modeling efforts. We show that these problems
find a natural explanation if the dust is contained in about 5-10 clouds along
radial rays through the torus. The spectral energy distributions (SED) of both
type 1 and type 2 sources are properly reproduced from different viewpoints of
the same object if the visual optical depth of each cloud is larger than about
60 and the clouds' mean free path increases roughly in proportion to radial
distance.
