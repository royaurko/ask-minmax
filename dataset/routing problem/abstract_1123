The route toward a Bose-Einstein condensate of dipolar molecules requires the
ability to efficiently associate dimers of different chemical species and
transfer them to the stable rovibrational ground state. Here, we report on
recent spectroscopic measurements of two weakly bound molecular levels and
newly observed narrow d-wave Feshbach resonances. The data are used to improve
the collisional model for the Bose-Bose mixture 41K87Rb, among the most
promising candidates to create a molecular dipolar BEC.
