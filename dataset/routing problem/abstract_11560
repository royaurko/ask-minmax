Last three years have seen new developments in the theory of last passage
percolation, which has variety applications to random permutations, random
growth and random vicious walks. It turns out that a few class of models have
determinant formulas for the probability distribution, which can be analyzed
asymptotically. One of the tools for the asymptotic analysis has been the
Riemann-Hilbert method. In this paper, we survey the use of Riemann-Hilbert
method in the last passage percolation problems.
