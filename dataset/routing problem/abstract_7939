In this paper we study existence and regularity of solutions to the
capillarity problem for compressible liquids in a tube. We introduce an
appropriate space of functions of bounded variation, in which the energy
functional recently introduced by Robert Finn can be defined. We prove
existence of a locally Lipschitz minimiser in this class.
