Recently there have been some unexpected results concerning Fuzzy Description
Logics (FDLs) with General Concept Inclusions (GCIs). They show that, unlike
the classical case, the DL ALC with GCIs does not have the finite model
property under Lukasiewicz Logic or Product Logic and, specifically, knowledge
base satisfiability is an undecidable problem for Product Logic. We complete
here the analysis by showing that knowledge base satisfiability is also an
undecidable problem for Lukasiewicz Logic.
