We study the Cauchy problem for the Laplace equation in a cylindrical domain
with data on a part of it's boundary which is a cross-section of the cylinder.
On reducing the problem to the Cauchy problem for the wave equation in a
complex domain and using hyperbolic theory we obtain explicit formulas for the
solution, thus developing the classical approach of Hans Lewy (1927).
