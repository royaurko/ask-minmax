The notions of fractal and essentially fractal algebras of approximation
sequences and of the Arveson dichotomy have proved extremely useful for several
spectral approximation problems. The purpose of this short note is threefold:
to present a short new proof of the fractal restriction theorem, to relate
essential fractality with Arveson dichotomy, and to derive a restriction
theorem for essential fractality.
