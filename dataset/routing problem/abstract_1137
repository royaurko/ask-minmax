We study the hierarchical structuring of islands of stable periodic
oscillations inside chaotic regions in phase diagrams of single-mode
semiconductor lasers with optical injection. Phase diagrams display remarkable
{\it accumulation horizons}: boundaries formed by the accumulation of infinite
cascades of self-similar islands of periodic solutions of ever-increasing
period. Each cascade follows a specific period-adding route. The riddling of
chaotic laser phases by such networks of periodic solutions may compromise
applications operating with chaotic signals such as e.g. secure communications.
