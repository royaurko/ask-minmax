This paper makes certain observations regarding some conjectures of Milnor
and Ramakrishnan in hyperbolic geometry and algebraic K-theory. As a
consequence of our observations, we obtain new results and conjectures
regarding the rationality and irrationality of Chern-Simons invariants of
hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
