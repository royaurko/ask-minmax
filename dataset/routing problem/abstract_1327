Network steganography conceals the transfer of sensitive information within
unobtrusive data in computer networks. So-called micro protocols are
communication protocols placed within the payload of a network steganographic
transfer. They enrich this transfer with features such as reliability, dynamic
overlay routing, or performance optimization --- just to mention a few. We
present different design approaches for the embedding of hidden channels with
micro protocols in digitized audio signals under consideration of different
requirements. On the basis of experimental results, our design approaches are
compared, and introduced into a protocol engineering approach for micro
protocols.
