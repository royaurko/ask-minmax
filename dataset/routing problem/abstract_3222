We present a reduction of the termination problem for a Turing machine (in
the simplified form of the Post correspondence problem) to the problem of
determining whether a continuous-time Markov chain presented as a set of Kappa
graph-rewriting rules has an equilibrium. It follows that the problem of
whether a computable CTMC is dissipative (ie does not have an equilibrium) is
undecidable.
