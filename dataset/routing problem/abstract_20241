We prove a free probability analog of a result of
Artstein-Bally-Barthez-Naor. In particualar we prove that if X_{1},X_{2},...
are freely independent identically distributed random variables, then the free
entropy chi(X_{1}+...+X_{n}/\sqrt{n}) is monotone increasing for all n. Our
proof also leads to a slight simplification of the original argument in the
classical case.
