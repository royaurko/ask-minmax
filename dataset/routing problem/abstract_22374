We investigate the discrete Sturm-Liouville equations. In the present
situation, the right hand side of the equation does not give rise to a positive
definite quadratic form and we use instead the left hand side to define such a
form. We prove in this paper that this form determines a Hilbert space (such
problems are called left-definite).
