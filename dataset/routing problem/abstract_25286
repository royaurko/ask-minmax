The suggestion that we occupy a privileged position near the centre of a
large, nonlinear, and nearly spherical void has recently attracted much
attention as an alternative to dark energy. Putting aside the philosophical
problems with this scenario, we perform the most complete and up-to-date
comparison with cosmological data. We use supernovae and the full cosmic
microwave background spectrum as the basis of our analysis. We also include
constraints from radial baryonic acoustic oscillations, the local Hubble rate,
age, big bang nucleosynthesis, the Compton y-distortion, and for the first time
include the local amplitude of matter fluctuations, \sigma_8. These all paint a
consistent picture in which voids are in severe tension with the data. In
particular, void models predict a very low local Hubble rate, suffer from an
"old age problem", and predict much less local structure than is observed.
