We recently showed that rotation significantly affects most observable
Cepheid quantities, and that rotation, in combination with the evolutionary
status of the star, can resolve the long-standing Cepheid mass discrepancy
problem. We therefore provide a brief overview of our results regarding the
problem of Cepheid masses. We also briefly mention the impact of rotation on
the Cepheid period-luminosity(-color) relation, which is crucial for
determining extragalactic distances, and thus for calibrating the Hubble
constant.
