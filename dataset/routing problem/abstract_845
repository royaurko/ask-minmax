Theoretical investigations of different routes to coherent perfect
polarization rotation illustrate its phenomenological connection with coherent
perfect absorption. Studying systems with broken parity, layering, combined
Faraday rotation and optical activity, or a rotator-loaded optical cavity
highlights their similarity and suggests new approaches to improving and
miniaturizing optical devices.
