Multidimensionality of our Universe is one of the most intriguing assumption
in modern physics. It follows naturally from theories unifying different
fundamental interactions with gravity, e.g. M/string theory. The idea has
received a great deal of renewed attention over the last few years. However, it
also brings a row of additional questions. According to observations the
internal space should be static or nearly static at least from the time of
primordial nucleosynthesis, otherwise the fundamental physical constants would
vary. This means that at the present evolutionary stage of the Universe there
are two possibilities: slow variation or compactification of internal space
scale parameters. In many recent studies the problem of extra dimensions
stabilization was studied for so-called ADD. Under these approaches a massive
scalar fields (gravitons or radions) of external space-time can be presented as
conformal excitations. In above mentioned works it was assumed that
multidimensional action to be linear with respect to curvature. Although as
follows from string theory, the gravity action needs to be extended to
nonlinear one. In order to investigate effects of nonlinearity, in this Thesis
a multidimensional Lagrangian will be studied, having the form L = f(R), where
f(R) is an arbitrary smooth function of the scalar curvature.
