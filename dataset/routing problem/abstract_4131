During the last years several ant-based techniques were involved to solve
hard and complex optimization problems. The current paper is a short study
about the influence of artificial ant species in solving optimization problems.
There are studied the artificial Pharaoh Ants, Lasius Niger and also artificial
ants with no special specificity used commonly in Ant Colony Optimization.
