In this paper, a framework is presented for node distribution with respect to
density, network connectivity and communication time. According to modeled
framework we evaluate and compare the performance of three routing protocols;
Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and
Fisheye State Routing (FSR) in MANETs and VANETs using two Mac-layer protocols;
802.11 and 802.11p. We have further modified these protocols by changing their
routing information exchange intervals; MOD AODV, MOD DSR and MOD FSR. A
comprehensive simulation work is performed in NS-2 for the comparison of these
routing protocols for varying mobilities and scalabilities of nodes. To
evaluate their efficiency; throughput, End-to-End Delay (E2ED) and Normalized
Routing Load (NRL) of these protocols are taken into account as performance
parameters. After extensive simulations, we observe that AODV outperforms both
with MANETs and VANETs.
