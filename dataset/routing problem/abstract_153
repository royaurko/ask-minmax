In This paper we present a genetic algorithm for the multi-pickup and
delivery problem with time windows (m-PDPTW). The m-PDPTW is an optimization
vehicles routing problem which must meet requests for transport between
suppliers and customers satisfying precedence, capacity and time constraints.
This paper purposes a brief literature review of the PDPTW, present our
approach based on genetic algorithms to minimizing the total travel distance
and thereafter the total travel cost, by showing that an encoding represents
the parameters of each individual.
