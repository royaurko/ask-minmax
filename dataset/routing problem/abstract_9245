The study is motivated by the known fact that, in the noncompact case, the
main minimum-problem of the theory of interior capacities of condensers in a
locally compact space is in general unsolvable, and this occurs even under very
natural assumptions (e.g., for the Newton, Green, or Riesz kernels in an
Euclidean space and closed condensers). Therefore it was particularly
interesting to find statements of variational problems dual to the main
minimum-problem (and hence providing some new equivalent definitions of the
capacity), but always solvable (e.g., even for nonclosed condensers). For all
positive definite kernels satisfying B. Fuglede's condition of consistency
between the strong and vague topologies, problems with the desired properties
are posed and solved. Their solutions provide a natural generalization of the
well-known notion of interior capacitary distributions associated with a set.
We give a description of those solutions, establish statements on their
uniqueness and continuity, and point out their characteristic properties. A
condenser is treated as a finite collection of arbitrary sets with sing +1 or
-1 prescribed, such that the closures of opposite-signed sets are mutually
disjoint.
