In this paper we are concerned with a initial boundary-value problem for a
coupled system of two KdV equations, posed on the positive half line, under the
effect of a localized damping term. The model arises when modeling the
propagation of long waves generated by a wave maker in a channel. It is shown
that the solutions of the system are exponential stable and globally well-posed
in the weighted space $L^2(e^{2bx}dx)$ for $b>0$. The stabilization problem is
studied using a Lyapunov approach while the well-posedness result is obtained
combining fixed point arguments and energy type estimates.
