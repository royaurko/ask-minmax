Modal dependence logic was introduced recently by V\"a\"an\"anen. It enhances
the basic modal language by an operator =(). For propositional variables
p_1,...,p_n, =(p_1,...,p_(n-1);p_n) intuitively states that the value of p_n is
determined by those of p_1,...,p_(n-1). Sevenster (J. Logic and Computation,
2009) showed that satisfiability for modal dependence logic is complete for
nondeterministic exponential time. In this paper we consider fragments of modal
dependence logic obtained by restricting the set of allowed propositional
connectives. We show that satisfibility for poor man's dependence logic, the
language consisting of formulas built from literals and dependence atoms using
conjunction, necessity and possibility (i.e., disallowing disjunction), remains
NEXPTIME-complete. If we only allow monotone formulas (without negation, but
with disjunction), the complexity drops to PSPACE-completeness. We also extend
V\"a\"an\"anen's language by allowing classical disjunction besides dependence
disjunction and show that the satisfiability problem remains NEXPTIME-complete.
If we then disallow both negation and dependence disjunction, satistiability is
complete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. In this way we
completely classify the computational complexity of the satisfiability problem
for all restrictions of propositional and dependence operators considered by
V\"a\"an\"anen and Sevenster.
