Many exact search algorithms for NP-hard graph problems adopt the old
Davis-Putman branch-and-reduce paradigm. The performance of these algorithms
often suffers from the increasing number of graph modifications, such as
vertex/edge deletions, that reduce the problem instance and have to be "taken
back" frequently during the search process. We investigate practical
implementation-based aspects of exact graph algorithms by providing a simple
hybrid graph representation that trades space for time to address the said
take-back challenge. Experiments on three well studied problems show consistent
significant improvements over classical methods.
