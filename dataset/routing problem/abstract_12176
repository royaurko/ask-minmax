We discuss two generalizations of the inverse problem of the calculus of
variations, one in which a given mechanical system can be brought into the form
of Lagrangian equations with non-conservative forces of a generalized Rayleigh
dissipation type, the other leading to Lagrangian equations with so-called
gyroscopic forces. Our approach focusses primarily on obtaining coordinate-free
conditions for the existence of a suitable non-singular multiplier matrix,
which will lead to an equivalent representation of a given system of
second-order equations as one of these Lagrangian systems with non-conservative
forces.
