We extend a model of the Dirac gauginos, which originate from N=2
supersymmetry (SUSY) for the gauge sector, such that the N=2 SUSY is imposed
also to the sfermion sector but only for the 3rd generation squarks and
sleptons. In addition to the N=2 supersymmetry, our model is constructed based
on the SU(3)c times SU(3)L times U(1)' gauge symmetry. By this extension, the
dominant source of radiative correction to the Higgs mass squared coming from
the stop loop becomes controllable based on the enhanced symmetry. Then it
becomes a viable model which provides a solution to the little hierarchy
problem in SUSY models. Even in the original scenario, the Dirac gauginos can
be superheavy, of order 10 TeV or so, while keeping the scalar masses at the
weak scale. This possibility is phenomenologically interesting because it can
suppress the unwanted flavor changing processes. And in scope of the LHC, this
scenario can have a very distinct signature related to the exotic sfermions
which are accompanied as the N=2 superpartners as well as the Dirac gauginos.
