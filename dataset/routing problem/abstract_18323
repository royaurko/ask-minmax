The Weighted Vertex Integrity (wVI) problem takes as input an $n$-vertex
graph $G$, a weight function $w:V(G)\to\mathbb{N}$, and an integer $p$. The
task is to decide if there exists a set $X\subseteq V(G)$ such that the weight
of $X$ plus the weight of a heaviest component of $G-X$ is at most $p$. Among
other results, we prove that:
  (1) wVI is NP-complete on co-comparability graphs, even if each vertex has
weight $1$;
  (2) wVI can be solved in $O(p^{p+1}n)$ time;
  (3) wVI admits a kernel with at most $p^3$ vertices.
  Result (1) refutes a conjecture by Ray and Deogun and answers an open
question by Ray et al. It also complements a result by Kratsch et al., stating
that the unweighted version of the problem can be solved in polynomial time on
co-comparability graphs of bounded dimension, provided that an intersection
model of the input graph is given as part of the input.
  An instance of the Weighted Component Order Connectivity (wCOC) problem
consists of an $n$-vertex graph $G$, a weight function $w:V(G)\to \mathbb{N}$,
and two integers $k$ and $l$, and the task is to decide if there exists a set
$X\subseteq V(G)$ such that the weight of $X$ is at most $k$ and the weight of
a heaviest component of $G-X$ is at most $l$. In some sense, the wCOC problem
can be seen as a refined version of the wVI problem. We prove, among other
results, that:
  (4) wCOC can be solved in $O(\min\{k,l\}\cdot n^3)$ time on interval graphs,
while the unweighted version can be solved in $O(n^2)$ time on this graph
class;
  (5) wCOC is W[1]-hard on split graphs when parameterized by $k$ or by $l$;
  (6) wCOC can be solved in $2^{O(k\log l)} n$ time;
  (7) wCOC admits a kernel with at most $kl(k+l)+k$ vertices.
  We also show that result (6) is essentially tight by proving that wCOC cannot
be solved in $2^{o(k \log l)}n^{O(1)}$ time, unless the ETH fails.
