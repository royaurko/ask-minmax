The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the most famous optimization
problems. Greedy crossover designed by Greffenstette et al, can be used while
Symmetric TSP (STSP) is resolved by Genetic Algorithm (GA). Researchers have
proposed several versions of greedy crossover. Here we propose improved version
of it. We compare our greedy crossover with some of recent crossovers, we use
our greedy crossover and some recent crossovers in GA then compare crossovers
on speed and accuracy.
