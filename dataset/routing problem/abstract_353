In this paper, we compare problems of cluster formation and cluster-head
selection between different protocols for data aggregation and transmission. We
focus on two aspects of the problem: (i) how to guess number of clusters
required to proficiently consume available sources for a sensor network, and
(ii) how to select number of cluster-heads to cover up sensor networks more
proficiently. A sensor in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) can communicate
directly only with other sensors that are within a radio range in a cluster.
However, in order to enable communication between sensors not within
communication range, they must form new clusters in distributed sensors.
Several clustering algorithms such as LEACH, DEEC, and SEP have been proposed
with the objectives of energy minimization, route-path selection, increased
connectivity and network longevity. LEACH protocol and the similar ones assume
an energy homogeneous system where a node is not likely to fail due to failure
in connectivity and packet dropping. More recent protocols like SEP and TEEN
considered the reverse that is energy heterogeneity which is more applicable to
case of WSNs. We developed a bi-dimensional chain model to select average
number of for DEEC. Simulation results are used to compare performance of
different protocols to found optimal solutions of above mentioned problems.
