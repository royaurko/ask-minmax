The direct problem of the detection of the Earth's absolute gravitation
potential maximum value (MGP) was solved. The inverse problem finding of the
Earth maximum gravitation (where there is a maximum of gravitation field
intensity and a potential function has a 'bending point') with the help of MGP
was solved as well. The obtained results show that the revealed Earth maximum
gravitation coincides quite strictly with the cseismic D" layer on the border
of the inner and outer (liquid) core. The validity of the method of an absolute
gravitation potential detection by the equal- potential velocity was proved as
'gravitation potential measurement' or 'Vs-gravity method'. The prospects of
this method for detecting of low-power or distant geological objects with
abnormal density and the possible earthquakes with low density was shown.
