Kelner, Orecchia, Sidford, and Zhu have given a randomized iterative method
for approximating the solution to the discrete Laplace equation that has
expected running time nearly linear in the size of the problem. The goal of
this note is to explain this algorithm in the language of difference operators
on graphs.
