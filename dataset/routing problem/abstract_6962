We study the martingale problem associated with the operator $L u =
\partial_s u + 1/2 \sum_{i,j=1}^{d_0} a^{ij} \partial_{ij} u + \sum_{i,j=1}^d
B^{ij} x^j \partial_i u$, where $d_0 \leq d$. We show that the martingale
problem is well-posed when the function $a$ is continuous and strictly
positive-definite on $\bb R^{d_0}$ and the matrix $B$ takes a particular
lower-diagonal, block form. We then localize this result to show that the
martingale problem remains well-posed when $B$ is replaced by a sufficiently
smooth vector field whose Jacobian matrix satisfies a nondegeneracy condition.
