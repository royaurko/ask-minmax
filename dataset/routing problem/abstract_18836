In this paper we construct a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for the
problem where a set of users is interested in gaining access to a common file,
but where each has only partial knowledge of the file. We further assume the
existence of another set of terminals in the system, called helpers, who are
not interested in the common file, but who are willing to help the users. Given
that the collective information of all the terminals is sufficient to allow
recovery of the entire file, the goal is to minimize the (weighted) sum of bits
that these terminals need to exchange over a noiseless public channel in order
achieve this goal. Based on established connections to the multi-terminal
secrecy problem, our algorithm also implies a polynomial-time method for
constructing the largest shared secret key in the presence of an eavesdropper.
We consider the following side-information settings: (i) side-information in
the form of uncoded packets of the file, where the terminals' side-information
consists of subsets of the file; (ii) side-information in the form of linearly
correlated packets, where the terminals have access to linear combinations of
the file packets; and (iii) the general setting where the the terminals'
side-information has an arbitrary (i.i.d.) correlation structure. We provide a
polynomial-time algorithm (in the number of terminals) that finds the optimal
rate allocations for these terminals, and then determines an explicit optimal
transmission scheme for cases (i) and (ii).
