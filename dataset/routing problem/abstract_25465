We derive an asymptotic expansion for a Wiener-Hopf determinant arising in
the problem of counting one-dimensional free fermions on a line segment at zero
temperature. This expansion is an extension of the result in the theory of
Toeplitz and Wiener-Hopf determinants known as the generalized Fisher-Hartwig
conjecture. The coefficients of this expansion are conjectured to obey certain
periodicity relations, which renders the expansion explicitly periodic in the
"counting parameter". We present two methods to calculate these coefficients
and verify the periodicity relations order by order: the matrix Riemann-Hilbert
problem and the Painleve V equation. We show that the expansion coefficients
are polynomials in the counting parameter and list explicitly first several
coefficients.
