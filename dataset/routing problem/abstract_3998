We consider a somehow peculiar Token/Bucket problem which at first sight
looks confusing and difficult to solve. The winning approach to solve the
problem consists in going back to the simple and traditional methods to solve
computer science problems like the one taught to us by Knuth. Somehow the main
trick is to be able to specify clearly what needs to be achieved, and then the
solution, even if complex, appears almost by itself.
