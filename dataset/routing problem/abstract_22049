We prove a cohomological property for a class of finite $p$-groups introduced
earlier by M. Y. Xu, which we call semi-abelian $p$-groups. This result implies
that a semi-abelian $p$-group has non-inner automorphisms of order $p$, which
settles a longstanding problem for this class. We answer also, independetly, an
old question of M. Y. Xu about the power structure of semi-abelian $p$-groups.
