In this paper we prove existence of (viscosity) solutions of Dirichlet
problems concerning fully nonlinear elliptic operator, which are either
degenerate or singular when the gradient of the solution is zero. For this
class of operators it is possible to extend the concept of eigenvalue, this
paper concerns the cases when the inf of the principal eigenvalues is positive
i.e. when both the maximum and the minimum principle holds.
