In this work, we propose a robust and easily implemented algebraic multigrid
method as a stand-alone solver or a preconditioner in Krylov subspace methods
for solving either symmetric and positive definite or saddle point linear
systems of equations arising from the finite element discretization of the
vector Laplacian problem, linear elasticity problem in pure displacement and
mixed displacement-pressure form, and Stokes problem in mixed velocity-pressure
form in 3D, respectively. We use hierarchical quadratic basis functions to
construct the finite element spaces. A new heuristic algebraic coarsening
strategy is introduced for construction of the hierarchical coarse system
matrices. We focus on numerical study of the mesh-independence robustness of
the algebraic multigrid and the algebraic multigrid preconditioned Krylov
subspace methods.
