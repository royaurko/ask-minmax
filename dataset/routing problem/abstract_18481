Assuming string theorists will not soon provide a compelling case for the
primary theory underlying particle physics, the field will proceed as it has
historically: with data stimulating and testing ideas. Ideally the soft
supersymmetry breaking Lagrangian will be measured and its patterns will point
to the underlying theory. But there are two new problems. First a matter of
principle: the theory may be simplest at distance scales and in numbers of
dimensions where direct experiments are not possible. Second a practical
problem: in the foreseeable future (with mainly hadron collider data) too few
observables can be measured to lead to direct connections between experiment
and theory. In this paper we discuss and study these issues and consider ways
to circumvent the problems, studying models to test methods. We propose a
semi-quantitative method for focusing and sharpening thinking when trying to
relate incomplete data to incomplete theory, as will probably be necessary.
