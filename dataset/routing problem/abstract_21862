Erd\H{o}s-Kac theorem is a celebrated result in number theory which says that
the number of distinct prime factors of a uniformly chosen random integer
satisfies a central limit theorem. In this paper, we establish the large
deviations and moderate deviations for this problem in a very general setting
for a wide class of additive functions.
