We prove an implicit function theorem and an inverse function theorem for
free noncommutative functions over operator spaces and on the set of nilpotent
matrices. We apply these results to study dependence of the solution of the
initial value problem for ODEs in noncommutative spaces on the initial data and
to extremal problems with noncommutative constraints.
