The nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger (NLS) equation is a ubiquitous example of an
envelope wave equation for conservative, dispersive systems. We revisit here
the problem of self-similar focusing of waves in the case of the focusing NLS
equation through the prism of a dynamic renormalization technique (MN dynamics)
that factors out self-similarity and yields a bifurcation view of the onset of
focusing. As a result, identifying the focusing self-similar solution becomes a
steady state problem. The discretized steady states are subsequently obtained
and their linear stability is numerically examined. The calculations are
performed in the setting of variable index of refraction, in which the onset of
focusing appears as a supercritical bifurcation of a novel type of mixed
Hamiltonian-dissipative dynamical system (reminiscent, to some extent, of a
pitchfork bifurcation).
