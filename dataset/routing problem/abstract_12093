This paper considers a key agreement problem in which two parties aim to
agree on a key by exchanging messages in the presence of adversarial tampering.
The aim of the adversary is to disrupt the key agreement process, but there are
no secrecy constraints (i.e. we do not insist that the key is kept secret from
the adversary). The main results of the paper are coding schemes and bounds on
maximum key generation rates for this problem.
