The energy disaggregation problem is recovering device level power
consumption signals from the aggregate power consumption signal for a building.
We show in this paper how the disaggregation problem can be reformulated as an
adaptive filtering problem. This gives both a novel disaggregation algorithm
and a better theoretical understanding for disaggregation. In particular, we
show how the disaggregation problem can be solved online using a filter bank
and discuss its optimality.
