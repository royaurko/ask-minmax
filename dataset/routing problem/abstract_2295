The past several years has witnessed a surge of interest in organometallic
trihalide perovskites, which are at the heart of the new generation of
solid-state solar cells. Here, we calculated the static conductivity of charged
domain walls in n- and p- doped organometallic uniaxial ferroelectric
semiconductor perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD)
theory. We find that due to the charge carrier accumulation, the static
conductivity may drastically increase at the domain wall by 3-4 orders of
magnitude in comparison with conductivity through the bulk of the material.
Also, a two-dimensional degenerated gas of highly mobile charge carriers could
be formed at the wall. The high values of conductivity at domain walls and
interfaces explain high efficiency in organometallic solution-processed
perovskite films which contains lots of different point and extended defects.
These results could suggest new routes to enhance the performance of this
promising class of novel photovoltaic materials.
