There has been sufficient observational indication suggesting a causal
connection between the binary history of neutron stars and the evolution of
their magnetic field. In particular, it is believed that the generation of the
low-field millisecond pulsars is a consequence of the processing of normal
high-field neutron stars in binary systems. We try to understand the mechanism
of field evolution in neutron stars that are members of binary systems with an
aim to understand the problem of millisecond pulsar generation. To this end we
have looked at four related problems : i. the effect of diamagnetic screening
on the final field of a neutron star accreting material from its binary
companion; ii. evolution of magnetic flux located in the crust of an accreting
neutron star; iii. application of the above-mentioned model to real systems and
a comparison with observations; iv. an investigation into the consequences of
magnetic flux being initially located in the core of the star and its
observational implications.
