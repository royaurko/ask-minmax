We show the necessity for a new approach towards comprehensive and consistent
simulations of the propagation of galactic cosmic rays. Our developments are
optimised for addressing the spatially 3-dimensional inhomogeneous diffusion
problem and utilise contemporary numerical methods. We aim to address the
transport problem in a full 3-dimensional environment. For that, we test the
transition from 2D to 3D simulation results within an existing propagation
code. We present sub-kpc scale simulations that allow the investigation of
small- scale structures regarding different model conditions such as variety
regarding non-axisymmetric cosmic ray source distributions. These results are
discussed critically and motivate our development of a new transport code for
galactic cosmic rays. The capabilities of this code are outlined.
