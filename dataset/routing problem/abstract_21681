We study the existence of nonradial sign-changing solutions to the
Schroedinger-Poisson system in dimension N>=3. We construct nonradial
sign-changing multi-peak solutions whose peaks are displaced in suitable
symmetric configurations and collapse to the same point. The proof is based on
the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction.
