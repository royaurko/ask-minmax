For boolean quadratic programming (BQP), we will show that there is no
duality gap between the primal and dual problems under some conditions by using
the classical Lagrangian duality. A benchmark generator is given to create
random BQP problems which can be solved in polynomial time. Several numerical
examples are generated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
