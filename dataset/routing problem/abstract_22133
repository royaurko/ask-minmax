A method for obtaining discretization formulas for the derivatives of a
function is presented, which relies on a generalization of divided differences.
These modified divided differences essentially correspond to a change of the
dependent variable. This method is applied to the numerical solution of the
eigenvalue problem for the two-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation, where
standard methods converge very slowly while the approach proposed here gives
accurate results.
