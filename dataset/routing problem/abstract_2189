Colloidal particles dispersed in liquid crystals can form new materials with
tunable elastic and electro-optic properties. In a periodic `blue phase' host,
particles should template into colloidal crystals with potential uses in
photonics, metamaterials, and transformational optics. Here we show by computer
simulation that colloid/cholesteric mixtures can give rise to regular crystals,
glasses, percolating gels, isolated clusters, twisted rings and undulating
colloidal ropes. This structure can be tuned via particle concentration, and by
varying the surface interactions of the cholesteric host with both the
particles and confining walls. Many of these new materials are metastable: two
or more structures can arise under identical thermodynamic conditions. The
observed structure depends not only on the formulation protocol, but also on
the history of an applied electric field. This new class of soft materials
should thus be relevant to design of switchable, multistable devices for
optical technologies such as smart glass and e-paper.
