In models with TeV-scale gravity it is expected that mini black holes will be
produced in near-future accelerators. On the other hand, TeV-scale gravity is
plagued with many problems like fast proton decay, unacceptably large
neutron-antineutron oscillations, flavor changing neutral currents, large
mixing between leptons, etc. Most of these problems can be solved if different
fermions are localized at different points in the extra dimensions. We study
the cross-section for the production of black holes and their angular momentum
distribution in these models with "split" fermions. We find that, for a fixed
value of the fundamental mass scale, the total production cross section is
reduced compared with models where all the fermions are localized at the same
point in the extra dimensions. Fermion splitting also implies that the bulk
component of the black hole angular momentum must be taken into account in
studies of the black hole decay via Hawking radiation.
