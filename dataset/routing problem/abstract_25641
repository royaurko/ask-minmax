Aims. The intensity profiles of the C_2 Swan bands in cool DQ white dwarfs
cannot be adequately fitted with models that otherwise succesfully reproduce
spectral features of the molecule CH in these stars. Initial modelling showed
that a two-component atmosphere in the style of a spot might be able to solve
the problem.
  Methods. We photometrically observed the two cool DQ white dwarfs GJ1117 and
EGGR78 to search for variability caused by stellar spots.
  Results. We have not found any such variability, but we estimate the effects
of hypothetical spots on lightcurves. We also estimate detection probabilities
for spots in different configurations. Alternative explanations of the problem
are needed and briefly discussed.
