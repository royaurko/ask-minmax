A model for holographic dark energy is proposed, following the idea that the
short distance cut-off is related to the infrared cut-off. We assume that the
infrared cut-off relevant to the dark energy is the size of the event horizon.
With the input $\Omega_\Lambda=0.73$, we predict the equation of state of the
dark energy at the present time be characterized by $w=-0.90$. The cosmic
coincidence problem can be resolved by inflation in our scenario, provided we
assume the minimal number of e-folds.
