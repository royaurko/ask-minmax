Anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking in the context of 4D conformally
sequestered models is combined with Poppitz-Trivedi D-type gauge-mediation. The
implementation of the two mediation mechanisms naturally leads to visible soft
masses at the same scale so that they can cooperatively solve the mu and flavor
problems of weak scale supersymmetry, as well as the tachyonic slepton problem
of pure anomaly-mediation. The tools are developed in a modular fashion for
more readily fitting into the general program of optimizing supersymmetric
dynamics in hunting for the most attractive weak scale phenomenologies combined
with Planck-scale plausibility.
