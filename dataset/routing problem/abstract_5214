In this letter, we study the robust beamforming problem for the multi-antenna
wireless broadcasting system with simultaneous information and power
transmission, under the assumption of imperfect channel state information (CSI)
at the transmitter. Following the worst-case deterministic model, our objective
is to maximize the worst-case harvested energy for the energy receiver while
guaranteeing that the rate for the information receiver is above a threshold
for all possible channel realizations. Such problem is nonconvex with infinite
number of constraints. Using certain transformation techniques, we convert this
problem into a relaxed semidefinite programming problem (SDP) which can be
solved efficiently. We further show that the solution of the relaxed SDP
problem is always rank-one. This indicates that the relaxation is tight and we
can get the optimal solution for the original problem. Simulation results are
presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
