Crowdsourcing can solve problems that current fully automated systems cannot.
Its effectiveness depends on the reliability, accuracy, and speed of the crowd
workers that drive it. These objectives are frequently at odds with one
another. For instance, how much time should workers be given to discover and
propose new solutions versus deliberate over those currently proposed? How do
we determine if discovering a new answer is appropriate at all? And how do we
manage workers who lack the expertise or attention needed to provide useful
input to a given task? We present a mechanism that uses distinct payoffs for
three possible worker actions---propose,vote, or abstain---to provide workers
with the necessary incentives to guarantee an effective (or even optimal)
balance between searching for new answers, assessing those currently available,
and, when they have insufficient expertise or insight for the task at hand,
abstaining. We provide a novel game theoretic analysis for this mechanism and
test it experimentally on an image---labeling problem and show that it allows a
system to reliably control the balance betweendiscovering new answers and
converging to existing ones.
