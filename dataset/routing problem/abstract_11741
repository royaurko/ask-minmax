The paper deals with a mixed boundary value problem for the Stokes system in
a polyhedral cone. Here different boundary conditions (in particular,
Dirichlet, Neumann, free surface conditions) are prescribed on the sides of the
polyhedron. The contributors obtain regularity results for weak solutions in
weighted $L_2$ Sobolev spaces and prove point estimates of Green's matrix.
