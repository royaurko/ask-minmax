Motivated by low energy consumption in geographic routing in wireless
networks, there has been recent interest in determining bounds on the length of
edges in the Delaunay graph of randomly distributed points. Asymptotic results
are known for random networks in planar domains. In this paper, we obtain upper
and lower bounds that hold with parametric probability in any dimension, for
points distributed uniformly at random in domains with and without boundary.
The results obtained are asymptotically tight for all relevant values of such
probability and constant number of dimensions, and show that the overhead
produced by boundary nodes in the plane holds also for higher dimensions. To
our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study on the lengths of long
edges in Delaunay graphs
