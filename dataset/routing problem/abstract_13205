A thin water film on a cleaved mica substrate undergoes a first order phase
transition between two values of film thickness. By inducing a finite
evaporation rate of the water, the interface between the two phases develops a
fingering instability similar to that observed in the Saffman-Taylor problem.
We draw the connection between the two problems, and construct solutions
describing the dynamics of evaporation in this system.
