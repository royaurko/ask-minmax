Given an orthogonal lattice with mesh length h on a bounded convex domain, we
propose to approximate the Aleksandrov solution of the Monge-Ampere equation by
regularizing the data and discretizing the equation in a subdomain using the
standard finite difference method. The Dirichlet data is used to approximate
the solution in the remaining part of the domain. We prove the uniform
convergence on compact subsets of the solution of the discrete problems to an
approximate problem on the subdomain. The result explains the behavior of
methods based on the standard finite difference method and designed to
numerically converge to non-smooth solutions. We propose an algorithm which for
smooth solutions appears faster than the popular Newton's method with a high
accuracy for non smooth solutions. The convergence of the algorithm is
independent of how close to the numerical solution the initial guess is, upon
rescaling the equation and given a user's measure of the closeness of an
initial guess.
