Single-peaked elections have been attracting much attention recently. It
turned out that many NP-hard voting problems become polynomial-time solvable
when restricted to single-peaked elections. A natural generalization of the
single-peaked elections is the k-peaked elections, where at most k peaks are
allowed in each vote in the election. In this paper, we mainly aim at
establishing a complexity dichotomy of controlling behaviors of a variant of
the sincere-strategy preference-based approval voting in k-peaked elections for
different values of k. It turns out that most NP-hardness results in the
general case also hold in k-peaked elections, even for k=2,3. On the other
hand, we derive polynomial-time algorithms for certain sincere-strategy
preference-based approval voting control problems for k=2. In addition, we also
study the sincere-strategy preference-based approval control problems from the
viewpoint of parameterized complexity and prove some FPT and W-hardness
results.
