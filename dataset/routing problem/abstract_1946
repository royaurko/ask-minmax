We demonstrate that the dynamics towards and within the Feigenbaum attractor
combine to form a q-deformed statistical-mechanical construction. The rate at
which ensemble trajectories converge to the attractor (and to the repellor) is
described by a q-entropy obtained from a partition function generated by
summing distances between neighboring positions of the attractor. The values of
the q-indices involved are given by the unimodal map universal constants, while
the thermodynamic structure is closely related to that formerly developed for
multifractals. As an essential component in our demonstration we expose, at a
previously unknown level of detail, the features of the dynamics of
trajectories that either evolve towards the Feigenbaum attractor or are
captured by its matching repellor. The dynamical properties of the family of
periodic superstable cycles in unimodal maps are seen to be key ingredients for
the comprehension of the discrete scale invariance features present at the
period-doubling transition to chaos. We make clear the dynamical origin of the
anomalous thermodynamic framework existing at the Feigenbaum attractor.
