Morse Theory on Banach spaces would be a useful tool in nonlinear analysis
but its development is hindered by many technical problems. In this paper we
present an approach based on a new notion of generalized functions called
\textquotedblleft ultrafunctions\textquotedblright\ which solves some of the
technical questions involved.
