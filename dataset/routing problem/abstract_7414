In this paper, for the Helmholtz transmission eigenvalue problem, we propose
a new equivalent weak formulation which is actually a nonselfadjoint linear
eigenvalue problem. Based on this weak formulation we give a finite element
discretization with good algebraic structure and prove the error estimates of
the numerical eigenvalues. We also apply the two-grid discretization to the
nonselfadjoint eigenvalue problem. Finally the numerical results confirm the
theoretical analysis and show that the methods presented in this paper are very
efficient.
