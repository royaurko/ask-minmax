The thesis consists of four main chapters. In Ch.2 we discuss experimental
results concerning the scaling behavior and fractality of fracture surfaces. In
Ch.3 continuum and discrete models for fracture mechanics are reviewed and
partially extended. In Ch.4 we present numerical results for a finite size
scaling of the macroscopic fracture stress in the absence of any disorder in
the material. We discuss in Ch.5, the main chapter, the technological important
problem of hydraulic fracturing of heterogeneous solids. We have performed
intensive computer simulations on this problem and discuss the conditions under
which the resulting cracks may develop fractal patterns. We also determine the
opening volume of the crack and the elastic stress field in the bulk,
quantities that are accessible experimentally. postscript file 'ft_phd93.ps.gz'
