The aim of this paper is to study properties of sections of convex bodies
with respect to different types of measures. We present a formula connecting
the Minkowski functional of a convex symmetric body K with the measure of its
sections. We apply this formula to study properties of general measures most of
which were known before only in the case of the standard Lebesgue measure. We
solve an analog of the Busemann-Petty problem for the case of general measures.
In addition, we show that there are measures, for which the answer to the
generalized Busemann-Petty problem is affirmative in all dimensions. Finally,
we apply the latter fact to prove a number of different inequalities concerning
the volume of sections of convex symmetric bodies in $\R^n$ and solve a version
of generalized Busemann-Petty problem for sections by k-dimensional subspaces.
