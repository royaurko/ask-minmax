We explain what is the challenge of light-front quantisation, and how we can
now answer it because of recent progress in solving the problem of zero modes
in the case of non-Abelian gauge theories. We also give a description of the
light-front Hamiltonian for SU(2) finite volume gluodynamics resulting from
this recent solution to the problem of light-front zero modes.
