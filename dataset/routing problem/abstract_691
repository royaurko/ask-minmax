Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) simulations were used to
investigate an influence of electric field, parallel to single and multilayer
graphene on its electron dispersion relations close to K point. It was shown
that for both single layer and AAAA stacking multilayer graphene under
influence of parallel field the dispersion relations transform to nonlinear.
The effect, associated with the hexagonal symmetry breaking, opens new route to
high speed transistors and logical devices working in Dirac regime. The
implementation of such device is presented.
