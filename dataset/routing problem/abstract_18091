An example of a nonunique solution of the Cauchy problem of
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with surprisingly regular Hamiltonian is
introduced. The proposed Hamiltonian H(t,x,p) fulfills the local Lipschitz
continuity with respect to the triple of variables (t,x,p), in particular, with
respect to the state variable x. Moreover, the mentioned Hamiltonian is convex
with respect to p and possesses linear growth in p, so it satisfies the
classical assumptions. Given HJB equation with the Hamiltonian satisfying the
above conditions, two distinct lower semicontinuous solutions with the same
final conditions are given. Moreover, one of the solutions is the value
function of Bolza Problem. The definition of lower semicontinuous solution was
proposed by Frankowska (1993) and Barron-Jensen (1990). The example that is
proposed in the current paper allows to understand better the role of
Lipschitz-type condition in the uniqueness of the Cauchy problem solution of
HJB equation.
