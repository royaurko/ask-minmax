Various astrophysical studies have motivated the investigation of the
transport of high energy particles in magnetic turbulence, either in the source
or en route to the observation sites. For strong turbulence and large rigidity,
the pitch-angle scattering rate is governed by a simple law involving a mean
free path that increases proportionally to the square of the particle energy.
In this paper, we show that perpendicular diffusion deviates from this behavior
in the presence of a mean field. We propose an exact theoretical derivation of
the diffusion coefficients and show that a mean field significantly changes the
transverse diffusion even in the presence of a stronger turbulent field. In
particular, the transverse diffusion coefficient is shown to reach a finite
value at large rigidity instead of increasing proportionally to the square of
the particle energy. Our theoretical derivation is corroborated by a dedicated
Monte Carlo simulation. We briefly discuss several possible applications in
astrophysics.
