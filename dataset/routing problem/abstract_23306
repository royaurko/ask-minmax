We generalize solutions of Einstein's equations for intersecting branes in
higher dimensional spacetimes to the nonstatic case, modeling an expanding
universe. The relation between the Hubble rate, the brane tensions, and the
bulk cosmological constant is similar to the case of a single 3-brane in a
5-dimensional spacetime. However, because the bulk inflates as well as the
branes, this class of solutions suffers from Newton's constant tending toward
zero on the TeV brane, where the Randall-Sundrum mechanism should solve the
weak scale hierarchy problem. The strength of gravity remains constant on the
Planck brane, however.
