The model-checking problem for hybrid systems is a well known challenge in
the scientific community. Most of the existing approaches and tools are limited
to safety properties only, or operates by transforming the hybrid system to be
verified into a discrete one, thus loosing information on the continuous
dynamics of the system. In this paper we present a logic for specifying complex
properties of hybrid systems called HyLTL, and we show how it is possible to
solve the model checking problem by translating the formula into an equivalent
hybrid automaton. In this way the problem is reduced to a reachability problem
on hybrid automata that can be solved by using existing tools.
