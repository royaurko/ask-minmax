Extensions of Einstein gravity which allow the gravitational constant $G$ to
change with time as the universe evolves may provide a resolution to the
horizon problem without invoking a period of vacuum domination and without the
subsequent entropy violation. In a cosmology for which the gravitational
constant is not in fact constant, the universe may be older at a given
temperature than in a standard Hot Big Bang universe; thus, larger regions of
space could have come into causal contact at that temperature. This opens the
possibility that large regions became smooth at some high temperature without
violating causality. The extra aging of the universe can be accomplished by an
early period with a large Planck mass, a period we call the MAD era (Modified
Aging era or the Massively Aged and Detained era). We discuss in this paper
theories of gravity in which the gravitational constant is replaced with a
function of a scalar field. However, this resolution to the smoothness problem
