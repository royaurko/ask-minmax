In this paper new algorithm for calculating power indices is described. The
complexity class of the problem is #P-complete and even calculating power index
of the biggest player is NP-hard task. Constructed algorithm is a mix of ideas
of two algorithms: Klinz & Woeginger partitioning algorithm and Mann & Shapley
generating functions algorithm. Time and space complexities of the algorithm
are analysed and compared with other known algorithms for the problem.
Constructed algorithm has pessimistic time complexity O(n 2^(n/2))and
pseudopolynomial complexity O(nq), where q is quota of the voting game. This
paper also solves open problem stated by H. Aziz and M. Paterson - existence of
the algorithm for calculating Banzhaf power indices of all players with time
complexity lower than O(n^2 2^(n/2)). Not only is the answer positive but this
can be done keeping the pseudopolynomial complexity of generating functions
algorithm in case weights are integers. New open problems are stated.
