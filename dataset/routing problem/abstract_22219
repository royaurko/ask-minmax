We treat a discrete-time asset allocation problem in an arbitrage-free,
generically incomplete financial market, where the investor has a possibly
non-concave utility function and wealth is restricted to remain non-negative.
Under easily verifiable conditions, we establish the existence of optimal
portfolios.
