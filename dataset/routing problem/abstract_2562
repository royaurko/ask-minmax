Nanotechnology has already made indelible dents in the fields of
communication, computation, electronics, photonics, gas sensors, diagnostic
technologies, catalysis, drug delivery systems and imaging. In particular, ZnO
nanostructures have attracted a lot of research interest due to their unique
structure- and size-dependent electrical, optical, and mechanical properties.
ZnO nanosystems are abundant with respect to a wide variety of morphologies
whose syntheses are critically dependent on several experimental parameters.
Cursory presentation of the immense potential of these tiny systems and the
state-of-the-art of the synthetic methodologies along with our initial research
on ZnO nanorods has been presented. ZnO nanorods in the size range 50-150nm
have been synthesized by solid-state route by heating zinc acetate with caustic
soda under specific growth conditions. X-ray diffraction pattern unequivocally
establishes a wurtzite structure. Scanning electron microscope images of ZnO
nanorods display a random distribution of non-uniform size ranges. The
manipulation of ZnO nanosystems by fine tuning the critical band gap of this
unique semiconductor by doping with divalent transition metal ions leading to
novel nanosystems to enhance the performance of the electronic devices is our
extended area of research.
