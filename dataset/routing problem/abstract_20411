Maximum-likelihood methods are applied to the problem of absorption
tomography. The reconstruction is done with the help of an iterative algorithm.
We show how the statistics of the illuminating beam can be incorporated into
the reconstruction. The proposed reconstruction method can be considered as a
useful alternative in the extreme cases where the standard ill-posed
direct-inversion methods fail.
