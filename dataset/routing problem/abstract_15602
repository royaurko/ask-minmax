Recently E. E. Donets, D. V. Galtsov, and the contributor reported the results of
numerical and analytical investigation of the SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills black
hole interior solutions (gr-qc/9612067). It was shown that a generic interior
solution develops a new type of an infinitely oscillating behavior with
exponentially growing amplitude. Numerical data for three sequential
oscillations were presented. The numerical integration technique was not
discussed. Later P. Breitenlohner, G. Lavrelashvili, and D. Maison confirmed
our main results (gr-qc/9703047). But they have made some misleading
statements. In particular, they claimed, discussing the oscillations, that ``as
one performs the numerical integration one quickly runs into serious
problems...'' so that ``it is practically impossible to follow more than one or
two of them numerically'' because ``the numerical integration procedure breaks
down''. It is shown here that trivial logarithmic substitutions and integration
along the integral curve solve these ``serious problems'' easily.
