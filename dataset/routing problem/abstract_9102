The problem of the determination of the charge density from limited
information about the charge form factor is an ill-posed inverse problem. A
Bayesian probabilistic approach to this problem which permits to take into
account both errors and prior information about the solution is presented. We
will show that many classical methods can be considered as special cases of the
proposed approach. We address also the problem of the basis function choice for
the discretization and the uncertainty of the solution. Some numerical results
for an analytical model are presented to show the performance of the proposed
method.
