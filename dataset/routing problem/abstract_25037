Many-body quantum-mechanical scattering problem is solved asymptotically when
the size of the scatterers (inhomogeneities) tends to zero and their number
tends to infinity.
  A method is given for calculation of the number of small inhomogeneities per
unit volume and their intensities such that embedding of these inhomogeneities
in a bounded region results in creating a new system, described by a desired
potential. The governing equation for this system is a non-relativistic
Schr\"odinger equation described by a desired potential.
  Similar ideas were developed by the contributor for acoustic and electromagnetic
(EM) wave scattering problems.
