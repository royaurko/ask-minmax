We investigate necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary
polynomial of degree $n$ to be trivial, i.e. to have the form $a(z-b)^n$. These
results are related to an open problem, conjectured in 2001 by E. Casas-
Alvero. It says, that any complex univariate polynomial, having a common root
with each of its non-constant derivative must be a power of a linear
polynomial. In particular, we establish determinantal representation of the
Abel-Goncharov interpolation polynomials, related to the problem and having its
own interest. Among other results are new Sz.-Nagy type identities for complex
roots and a generalization of the Schoenberg conjectured analog of Rolle's
theorem for polynomials with real and complex coefficients.
