The requirements roadmap concept is introduced as a solution to the problem
of the requirements engineering of adaptive systems. The concept requires a new
general definition of the requirements problem which allows for quantitative
(numeric) variables, together with qualitative (binary boolean) propositional
variables, and distinguishes monitored from controlled variables for use in
control loops. We study the consequences of these changes, and argue that the
requirements roadmap concept bridges the gap between current general
definitions of the requirements problem and its notion of solution, and the
research into the relaxation of requirements, the evaluation of their partial
satisfaction, and the monitoring and control of requirements, all topics of
particular interest in the engineering of requirements for adaptive systems
[Cheng et al. 2009]. From the theoretical perspective, we show clearly and
formally the fundamental differences between more traditional conception of
requirements engineering (e.g., Zave & Jackson [1997]) and the requirements
engineering of adaptive systems (from Fickas & Feather [1995], over Letier &
van Lamsweerde [2004], and up to Whittle et al. [2010] and the most recent
research). From the engineering perspective, we define a proto-framework for
early requirements engineering of adaptive systems, which illustrates the
features needed in future requirements frameworks for this class of systems.
