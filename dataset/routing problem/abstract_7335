We are interested in the numerical solution of nonsymmetric linear systems
arising from the discretization of convection-diffusion partial differential
equations with separable coefficients and dominant convection. Preconditioners
based on the matrix equation formulation of the problem are proposed, which
naturally approximate the original discretized problem. For certain types of
convection coefficients, we show that the explicit solution of the matrix
equation can effectively replace the linear system solution. Numerical
experiments with data stemming from two and three dimensional problems are
reported, illustrating the potential of the proposed methodology.
