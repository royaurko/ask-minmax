In this paper we address two problems, for which we present novel, efficient,
algorithmic solutions. The first problem is motivated by practical situations
and is concerned with the efficient estimation of the upload bandwidth of a
machine, particularly in the context of a peer-to-peer content sharing and
distribution application. The second problem is more of a theoretical nature
and considers a constrained communication resource allocation situation.
