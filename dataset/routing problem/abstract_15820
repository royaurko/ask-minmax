The recent theory of plausible and paradoxical reasoning (DSmT for short, or
Dezert-Smarandache Theory), developed by the contributors, appears to be a nice
promising theoretical tools to solve many information fusion problems (for
example in military defense, medicine, etc.), where the Shafer's model cannot
be used due to the intrinsic paradoxical nature of the elements of the frame of
discernment and where a strong internal conflict between sources arises. The
main idea of DSmT is to work on the hyper-powerset of the frame of discernment
of the problem under consideration. Although the definition of hyper-powerset
is well established, the major difficulty in practice is to generate such
hyper-powersets in order to implement DSmT fusion rule on computers. We present
in this paper a simple algorithm for generating hyper-powersets and discuss the
limitations of our actual computers to generate such hyper-powersets when the
dimension of the problem increases.
