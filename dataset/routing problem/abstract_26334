Frequency non-selective time-selective multiple access channels in which
transmitters can freely choose their power control policy are considered. The
individual objective of the transmitters is to maximize their averaged
energy-efficiency. For this purpose, a transmitter has to choose a power
control policy that is, a sequence of power levels adapted to the channel
variations. This problem can be formulated as a stochastic game with
discounting for which there exists a theorem characterizing all the equilibrium
utilities (equilibrium utility region). As in its general formulation, this
theorem relies on global channel state information (CSI), it is shown that some
points of the utility region can be reached with individual CSI. Interestingly,
time-sharing based solutions, which are usually considered for centralized
policies, appear to be part of the equilibrium solutions. This analysis is
illustrated by numerical results providing further insights to the problem
under investigation.
