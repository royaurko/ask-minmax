The present article deals with a formulation of the so called (vacuum)
Palatini gravity as a general variational principle. In order to accomplish
this goal, some geometrical tools related to the geometry of the bundle of
connections of the frame bundle $LM$ are used. A generalization of
Lagrange-Poincar\'e reduction scheme to these types of variational problems
allows us to relate it with the Einstein-Hilbert variational problem. Relations
with some other variational problems for gravity found in the literature are
discussed.
