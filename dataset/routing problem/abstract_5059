The paper gives a survey of the modern results on elliptic problems on the
H\"ormander function spaces. More precisely, elliptic problems are studied on a
Hilbert scale of the isotropic H\"ormander spaces parametrized by a real number
and a function slowly varying at $+\infty$ in the Karamata sense. This refined
scale is finer than the Sobolev scale and is closed with respect to the
interpolation with a function parameter. The Fredholm property of elliptic
operators and elliptic boundary-value problems is preserved for this scale. A
local refined smoothness of the elliptic problem solution is studied. An
abstract construction of classes of function spaces in which the elliptic
problem is a Fredholm one is found. In particular, some generalizations of the
Lions-Magenes theorems are given.
