The longest common subsequence problem is a long studied prototype of pattern
matching problems. In spite of the effort dedicated to it, the numerical value
of its central quantity, the Chvatal-Sankoff constant, is not yet known.
Numerical estimations of this constant are very difficult due to finite size
effects. We propose a numerical method to estimate the Chvatal-Sankoff constant
which combines the advantages of an analytically known functional form of the
finite size effects with an efficient multi-spin coding scheme. This method
yields very high precision estimates of the Chvatal-Sankoff constant. Our
results correct earlier estimates for small alphabet size while they are
consistent with (albeit more precise than) earlier results for larger alphabet
size.
