We establish a deformation isomorphism between the algebras of
$SU(d)$-biinvariant compactly supported measures on $SL(d,\comp)$ and
$SU(d)$-conjugation invariant measures on the Euclidean space $H_d^0$ of all
Hermitian $d\times d$-matrices with trace 0. This isomorphism concisely
explains a close connection between the spectral problem for sums of Hermititan
matrices on one hand and the singular spectral problem for products of matrices
from $SL(d,\comp)$ on the other, which has recently been observed by Klyachko
\cite{Kl2}. From this deformation we further obtain an explicit, probability
preserving and isometric isomorphism between the Banach algebra of bounded
$SU(d)$-biinvariant measures on $SL(d,\comp)$ and a certain (non-invariant)
subalgebra of the bounded signed measures on $H_d^0$. We demonstrate how this
probability preserving isomorphism leads to limit theorems for the singular
spectrum of $SU(d)$-biinvariant random walks on $SL(d,\comp)$ in a simple way.
Our construction relies on deformations of hypergroup convolutions and will be
carried out in the general setting of complex semisimple Lie groups.
