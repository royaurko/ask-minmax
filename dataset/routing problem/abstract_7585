The purpose of this licentiate thesis is to present Bukhgeim's result of
2007, which solves the inverse boundary value problem of the Schr\"odinger
equation in the plane. The thesis is mainly based on Bukhgeim's paper and Kari
Astala's seminar talk, which he gave the 11th and 18th September of 2008 at the
University of Helsinki.
  Section 3 is devoted to the history and past results concerning some related
problems: notably the inverse problem of the Schr\"odinger and conductivity
equations in different settings. We also describe why some of the past methods
do not work in the general case in a plane domain.
  Section 4 outlines Bukhgeim's result and sketches out the proof. This proof
is a streamlined version of the one in Bukhgeim's paper with the stationary
phase method based on Kari Astala's presentation. In the following section we
prove all the needed lemmas which are combined in section 6 to prove the
solvability of the inverse problem.
  The idea of the proof is simple. Given two Schr\"odinger equations with the
same boundary data we get an orthogonality relation for the solutions of the
two equations. Then we show the existence of certain oscillating solutions and
insert these into the orthogonality relation. Then by a stationary phase
argument we see that the two Schr\"odinger equations are the same.
  In the last section we contemplate an unclear detail in Bukhgeim's paper
which Kari Astala pointed out in his seminar talk: without an extra argument
Bukhgeim's proof shows the solvability of the inverse problem only for
differentiable potentials instead of ones in L^p. But the special oscillating
solutions exist even for L^p potentials.
