Several results are obtained concerning the function $\Delta_k(x)$, which
represents the error term in the general Dirichlet divisor problem. These
include the estimates for the integral of this function, as well as for the
corresponding mean square integral. The mean square integral of $\Delta_2(x)$
is investigated in detail.
