Scattering of two baryons in the large-N Gross-Neveu model via the
time-dependent Dirac-Hartree-Fock approach has recently been solved in closed
analytical form. Here, we generalize this result to scattering processes
involving any number and complexity of the scatterers. The result is
extrapolated from the solution of few baryon problems, found via a joint ansatz
for the scalar mean field and the Dirac spinors, and presented in analytical
form. It has been verified numerically for up to 8-baryon problems so far, but
a full mathematical proof is still missing. Examples shown include the analogue
of proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus scattering in this toy model. All the
parameters of the general result can be fixed by one- and two-baryon input
only. We take this finding as evidence for factorized scattering, but on the
level of composite multi-fermion states rather than elementary fermions.
