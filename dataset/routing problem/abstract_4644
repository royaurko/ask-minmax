The purpose of this paper is to extend some spectral properties of regular
Sturm-Liouville problems to the special type discontinuous boundary-value
problem, which consists of a Sturm-Liouville equation together with
eigenparameter-dependent boundary conditions and two supplementary transmission
conditions. We construct the resolvent operator and Green's function and prove
theorems about expansions in terms of eigenfunctions in modified Hilbert space
$L_{2}[a, b]$. \vskip0.3cm\noindent Keywords: Boundary-value problems,
transmission conditions, Resolvent operator, expansion theorem.
