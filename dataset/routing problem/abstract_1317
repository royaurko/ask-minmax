We have hiked many miles alongside several professors as we traversed our
statistical path -- a regime switching trail which changed direction following
a class on the foundations of our discipline. As we play the game of research
in that limbo between student and academic, one thing among Prof. Bernardi's
teachings has never been more clear: to draw a route in the research map you
not only need to know your destination, but you must also understand where you
are and how you arrived there.
