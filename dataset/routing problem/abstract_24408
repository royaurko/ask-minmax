In this paper we want to apply the notion of product between ultrafilters to
answer several questions which arise around the Connes' embedding problem. For
instance, we will give a simplification and generalization of a theorem by
Radulescu; we will prove that ultraproduct of hyperlinear groups is still
hyperlinear and consequently the von Neumann algebra of the free group with
uncountable many generators is embeddable into $R^{\omega}$. This follows also
from a general construction that allows, starting from an hyperlinear group, to
find a family of hyperlinear groups. We will introduce the notion of
hyperlinear pair and we will use it to give some other characterizations of
hyperlinearity. We will prove also that the cross product of a hyperlinear
group via a profinite action is embeddable into $R^{\omega}$.
