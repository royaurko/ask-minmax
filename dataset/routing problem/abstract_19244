We report on recent work on adaptive timestep control for weakly instationary
gas flows [16, 18, 17] carried out within SFB 401, TPA3. The method which we
implement and extend is a space-time splitting of adjoint error representations
for target functionals due to S\"uli [19] and Hartmann [10]. In this paper, we
first review the method for scalar, 1D, conservation laws. We design a test
problem for weakly instationary solutions and show numerical experiments which
clearly show the possible benefits of the method. Then we extend the approach
to the 2D Euler equations of gas dynamics. New ingredients are (i) a
conservative formulation of the adjoint problem which makes its solution robust
and efficient, (ii) the derivation of boundary conditions for this new
formulation of the adjoint problem and (iii) the coupling of the adaptive
time-stepping with the multiscale spatial adaptation due to M \"uller [12, 3],
also developed within SFB 401. The combined space-time adaptive method provides
an efficient choice of timesteps for implicit computations of weakly
instationary flows. The timestep will be very large in regions of stationary
flow, and becomes small when a perturbation enters the flow field. The
efficiency of the Euler solver is investigated by means of an unsteady inviscid
2D flow over a bump.
