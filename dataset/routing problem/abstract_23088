We present our first successful numerical results of 3D general relativistic
simulations in which the Einstein equation as well as the hydrodynamic
equations are fully solved. This paper is especially devoted to simulations of
test problems such as spherical dust collapse, stability test of perturbed
spherical stars, and preservation of (approximate) equilibrium states of
rapidly rotating neutron star and/or corotating binary neutron stars. These
test simulations confirm that simulations of coalescing binary neutron stars
are feasible in a numerical relativity code. It is illustrated that using our
numerical code, simulations of these problems, in particular those of
corotating binary neutron stars, can be performed stably and fairly accurately
for a couple of dynamical timescales. These numerical results indicate that our
formulation for solving the Einstein field equation and hydrodynamic equations
are robust and make it possible to perform a realistic simulation of coalescing
binary neutron stars for a long time from the innermost circular orbit up to
formation of a black hole or neutron star.
