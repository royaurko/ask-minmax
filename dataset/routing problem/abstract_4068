Modified Rayleigh conjecture (MRC) in scattering theory was proposed and
justified by the contributor (J.Phys A, 35 (2002), L357-L361). MRC allows one to
develop efficient numerical algorithms for solving boundary-value problems. It
gives an error estimate for solutions. In this paper the MRC is formulated and
proved for static problems.
