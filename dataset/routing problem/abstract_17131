In this paper, we address the problem of stabilization in continuous time
linear dynamical systems using state feedback when compressive sampling
techniques are used for state measurement and reconstruction. In [5], we had
introduced the concept of using l1 reconstruction technique, commonly used in
sparse data reconstruction, for state measurement and estimation in a discrete
time linear system. In this work, we extend the previous scenario to analyse
continuous time linear systems. We investigate the effect of switching within a
set of sparsifiers, introduced in [5], on the stability of a linear plant in
continuous time settings. Initially, we analyze the problem of stabilization in
low dimensional systems, following which we generalize the results to address
the problem of stabilization in systems of arbitrary dimensions.
