A new scheme for numerical integration of the 1D2V relativistic
Vlasov-Maxwell system is proposed. Assuming that all particles in a cell of the
phase space move with the same velocity as that of the particle located at the
center of the cell at the beginning of each time step, we successfully
integrate the system with no artificial loss of particles. Furthermore,
splitting the equations into advection and interaction parts, the method
conserves the sum of the kinetic energy of particles and the electromagnetic
energy. Three test problems, the gyration of particles, the Weibel instability,
and the wakefield acceleration, are solved by using our scheme. We confirm that
our scheme can reproduce analytical results of the problems. Though we deal
with the 1D2V relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system, our method can be applied to
the 2D3V and 3D3V cases.
