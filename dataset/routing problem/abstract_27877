This paper studies the stability of velocity-pressure mixed approximations of
the Stokes problem when different finite element (FE) spaces for each component
of the velocity field are considered. We consider some new combinations of
continuous FE reducing the number of degrees of freedom in some velocity
components. Although the resulting FE combinations are not stable in general,
by using the Stenberg's macro-element technique, we show their stability in a
wide family of meshes (namely, in uniformly unstructured meshes). Moreover, a
post-processing is given in order to convert any mesh family in an uniformly
unstructured mesh family. Finally, some 2D and 3D numerical simulations are
provided agree with the previous analysis.
