In optical WDM networks, transmission of information along optical lines is
advantageous since it has high transmission capacity, scalability, feasibility
and also high reliability. But large amount of information is being carried;
any problem during transmission can lead to severe damage to the data being
carried. Hence it is essential to consider the routing as well as the
wavelength assignment problems and then develop a combined solution for both
the problems. In this paper, we propose to develop a routing and wavelength
assignment algorithm for selecting the suitable alternate path for the data
packets transmission. Two stages are based on the available bandwidth and the
number of wavelength used in the link as construction of alternate paths, route
and wavelength selection. In proposed work, Adaptive Routing and First-Fit
Wavelength Assignment (AR-FFWA) algorithm to be used. For each pair of source
and destination, the path with the minimum granularity values are selected as
the primary path for data transmission, allocating the sufficient wavelength
and the performances will be evaluated by using ns-2 simulation models. When we
compared to existing system the overall blocking probability will be reduced to
too low.
