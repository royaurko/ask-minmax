We study singularities of the n-body problem in spaces of constant curvature
and generalize certain results due to Painleve, Weierstrass, and Sundman. For
positive curvature, some of our proofs use the correspondence between total
collision solutions of the original system and their orthogonal projection--a
property that offers a new method of approaching the problem in this particular
case.
