In the beginning stage, face verification is done using easy method of
geometric algorithm models, but the verification route has now developed into a
scientific progress of complicated geometric representation and matching
process. In modern time the skill have enhanced face detection system into the
vigorous focal point. Researchers currently undergoing strong research on
finding face recognition system for wider area information taken under
hysterical elucidation dissimilarity. The proposed face recognition system
consists of a narrative exposition indiscreet preprocessing method, a hybrid
Fourier-based facial feature extraction and a score fusion scheme. We take in
conventional the face detection in unlike cheer up circumstances and at unusual
setting. Image processing, Image detection, Feature removal and Face detection
are the methods used for Face Verification System . This paper focuses mainly
on the issue of toughness to lighting variations. The proposed system has
obtained an average of verification rate on Two-Dimensional images under
different lightening conditions.
