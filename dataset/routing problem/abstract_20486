Quantum state discrimination for two coherent states with opposite phases as
measured relative to a reference pulse is analyzed as functions of the
intensities of both the signal states and of the reference pulse. This problem
is relevant for Quantum Key Distribution with phase encoding. We consider both
the optimum measurements and simple measurements that require only
beamsplitters and photodetectors.
