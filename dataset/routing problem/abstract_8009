N-order Darboux transformation operator is defined on the basis of a general
notion of transformation operators. Factorisation properties of this operator
are studied. The Darboux transformation operator technique is applied to
construct and investigate potentials with bound states at arbitrary energies
for the spectral problem on semiaxis.
