We consider the Cauchy problem for evolutionary Faddeev model corresponding
to maps from the Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{1 + n}$ to the unit sphere
$\mathbb{S}^2$, which obey a system of non-linear wave equations. The
nonlinearity enjoys the null structure and contains semi-linear terms,
quasi-linear terms and unknowns themselves. We prove that the Cauchy problem is
globally well-posed for sufficiently small initial data in Sobolev space.
