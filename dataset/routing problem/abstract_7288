Photolithography is a process in the production of integrated circuits in
which a mask is used to create an exposed pattern with a desired geometric
shape. In the inverse problem of photolithography, a desired pattern is given
and the mask that produces an exposed pattern which is close to the desired one
is sought. We propose a variational approach formulation of this shape design
problem and introduce a regularization strategy. The main novelty in this work
is the regularization term that makes the thresholding operation involved in
photolithography stable. The potential of the method is demonstrated in
numerical experiments.
