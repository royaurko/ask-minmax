We propose a selection region based multi-hop routing protocol for random
mobile ad hoc networks, where the selection region is defined by two
parameters: a reference distance and a selection angle. At each hop, a relay is
chosen as the nearest node to the transmitter that is located within the
selection region. By assuming that the relay nodes are randomly placed, we
derive an upper bound for the optimum reference distance to maximize the
expected density of progress and investigate the relationship between the
optimum selection angle and the optimum reference distance. We also note that
the optimized expected density of progress scales as $\Theta(\sqrt{\lambda})$,
which matches the prior results in the literature. Compared with the
spatial-reuse multi-hop protocol in \cite{Baccelli:Aloha} recently proposed by
Baccelli \emph{et al.}, in our new protocol the amount of nodes involved and
the calculation complexity for each relay selection are reduced significantly,
which is attractive for energy-limited wireless ad hoc networks (e.g., wireless
sensor networks).
