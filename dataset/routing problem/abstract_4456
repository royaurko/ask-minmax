We demonstrate implementations of the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein scheme be-
yond normal-form games. The scope of our research includes decision problems,
i.e., one-player extensive games. The research is based on the examination of
their features when the decision problems are carried out via the EWL protocol.
We prove that unitary operators can be adapted to play the role of strategies
in deci- sion problems with imperfect recall. Furthermore, we prove that
unitary operators provide the decision maker possibilities that are
inaccessible for classical strategies.
