Though the predictions of the Standard Model (SM) are in excellent agreement
with experiments there are still several theoretical problems associated with
the Higgs sector of the SM, where it is widely believed that some ``{\it new
physics}'' will take over at the TeV scale. One beyond the SM theory which
resolves these problems is the Little Higgs (LH) model. In this work we have
investigated the effects of the LH model on $\gggg$ scattering
\cite{Choudhury:2006xa}.
