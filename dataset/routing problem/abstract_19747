We explore numerically the evolution of a collapsing spherical shell of
charged, massless scalar field. We obtain an external \RN space-time, and an
inner space-time that is bounded by a singularity on the Cauchy Horizon. We
compare these results with previous analysis and discuss some of the numerical
problems encountered.
