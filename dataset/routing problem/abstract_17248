We perform a Bayesian grid-based analysis of the solar l=0,1,2 and 3 p modes
obtained via BiSON in order to deliver the first Bayesian asteroseismic
analysis of the solar composition problem. We do not find decisive evidence to
prefer either of the contending chemical compositions, although the revised
solar abundances (AGSS09) are more probable in general. We do find indications
for systematic problems in standard stellar evolution models, unrelated to the
consequences of inadequate modelling of the outer layers on the higher-order
modes. The seismic observables are best fit by solar models that are several
hundred million years older than the meteoritic age of the Sun. Similarly,
meteoritic age calibrated models do not adequately reproduce the observed
seismic observables. Our results suggest that these problems will affect any
asteroseismic inference that relies on a calibration to the Sun.
