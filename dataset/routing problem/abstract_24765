This paper introduces a new method for semi-supervised learning on high
dimensional nonlinear manifolds, which includes a phase of unsupervised basis
learning and a phase of supervised function learning. The learned bases provide
a set of anchor points to form a local coordinate system, such that each data
point $x$ on the manifold can be locally approximated by a linear combination
of its nearby anchor points, with the linear weights offering a
local-coordinate coding of $x$. We show that a high dimensional nonlinear
function can be approximated by a global linear function with respect to this
coding scheme, and the approximation quality is ensured by the locality of such
coding. The method turns a difficult nonlinear learning problem into a simple
global linear learning problem, which overcomes some drawbacks of traditional
local learning methods. The work also gives a theoretical justification to the
empirical success of some biologically-inspired models using sparse coding of
sensory data, since a local coding scheme must be sufficiently sparse. However,
sparsity does not always satisfy locality conditions, and can thus possibly
lead to suboptimal results. The properties and performances of the method are
empirically verified on synthetic data, handwritten digit classification, and
object recognition tasks.
