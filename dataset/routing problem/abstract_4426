Writing the boundary integral equation for an exterior problem of elasticity
is subordinate so far to hypotheses on the asymptotical behaviour at infinity
of solutions. The sufficient conditions met in the literature are too
restrictive and do not notably cover the case when the loading has a non zero
resultant force. This difficulty can be removed by considering the problem in
displacements relatively to one point located at a finite distance from the
loading. Finally, this auxiliary problem allows widening the conditions of
validity of the usual formulation of the direct integral method.
