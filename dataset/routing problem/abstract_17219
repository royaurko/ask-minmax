We consider the inverse problem of determining the unknown function $\alpha:
\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ from the DN map associated to the operator
$\mbox{div}(A(x',\alpha (x\_3))\nabla \cdot)$ acting in the infinite straight
cylindrical waveguide $\Omega =\omega \times \mathbb{R}$, where $\omega$ is a
bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^2$. Here $A=(A\_{ij}(x))$, $x=(x',x\_3) \in
\Omega$, is a matrix-valued metric on $\Omega$ obtained by straightening a
twisted waveguide. This inverse anisotropic conductivity problem remains
generally open, unless the unknown function $\alpha$ is assumed to be constant.
In this case we prove Lipschitz stability in the determination of $\alpha$ from
the corresponding DN map. The same result remains valid upon substituting a
suitable approximation of the DN map, provided the function $\alpha$ is
sufficiently close to some {\it a priori} fixed constant.
