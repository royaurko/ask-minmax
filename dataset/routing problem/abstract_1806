We show that individual vibrational modes in single-molecule junctions with
asymmetric molecule-lead coupling can be selectively excited by applying an
external bias voltage. Thereby, a non-statistical distribution of vibrational
energy can be generated, that is, a mode with a high frequency can be stronger
excited than a mode with a lower frequency. This is of particular interest in
the context of mode-selective chemistry, where one aims to break specific (not
necessarily the weakest) chemical bond in a molecule. Such mode-selective
vibrational excitation is demonstrated for two generic model systems
representing asymmetric molecular junctions and/or scanning tunneling
microscopy experiments. To this end, we employ two complementary theoretical
approaches, a nonequilibrium Green's function approach and a master equation
approach. The comparison of both methods reveals good agreement in describing
resonant electron transport through a single-molecule contact, but also
highlights the role of non-resonant transport processes, in particular
co-tunneling and off-resonant electron-hole pair creation processes.
