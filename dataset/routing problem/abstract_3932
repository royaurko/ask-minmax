An algebraic criterion that is sufficient to establish the existence of
certain a priori estimates for the solution of first-order homogeneous linear
characteristic problems is derived. Estimates of such kind ensure the stability
of the solutions under small variations of the data. Characteristic problems
that satisfy this criterion are, in a sense, manifestly well posed.
