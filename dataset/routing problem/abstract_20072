This note contains a report of a proof by computer that the Fibonacci group
F(2,9) is automatic. The automatic structure can be used to solve the word
problem in the group. Furthermore, it can be seen directly from the
word-acceptor that the group generators have infinite order, which of course
implies that the group itself is infinite.
