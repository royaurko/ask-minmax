We give answers of two problems about graph coloring test graphs suggested by
Kozlov. We prove that a graph whose chromatic number is 2 is a homotopy test
graph. We prove there is a graph $T$ with two involutions $\gamma_1$ and
$\gamma_2$ where $(T,\gamma_1)$ is a Stiefel-Whitney test graph, but
$(T,\gamma_2)$ is not.
