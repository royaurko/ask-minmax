The problem of classifying, upto isometry (or similarity), the orientable
spherical, Euclidean and hyperbolic 3-manifolds that arise by identifying the
faces of a Platonic solid is formulated in the language of Coxeter groups. In
the spherical and hyperbolic cases, this allows us to complete the
classification begun by Lorimer, Richardson and Rubinstein and Best.
