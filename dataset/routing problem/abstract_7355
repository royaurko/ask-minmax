Let $\Omega$ be a bounded domain in $\R^n$, $n\ge 3$ with smooth boundary
$\partial\Omega$ and a small hole. We give the first example of sign-changing
{\it bubbling} solutions to the nonlinear elliptic problem $$
  -\Delta u=|u|^{{n+2\over n-2} +\ve -1 } u \, \, \mbox{ in } \Omega , \quad
\quad
  u=0 \mbox{ on } \partial \Omega, $$ where $\ve$ is a small positive
parameter. The basic cell in the construction is the sign-changing nodal
solution to the critical Yamabe problem $$ -\Delta w = |w|^{\frac{4}{n-2}} w, \
\ w \in {\mathcal D}^{1,2} (\R^n) $$ which has large number ($3n$) of kernels.
