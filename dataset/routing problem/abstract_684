We present an all-optical routing scheme based simultaneously on optically
induced photonic structures and the Airy beam family. The presented work
utilizes these accelerating beams for the demonstration of an all-optical
router with individually addressable output channels. In addition, we are able
to activate multiple channels at the same time providing us with an optically
induced splitter with configurable outputs. The experimental results are
corroborated by corresponding numerical simulations.
