We discuss possibilities of application of Numerical Analysis methods to
proving computability, in the sense of the TTE approach, of solution operators
of boundary-value problems for systems of PDEs. We prove computability of the
solution operator for a symmetric hyperbolic system with computable real
coefficients and dissipative boundary conditions, and of the Cauchy problem for
the same system (in this case we also prove computable dependence on the
coefficients) in a cube $Q\subseteq\mathbb R^m$. Such systems describe a wide
variety of physical processes (e.g. elasticity, acoustics, Maxwell equations).
Moreover, many boundary-value problems for the wave equation also can be
reduced to this case, thus we partially answer a question raised in
\cite{wz02}. Compared with most of other existing methods of proving
computability for PDEs, this method does not require existence of explicit
solution formulas and is thus applicable to a broader class of (systems of)
equations.
