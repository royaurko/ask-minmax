The University of Oxford has started the design and development of the new
experiment ADLER (Airborne Detector for Low Energy Rays). This apparatus will
measure the cosmic-ray muon flux at an altitude of 10 - 13km. The detector
should be flown by aircrafts on transatlantic routes crossing the magnetic
equator to investigate the flux at different geomagnetic latitudes. The goal of
the experiment is to obtain better constraints on the low energy atmospheric
neutrino flux and the results will be of importance to the atmospheric neutrino
anomaly.
