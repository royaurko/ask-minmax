We present a new formalism, alternative to the old TBA-like approach, for
solution of the spectral problem of planar N = 4 SYM. It takes a concise form
of a non-linear matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem in terms of a few Q-functions.
We demonstrate the formalism for two types of observables - local operators at
weak coupling and cusped Wilson lines in a near BPS limit.
