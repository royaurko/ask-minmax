Dynamic graph theory is a novel, growing area that deals with graphs that
change over time and is of great utility in modelling modern wireless, mobile
and dynamic environments. As a graph evolves, possibly arbitrarily, it is
challenging to identify the graph properties that can be preserved over time
and understand their respective computability.
  In this paper we are concerned with the treewidth of dynamic graphs. We focus
on metatheorems, which allow the generation of a series of results based on
general properties of classes of structures. In graph theory two major
metatheorems on treewidth provide complexity classifications by employing
structural graph measures and finite model theory. Courcelle's Theorem gives a
general tractability result for problems expressible in monadic second order
logic on graphs of bounded treewidth, and Frick & Grohe demonstrate a similar
result for first order logic and graphs of bounded local treewidth.
  We extend these theorems by showing that dynamic graphs of bounded (local)
treewidth where the length of time over which the graph evolves and is observed
is finite and bounded can be modelled in such a way that the (local) treewidth
of the underlying graph is maintained. We show the application of these results
to problems in dynamic graph theory and dynamic extensions to static problems.
In addition we demonstrate that certain widely used dynamic graph classes
naturally have bounded local treewidth.
