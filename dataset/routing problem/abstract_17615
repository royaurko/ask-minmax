In this paper, we study in-order packet delivery in instantly decodable
network coded systems for wireless broadcast networks. We are interested in
applications, in which the successful delivery of a packet depends on the
correct reception of this packet and all its preceding packets. We formulate
the problem of minimizing the number of undelivered packets to all receivers
over all transmissions until completion as a stochastic shortest path (SSP)
problem. Although finding the optimal packet selection policy using SSP is
computationally complex, it allows us to systematically exploit the problem
structure and draw guidelines for efficient packet selection policies that can
reduce the number of undelivered packets to all receivers over all
transmissions until completion. According to these guidelines, we design a
simple heuristic packet selection algorithm. Simulation results illustrate that
our proposed algorithm provides quicker packet delivery to the receivers
compared to the existing algorithms in the literature.
