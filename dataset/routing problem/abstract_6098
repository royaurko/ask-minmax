A model of cosmology, that arises from the hypothesis that ordinary matter,
dark matter and dark energy are made of the same stuff, is studied. It is
argued that this hypothesis is a consequence of considering space and time in
the same footing. The model provides a solution to the cosmic coincidence
problem predicting without fine-tuning values in agreement with observations.
Besides, the model does not suffer from neither the flatness nor the horizon
problems, does not appear to spoil the successes of cosmic nucleosynthesis
calculations and allows for the formation of galaxies and clusters.
