We use the notions of reflexivity and of reflexive dimensions in order to
introduce probability measures for lattice polytopes and initiate the
investigation of their statistical properties. Examples of applications to
discrete geometry include a study of randomness of self-duality of reflexive
polytopes and implications for expectation values of the numbers of such
polytopes in higher dimensions. We also discuss enumeration problems and
related algorithms and point out interesting open problems. In this context we
define the notion of IP-confined polytopes. Our new results include the list of
IP-simplices in 3 dimensions that are not IP-confined. The main motivation for
the study of these issues comes from applications in algebraic geometry and
string theory.
