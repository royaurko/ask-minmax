The purpose of this article is to study the problem of finding sharp lower
bounds for the norm of the product of polynomials in the ultraproducts of
Banach spaces $(X_i)_{\mathfrak U}$. We show that, under certain hypotheses,
there is a strong relation between this problem and the same problem for the
spaces $X_i$.
