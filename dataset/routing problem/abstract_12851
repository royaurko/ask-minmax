Weyl theory for Dirac systems with rectangular matrix potentials is
non-classical. The corresponding Weyl functions are rectangular matrix
functions. Furthermore, they are non-expansive in the upper semi-plane. Inverse
problems are treated for such Weyl functions, and some results are new even for
the square Weyl functions. High energy asymptotics of Weyl functions and
Borg-Marchenko type uniqueness results are derived too.
