The presence of dark energy in the Universe is inferred directly and
indirectly from a large body of observational evidence. The simplest and most
theoretically appealing possibility is the vacuum energy density (cosmological
constant). However, although in agreement with current observations, such a
possibility exacerbates the well known cosmological constant problem, requiring
a natural explanation for its small, but nonzero, value. In this paper we focus
our attention on another dark energy candidate, one arising from gravitational
\emph{leakage} into extra dimensions. We investigate observational constraints
from current measurements of angular size of high-$z$ compact radio-sources on
accelerated models based on this large scale modification of gravity. The
predicted age of the Universe in the context of these models is briefly
discussed. We argue that future observations will enable a more accurate test
of these cosmologies and, possibly, show that such models constitute a viable
possibility for the dark energy problem.
