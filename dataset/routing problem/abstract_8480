We present a decentralized message exchange process (tatonnement process) for
determining the level at which a certain public good will be provided to a set
of individuals who finance the cost of attaining that level. The message
exchange process we propose requires minimal coordination overhead and
converges to the optimal solution of the corresponding centralized problem.
