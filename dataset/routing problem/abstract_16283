A hidden supersymmetry is revealed in the spinless Aharonov-Bohm problem. The
intrinsic supersymmetric structure is shown to be intimately related with the
scale symmetry. As a result, a bosonized superconformal symmetry is identified
in the system. Different self-adjoint extensions of the Aharonov-Bohm problem
are studied in the light of this superconformal structure and interacting
anyons. Scattering problem of the original Aharonov-Bohm model is discussed in
the context of the revealed supersymmetry.
