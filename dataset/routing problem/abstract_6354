We present an algorithm for characterising the generalised Dirichlet to
Neumann map for moving initial-boundary value problems. This algorithm is
derived by combining the so-called global relation, which couples the initial
and boundary values of the problem, with a new method for inverting certain
one-dimensional integrals. This new method is based on the spectral analysis of
an associated ODE and on the use of the d-bar formalism. As an illustration,
the Neumann boundary value for the linearised Schroedinger equation is
determined in terms of the Dirichlet boundary value and of the initial
condition.
