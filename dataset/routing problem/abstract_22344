It is known that the $S(n,k)$ Stirling numbers as well as the ordered
Stirling numbers $k!S(n,k)$ form log-concave sequences. Although in the first
case there are many estimations about the mode, for the ordered Stirling
numbers such estimations are not known. In this short note we study this
problem and some of its generalizations.
