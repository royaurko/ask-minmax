This paper was motivated by a problem left by Herzog and Hibi, namely to
classify all unmixed polymatroidal ideals. In the particular case of
polymatroidal ideals corresponding to discrete polymatroids of Veronese type,
i.e ideals of Veronese type, we give a complete description of the associated
prime ideals and then, we show that such an ideal is unmixed if and only if it
is Cohen-Macaulay. We also give for this type of ideals equivalent
characterizations for being equidimensional.
