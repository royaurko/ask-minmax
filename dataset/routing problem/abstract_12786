In this paper the problems of deriving a taxonomy from a text and
concept-oriented text segmentation are approached. Formal Concept Analysis
(FCA) method is applied to solve both of these linguistic problems. The
proposed segmentation method offers a conceptual view for text segmentation,
using a context-driven clustering of sentences. The Concept-oriented Clustering
Segmentation algorithm (COCS) is based on k-means linear clustering of the
sentences. Experimental results obtained using COCS algorithm are presented.
