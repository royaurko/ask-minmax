We consider nonparametric sequential hypothesis testing problem when the
distribution under the null hypothesis is fully known but the alternate
hypothesis corresponds to some other unknown distribution with some loose
constraints. We propose a simple algorithm to address the problem. These
problems are primarily motivated from wireless sensor networks and spectrum
sensing in Cognitive Radios. A decentralized version utilizing spatial
diversity is also proposed. Its performance is analysed and asymptotic
properties are proved. The simulated and analysed performance of the algorithm
is compared with an earlier algorithm addressing the same problem with similar
assumptions. We also modify the algorithm for optimizing performance when
information about the prior probabilities of occurrence of the two hypotheses
are known.
