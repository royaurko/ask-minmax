Wireless sensor networks hold a great potential in the deployment of several
applications of a paramount importance in our daily life. Video sensors are
able to improve a number of these applications where new approaches adapted to
both wireless sensor networks and video transport specific characteristics are
required. The aim of this work is to provide the necessary bandwidth and to
alleviate the congestion problem to video streaming. In this paper, we
investigate various load repartition strategies for congestion control
mechanism on top of a multipath routing feature. Simulations are performed in
order to get insight into the performances of our proposals.
