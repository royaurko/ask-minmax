Multipole electron modes beyond the Mie plasmon in atomic clusters are
investigated within the time-dependent local density approximation theory
(TDLDA). We consider the origin of the modes, their connection with basic
cluster properties and possible routes of experimental observation. Particular
attention is paid to infrared magnetic orbital modes, scissors and twist, and
electric quadrupole mode. The scissors and twist modes determine orbital
magnetism of clusters while the electric quadrupole mode provides direct access
to the single electron spectra of the cluster. We examine two-photon processes
(Raman scattering, stimulated emission pumping and stimulated adiabatic Raman
passage) as the most promising tools for experimental investigation of the
modes.
