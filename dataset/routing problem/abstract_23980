A method of a non-stationary description of tunneling of a particle through
the one-dimensional and spherically symmetric rectangular barriers on the basis
of analisis of multiple internal reflections of wave packets in relation on the
barrier boundaries, named as the Method of multiple internal reflections, is
presented at the first time. For the one-dimensional problem the applicability
of this method is proved, its specific features are analyzed. For the
spherically symmetric problem the amplitudes of the transmitted and reflected
wave packets, times of tunneling and reflection in relation to the barrier are
calculated using this method. The effect of Hartman-Fletcher is analyzed.
