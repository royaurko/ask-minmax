The number of partitions of n into parts divisible by a or b equals the
number of partitions of n in which each part and each difference of two parts
is expressible as a non-negative integer combination of a or b. This
generalizes identities of MacMahon and Andrews. The analogous identities for
three or more integers (in place of a,b) hold in certain cases.
