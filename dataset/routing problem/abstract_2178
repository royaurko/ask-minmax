We found new signatures of the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) in the context
of superconducting circuits. We show that if the recent experiment made by
Wilson {\it et al}, which brought the DCE into reality for the first time, is
repeated with slight modifications (for instance, different values for the
capacitance of the SQUID), three remarkable results will show up, namely: {\it
(i)} a quite different spectral distribution for the created particles,
deviating from the typical parabolic shape; {\it (ii)} an enhancement by a
factor of approximately $5 \times 10^3 $ in the number of created particles
with half driven frequency of the effective moving mirror and {\it (iii)} an
enhancement by a factor of $3 \times 10^2$ in the particle creation rate. These
results may guide the experimentalists in their search for alternative routes
to observe the DCE in future experiments.
