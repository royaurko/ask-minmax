In this paper we develop an artificial initial boundary value problem for the
high-order heat equation in a bounded domain $\Omega$. It is found an unique
classical solution of this problem in an explicit form and shown that the
solution of the artificial initial boundary value problem is equal to the
solution of the infinite problem (Cauchy problem) in $\Omega$.
