The implication problem for the class of embedded dependencies is
undecidable. However, this does not imply lackness of a proof procedure as
exemplified by the chase algorithm. In this paper we present a complete
axiomatization of embedded dependencies that is based on the chase and uses
inclusion dependencies and implicit existential quantification in the
intermediate steps of deductions.
