We consider the reduced two-body problem with a central potential on the
sphere ${\bf S}^{2}$ and the hyperbolic plane ${\bf H}^{2}$. For two potentials
different from the Newton and the oscillator ones we prove the nonexistence of
an additional meromorphic integral for the complexified dynamic systems.
