A promising solution to the doublet-triplet splitting problem of SUSY GUT's
is the Higgs as pseudo-Goldstone boson mechanism. We present two models which
naturally implement this idea and extend one of them to include fermion masses.
We examine the phenomenological consequences of this mechanism and present the
favored parameter region.
