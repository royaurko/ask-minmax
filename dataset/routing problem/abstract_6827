In this paper we study a mixed problem for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equation globally that have a nonlinear adding, in which the coefficient is a
generalized function. Here is proved a global solvability theorem of the
considered problem with use of the general solvability theorem of the article
[30]. Furthermore here is investigated also the behaviour of the solution of
the studied problem.
