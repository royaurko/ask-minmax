We prove a global H\"older stability estimate for a hybrid inverse problem
combining microwave imaging and ultrasound. The principal features of this
result are that we assume to have access to measurements associated to a
single, arbitrary and possibly sign changing solution of a Schr\"odinger
equation, and that zero is allowed to be an eigenvalue of the equation.
