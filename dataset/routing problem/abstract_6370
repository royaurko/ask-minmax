A method using an expansion of the four-body Yakubovsky wave function
components onto the basis of the Faddeev-equation solutions for the two-cluster
sub-Hamiltonian eigenfunctions is proposed. This expansion reduces the
Yakubovsky differential equations to a system of coupled-channel equations for
functions depending on the relative coordinates between the subsystems of the
two-cluster partitions. On the basis of the resulting equations the
four-nucleon bound-state problem and the zero-energy n-t scattering problem are
solved on the relatively small computer.
