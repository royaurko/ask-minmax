In this paper is proposed a geometric solution to the dark energy, assuming
that the space can be divided into regions of size $\sim L_{p}$ and energy
$\sim E_{p}$. Significantly this assumption generate a energy density similar
to the energy density observed for the vaccum energy, the correct solution for
the coincidence problem and the state equation characteristic of quintessence
in the comoving coordinates. Similarly is studied the ultraviolet and infrarred
limits and the amount of dark energy in the Universe.
