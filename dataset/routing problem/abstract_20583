We give the exact solution of orbit dependent nuclear pairing problem between
two non-degenerate energy levels using the Bethe ansatz technique. Our solution
reduces to previously solved cases in the appropriate limits including
Richardson's treatment of reduced pairing in terms of rational Gaudin algebra
operators.
