We consider the inverse obstacle scattering problem of determining both the
shape and the "equivalent impedance" from far field measurements at a fixed
frequency. In this work, the surface impedance is represented by a second order
surface differential operator (refer to as generalized impedance boundary
condition) as opposed to a scalar function. The generalized impedance boundary
condition can be seen as a more accurate model for effective impedances and is
widely used in the scattering problem for thin coatings. Our approach is based
on a least square optimization technique. A major part of our analysis is to
characterize the derivative of the cost function with respect to the boundary
and this complex surface impedance configuration. In particular, we provide an
extension of the notion of shape derivative to the case where the involved
impedance parameters do not need to be surface traces of given functions, which
leads (in general) to a non-vanishing tangential boundary perturbation. The
efficiency of considering this type of derivative is illustrated by several 2D
numerical experiments based on a (classical) steepest descent method. The
feasibility of retrieving both the shape and the impedance parameters is also
discussed in our numerical experiments.
