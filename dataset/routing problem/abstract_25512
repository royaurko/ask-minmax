Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over a finite field $k$, and $\ell$ a prime
number different from the characteristic of $k$. In this paper we consider the
problem of finding the structure of the Tate module $T_\ell(E)$ as an integral
Galois representations of $k$. We indicate an explicit procedure to solve this
problem starting from the characteristic polynomial $f_E(x)$ and the
$j$-invariant $j_E$ of $E$. Hilbert Class Polynomials of imaginary quadratic
orders play here an important role. We give a global application to the study
of prime-splitting in torsion fields of elliptic curves over number fields.
