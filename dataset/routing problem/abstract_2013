We investigate one of the most common analytic continuation techniques in
condensed matter physics, namely the Pad\'{e} approximant. Aspects concerning
its implementation in the exact muffin-tin orbitals (EMTO) method are
scrutinized with special regard towards making it stable and free of artificial
defects. The electronic structure calculations are performed for solid
hydrogen, and the performance of the analytical continuation is assessed by
monitoring the density of states constructed directly and via the Pad\'{e}
approximation. We discuss the difference between the \textbf{k}-integrated and
\textbf{k}-resolved analytical continuations, as well as describing the use of
random numbers and pole residues to analyze the approximant. It is found that
the analytic properties of the approximant can be controlled by appropriate
modifications, making it a robust and reliable tool for electronic structure
calculations. At the end, we propose a route to perform analytical continuation
for the EMTO + dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) method.
