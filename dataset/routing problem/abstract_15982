Maxwell equations are solved in a layer comprising a finite number of
homogeneous isotropic dielectric regions ended by anisotropic perfectly matched
layers (PMLs). The boundary-value problem is solved and the dispersion relation
inside the PML is derived. The general expression of the eigenvalues equation
for an arbitrary number of regions in each layer is obtained, and both
polarization modes are considered. The modal functions of a single layer ended
by PMLs are found, and their orthogonality relation is derived. The present
method is useful to simulate scattering problems from dielectric objects as
well as propagation in planar slab waveguides. Its potential to deal with more
complex problems such as the scattering from an object with arbitrary cross
section in open space using the multilayer modal method is briefly discussed.
