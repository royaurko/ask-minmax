Is there a connection between the branch point singularity at the particle
emission threshold and the appearance of cluster states which reveal the
structure of a corresponding reaction channel? Which nuclear states are most
impacted by the coupling to the scattering continuum? What should be the most
important steps in developing the theory that will truly unify nuclear
structure and nuclear reactions? The common denominator of these questions is
the continuum shell-model approach to bound and unbound nuclear states, nuclear
decays, and reactions.
