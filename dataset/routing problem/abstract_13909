We prove elementary recursive bounds in the degrees for Positivstellensatz
and Hilbert 17-th problem, which is the expression of a nonnegative polynomial
as a sum of squares of rational functions. We obtain a tower of five
exponentials. A precise bound in terms of the number and degree of the
polynomials and their number of variables is provided in the paper.
