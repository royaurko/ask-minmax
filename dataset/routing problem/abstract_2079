A formulation towards quantifying resource count used in a measurement, that
is independent of the model of the measurement dynamics(Quantum/Classical), is
considered. For any general measurement with $(M+1)$ discrete outcomes, it is
found that there is a unique probability distribution that minimizes the
measurement error, with the error scaling as $1/M$. For a measurement with a
finite resource$(R)$, this absolute bound implies the resource count to be
equal to the possible outcomes i.e. $R=M$. This formulation therefore provides
a model independent route towards estimating resource count used in any general
measurement scheme.
