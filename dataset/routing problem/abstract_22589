Phantom dark energy models, with w < -1, are characterized by a future
singularity and therefore a finite lifetime for the universe. Because the
future singularity is triggered by the onset of dark-energy domination, the
universe spends a significant fraction of its total lifetime in a state for
which the dark energy and matter densities are roughly comparable. We
calculate, as a function of w, the fraction of the total lifetime of the
universe for which the dark energy and matter densities differ by less than the
ratio r_0 in either direction. For r_0 = 10, this fraction varies from 1/3 to
1/8 as w varies from -1.5 to -1.1; the fraction is smaller for smaller values
of r_0. This result indicates that the coincidence problem is significantly
ameliorated in phantom-dominated cosmologies with a future singularity.
