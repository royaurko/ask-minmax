This paper presents efficient implementations of several algorithms for
solving the minimum-cost network flow problem. Various practical heuristics and
other important implementation aspects are also discussed. A novel result of
this work is the application of Goldberg's recent partial augment-relabel
method in the cost-scaling algorithm. The presented implementations are
available as part of the LEMON open source C++ optimization library
(\url{http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/}). The performance of these codes is compared to
well-known and efficient minimum-cost flow solvers, namely CS2, RelaxIV, MCF,
and the corresponding method of the LEDA library. According to thorough
experimental analysis, the presented cost-scaling and network simplex
implementations turned out to be more efficient than LEDA and MCF. Furthermore,
the cost-scaling implementation is competitive with CS2. The RelaxIV algorithm
is often much slower than the other codes, although it is quite efficient on
particular problem instances.
