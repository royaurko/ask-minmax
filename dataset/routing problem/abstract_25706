The paper is devoted to the penalty Robin-Robin domain decomposition methods
(DDMs), proposed by us for the solution of unilateral multibody contact
problems of elasticity. These DDMs are based on the penalty method for
variational inequalities and some stationary and nonstationary iterative
methods for nonlinear variational equations. The main result of the paper is
that we give the mathematical justification of proposed DDMs and prove theorems
on their convergence. We also investigate the numerical efficiency of these
methods using the finite element approximations.
