For nearly two centuries the dynamics of chains have offered examples of
paradoxical theoretical predictions. Here we propose a theory for the
dissipative dynamics of one-dimensional continua with singularities which
provides a unified treatment for chain problems that have suffered from
paradoxical solutions. These problems are duly solved within the present theory
and their paradoxes removed---we hope.
