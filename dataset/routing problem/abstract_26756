We examine the evolution of the best choice algorithm and the probability of
its success from a directed path to the linear order of the same cardinality
through $k$th powers of a directed path, $1 \leq k < n$. The vertices of a
$k$th power of a directed path of a known length $n$ are exposed one by one to
a selector in some random order. At any time the selector can see the graph
induced by the vertices that have already come. The selector's aim is to choose
online the maximal vertex (i.e. the vertex with no outgoing edges). It is shown
that the probability of success $p_n$ for the optimal algorithm for the $k$th
power of a directed path satisfies $p_n = \Theta(n^{-1/(k+1)})$. We also
consider the case when the selector knows the distance in the underlying path
between each two vertices that are joined by an edge in the induced graph. An
optimal algorithm for this choice problem is presented. The exact probability
of success when using this algorithm is given.
