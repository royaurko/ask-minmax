Levitated nanospheres in optical cavities open a novel route to study
many-body systems out of solution and highly isolated from the environment. We
show that properly tuned optical parameters allow for the study of the
non-equilibrium dynamics of composite nano-particles with non-isotropic optical
friction. We find friction induced ordering and nematic transitions with
non-equilibrium analogs to liquid crystal phases for ensembles of dimers.
