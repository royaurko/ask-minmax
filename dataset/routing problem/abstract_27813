An analytical study on crease formations in a swelling gel layer is
conducted. By exploring the smallness of the layer thickness and using a method
of coupled series-asymptotic expansions, the original nonlinear eigenvalue
problem of partial differential equations is reduced to one of ordinary
differential equations. The latter problem is then solved analytically to
obtain closed-form solutions for all the post-bifurcation branches. With the
available analytical results, a number of deep insights on crease formations
are provided, including the unveiling of three pathways to crease (depending on
the layer thickness), determination of the bifurcation type, establishment of a
lower bound for mode numbers and two scaling laws. Also, a number of
experimental results are captured, which are then nicely interpreted based on
the analytical solutions. In particular, it is shown that some critical
physical quantities are invariant with respect to the thickness at the moment
of crease formation. It appears that the present work offers a comprehensive
understanding on crease formation, a widely-spread phenomenon.
