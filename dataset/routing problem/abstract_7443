In this paper, it is investigated for an inhomogeneous Dirichlet problem with
$L^p$ boundary data for polyharmonic equation in the upper half-plane. By using
higher order Poisson kernels and Pompeiu operators, which are respectively due
to Du, Qian and Wang [Z. Du, T. Qian and J. Wang, {\it $L^{p}$ polyharmonic
Dirichlet problems in regular domains II: The upper half plane}, J.
Differential Equations 252(2012), 1789-1812] as well as Begehr and Hile [H.
Begehr and G. Hile, {\it A hierarchy of integral operators}, Rocky Mountain J.
Math. 27(1997), 669-706], it is given that the unique integral representation
solution under some certain estimates.
