We consider the percolation problem in the high-temperature Ising model on
the two-dimensional square lattice at or near critical external fields. The
incipient infinite cluster (IIC) measure in the sense of Kesten is constructed.
As a consequence, we can obtain some geometric properties of IIC. The result
holds also for the triangular lattice.
