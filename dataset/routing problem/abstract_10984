As the title suggests, this is an attempt at bosonizing fermions in any
number of dimensions without paying attention to the fact that the Fermi
surface is an extended object. One is tempted to introduce the density
fluctuation and its conjugate and recast the interacting problem in terms of
these canonical Bose fields. However, we find that the attempt is short-sighted
figuratively as well for the same reason.
 But surprisingly, this flaw, which manifests itself as an inconsistency
between Menikoff-Sharp's construction of the kinetic energy operator in terms
of currents and densities, and our ansatz for this operator, is nevertheless
able to reproduce(although reluctantly) many salient features of the free
theory.
 Buoyed by this success, we solve the interacting problem and compute the full
propagator.
