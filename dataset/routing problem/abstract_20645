This paper presents a class of Two-Step General Linear Methods for the
numerical solution of Retarded Functional Differential Equations. Explicit
methods up to order five are constructed. To avoid order reduction for mildly
stiff problems the uniform stage order of the methods is chosen to be close to
uniform order.
