We construct new non-associative key establishment protocols for all left
self-distributive (LD), multi-LD-, and mutual LD-systems. The hardness of these
protocols relies on variations of the (simultaneous) iterated LD-problem and
its generalizations. We discuss instantiations of these protocols using
generalized shifted conjugacy in braid groups and their quotients, LD-conjugacy
and $f$-symmetric conjugacy in groups. We suggest parameter choices for
instantiations in braid groups, symmetric groups and several matrix groups.
