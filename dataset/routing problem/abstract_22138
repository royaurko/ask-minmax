The loss of stability of induction motor controlled by Indirect Field
Oriented Control (IFOC) is a matter of great concern of operators and design
engineers. This paper reports indices to detect and predict stability problem
such as system oscillations. Oscillations as a result of loss of stability, due
to Hopf bifurcation, for different parameter values of IFOC motor are studied
using the proposed indices.
