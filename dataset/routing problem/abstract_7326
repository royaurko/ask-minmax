The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive study of some linear
nonlocal diffusion problems in metric measure spaces. These include, for
example, open subsets in $\mathbb{R}^N$, graphs, manifolds, multi-structures or
some fractal sets. For this, we study regularity, compactness, positiveness and
the spectrum of the stationary nonlocal operator. Then we study the solutions
of linear evolution nonlocal diffusion problems, with emphasis in similarities
and differences with the standard heat equation in smooth domains. In
particular prove weak and strong maximum principles and describe the asymptotic
behaviour using spectral methods.
