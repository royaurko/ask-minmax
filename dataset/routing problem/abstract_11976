We consider the problem of succinctly encoding a static map to support
approximate queries. We derive upper and lower bounds on the space requirements
in terms of the error rate and the entropy of the distribution of values over
keys: our bounds differ by a factor log e. For the upper bound we introduce a
novel data structure, the Bloom map, generalising the Bloom filter to this
problem. The lower bound follows from an information theoretic argument.
