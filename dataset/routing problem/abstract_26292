The paper proposes Monte Carlo algorithms for the computation of the
information rate of two-dimensional source/channel models. The focus of the
paper is on binary-input channels with constraints on the allowed input
configurations. The problem of numerically computing the information rate, and
even the noiseless capacity, of such channels has so far remained largely
unsolved. Both problems can be reduced to computing a Monte Carlo estimate of a
partition function. The proposed algorithms use tree-based Gibbs sampling and
multilayer (multitemperature) importance sampling. The viability of the
proposed algorithms is demonstrated by simulation results.
