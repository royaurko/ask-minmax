Since GNU/Linux became a popular operating system on computer network
routers, its packet routing mechanisms attracted more interest. This does not
only concern 'big' Linux servers acting as a router but more and more small and
medium network access devices, such as DSL or cable access devices.
  Although there are a lot of documents dealing with high performance routing
with GNU/Linux, only a few offer experimental results to prove the given
advices. This study evaluates the throughput performance of Linux' routing
subsystem netfilter under various conditions like different data transport
protocols in combination with different IP address families and transmission
strategies. Those conditions were evaluated with two different types of
netfilter rules for a high number in the rule tables. In addition to this, our
experiments allowed us to evaluate two prominent client connection handling
techniques (threads and the epoll() facility).
  The evaluation of the 1.260 different combinations of our test parameters
shows a nearly linear but small throughput loss with the number of rules which
is independant from the transport protocol and framesize. However, this
evaluation identifies another issue concerning the throughput loss when it
comes to the address family, i.e. IPv4 and IPv6.
