We show that a locally Ahlfors 2-regular and locally linearly locally
contractible metric surface is locally quasisymmetrically equivalent to the
disk. We also discuss an application of this result to the problem of
characterizing surfaces in some Euclidean space that are locally bi-Lipschitz
equivalent to an open subset of the plane.
