Let $\E$ be an ordinary elliptic curve over a finite field $\F_{q}$ of $q$
elements and $x(Q)$ denote the $x$-coordinate of a point $Q = (x(Q),y(Q))$ on
$\E$. Given an $\F_q$-rational point $P$ of order $T$, we show that for any
subsets $\cA, \cB$ of the unit group of the residue ring modulo $T$, at least
one of the sets $$ \{x(aP) + x(bP) : a \in \cA, b \in \cB\}
\quad\text{and}\quad \{x(abP) : a \in \cA, b \in \cB\} $$ is large. This
question is motivated by a series of recent results on the sum-product problem
over finite fields and other algebraic structures.
