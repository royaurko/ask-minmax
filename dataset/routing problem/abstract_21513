This work exposes which mechanisms and procesess in the Nature of evolution
compute a function not computable by Turing machine. The computer with
intelligence that is not higher than one bacteria population could have, but
with efficency to solve the problems that are non-computable by Turing machine
is represented. This theoretical construction is called Universal Evolutinary
Computer and it is based on the superecursive algorithms of evolvability.
