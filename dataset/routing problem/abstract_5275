This problem was solved within the framework of the grant project "Solving of
problems of cluster analysis with application of parallel algorithms and cloud
technologies" in the Institute of Mathematics and Mathematical Modelling in
Almaty. The problem of cluster analysis for the large amount of data is very
important in different areas of science - genetics, biology, sociology etc. At
the same time, such statistical known packages as STATISTICA, STADIA, SYSTAT
and others do not allow to solve large problems. The new algorithm that uses
the high processing power of GPUs for solving clustering problems by the
K-means method was developed. This algorithm is implemented as a C++
application in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 with using the GPU Nvidia GeForce
660. The developed software package for solving clustering problems by the
method of K - means with using GPUs allows us to handle up to 2 million records
with number of features up to 25. The gain in the computing time is in factor
5. We plan to increase this factor up to 20-30 after improving the algorithms.
