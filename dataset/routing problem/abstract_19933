The preliminary results of PIBETA experiment strongly suggest the presence of
non V-A anomalous interactions in the radiative pion decay. We assume that they
arise as a result of the exchange of new intermediate chiral spin-1 bosons
which interact anomalously with matter. Their contribution into the tau-decay
leads to violation of the CVC hypothesis at the same level as detected
experimentally.
