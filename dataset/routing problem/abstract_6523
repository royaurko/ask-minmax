In this paper, we present a local convergence analysis of inexact
Gauss-Newton like methods for solving nonlinear least squares problems. Under
the hypothesis that the derivative of the function associated with the least
square problem satisfies a majorant condition, we obtain that the method is
well-defined and converges. Our analysis provides a clear relationship between
the majorant function and the function associated with the least square
problem. It also allows us to obtain an estimate of convergence ball for
inexact Gauss-Newton like methods and some important, special cases.
