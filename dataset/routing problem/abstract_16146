Numerical solution of reaction-diffusion equations in three dimensions is one
of the most challenging applied mathematical problems. Since these simulations
are very time consuming, any ideas and strategies aiming at the reduction of
CPU time are important topics of research. A general and robust idea is the
parallelization of source codes/programs. Recently, the technological
development of graphics hardware created a possibility to use desktop video
cards to solve numerically intensive problems. We present a powerful parallel
computing framework to solve reaction-diffusion equations numerically using the
Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) with CUDA. Four different reaction-diffusion
problems, (i) diffusion of chemically inert compound, (ii) Turing pattern
formation, (iii) phase separation in the wake of a moving diffusion front and
(iv) air pollution dispersion were solved, and additionally both the Shared
method and the Moving Tiles method were tested. Our results show that parallel
implementation achieves typical acceleration values in the order of 5-40 times
compared to CPU using a single-threaded implementation on a 2.8 GHz desktop
computer.
