A new syntactic characterization of problems complete via Turing reductions
is presented. General canonical forms are developed in order to define such
problems. One of these forms allows us to define complete problems on ordered
structures, and another form to define them on unordered non-Aristotelian
structures. Using the canonical forms, logics are developed for complete
problems in various complexity classes. Evidence is shown that there cannot be
any complete problem on Aristotelian structures for several complexity classes.
Our approach is extended beyond complete problems. Using a similar form, a
logic is developed to capture the complexity class $NP\cap coNP$ which very
likely contains no complete problem.
