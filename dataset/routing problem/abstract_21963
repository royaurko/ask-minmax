In this paper, we study a new class of fractional partial differential
equations which are obtained by minimizing variational problems in fractional
Sobolev spaces. We introduce a notion of fractional gradient which has the
potential to extend many classical results in the Sobolev spaces to the
nonlocal and fractional setting in a natural way.
