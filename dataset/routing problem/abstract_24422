QCD_{AS}, a variant of large N_c QCD in which quarks transform under the
color two-index antisymmetric representation, reduces to standard QCD at N_c =
3 and provides an alternative to the usual large N_c extrapolation that uses
fundamental representation quarks. Previous strong plausibility arguments
assert that the QCD_{AS} baryon mass scales as N_c^2; however, the complicated
combinatoric problem associated with quarks carrying two color indices impeded
a complete demonstration. We develop a diagrammatic technique to solve this
problem. The key ingredient is the introduction of an effective multi-gluon
vertex: a "traffic circle" or "roundabout" diagram. We show that arbitrarily
complicated diagrams can be reduced to simple ones with the same leading N_c
scaling using this device, and that the leading contribution to baryon mass
does, in fact, scale as N_c^2.
