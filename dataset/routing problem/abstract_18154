We address the problem of un-supervised soft-clustering called
micro-clustering. The aim of the problem is to enumerate all groups composed of
records strongly related to each other, while standard clustering methods
separate records at sparse parts. The problem formulation of micro-clustering
is non-trivial. Clique mining in a similarity graph is a typical approach, but
it results in a huge number of cliques that are of many similar cliques. We
propose a new concept data polishing. The cause of huge solutions can be
considered that the groups are not clear in the data, that is, the boundaries
of the groups are not clear, because of noise, uncertainty, lie, lack, etc.
Data polishing clarifies the groups by perturbating the data. Specifically,
dense subgraphs that would correspond to clusters are replaced by cliques. The
clusters are clarified as maximal cliques, thus the number of maximal cliques
will be drastically reduced. We also propose an efficient algorithm applicable
even for large scale data. Computational experiments showed the efficiency of
our algorithm, i.e., the number of solutions is small, (e.g., 1,000), the
members of each group are deeply related, and the computation time is short.
