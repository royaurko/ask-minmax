The Dirichlet problem with oscillating boundary data is the subject of study
in this paper. It turns out that due to integral representation of such
problems we can reduce the study to the case of surface integrals of rapidly
oscillating functions, and their limit behavior: $$ \lim_{\e \to 0}
\int_{\Gamma} g(y,\frac{y}{\e}) d\sigma_y, $$ where $g(x,y)$, represents the
boundary value in the Dirichlet problem. The lower dimensional character of the
surface $\Gamma$ produces unexpected and surprising effective limits. In
general, the limit of the integral depends strongly on the sequence $\e=\e_j$
chosen. Notwithstanding this, when the surface does not have flat portions with
\emph{rational directions} a full averaging takes place and we obtain a unique
effective limit in the above integral. The results here are connected to recent
works of D. G\'erard-Varet and N. Masmoudi, where they study this problem in
combination with homogenization of the operator, in convex domains.
