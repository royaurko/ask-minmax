In this paper we study the deterministic homogenization problems for unsteady
Navier-Stokes type equations, on one hand in an open set {\Omega} of R^{N}, on
the other hand in porous media {\Omega}^{{\epsilon}}. In the second case, the
equations are classical unsteady Navier-Stokes one, and the porous media are
periodic
