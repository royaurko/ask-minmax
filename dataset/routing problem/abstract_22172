We consider the problem of traveling among random points in Euclidean space,
when only a random fraction of the pairs are joined by traversable connections.
In particular, we show a threshold for a pair of points to be connected by a
geodesic of length arbitrarily close to their Euclidean distance, and analyze
the minimum length Traveling Salesperson Tour, extending the
Beardwood-Halton-Hammersley theorem to this setting.
