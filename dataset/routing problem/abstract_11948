Diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach is applied to a problem of a single
spin-down fermion resonantly interacting with the sea of ideal spin-up
fermions. On one hand, we develop a generic, sign-problem tolerant, method of
exact numerical solution of polaron-type models. On the other hand, our
solution is important for understanding the phase diagram and properties of the
BCS-BEC crossover in the strongly imbalanced regime. This is the first, and
possibly characteristic, example of how the Monte Carlo approach can be applied
to a divergent sign-alternating diagrammatic series.
