We prove locally in time the existence of a smooth solution for
multidimensional two-phase Stefan problem for degenerate parabolic equations of
the porous medium type. We establish also natural H\"{o}lder class for the
boundary conditions in the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem for a degenerate parabolic
equation.
