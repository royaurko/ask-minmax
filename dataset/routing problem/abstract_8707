In this paper we study complexity of randomly generated instances of Dehn
search problems in finitely presented groups. We use Crump-Mode-Jagers
processes to show that most of the random instances are easy. Our analysis
shows that for any choice of a finitely presented platform group in
Wagner-Wagner public key encryption protocol the majority of random keys can be
broken by a polynomial time algorithm.
