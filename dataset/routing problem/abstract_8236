In this paper we study the inverse spectral problem of reconstructing
energy-dependent Sturm-Liouville equations from two spectra. We give a
reconstruction algorithm and establish existence and uniqueness of
reconstruction. Our approach essentially exploits the connection between the
spectral problems under study and those for Dirac operators of a special form.
