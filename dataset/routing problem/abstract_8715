We prove that the solution of the discounted approximation of a degenerate
viscous Hamilton--Jacobi equation with convex Hamiltonians converges to that of
the associated ergodic problem. We characterize the limit in terms of
stochastic Mather measures by naturally using the nonlinear adjoint method, and
deriving a commutation lemma. This convergence result was first achieved by
Davini, Fathi, Iturriaga, and Zavidovique for the first order Hamilton--Jacobi
equation.
