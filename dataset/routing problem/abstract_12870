This paper is devoted to study the existence of solutions and the monotone
method of second-order periodic boundary value problems when the lower and
upper solutions $\alpha$ and $\beta$ violate the boundary conditions $
\alpha(0)=\alpha(2\pi)$ and $\beta(0)=\beta(2\pi)$. We present several
comparison results. We show that the method of lower and upper solutions
coupled with the monotone iterative technique is valid to obtain constuctive
proof of existence of solutions.
