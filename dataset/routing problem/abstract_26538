We analyze representative ill-posed scenarios of tomographic PIV with a focus
on conditions for unique volume reconstruction. Based on sparse random seedings
of a region of interest with small particles, the corresponding systems of
linear projection equations are probabilistically analyzed in order to
determine (i) the ability of unique reconstruction in terms of the imaging
geometry and the critical sparsity parameter, and (ii) sharpness of the
transition to non-unique reconstruction with ghost particles when choosing the
sparsity parameter improperly. The sparsity parameter directly relates to the
seeding density used for PIV in experimental fluids dynamics that is chosen
empirically to date. Our results provide a basic mathematical characterization
of the PIV volume reconstruction problem that is an essential prerequisite for
any algorithm used to actually compute the reconstruction. Moreover, we connect
the sparse volume function reconstruction problem from few tomographic
projections to major developments in compressed sensing.
