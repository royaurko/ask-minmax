A method developed from the Dualized Standard Model for calculating the quark
CKM matrix and masses is applied to the parallel problem in neutrino
oscillations. Taking the parameters determined from quarks and the masses of
two neutrinos: $m_3^2 \sim 10^{-2} - 10^{-3} eV^2$ suggested by atmospheric
neutrino data, and $m_2^2 \sim 10^{-10} eV^2$ suggested by the long wave-length
oscillation (LWO) solution of the solar neutrino problem, one obtains from a
parameter-free calculation all the mixing angles in reasonable agreement with
existing experiment. However, the scheme is found not to accommodate
comfortably the mass values $m_2^2 \sim 10^{-5} eV^2$ suggested by the MSW
solution for solar neutrinos.
