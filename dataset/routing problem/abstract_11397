The spacetime singularities play a useful role in gravitational theories by
distinguishing physical solutions from non-physical ones. The problem, we
studying in this paper is: are these singularities stable? To answer this
question, we have analyzed the general problem of stability of the family of
the static spherically symmetric solutions of the standard Einstein-Maxwell
model coupled to an extra free massless scalar field. We have obtained the
equations for the axial and polar perturbations. The stability against axial
perturbations has been proven.
