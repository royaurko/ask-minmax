In this paper we focus on the problem of completion of multidimensional
arrays (also referred to as tensors) from limited sampling. Our approach is
based on a recently proposed tensor-Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD) [1].
Using this factorization one can derive notion of tensor rank, referred to as
the tensor tubal rank, which has optimality properties similar to that of
matrix rank derived from SVD. As shown in [2] some multidimensional data, such
as panning video sequences exhibit low tensor tubal rank and we look at the
problem of completing such data under random sampling of the data cube. We show
that by solving a convex optimization problem, which minimizes the tensor
nuclear norm obtained as the convex relaxation of tensor tubal rank, one can
guarantee recovery with overwhelming probability as long as samples in
proportion to the degrees of freedom in t-SVD are observed. In this sense our
results are order-wise optimal. The conditions under which this result holds
are very similar to the incoherency conditions for the matrix completion,
albeit we define incoherency under the algebraic set-up of t-SVD. We show the
performance of the algorithm on some real data sets and compare it with other
existing approaches based on tensor flattening and Tucker decomposition.
