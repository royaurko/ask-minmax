A correspondence between the sextic anharmonic oscillator and a pair of
third-order ordinary differential equations is used to investigate the
phenomenon of quasi-exact solvability for eigenvalue problems involving
differential operators with order greater than two. In particular, links with
Bender-Dunne polynomials and resonances between independent solutions are
observed for certain second-order cases, and extended to the higher-order
problems.
