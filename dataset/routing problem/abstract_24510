The KPII equation is an integrable nonlinear PDE in 2+1 dimensions (two
spatial and one temporal), which arises in several physical circumstances,
including fluid mechanics where it describes waves in shallow water. It
provides a multidimensional generalisation of the renowned KdV equation. In
this work, we employ a novel approach recently introduced by one of the contributors
in connection with the Davey-Stewartson equation \cite{FDS2009}, in order to
analyse the initial-boundary value problem for the KPII equation formulated on
the half-plane. The analysis makes crucial use of the so-called d-bar
formalism, as well as of the so-called global relation. A novel feature of
boundary as opposed to initial-value problems in 2+1 is that the d-bar
formalism now involves a function in the complex plane which is discontinuous
across the real axis.
