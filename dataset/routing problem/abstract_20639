We describe an algebra for composing automata in which the actions have
probabilities. We illustrate by showing how to calculate the probability of
reaching deadlock in k steps in a model of the classical Dining Philosopher
problem, and show, using the Perron-Frobenius Theorem, that this probability
tends to 1 as k tends to infinity.
