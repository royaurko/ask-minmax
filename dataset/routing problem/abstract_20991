The approach used by Kalashnikov and Tsitsiashvili for constructing upper
bounds for the tail distribution of a geometric sum with subexponential
summands is reconsidered. By expressing the problem in a more probabilistic
light, several improvements and one correction are made, which enables the
constructed bound to be significantly tighter. Several examples are given,
showing how to implement the theoretical result.
