This paper studies a class of probabilistic models on graphs, where edge
variables depend on incident node variables through a fixed probability kernel.
The class includes planted con- straint satisfaction problems (CSPs), as well
as more general structures motivated by coding and community clustering
problems. It is shown that under mild assumptions on the kernel and for sparse
random graphs, the conditional entropy of the node variables given the edge
variables concentrates around a deterministic threshold. This implies in
particular the concentration of the number of solutions in a broad class of
planted CSPs, the existence of a threshold function for the disassortative
stochastic block model, and the proof of a conjecture on parity check codes. It
also establishes new connections among coding, clustering and satisfiability.
