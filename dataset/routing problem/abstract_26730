We present analytical bound state solutions of the spin-zero Klein-Gordon
(KG) particles in the field of unequal mixture of scalar and vector Yukawa
potentials within the framework of the approximation scheme to the centrifugal
potential term for any arbitrary -state. The approximate energy eigenvalues and
unnormalized wave functions are obtained in closed forms using a simple
shortcut of the Nikiforov-Uvarov (NU) method. Further, we solve the KG-Yukawa
problem for its exact numerical energy eigenvalues via amplitude phase (AP)
method to test the accuracy of the present solutions found by using the NU
method. Our numerical tests using energy calculations demonstrate the existence
of inter-dimensional degeneracy amongst energy states of the KG-Yukawa problem.
The dependence of the energy on the dimension is numerically discussed for
spatial dimensions
