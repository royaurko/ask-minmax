We formulate and investigate a statistical inverse problem of a random
tomographic nature, where a probability density function on $\mathbb{R}^3$ is
to be recovered from observation of finitely many of its two-dimensional
projections in random and unobservable directions. Such a problem is distinct
from the classic problem of tomography where both the projections and the unit
vectors normal to the projection plane are observable. The problem arises in
single particle electron microscopy, a powerful method that biophysicists
employ to learn the structure of biological macromolecules. Strictly speaking,
the problem is unidentifiable and an appropriate reformulation is suggested
hinging on ideas from Kendall's theory of shape. Within this setup, we
demonstrate that a consistent solution to the problem may be derived, without
attempting to estimate the unknown angles, if the density is assumed to admit a
mixture representation.
