We study a number of realizations of axions existing in a multi-`throat'
generalization of the warped throat geometry of a Randall-Sundrum slice of
$AdS_5$. As argued by previous contributors, the problem of generating a suitable,
phenomenologically allowed Peccei-Quinn scale is simply and elegantly solved by
the warping. In compactifications with two or more throats it is possible to
simultaneously solve the Standard Model hierarchy problem by the
Randall-Sundrum mechanism while implementing interesting warped axion models.
The constructions discussed are related to holographic duals of previously
studied models of composite axions arising from strongly coupled
four-dimensional dynamics.
