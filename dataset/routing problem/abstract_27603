In this paper, a robust online sequential extreme learning machine (ROS-ELM)
is proposed. It is based on the original OS-ELM with an adaptive selective
ensemble framework. Two novel insights are proposed in this paper. First, a
novel selective ensemble algorithm referred to as particle swarm optimization
selective ensemble (PSOSEN) is proposed. Noting that PSOSEN is a general
selective ensemble method which is applicable to any learning algorithms,
including batch learning and online learning. Second, an adaptive selective
ensemble framework for online learning is designed to balance the robustness
and complexity of the algorithm. Experiments for both regression and
classification problems with UCI data sets are carried out. Comparisons between
OS-ELM, simple ensemble OS-ELM (EOS-ELM) and the proposed ROS-ELM empirically
show that ROS-ELM significantly improves the robustness and stability.
