For a two-variable formula &psi;(X,Y) of Monadic Logic of Order (MLO) the
Church Synthesis Problem concerns the existence and construction of an operator
Y=F(X) such that &psi;(X,F(X)) is universally valid over Nat.
  B\"{u}chi and Landweber proved that the Church synthesis problem is
decidable; moreover, they showed that if there is an operator F that solves the
Church Synthesis Problem, then it can also be solved by an operator defined by
a finite state automaton or equivalently by an MLO formula. We investigate a
parameterized version of the Church synthesis problem. In this version &psi;
might contain as a parameter a unary predicate P. We show that the Church
synthesis problem for P is computable if and only if the monadic theory of
<Nat,<,P> is decidable. We prove that the B\"{u}chi-Landweber theorem can be
extended only to ultimately periodic parameters. However, the MLO-definability
part of the B\"{u}chi-Landweber theorem holds for the parameterized version of
the Church synthesis problem.
