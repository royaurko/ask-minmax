We address the problem of spring-like coupling between bosons in an open
chain configuration where the counter-rotating terms are explicitly included.
We show that fruitful insight can be gained by decomposing the time-evolution
operator of this problem into a pattern of linear-optics elements. This allows
us to provide a clear picture of the effects of the counter-rotating terms in
the important problem of long-haul entanglement distribution. The analytic
control over the variance matrix of the state of the bosonic register allows us
to track the dynamics of the entanglement. This helps in designing a global
addressing scheme, complemented by a proper initialization of the register,
which quantitatively improves the entanglement between the extremal oscillators
in the chain, thus providing a strategy for feasible long distance entanglement
distribution.
