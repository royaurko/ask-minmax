We extend the theory of quasipotentials in dynamical systems by calculating
an exact potential for the critical fluctuations of pitchfork bifurcations of
period-doubling maps in the weak noise limit. These far-from-equilibrium
fluctuations are described by finite-size mean field theory, placing their
static properties in the same universality class as the Ising model on a
complete graph. We demonstrate that the effective system size of noisy
period-doubling bifurcations exhibits universal scaling behavior along
period-doubling routes to chaos.
