Following Mettu and Plaxton, we study online algorithms for the k-medians
problem. Such an algorithm must produce a nested sequence F_1\subseteq
F_2\subseteq...\subseteq F_n of sets of facilities. Mettu and Plaxton show that
online metric medians has a (roughly) 40-competitive deterministic
polynomial-time algorithm. We give improved algorithms, including a
(24+\epsilon)-competitive deterministic polynomial-time algorithm and a
5.44-competitive, randomized, non-polynomial-time algorithm.
  We also consider the competitive ratio with respect to size. An algorithm is
s-size-competitive if, for each k, the cost of F_k is at most the minimum cost
of any set of k facilities, while the size of F_k is at most s k. We present
optimally competitive algorithms for this problem.
  Our proofs reduce online medians to the following online bidding problem:
faced with some unknown threshold T>0, an algorithm must submit ``bids'' b>0
until it submits a bid as large as T. The algorithm pays the sum of its bids.
We describe optimally competitive algorithms for online bidding.
  Our results on cost-competitive online medians extend to approximately metric
distance functions, online fractional medians, and online bicriteria
approximation.
