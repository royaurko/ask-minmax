We show that Connes' embedding problem for II_1-factors is equivalent to a
statement about distributions of sums of self-adjoint operators with matrix
coefficients. This is an application of a linearization result for finite von
Neumann algebras, which is proved using asymptotic second order freeness of
Gaussian random matrices.
