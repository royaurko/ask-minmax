These lectures concern basic aspects of the theory of semigroups of
endomorphisms of type $I$ factors that relate to causal dynamics, dilation
theory, and the problem of classifying $E_0$-semigroups up to cocycle
conjugacy. We give only a few proofs here; full details can be found in the
contributor's upcoming monograph {\em Noncommutative Dynamics and $E$-semigroups},
to be published in the Springer series Monographs in Mathematics.
