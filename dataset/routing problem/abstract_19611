We revisit the problem of inelastic times governing the temperature behavior
of the weak localization correction and mesoscopic fluctuations in one- and
two-dimensional systems. It is shown that, for dephasing by the electron
electron interaction, not only are those times identical but the scaling
functions are also the same.
