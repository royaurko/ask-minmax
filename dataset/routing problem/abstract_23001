Computational models pervade all branches of the exact sciences and have in
recent times also started to prove to be of immense utility in some of the
traditionally 'soft' sciences like ecology, sociology and politics. This volume
is a collection of a few cutting-edge research papers on the application of
variety of computational models and tools in the analysis, interpretation and
solution of vexing real-world problems and issues in economics, management,
ecology and global politics by some prolific researchers in the field.
