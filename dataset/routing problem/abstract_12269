In some particular cases we give criteria for morphic sequences to be almost
periodic (=uniformly recurrent). Namely, we deal with fixed points of
non-erasing morphisms and with automatic sequences. In both cases a
polynomial-time algorithm solving the problem is found. A result more or less
supporting the conjecture of decidability of the general problem is given.
