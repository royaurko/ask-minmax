The wireless sensor network is a collection of energy-constrained nodes.
Their objective is to sense, collect and process information for some ad-hoc
purpose. Typically the nodes are deployed in geographically inaccessible
regions. Thus the most challenging task is to design a network with minimal
power consumption. As the nodes have to collect and process data very fast,
minimizing data delivery time is another objective. In addition to this, when
multiple sources transmit data simultaneously, the network load gradually
increases and it may lead to congestion. In this paper we have proposed an
adaptive framework in which multiple sources transmit data simultaneously with
minimal end-to-end data delivery time and minimal energy consumption besides
ensuring that congestion remains at an optimum low so that minimal number of
data packets are dropped. This paper presents an adaptive framework to achieve
the above-mentioned objectives. This framework has been used over Mac 802.11
and extensive simulations have been carried out in NS2 to prove the
effectiveness of the framework over traditional Mac as well as few other
existing protocols.
