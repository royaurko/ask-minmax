We consider a dynamic vehicle routing problem with time windows and
stochastic customers (DS-VRPTW), such that customers may request for services
as vehicles have already started their tours. To solve this problem, the goal
is to provide a decision rule for choosing, at each time step, the next action
to perform in light of known requests and probabilistic knowledge on requests
likelihood. We introduce a new decision rule, called Global Stochastic
Assessment (GSA) rule for the DS-VRPTW, and we compare it with existing
decision rules, such as MSA. In particular, we show that GSA fully integrates
nonanticipativity constraints so that it leads to better decisions in our
stochastic context. We describe a new heuristic approach for efficiently
approximating our GSA rule. We introduce a new waiting strategy. Experiments on
dynamic and stochastic benchmarks, which include instances of different degrees
of dynamism, show that not only our approach is competitive with
state-of-the-art methods, but also enables to compute meaningful offline
solutions to fully dynamic problems where absolutely no a priori customer
request is provided.
