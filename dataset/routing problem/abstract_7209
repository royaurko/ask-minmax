Over the past decade, we have designed six typefaces based on mathematical
theorems and open problems, specifically computational geometry. These
typefaces expose the general public in a unique way to intriguing results and
hard problems in hinged dissections, geometric tours, origami design,
computer-aided glass design, physical simulation, and protein folding. In
particular, most of these typefaces include puzzle fonts, where reading the
intended message requires solving a series of puzzles which illustrate the
challenge of the underlying algorithmic problem.
