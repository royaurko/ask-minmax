We address the problem of Dirac fermions interacting with longitudinal
phonons. A gap in the spectrum of fermions leads to the emergence of the
Chern--Simons excitations in the spectrum of phonons. We study the effect of
those excitations on observable quantities: the phonon dispersion, the phonon
spectral density, and the Hall conductivity.
