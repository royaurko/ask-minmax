The paper is concerned with the completeness property of root functions of
general boundary value problems for $n \times n$ first order systems of
ordinary differential equations on a finite interval. In comparison with the
recent paper [45] we substantially relax the assumptions on boundary conditions
guarantying the completeness of root vectors, allowing them to be non-weakly
regular and even degenerate. Emphasize that in this case the completeness
property substantially depends on the values of a potential matrix at the
endpoints of the interval.
  It is also shown that the system of root vectors of the general $n \times n$
Dirac type system subject to certain boundary conditions forms a Riesz basis
with parentheses. We also show that arbitrary complete dissipative boundary
value problem for Dirac type operator with a summable potential matrix admits
the spectral synthesis in $L^2([0,1]; \mathbb{C}^n)$. Finally, we apply our
results to investigate completeness and the Riesz basis property of the dynamic
generator of spatially non-homogenous damped Timoshenko beam model.
