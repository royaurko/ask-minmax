The entropy of the random walk on the discrete contable group could be used
for comparison of the system of the generators. Fundamental inequality between
growth, entropy and escape gives the possibility to define "the best" system of
the generators. We formulate a new circle of the problems related to the
various growth and asymptotics on the groups.
