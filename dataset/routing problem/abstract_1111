The bifurcation structure of the Langford equation is studied numerically in
detail. Periodic, doubly-periodic, and chaotic solutions and the routes to
chaos via coexistence of double periodicity and period-doubling bifurcations
are found by the Poincar\'e plot of successive maxima of the first mode $x_1$.
Frequency-locked periodic solutions corresponding to the Farey sequence $F_n$
are examined up to $n=14$. Period-doubling bifurcations appears on some of the
periodic solutions and the similarity of bifurcation structures between the
sine-circle map and the Langford equation is shown. A method to construct the
Poincar\'e section for triple periodicity is proposed.
