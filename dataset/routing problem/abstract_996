The temperature dependent resistance $R$($T$) of polycrystalline
ferromagnetic CoFeB thin films of varying thickness are analyzed considering
various electrical scattering processes. We observe a resistance minimum in
$R$($T$) curves below $\simeq$ 29 K, which can be explained as an effect of
intergranular Coulomb interaction in a granular system. While the magnetic
contribution is the weakest compared to structural and Coulomb interaction
related scattering processes, it is the only thickness independent process
whereas the other two processes contribute more as the thickness decreases
implying the role of disorder and granularity. On the contrary, the negative
coefficient of resistance can be explained by electron interaction effect in
disordered amorphous films.
