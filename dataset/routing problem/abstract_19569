We give an account of matter and (basically) a solution of a new class of
problems synthesizing percolation theory and branching diffusion processes.
They led us to realizing a novel type of stochastic processes, namely branching
processes with diffusion on the space of parameters distinguishing the
branching `particles' each other.
