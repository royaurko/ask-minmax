The origin of the particles in the highest energy end of the cosmic ray
spectrum is discussed in the context of the wider problem of the origin of the
whole cosmic radiation as observed at the Earth. In particular we focus our
attention on the acceleration problem and on the transition from galactic to
extragalactic cosmic rays.
