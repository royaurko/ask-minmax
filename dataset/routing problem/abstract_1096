Exclusive measurements of the two-pion production channel p p -> p p pi+ pi-
have been carried out near threshold at CELSIUS with the PROMICE/WASA detector.
They reveal p p -> p p*(1440) -> p p sigma -> p p (pi+ pi-)I=l=0 as the
dominant process at these energies, however, the data exhibit also significant
contributions from p*(1440) -> Delta pi -> p (pi+ pi-)I=l=0 . From the observed
interference of this routes their relative branching ratio is derived.
