In the following, we discuss nonlinear simulations of nonlinear dynamical
systems, which are applied in technical and biological models. We deal with
different ideas to overcome the treatment of the nonlinearities and discuss a
novel splitting approach. While Magnus expansion has been intensely studied and
widely applied for solving explicitly time-dependent problems, it can also be
extended to nonlinear problems. By the way it is delicate to extend, while an
exponential character have to be computed. Alternative methods, like successive
approximation methods, might be an attractive tool, which take into account the
temporally in-homogeneous equation (method of Tanabe and Sobolevski). In this
work, we consider nonlinear stability analysis with numerical experiments and
compare standard integrators to our novel approaches.
