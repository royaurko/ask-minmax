We initiate the study of the Bipartite Contraction problem from the
perspective of parameterized complexity. In this problem we are given a graph
$G$ and an integer $k$, and the task is to determine whether we can obtain a
bipartite graph from $G$ by a sequence of at most $k$ edge contractions. Our
main result is an $f(k) n^{O(1)}$ time algorithm for Bipartite Contraction.
Despite a strong resemblance between Bipartite Contraction and the classical
Odd Cycle Transversal (OCT) problem, the methods developed to tackle OCT do not
seem to be directly applicable to Bipartite Contraction. Our algorithm is based
on a novel combination of the irrelevant vertex technique, introduced by
Robertson and Seymour, and the concept of important separators. Both techniques
have previously been used as key components of algorithms for fundamental
problems in parameterized complexity. However, to the best of our knowledge,
this is the first time the two techniques are applied in unison.
