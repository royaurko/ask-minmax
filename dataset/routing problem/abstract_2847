The probleme des menages (married couples problem) introduced by E.Lucas in
1891 is a classical problem that asks the number of ways to arrange n married
couples around a circular table, so that husbands and wives are in alternate
places but no couple is seated together. In this paper we present a new version
of the Menage Problem that carries the constraints consistent with the Muslim
culture.
