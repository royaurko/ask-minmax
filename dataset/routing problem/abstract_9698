We present an approach for analyzing initial-boundary value problems for
integrable equations whose Lax pairs involve $3 \times 3$ matrices. Whereas
initial value problems for integrable equations can be analyzed by means of the
classical Inverse Scattering Transform (IST), the presence of a boundary
presents new challenges. Over the last fifteen years, an extension of the IST
formalism developed by Fokas and his collaborators has been successful in
analyzing boundary value problems for several of the most important integrable
equations with $2 \times 2$ Lax pairs, such as the Korteweg-de Vries, the
nonlinear Schr\"odinger, and the sine-Gordon equations. In this paper, we
extend these ideas to the case of equations with Lax pairs involving $3 \times
3$ matrices.
