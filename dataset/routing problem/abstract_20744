We study cone differential operators on the half-axis and edge-degenerate
differential operators on a half-space. We construct subspaces of edge Sobolev
spaces that can be considered as natural domains for edge-degenerate operators
and indicate how they can be used in the study of boundary problems for
edge-degenerate operators.
