We consider a database composed of a set of conceptual graphs. Using
conceptual graphs and graph homomorphism it is possible to build a basic
query-answering mechanism based on semantic search. Graph homomorphism defines
a partial order over conceptual graphs. Since graph homomorphism checking is an
NP-Complete problem, the main requirement for database organizing and managing
algorithms is to reduce the number of homomorphism checks. Searching is a basic
operation for database manipulating problems. We consider the problem of
searching for an element in a partially ordered set. The goal is to minimize
the number of queries required to find a target element in the worst case.
First we analyse conceptual graph database operations. Then we propose a new
algorithm for a subclass of lattices. Finally, we suggest a parallel search
algorithm for a general poset. Keywords. Conceptual Graph, Graph Homomorphism,
Partial Order, Lattice, Search, Database.
