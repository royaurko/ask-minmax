We consider the linear eigenvalue problem \tag{1}
  -u" = \lambda u, \quad \text{on $(-1,1)$}, where $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$,
together with the general multi-point boundary conditions \tag{2} \alpha_0^\pm
u(\pm 1) + \beta_0^\pm u'(\pm 1) = \sum^{m^\pm}_{i=1} \alpha^\pm_i
u(\eta^\pm_i)
  + \sum_{i=1}^{m^\pm} \beta^\pm_i u'(\eta^\pm_i). We also suppose that:
\alpha_0^\pm \ge 0, \quad \alpha_0^\pm + |\beta_0^\pm| > 0, \tag{3} \pm
\beta_0^\pm \ge 0, \tag{4} (\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m^\pm}
|\alpha_i^\pm|}{\alpha_0^\pm})^2
  + (\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m^\pm} |\beta_i^\pm|}{\beta_0^\pm})^2
  < 1, \tag{5} with the convention that if any denominator in (5) is zero then
the corresponding numerator must also be zero, and the corresponding fraction
is omitted from (5) (by (3), at least one denominator is nonzero in each
condition).
  In this paper we show that the basic spectral properties of this problem are
similar to those of the standard Sturm-Liouville problem with separated
boundary conditions. Similar multi-point problems have been considered before
under more restrictive hypotheses. For instance, the cases where $\beta_i^\pm =
0$, or $\alpha_i^\pm = 0$, $i = 0,..., m^\pm$ (such conditions have been termed
Dirichlet-type or Neumann-type respectively), or the case of a single-point
condition at one end point and a Dirichlet-type or Neumann-type multi-point
condition at the other end. Different oscillation counting methods have been
used in each of these cases, and the results here unify and extend all these
previous results to the above general Sturm-Liouville-type boundary conditions.
