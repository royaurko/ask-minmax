We present a KL-control treatment of the fundamental problem of erasing a
bit. We introduce notions of \textbf{reliability} of information storage via a
reliability timescale $\tau_r$, and speed of erasing via an erasing timescale
$\tau_e$. Our problem formulation captures the tradeoff between speed,
reliability, and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) cost required to erase a bit. We
show that erasing a reliable bit fast costs at least $\log 2 - \log\left(1 -
\operatorname{e}^{-\frac{\tau_e}{\tau_r}}\right) > \log 2$, which goes to
$\frac{1}{2} \log\frac{2\tau_r}{\tau_e}$ when $\tau_r>>\tau_e$.
