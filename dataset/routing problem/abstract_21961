We consider the problem of the construction of the goodness-of-fit tests for
diffusion processes with {\it small noise}. The basic hypothesis is composite
parametric and our goal is to obtain asymptotically distribution free tests. We
propose two solutions. The first one is based on the change of time and the
second test we obtain with the help of some linear transformation of the
``natural'' statistics.
