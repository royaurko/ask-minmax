Here we treat the problem: given a torsion-free connection do its geodesics,
as unparametrised curves, coincide with the geodesics of an Einstein metric? We
find projective invariants such that the vanishing of these is necessary for
the existence of such a metric, and in generic settings the vanishing of these
is also sufficient. We also obtain results for the problem of metrisability
(without the Einstein condition): We show that the odd Chern type invariants of
an affine connection are projective invariants that obstruct the existence of a
projectively related Levi-Civita connection. In addition we discuss a concrete
link between projective and conformal geometry and the application of this to
the projective-Einstein problem.
