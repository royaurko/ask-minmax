The cosmological constant appearing in the Wheeler-De Witt equation is
considered as an eigenvalue of the associated Sturm-Liouville problem. A
variational approach with Gaussian trial wave functionals is used as a method
to study such a problem. We approximate the equation to one loop in a
Schwarzschild background and a zeta function regularization is involved to
handle with divergences. The regularization is closely related to the
subtraction procedure appearing in the computation of Casimir energy in a
curved background. A renormalization procedure is introduced to remove the
infinities together with a renormalization group equation. The case of massive
gravitons is discussed.
