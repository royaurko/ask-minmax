Given a dictionary that consists of multiple blocks and a signal that lives
in the range space of only a few blocks, we study the problem of finding a
block-sparse representation of the signal, i.e., a representation that uses the
minimum number of blocks. Motivated by signal/image processing and computer
vision applications, such as face recognition, we consider the block-sparse
recovery problem in the case where the number of atoms in each block is
arbitrary, possibly much larger than the dimension of the underlying subspace.
To find a block-sparse representation of a signal, we propose two classes of
non-convex optimization programs, which aim to minimize the number of nonzero
coefficient blocks and the number of nonzero reconstructed vectors from the
blocks, respectively. Since both classes of problems are NP-hard, we propose
convex relaxations and derive conditions under which each class of the convex
programs is equivalent to the original non-convex formulation. Our conditions
depend on the notions of mutual and cumulative subspace coherence of a
dictionary, which are natural generalizations of existing notions of mutual and
cumulative coherence. We evaluate the performance of the proposed convex
programs through simulations as well as real experiments on face recognition.
We show that treating the face recognition problem as a block-sparse recovery
problem improves the state-of-the-art results by 10% with only 25% of the
training data.
