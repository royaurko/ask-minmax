We solve a class of control problems with fuel constraint by means of the
log-Laplace transforms of $J$-functionals of Dawson-Watanabe superprocesses.
This solution is related to the superprocess solution of quasilinear parabolic
PDEs with singular terminal condition. For the probabilistic verification
proof, we develop sharp bounds on the blow-up behavior of log-Laplace
functionals of $J$-functionals, which might be of independent interest.
