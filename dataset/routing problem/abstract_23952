Recent analyses of multifragmentation in terms of Fisher's model and the
related construction of a phase diagram brings forth the problem of the true
existence of the vapor phase and the meaning of its associated pressure. Our
analysis shows that a thermal emission picture is equivalent to a Fisher-like
equilibrium description which avoids the problem of the vapor and explains the
recently observed Boltzmann-like distribution of the emission times. In this
picture a simple Fermi gas thermometric relation is naturally justified. Low
energy compound nucleus emission of intermediate mass fragments is shown to
scale according to Fisher's formula and can be simultaneously fit with the much
higher energy ISiS multifragmentation data.
