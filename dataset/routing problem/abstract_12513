Existing methods of providing data anonymity preserve individual privacy,
but, the task of protecting respondent groups' information in publicly
available datasets remains open. Group anonymity lies in hiding (masking) data
patterns that cannot be revealed by analyzing individual records. We discuss
main corresponding problems, and provide methods for solving each one.
Keywords: group anonymity, wavelet transform.
