Determining the heating mechanism (or mechanisms) that causes the outer
atmosphere of the Sun, and many other stars, to reach temperatures orders of
magnitude higher than their surface temperatures has long been a key problem.
For decades the problem has been known as the coronal heating problem, but it
is now clear that `coronal heating' cannot be treated or explained in isolation
and that the heating of the whole solar atmosphere must be studied as a highly
coupled system. The magnetic field of the star is known to play a key role,
but, despite significant advancements in solar telescopes, computing power and
much greater understanding of theoretical mechanisms, the question of which
mechanism or mechanisms are the dominant supplier of energy to the chromosphere
and corona is still open. Following substantial recent progress, we consider
the most likely contenders and discuss the key factors that have made, and
still make, determining the actual (coronal) heating mechanism (or mechanisms)
so difficult.
