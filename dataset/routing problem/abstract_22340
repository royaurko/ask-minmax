A procedure and theoretical results are presented for the problem of
determining a minimal robust positively invariant (RPI) set for a linear
discrete-time system subject to unknown, bounded disturbances. The procedure
computes, via the solving of a single LP, a polytopic RPI set that is minimal
with respect to the family of RPI sets generated from a finite number of
inequalities with pre-defined normal vectors.
