Certain endgame considerations in the two-player Nigerian Mancala-type game
Ayo can be identified with the problem of finding winning positions in the
solitaire game Tchoukaitlon. The periodicity of the pit occupancies in $s$
stone winning positions is determined. Given $n$ pits, the number of stones in
a winning position is found to be asymptotically bounded by $n^{2}/\pi$.
