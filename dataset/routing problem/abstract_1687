We report $^{23}$Na and $^{59}$Co nuclear magnetic (NMR) and quadrupolar
resonance (NQR) studies for the $x=2/3$ phase of the lamellar oxide
Na$_{x}$CoO$_{2}$, which allowed us to establish reliably the atomic order of
the Na layers and their stacking between the CoO$_{2}$ slabs. We evidence that
the Na$^{+}$ order stabilizes filled non magnetic Co$^{3+}$ ions on 25% of the
cobalt sites arranged in a triangular sublattice. The transferred holes are
delocalized on the 75% complementary cobalt sites which unexpectedly display a
planar cobalt kagom\'{e} structure. These experimental results resolve a
puzzling issue by precluding localized moments pictures for the magnetic
properties. They establish that the quasi ferromagnetic properties result from
a narrow band connecting a frustrated arrangement of atomic orbitals, and open
the route to unravel through similar studies the electronic properties of the
diverse ordered phases of sodium cobaltates.
