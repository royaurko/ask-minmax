This paper describes a fourth-order integration algorithm for the
gravitational N-body problem based on discrete Lagrangian mechanics. When used
with shared timesteps, the algorithm is momentum conserving and symplectic. We
generalize the algorithm to handle individual time steps; this introduces
fifth-order errors in angular momentum conservation and symplecticity. We show
that using adaptive block power of two timesteps does not increase the error in
symplecticity. In contrast to other high-order, symplectic, individual
timestep, momentum-preserving algorithms, the algorithm takes only forward
timesteps. We compare a code integrating an N-body system using the algorithm
with a direct-summation force calculation to standard stellar cluster
simulation codes. We find that our algorithm has about 1.5 orders of magnitude
better symplecticity and momentum conservation errors than standard algorithms
for equivalent numbers of force evaluations and equivalent energy conservation
errors.
