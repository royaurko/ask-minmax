Let $A$ be a Banach algebra and $A^{**}$ be the second dual of it. We show
that by some new conditions, $A$ is weakly amenable whenever $A^{**}$ is weakly
amenable. We will study this problem under generalization, that is, if
$(n+2)-th$ dual of $A$, $A^{(n+2)}$, is $T-S-$weakly amenable, then $A^{(n)}$
is $T-S-$weakly amenable where $T$ and $S$ are continuous linear mappings from
$A^{(n)}$ into $A^{(n)}$.
