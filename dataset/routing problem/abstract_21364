We present a reduced basis method for the simulation of American option
pricing. To tackle this model numerically, we formulate the problem in terms of
a time dependent variational inequality. Characteristic ingredients are a
POD-greedy and an angle-greedy procedure for the construction of the primal and
dual reduced spaces. Numerical examples are provided, illustrating the
approximation quality and convergence of our approach.
