The problem of equilibrium of a plasma in a Tokamak is a free boundary
problemdescribed by the Grad-Shafranov equation in axisymmetric configurations.
The right hand side of this equation is a non linear source, which represents
the toroidal component of the plasma current density. This paper deals with the
real time identification of this non linear source from experimental
measurements. The proposed method is based on a fixed point algorithm, a finite
element resolution, a reduced basis method and a least-square optimization
formulation.
