In the present work we report on a genuine route by which a high-dimensional
(with d>4) chaotic attractor is created directly, i.e., without a
low-dimensional chaotic attractor as an intermediate step. The high-dimensional
chaotic set is created in a heteroclinic global bifurcation that yields an
infinite number of unstable tori.The mechanism is illustrated using a system
constructed by coupling three Lorenz oscillators. So, the route presented here
can be considered a prototype for high-dimensional chaotic behavior just as the
Lorenz model is for low-dimensional chaos.
