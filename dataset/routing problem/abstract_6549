We give a prescription for how to compute the Callias index, using as
regulator an exponential function. We find agreement with old results in all
odd dimensions. We show that the problem of computing the dimension of the
moduli space of self-dual strings can be formulated as an index problem in
even-dimensional (loop-)space. We think that the regulator used in this Letter
can be applied to this index problem.
