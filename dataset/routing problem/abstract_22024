A class of photoacoustic acquisition geometries in n-space is considered such
that the spherical mean transform admits an exact filtered back projection
reconstruction formula. The reconstruction is interpreted as a time reversion
mirror that reproduces exactly an arbitrary source distribution in the cavity.
A series of examples of non-uniqueness of the inverse potential problem is
constructed basing on the same geometrical technique.
