We construct spherically symmetric solutions to the Einstein-Euler equations,
which contains a positive cosmological constant, say, the Einstein-Euler-de
Sitter equations. We assume a realistic barotropic equation of state.
Equilibria of the spherically symmetric Einstein-Euler-de Sitter equations are
given by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff-de Sitter equation. We can construct
solutions near time periodic linearized solutions around the equilibrium. The
Cauchy problem around the equilibrium can be solved. This work can be
considered as a trial of the generalization of the previous work on the problem
without cosmological constants.
