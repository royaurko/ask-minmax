Gossip algorithms for distributed computation are attractive due to their
simplicity, distributed nature, and robustness in noisy and uncertain
environments. However, using standard gossip algorithms can lead to a
significant waste in energy by repeatedly recirculating redundant information.
For realistic sensor network model topologies like grids and random geometric
graphs, the inefficiency of gossip schemes is related to the slow mixing times
of random walks on the communication graph. We propose and analyze an
alternative gossiping scheme that exploits geographic information. By utilizing
geographic routing combined with a simple resampling method, we demonstrate
substantial gains over previously proposed gossip protocols. For regular graphs
such as the ring or grid, our algorithm improves standard gossip by factors of
$n$ and $\sqrt{n}$ respectively. For the more challenging case of random
geometric graphs, our algorithm computes the true average to accuracy
$\epsilon$ using $O(\frac{n^{1.5}}{\sqrt{\log n}} \log \epsilon^{-1})$ radio
transmissions, which yields a $\sqrt{\frac{n}{\log n}}$ factor improvement over
standard gossip algorithms. We illustrate these theoretical results with
experimental comparisons between our algorithm and standard methods as applied
to various classes of random fields.
