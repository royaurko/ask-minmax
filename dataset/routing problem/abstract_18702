Bender-Canfield showed that a plethora of graph counting problems in
oriented/unoriented surfaces involve two constants $t_g$ and $p_g$ for the
oriented and the unoriented case respectively. T.T.Q. Le and the contributors
recently discovered a hidden relation between the sequence $t_g$ and a formal
power series solution $u(z)$ of the Painlev\'e I equation which, among other
things, allows to give exact asymptotic expansion of $t_g$ to all orders in
$1/g$ for large $g$. The paper introduces a formal power series solution $v(z)$
of a Riccati equation, gives a nonlinear recursion for its coefficients and an
exact asymptotic expansion to all orders in $g$ for large $g$, using the theory
of Borel transforms. In addition, we conjecture a precise relation between the
sequence $p_g$ and $v(z)$. Our conjecture is motivated by the enumerative
aspects of a quartic matrix model for real symmetric matrices, and the analytic
properties of its double scaling limit. In particular, the matrix model
provides a computation of the number of rooted quadrangulations in the
2-dimensional projective plane. Our conjecture implies analyticity of the
$\mathrm{O}(N)$ and $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$-types of free energy of an arbitrary
closed 3-manifold in a neighborhood of zero. Finally, we give a matrix model
calculation of the Stokes constants, pose several problems that can be answered
by the Riemann-Hilbert approach, and provide ample numerical evidence for our
results.
