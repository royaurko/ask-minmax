The general self-adjoint elliptic boundary value problems are considered in a
domain $G\subset \Bbb R^{n+1}$ with finitely many cylindrical ends. The
coefficients are stabilizing (as $x\to\infty$, $x\in G$) so slowly that we can
only describe some ``structure'' of solutions far from the origin. This problem
may be understood as a model of ``generalized branching waveguide.'' We
introduce a notion of the energy flow through the cross-sections of the
cylindrical ends and define outgoing and incoming ``waves.'' An augmented
scattering matrix is introduced. Analyzing the spectrum of this matrix one can
find the number of linearly independent solutions to the homogeneous problem
decreasing at infinity with a given rate. We discuss the statement of problem
with so-called radiation conditions and enumerate self-adjoint extensions of
the operator of the problem.
