We describe a class of integrable models of 1+1 and 1-dimensional dilaton
gravity coupled to scalar fields. The models can be derived from high
dimensional supergravity theories by dimensional reductions. The equations of
motion of these models reduce to systems of the Liouville equations endowed
with energy and momentum constraints. We construct the general solution of the
1+1 dimensional problem in terms of chiral moduli fields and establish its
simple reduction to static black holes (dimension 0+1), and cosmological models
(dimension 1+0). We also discuss some general problems of dimensional reduction
and relations between static and cosmological solutions.
