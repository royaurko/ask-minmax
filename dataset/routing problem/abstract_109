In this paper we consider an integrated model for TCP/IP protocols with
multipath routing. The model combines a Network Utility Maximization for rate
control based on end-to-end queuing delays, with a Markovian Traffic
Equilibrium for routing based on total expected delays. We prove the existence
of a unique equilibrium state which is characterized as the solution of an
unconstrained strictly convex program. A distributed algorithm for solving this
optimization problem is proposed, with a brief discussion of how it can be
implemented by adapting the current Internet protocols.
