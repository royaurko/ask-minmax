In this talk I show how to canonically quantize a massless scalar field in
the background of a Schwarzschild black hole in Lema\^itre coordinates and then
present a simplified derivation of Hawking radiation based upon this procedure.
The key result of quantization procedure is that the Hamiltonian of the system
is explicitly time dependent and so problem is intrinsically non-static. From
this it follows that, although a unitary time-development operator exists, it
is not useful to talk about vacuum states; rather, one should focus attention
on steady state phenomena such as the Hawking radiation. In order to clarify
the approximations used to study this problem I begin by discussing the related
problem of the massless scalar field theory calculated in the presence of a
moving mirror.
