We study the exponential stability of evolutionary equations. The focus is
laid on second order problems and we provide a way to rewrite them as a
suitable first order evolutionary equation, for which the stability can be
proved by using frequency domain methods. The problem class under consideration
is broad enough to cover integro-differential equations, delay-equations and
classical evolution equations within a unified framework.
