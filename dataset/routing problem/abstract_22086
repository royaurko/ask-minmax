In this work we study the problem of adaptive MPC for linear time-invariant
uncertain models. We assume linear models with parametric uncertainties, and
propose an iterative multi-variable extremum seeking (MES)-based learning MPC
algorithm to learn on-line the uncertain parameters and update the MPC model.
We show the effectiveness of this algorithm on a DC servo motor control
example.
