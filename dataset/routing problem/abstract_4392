We introduce a restricted four body problem in a 2+2 configuration extending
the classical Sitnikov problem to the Double Sitnikov problem. The secondary
bodies are moving on the same perpendicular line to the planewhere the
primaries evolve, so almost every solution is a collision orbit. We extend the
solutions beyond collisions with a symplectic regularization and study the set
of energy surfaces that contain periodic orbits.
