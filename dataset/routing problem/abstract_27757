We address the problem of Compressed Sensing (CS) with side information.
Namely, when reconstructing a target CS signal, we assume access to a similar
signal. This additional knowledge, the side information, is integrated into CS
via L1-L1 and L1-L2 minimization. We then provide lower bounds on the number of
measurements that these problems require for successful reconstruction of the
target signal. If the side information has good quality, the number of
measurements is significantly reduced via L1-L1 minimization, but not so much
via L1-L2 minimization. We provide geometrical interpretations and experimental
results illustrating our findings.
