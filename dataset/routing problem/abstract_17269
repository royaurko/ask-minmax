In this paper we investigate from first principles the effect of the
electron-phonon interaction in two paradigmatic nanostructures:
trans-polyacetylene and polyethylene. We found that the strong electron-phonon
interaction leads to the appearance of complex structures in the frequency
dependent electronic self-energy. Those structures rule out any quasi-particle
picture, and make the adiabatic and static approximations commonly used in the
well-established Heine Allen Cardona (HAC) approach inadequate. We propose,
instead, a fully ab-initio dynamical formulation of the problem within the Many
Body Perturbation Theory framework. The present dynamical theory reveals that
the structures appearing in the electronic self-energy are connected to the
existence of packets of correlated electron/phonon states. These states appear
in the spectral functions even at $T=0\,K$, revealing the key role played by
the zero point motion effect. We give a physical interpretation of these states
by disclosing their internal composition by mapping the Many Body problem to
the solution of an eigenvalue problem.
