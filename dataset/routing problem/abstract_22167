We consider the Kudryashov-Sinelshchikov equation, which contains nonlinear
dispersive effects. We prove that as the diffusion parameter tends to zero, the
solutions of the dispersive equation coverge to the entropy ones of the Burgers
equation. The proof relies on deriving suitable a priori estimates together
with an application of the compansated compactness method in the L^p setting.
