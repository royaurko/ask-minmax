Mobile ad hoc networks communicate without any fixed infrastructure or ant
centralized domain. All the nodes are free to move randomly within the network
and share information dynamically. To achieve an efficient routing various
protocols have been developed so far which vary in their nature and have their
own salient properties. In this paper, we have discussed one of the latest
protocols i.e. Dynamic Manet on demand (DYMO) routing Protocol, implemented and
analysed its performance with other similar protocols against different
parameters. Finally a comparison has been presented between all of them.
