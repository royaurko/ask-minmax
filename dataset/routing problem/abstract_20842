It is shown that the sharp constant in the Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya inequality on
the three dimensional upper half space is given by the Sobolev constant. This
is achieved by a duality argument relating the problem to a
Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev type inequality whose sharp constant is determined as
well.
