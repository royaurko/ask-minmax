In this paper, we present the convergence analysis of the rectangular Morley
element scheme utilised on the second order problem in arbitrary dimensions.
Specifically, we prove that the convergence of the scheme is of
$\mathcal{O}(h)$ order in energy norm and of $\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ order in $L^2$
norm on general $d$-rectangular grids. Moreover, when the grid is uniform, the
convergence rate can be of $\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ order in energy norm, and the
convergence rate in $L^2$ norm is still of $\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ order, which can
not be improved. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate our
theoretical results.
