In the paper the Dirichlet problem with non-classical conditions not
requiring agreement conditions is considered for a fourth order pseudoparabolic
equation with non-classical coefficients. The equivalence of these conditions
with the classic boundary conditions is substantiated in the case if the
solution of the stated problem is sought in S.L.Sobolev isotropic space.
