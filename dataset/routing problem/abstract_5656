A fundamental problem in differential geometry is to characterize intrinsic
metrics on a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold ${\mathcal M}^2$ which can be
realized as isometric immersions into $\R^3$. This problem can be formulated as
initial and/or boundary value problems for a system of nonlinear partial
differential equations of mixed elliptic-hyperbolic type whose mathematical
theory is largely incomplete. In this paper, we develop a general approach,
which combines a fluid dynamic formulation of balance laws for the
Gauss-Codazzi system with a compensated compactness framework, to deal with the
initial and/or boundary value problems for isometric immersions in $\R^3$. The
compensated compactness framework formed here is a natural formulation to
ensure the weak continuity of the Gauss-Codazzi system for approximate
solutions, which yields the isometric realization of two-dimensional surfaces
in $\R^3$. As a first application of this approach, we study the isometric
immersion problem for two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with strictly
negative Gauss curvature. We prove that there exists a $C^{1,1}$ isometric
immersion of the two-dimensional manifold in $\R^3$ satisfying our prescribed
initial conditions. T
