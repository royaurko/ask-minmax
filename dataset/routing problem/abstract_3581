The purpose of this paper is to study ?nite dimensional equivariant moduli
problems from the viewpoint of strati?cation theory. We show that there exists
a strati- ?ed obstruction system for a ?nite dimensional equivariant moduli
problem. In addition, we de?ne a coindex for a G-vector bundle which is
determined by the G-action on the vector bundle and prove that if the coindex
of an oriented equivariant moduli problem is bigger than 1, then we obtain an
invariant Euler cycle via equivariant perturbation. In particular, we get a
localization formula for the strati?ed transversal intersection of S1-moduli
problems.
