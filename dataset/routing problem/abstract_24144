We develop techniques to compute the one-loop anomalous dimensions of
operators in the ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory that are dual to open
strings ending on boundstates of sphere giant gravitons. Our results, which are
applicable to excitations involving an arbitrary number of open strings,
generalize the single string results of hep-th/0701067. The open strings we
consider carry angular momentum on an S$^3$ embedded in the S$^5$ of the
AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ background. The problem of computing the one loop anomalous
dimensions is replaced with the problem of diagonalizing an interacting Cuntz
oscillator Hamiltonian. Our Cuntz oscillator dynamics illustrates how the
Chan-Paton factors for open strings propagating on multiple branes can arise
dynamically.
