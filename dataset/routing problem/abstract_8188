The classical two-capacitor problem shows a mysterious lose of energy even
under lossless conditions and questions the basic understanding of energy
relation in a capacitor. Here, we present a solution to the classical
two-capacitor problem. We find that by reinterpreting the energy calculations
we achieve no lose of energy thereby obeying the conservation of energy law.
