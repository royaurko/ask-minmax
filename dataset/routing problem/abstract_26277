The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) provides a highly efficient computational
tool for solving constant coefficient partial differential equations (e.g. the
Poisson equation) on infinite domains. The solution to such an equation is
given as the convolution between a fundamental solution and the given data
function, and the FMM is used to rapidly evaluate the sum resulting upon
discretization of the integral. This paper describes an analogous procedure for
rapidly solving elliptic \textit{difference} equations on infinite lattices. In
particular, a fast summation technique for a discrete equivalent of the
continuum fundamental solution is constructed. The asymptotic complexity of the
proposed method is $O(N_{\rm source})$, where $N_{\rm source}$ is the number of
points subject to body loads. This is in contrast to FFT based methods which
solve a lattice Poisson problem at a cost $O(N_{\Omega}\log N_{\Omega})$
independent of $N_{\rm source}$, where $\Omega$ is an artificial rectangular
box containing the loaded points and $N_{\Omega}$ is the number of points in
$\Omega$.
