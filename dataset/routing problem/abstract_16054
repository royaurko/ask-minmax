We propose a novel distributed resource allocation scheme for the up-link of
a cellular multi-carrier system based on the message passing (MP) algorithm. In
the proposed approach each transmitter iteratively sends and receives
information messages to/from the base station with the goal of achieving an
optimal resource allocation strategy. The exchanged messages are the solution
of small distributed allocation problems. To reduce the computational load, the
MP problems at the terminals follow a dynamic programming formulation. The
advantage of the proposed scheme is that it distributes the computational
effort among all the transmitters in the cell and it does not require the
presence of a central controller that takes all the decisions. Numerical
results show that the proposed approach is an excellent solution to the
resource allocation problem for cellular multi-carrier systems.
