Modern scientific repositories are growing rapidly in size. Scientists are
increasingly interested in viewing the latest data as part of query results.
Current scientific middleware cache systems, however, assume repositories are
static. Thus, they cannot answer scientific queries with the latest data. The
queries, instead, are routed to the repository until data at the cache is
refreshed. In data-intensive scientific disciplines, such as astronomy,
indiscriminate query routing or data refreshing often results in runaway
network costs. This severely affects the performance and scalability of the
repositories and makes poor use of the cache system. We present Delta, a
dynamic data middleware cache system for rapidly-growing scientific
repositories. Delta's key component is a decision framework that adaptively
decouples data objects---choosing to keep some data object at the cache, when
they are heavily queried, and keeping some data objects at the repository, when
they are heavily updated. Our algorithm profiles incoming workload to search
for optimal data decoupling that reduces network costs. It leverages formal
concepts from the network flow problem, and is robust to evolving scientific
workloads. We evaluate the efficacy of Delta, through a prototype
implementation, by running query traces collected from a real astronomy survey.
