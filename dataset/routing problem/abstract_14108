The max-Lukasiewicz semiring is defined as the unit interval [0,1] equipped
with the arithmetics "a+b"=max(a,b) and "ab"=max(0,a+b-1). Linear algebra over
this semiring can be developed in the usual way. We observe that any problem of
the max-Lukasiewicz linear algebra can be equivalently formulated as a problem
of the tropical (max-plus) linear algebra. Based on this equivalence, we
develop a theory of the matrix powers and the eigenproblem over the
max-Lukasiewicz semiring.
