Let $f:[0,+\infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ be a (locally) Lipschitz function and
$\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ a $C^{1,\alpha}$ domain whose boundary is
unbounded and connected. If there exists a positive bounded solution to the
overdetermined elliptic problem $$ \left\{\begin{array} {ll} \Delta u + f(u) =
0 & \mbox{in }\; \Omega
  \\ u= 0\, \, \, , \, \, \, \frac{\partial u}{\partial \vec{\nu}}=1 &\mbox{on
}\; \partial \Omega \end{array}\right. $$ we prove that $\Omega$ is a
half-plane. In particular, we obtain a partial answer to a question raised by
H. Berestycki, L. Caffarelli and L. Nirenberg in 1997.
