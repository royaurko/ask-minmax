The problem of determining the ground state of a $d$-dimensional interface
embedded in a $(d+1)$-dimensional random medium is treated numerically. Using a
minimum-cut algorithm, the exact ground states can be found for a number of
problems for which other numerical methods are inexact and slow. In particular,
results are presented for the roughness exponents and ground-state energy
fluctuations in a random bond Ising model. It is found that the roughness
exponent $\zeta = 0.41 \pm 0.01, 0.22 \pm 0.01$, with the related energy
exponent being $\theta = 0.84 \pm 0.03, 1.45 \pm 0.04$, in $d = 2, 3$,
respectively. These results are compared with previous analytical and numerical
estimates.
