We present a controller synthesis algorithm for a discrete time reach-avoid
problem in the presence of adversaries. Our model of the adversary captures
typical malicious attacks envisioned on cyber-physical systems such as sensor
spoofing, controller corruption, and actuator intrusion. After formulating the
problem in a general setting, we present a sound and complete algorithm for the
case with linear dynamics and an adversary with a budget on the total L2-norm
of its actions. The algorithm relies on a result from linear control theory
that enables us to decompose and precisely compute the reachable states of the
system in terms of a symbolic simulation of the adversary-free dynamics and the
total uncertainty induced by the adversary. With this decomposition, the
synthesis problem eliminates the universal quantifier on the adversary's
choices and the symbolic controller actions can be effectively solved using an
SMT solver. The constraints induced by the adversary are computed by solving
second-order cone programmings. The algorithm is later extended to synthesize
state-dependent controller and to generate attacks for the adversary. We
present preliminary experimental results that show the effectiveness of this
approach on several example problems.
