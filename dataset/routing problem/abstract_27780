Multi-dimensional weighted Markov decision processes (MDPs) are useful to
analyze systems with multiple objectives that are potentially conflicting and
make necessary the analysis of trade-offs. In this paper, we study the
complexity of percentile queries in such MDPs and provide algorithms to
synthesize strategies that enforce such constraints. Given a multi-dimensional
weighted MDP and a quantitative payoff function $f$, quantitative thresholds
$v_i$ (one per dimension), and probability thresholds $\alpha_i$, we show how
to compute a single strategy that enforces that for all dimension $i$, the
probability that an outcome $\rho$ satisfies $f_i(\rho) \geq v_i$ is at least
$\alpha_i$. We study this problem for the classical quantitative payoffs
studied in the literature (sup, inf, lim sup, lim inf, mean-payoff, truncated
sum, discounted sum). So our work can be seen as an extension to the
quantitative case of the multi-objective model checking problem on MDPs studied
by Etessami et al. in unweighted MDPs.
