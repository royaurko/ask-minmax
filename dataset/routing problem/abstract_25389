In this work, a coding technique called cost constrained Geometric Huffman
coding (ccGhc) is developed. ccGhc minimizes the Kullback-Leibler distance
between a dyadic probability mass function (pmf) and a target pmf subject to an
affine inequality constraint. An analytical proof is given that when ccGhc is
applied to blocks of symbols, the optimum is asymptotically achieved when the
blocklength goes to infinity. The derivation of ccGhc is motivated by the
problem of encoding a text to a sequence of slats subject to architectural
design criteria. For the considered architectural problem, for a blocklength of
3, the codes found by ccGhc match the design criteria. For communications
channels with average cost constraints, ccGhc can be used to efficiently find
prefix-free modulation codes that are provably capacity achieving.
