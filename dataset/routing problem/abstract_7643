The contributors give the definition and property of a bit-pair shadow, and design
the three algorithms of a public key cryptoscheme that is based on a
multivariate permutation problem (MPP) and an anomalous subset product problem
(ASPP) to which no subexponential time solutions are found so far, and regards
a bit-pair as an operation unit. Further, demonstrate that the decryption
algorithm is correct, deduce the probability that a plaintext solution is
nonunique is nearly zero, dissect the running times of the three algorithms,
analyze the security of the new scheme against extracting a private key from a
public key and recovering a related plaintext from a ciphertext by LLL lattice
basis reduction, meet-in-the-middle dichotomy, and adaptive-chosen-ciphertext
approach on the assumption that an integer factorization problem, a discrete
logarithm problem, and a low-density subset sum problem can be solved
efficiently, and prove that new scheme using random both padding and
permutation is semantically secure. Meantime, give a conversion from an ASPP to
an anomalous subset sum problem (ASSP). The analysis shows that the bit-pair
method increases the density of a related ASSP knapsack to D > 1, and decreases
the modulus length of the new scheme to lgM = 464, 544, or 640 corresponding to
n = 80, 96, or 112 separately.
