Electric field effects in ferromagnetic/oxide dielectric structures provide a
new route to control domain wall (DW) dynamics with low power dissipation.
However, electric field effect on DW velocity has been only observed so far in
the creep regime where DW velocity is low due to a strong interaction with
pinning sites. Here, we show gate voltage modulation of DW velocity within the
creep, intermediate depinning, depinning and flow regimes with velocities up to
20 m/s in Ta/Co40Fe40B20/MgO/TiO2 structures with perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy. We demonstrate a universal description of this effect over the full
range of DW dynamics by taking into account an effective magnetic field being
linear with the electric field. Our work opens new opportunities for the study
and optimization of electric field effect at ferromagnetic metal/insulator
interfaces.
