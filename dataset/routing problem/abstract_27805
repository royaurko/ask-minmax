The problem of finding an optimal sensing schedule for a mobile device that
encounters an intermittent WiFi access opportunity is considered. At any given
time, the WiFi is in any of the two modes, ON or OFF, and the mobile's
incentive is to connect to the WiFi in the ON mode as soon as possible, while
spending as little sensing energy. We introduce a dynamic programming framework
which enables the characterization of an explicit solution for several models,
particularly when the OFF periods are exponentially distributed. While the
problem for non-exponential OFF periods is ill-posed in general, a usual
workaround in literature is to make the mobile device aware if one ON period is
completely missed. In this restricted setting, using the DP framework, the
deterministic nature of the optimal sensing policy is established, and value
iterations are shown to converge to the optimal solution. Finally, we address
the blind situation where the distributions of ON and OFF periods are unknown.
A continuous bandit based learning algorithm that has vanishing regret (loss
compared to the optimal strategy with the knowledge of distributions) is
presented, and comparisons with the optimal schemes are provided for
exponential ON and OFF times.
