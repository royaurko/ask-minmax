We prove that there exists a dimension group $G$ whose positive cone is not
isomorphic to the dimension monoid Dim$L$ of any lattice $L$. The dimension
group $G$ has an order-unit, and can be taken of any cardinality greater than
or equal to $\aleph\_2$. As to determining the positive cones of dimension
groups in the range of the Dim functor, the $\aleph\_2$ bound is optimal. This
solves negatively the problem, raised by the contributor in 1998, whether any
conical refinement monoid is isomorphic to the dimension monoid of some
lattice. Since $G$ has an order-unit of index two, this also solves negatively
a problem raised in 1994 by K.R. Goodearl about representability, with respect
to $K\_0$, of dimension groups with order-unit of index 2 by unit-regular
rings.
