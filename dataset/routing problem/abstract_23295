The current status of oscillation solutions to the Solar Neutrino Problem is
reviewed. Four oscillation solutions are discussed in the light of 708d
Superkamiokande data: MSW, Just-So VO, VO with Energy-Independent Suppression
(EIS) and Resonant-Spin-Flavor-Precession (RSFP). Only EIS VO is strongly
disfavoured by the global rates, mostly due to the Homestake data. Vacuum
oscillations give an interesting solution which explains high-energy excess of
events observed by Superkamiokande and predicts {\em semi-annual} seasonal
variation of $Be$-neutrino flux. There are indications to these variations in
the GALLEX and Homestake data. No direct evidence for oscillation is found yet.
