This is a problem list in the theory of foliations and laminations of
3-manifolds. The focus is on the relationship of foliations and laminations
with other aspects of 3-manifold topology, especially with the Thurston theory
of geometric structures. This problem list is not meant to be comprehensive;
rather it focusses on research areas that currently seem (to the contributor)
particularly promising.
