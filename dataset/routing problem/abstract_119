We present approximation algorithms for the directed Rural Postman problem
(DRPP), the mixed, windy Rural Postman problem (MWRPP), and the mixed, windy
Capacitated Arc Routing problem (MWCARP). We show that
$\alpha(n)$-approximations for $n$-vertex metric asymmetric TSP
($\triangle$-ATSP) yield $(\alpha(C) + 1)$-approximations for DRPP,
$(\alpha(C)+3)$-approximations for MWRPP, and $O(\alpha(C+1))$-approximations
for MWCARP, where $C$ is the number of weakly connected components induced by
positive-demand edges and arcs. Combining this with a result from the
literature, we obtain $O(\log C/\log \log C)$-approximations for each of the
considered problems, which improves to polynomial-time constant-factor
approximations if $C \in O(\log n)$. Moreover, since $\alpha$-approximations
for DRPP yield $\alpha$-approximations for $\triangle$-ATSP, our result shows
that $\triangle$-ATSP and MWCARP are approximation-equivalent up to small
factors.
