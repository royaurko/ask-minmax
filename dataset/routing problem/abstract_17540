Numerous approximation algorithms for problems on geometric intersection
graphs have been proposed in the literature, exhibiting a sharp trade-off
between running times and approximation ratios. We introduce a method to obtain
linear-time constant-factor approximation algorithms for such problems. To
illustrate its applicability, we obtain results for three well-known
optimization problems on two classes of geometric intersection graphs. Among
such results, our method yields linear-time (4+eps)-approximations for the
maximum-weight independent set and the minimum dominating set of unit disk
graphs, thus bringing dramatic performance improvements when compared to
previous algorithms that achieve the same approximation ratios.
