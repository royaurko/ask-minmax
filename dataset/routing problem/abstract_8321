In this paper, we prove that there exists a unique weak solution to the mixed
boundary value problem for a general class of semilinear second order elliptic
partial differential equations with singular coefficients. Our approach is
probabilistic. The theory of Dirichlet forms and backward stochastic
differential equations with singular coefficients and infinite horizon plays a
crucial role.
