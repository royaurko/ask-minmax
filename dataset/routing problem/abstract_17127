This work studies the problem of simultaneously separating and reconstructing
signals from compressively sensed linear mixtures. We assume that all source
signals share a common sparse representation basis. The approach combines
classical Compressive Sensing (CS) theory with a linear mixing model. It allows
the mixtures to be sampled independently of each other. If samples are acquired
in the time domain, this means that the sensors need not be synchronized. Since
Blind Source Separation (BSS) from a linear mixture is only possible up to
permutation and scaling, factoring out these ambiguities leads to a
minimization problem on the so-called oblique manifold. We develop a geometric
conjugate subgradient method that scales to large systems for solving the
problem. Numerical results demonstrate the promising performance of the
proposed algorithm compared to several state of the art methods.
