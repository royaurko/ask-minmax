The simulation of the metabolism in mammalian cells becomes a severe problem
if spatial distributions must be taken into account. Especially the cytoplasm
has a very complex geometric structure which cannot be handled by standard
discretization techniques. In the present paper we propose a homogenization
technique for computing effective diffusion constants. This is accomplished by
using a two-step strategy. The first step consists of an analytic
homogenization from the smallest to an intermediate scale. The homogenization
error is estimated by comparing the analytic diffusion constant with a
numerical estimate obtained by using real cell geometries. The second step
consists of a random homogenization. Since no analytical solution is known to
this homogenization problem, a numerical approximation algorithm is proposed.
Although rather expensive this algorithm provides a reasonable estimate of the
homogenized diffusion constant.
