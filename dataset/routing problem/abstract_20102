We apply model theoretic methods to the problem of existence of countable
universal graphs with finitely many forbidden connected subgraphs. We show
that to a large extent the question reduces to one of local finiteness of an
associated''algebraic closure'' operator. The main applications are new
examples of universal graphs with forbidden subgraphs and simplified
treatments of some previously known cases.
