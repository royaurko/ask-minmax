Let A be a C_0(X)-algebra. Then the multiplier algebra M(A) is a C(Y)-algebra
in a natural way, where Y is the Stone-Cech compactification of X. Each x in X
gives rise to an ideal J_x of A and an ideal H_x of M(A). The ideal J_x is
contained in H_x, and H_x is contained in the strict closure of J_x in M(A).
This paper studies the problem of determining when H_x is equal to the strict
closure of J_x. THis can be interpreted as a problem of spectral synthesis
type.
