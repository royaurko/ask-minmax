In this work we consider optimal stopping problems with conditional convex
risk measures called optimised certainty equivalents. Without assuming any kind
of time-consistency for the underlying family of risk measures, we derive a
novel representation for the solution of the optimal stopping problem. In
particular, we generalise the additive dual representation of Rogers (2002) to
the case of optimal stopping under uncertainty. Finally, we develop several
Monte Carlo algorithms and illustrate their power for optimal stopping under
Average Value at Risk.
