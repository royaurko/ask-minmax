We consider the problem of estimating the parameter $\fnl$ in the standard
local model of primordial CMB non-Gaussianity. We determine the properties of
maximum likelihood (ML) estimates and show that the problem is not the typical
ML estimation problem as there are subtle issues involved. In particular, The
Cramer-Rao inequality is not applicable and the likelihood function is
unbounded with several points of maxima. However, the particular
characteristics of the likelihood function lead to ML estimates that are simple
and easy to compute. We compare their performance to that of moment estimators.
We find that ML is better than the latter for values $\fnl$ away from the
origin. For small values of $\fnl$, the fifth order moment is better than ML
and the other moment estimators. However, we show how for small $\fnl$, one can
easily improve the estimators by a simple shrinkage procedure. This is clearly
important when the goal is to estimate a very small $\fnl$. In the process of
studying the inference problem, we address some basic issues regarding
statistical estimation in general that were raised at the Workshop on
Non-Gaussianity in Cosmology held in Trieste in July 2006.
