Current paper discusses the methodologies involved in integrating Resource
Description Framework into a HyperGraph Graph HG 2 data structure in order to
preserve the semantics of the information contained in RDF document for dealing
future cross platform information portability issues. The entire semantic web
is mostly dominated by few information frameworks like RDF, Topic Map, OWL etc.
Hence semantic web currently faces the problem of non existence of common
information meta-model which can integrate them all for ex-panded semantic
search. On the background of development of Hyper Graph Graph HG 2 data
structure, an RDF document if integrated to it, maintains the original
semantics and exposes some critical semantic and object mapping lift as well
which could further be exploited for semantic search and information
transitional problems. The focus of the paper is to present the mapping
constructs between RDF elements and HyperGraph Graph HG 2 elements.
