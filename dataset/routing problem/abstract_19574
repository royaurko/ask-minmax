A detailed description of a method for calculating static linear-response
functions in the problem of lattice dynamics is presented. The method is based
on density functional theory and it uses linear muffin-tin orbitals as a basis
for representing first-order corrections to the one-electron wave functions. As
an application we calculate phonon dispersions in Si and NbC and find good
agreement with experiments.
