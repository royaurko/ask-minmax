Pairs of migrating extrasolar planets often lock into mean motion resonance
as they drift inward. This paper studies the convergent migration of giant
planets (driven by a circumstellar disk) and determines the probability that
they are captured into mean motion resonance. The probability that such planets
enter resonance depends on the type of resonance, the migration rate, the
eccentricity damping rate, and the amplitude of the turbulent fluctuations.
This problem is studied both through direct integrations of the full 3-body
problem, and via semi-analytic model equations. In general, the probability of
resonance decreases with increasing migration rate, and with increasing levels
of turbulence, but increases with eccentricity damping. Previous work has shown
that the distributions of orbital elements (eccentricity and semimajor axis)
for observed extrasolar planets can be reproduced by migration models with
multiple planets. However, these results depend on resonance locking, and this
study shows that entry into -- and maintenance of -- mean motion resonance
depends sensitively on migration rate, eccentricity damping, and turbulence.
