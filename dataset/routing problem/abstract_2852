This paper is devoted to establishing results for semilinear elliptic
boundary value problems where the solvability of problems subject to {\it No
Flux} boundary conditions follows from the solvability of related {\it
Dirichlet} boundary value problems. Throughout it is assumed that the nonlinear
perturbation terms are gradient dependent. An extension of \textit{No-Flux}
problems is discussed, as well.
