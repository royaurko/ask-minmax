The use of multiple Decision Models (DMs) enables to enhance the accuracy in
decisions and at the same time allows users to evaluate the confidence in
decision making. In this paper we explore the ability of multiple DMs to learn
from a small amount of verified data. This becomes important when data samples
are difficult to collect and verify. We propose an evolutionary-based approach
to solving this problem. The proposed technique is examined on a few clinical
problems presented by a small amount of data.
