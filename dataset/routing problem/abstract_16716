Consider the following birth and death process with the following
infinitesimal transition probabilities {\lambda}(k) ={\lambda}/(1+k) and
{\mu}(k) = {\mu}k with {\lambda},{\mu}> 0. This process has known as a
discouragement queue [5]. Although from the theoretical point of view the
problem of the determination of the transition functions has been solved [4],
the explicit form of them is not present in literature. We have solved this
problem assuming that the solution is representable by a Taylor series, under
the initial condition that the process starts to state zero. We discuss also
the same problem for the embedded chain and using direct computation we obtain
a recursive formula for the transient distribution.
