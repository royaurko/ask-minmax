The characteristic representation, or Goursat problem, for the
Klein-Fock-Gordon equation with Volkov interaction [1] is regarded. It is shown
that in this representation the explicit form of the Volkov propagator can be
obtained. Using the characteristic representation technique, the Schwinger
integral [2] in the Volkov problem can be calculated.
