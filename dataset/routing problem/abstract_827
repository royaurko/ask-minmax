A general procedure which defines a partial ordering of cyclic permutations
induced by continuous maps is known for constructing immediate successors to a
cycle. We expound on this procedure in terms of labelled digraphs and
characteristic polynomials then apply this study to period doubling, the most
common route to chaos for a nonlinear dynamical system.
