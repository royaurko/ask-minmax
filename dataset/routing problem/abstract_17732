We consider Approval Voting systems where each voter decides on a subset to
candidates he/she approves. We focus on the optimization problem of finding the
committee of fixed size k minimizing the maximal Hamming distance from a vote.
In this paper we give a PTAS for this problem and hence resolve the open
question raised by Carragianis et al. [AAAI'10]. The result is obtained by
adapting the techniques developed by Li et al. [JACM'02] originally used for
the less constrained Closest String problem. The technique relies on extracting
information and structural properties of constant size subsets of votes.
