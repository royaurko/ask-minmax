We prove the existence of complete minimal surfaces of genus g>1 which
minimize the total curvature for their genus. Our method is first to identify
this (Weierstrass high dimensional period) problem with the problem of finding
a particular type of polygonal arc in the complex domain: the arc alternates
between horizontal and vertical segments, and the two complementary regions
admit a conformal, vertex-preserving map. The pair of complementary domains
represent flat structures for pieces of the Weierstrass data. We then find such
an arc within a moduli space of candidate polygonal arcs by exploring
differences in conformal geometry between the regions.
  The argument is sufficiently robust that it generalizes to prove the
existence of other types of minimal surfaces. (Those surfaces will be described
in a forthcoming paper; the surfaces described here extend work of
Chen-Gackst\"atter and do Esp\'irito Santo, and our argument represents a proof
independent of one given at about the same time by K. Sato.)
