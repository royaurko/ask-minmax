We present a self-consistent field approximation to the problem of the
genetic switch composed of two mutually repressing/activating genes. The
protein and DNA state dynamics are treated stochastically and on equal footing.
In this approach the mean influence of the proteomic cloud created by one gene
on the action of another is self-consistently computed. Within this
approximation a broad range of stochastic genetic switches may be solved
exactly in terms of finding the probability distribution and its moments. A
much larger class of problems, such as genetic networks and cascades also
remain exactly solvable with this approximation. We discuss in depth certain
specific types of basic switches, which are used by biological systems and
compare their behavior to the expectation for a deterministic switch.
