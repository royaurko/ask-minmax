The solution of large, sparse constrained least-squares problems is a staple
in scientific and engineering applications. However, currently available codes
for such problems are proprietary or based on MATLAB. We announce a freely
available C implementation of the fast block pivoting algorithm of Portugal,
Judice, and Vicente. Our version is several times faster than Matstoms' MATLAB
implementation of the same algorithm. Further, our code matches the accuracy of
MATLAB's built-in lsqnonneg function.
