We study the fine-tuning problem in the context of general gauge mediation.
Numerical analyses toward for relaxing fine-tuning are presented. We analyse
the problem in typical three cases of the messenger scale, that is, GUT
($2\times10^{16}$ GeV), intermediate ($10^{10}$ GeV), and relatively low energy
($10^6$ GeV) scales. In each messenger scale, the parameter space reducing the
degree of tuning as around 10% is found. Certain ratios among gluino mass, wino
mass and soft scalar masses are favorable. It is shown that the favorable
region becomes narrow as the messenger scale becomes lower, and tachyonic
initial conditions of stop masses at the messenger scale are favored to relax
the fine-tuning problem for the relatively low energy messenger scale. Our
spectra would also be important from the viewpoint of the $\mu-B$ problem.
