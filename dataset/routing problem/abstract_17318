We consider a periodically perforated domain obtained by making in R^n a
periodic set of holes, each of them of size proportional to \epsilon. Then we
introduce a nonlinear boundary value problem for the Lam\'e equations in such a
periodically perforated domain. The unknown of the problem is a vector valued
function u which represents the displacement attained in the equilibrium
configuration by the points of a periodic linearly elastic matrix with a hole
of size \epsilon contained in each periodic cell. We assume that the traction
exerted by the matrix on the boundary of each hole depends (nonlinearly) on the
displacement attained by the points of the boundary of the hole. Then our aim
is to describe what happens to the displacement vector function u when \epsilon
tends to 0. Under suitable assumptions we prove the existence of a family of
solutions {u(\epsilon,.) : \epsilon \in ]0,\epsilon'[} with a prescribed
limiting behaviour when \epsilon approaches 0. Moreover, the family
{u(\epsilon,.) : \epsilon \in ]0,\epsilon'[} is in a sense locally unique and
can be continued real analytically for negative values of \epsilon.
