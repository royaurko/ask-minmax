For the HB problem with the CR constraint, the rate-distortion function is
derived under the assumption that the side information sequences are
(stochastically) degraded. The rate-distortion function is also calculated
explicitly for three examples, namely Gaussian source and side information with
quadratic distortion metric, and binary source and side information with
erasure and Hamming distortion metrics. The rate-distortion function is then
characterized for the HB problem with cooperating decoders and (physically)
degraded side information. For the cascade problem with the CR constraint, the
rate-distortion region is obtained under the assumption that side information
at the final node is physically degraded with respect to that at the
intermediate node. For the latter two cases, it is worth emphasizing that the
corresponding problem without the CR constraint is still open. Outer and inner
bounds on the rate-distortion region are also obtained for the cascade problem
under the assumption that the side information at the intermediate node is
physically degraded with respect to that at the final node. For the three
examples mentioned above, the bounds are shown to coincide. Finally, for the HB
problem, the rate-distortion function is obtained under the more general
requirement of constrained reconstruction, whereby the decoder's estimate must
be recovered at the encoder only within some distortion.
