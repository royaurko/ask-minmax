The main scope of this article is to define the concept of principal
eigenvalue for fully non linear second order operators in bounded domains that
are elliptic and homogenous. In particular we prove maximum and comparison
principle, Holder and Lipschitz regularity. This leads to the existence of a
first eigenvalue and eigenfunction and to the existence of solutions of
Dirichlet problems within this class of operators.
