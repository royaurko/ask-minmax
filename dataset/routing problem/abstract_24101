We study a variant of a problem considered by Dinaburg and Sinai on the
statistics of the minimal solution to a linear Diophantine equation. We show
that the signed ratio between the Euclidean norms of the minimal solution and
the coefficient vector is uniformly distributed modulo one. We reduce the
problem to an equidistribution theorem of Anton Good concerning the orbits of a
point in the upper half-plane under the action of a Fuchsian group.
