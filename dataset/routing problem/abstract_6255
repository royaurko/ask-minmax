The deformation problem for pseudoholomorphic curves and related geometrical
properties of the total moduli space of pseudoholomorphic curves are studied. A
sufficient condition for the saddle point property of the total moduli space is
established. The local symplectic isotopy problem is formulated and solved for
the case of imbedded pseudoholomorphic curves. It is shown that any two
symplectically imbedded surfaces Sigma_0, Sigma_1 in CP^2 of the same degree
d\le 6 are symplectically isotopic.
