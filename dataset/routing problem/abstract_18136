In approximation theory, logarithmic derivatives of complex polynomials are
called simple partial fractions (SPF) as suggested by Eu. P. Dolzhenko. Many
solved and unsolved extremal problems, related to SPF, are traced back to works
of G. Boole, A. J. Macintyre, W. H. J. Fuchs, M. Marstrand, E. A. Gorin, A. A.
Gonchar, Eu. P. Dolzhenko. At present, many contributors systematically develop
methods of approximation and interpolation by SPF and several their
modifications. Simultaneously, related problems appear for SPF: inequalities of
different metrics, estimation of derivatives, separation of singularities,
etc., being of independent interest.
  We systematize such problems, known to us, to some extent in Introduction of
this survey. In the main part, we formulate principal results and outline
methods for their proofs if possible.
