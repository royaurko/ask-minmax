Motivated by applications in storage systems and property testing, we study
data stream algorithms for local testing and tolerant testing of codes.
Ideally, we would like to know whether there exist asymptotically good codes
that can be local/tolerant tested with one-pass, poly-log space data stream
algorithms. We show that for the error detection problem (and hence, the local
testing problem), there exists a one-pass, log-space data stream algorithm for
a broad class of asymptotically good codes, including the Reed-Solomon (RS)
code and expander codes. In our technically more involved result, we give a
one-pass, $O(e\log^2{n})$-space algorithm for RS (and related) codes with
dimension $k$ and block length $n$ that can distinguish between the cases when
the Hamming distance between the received word and the code is at most $e$ and
at least $a\cdot e$ for some absolute constant $a>1$. For RS codes with random
errors, we can obtain $e\le O(n/k)$. For folded RS codes, we obtain similar
results for worst-case errors as long as $e\le (n/k)^{1-\eps}$ for any constant
$\eps>0$. These results follow by reducing the tolerant testing problem to the
error detection problem using results from group testing and the list
decodability of the code. We also show that using our techniques, the space
requirement and the upper bound of $e\le O(n/k)$ cannot be improved by more
than logarithmic factors.
