Comptonization is the process in which photon spectrum changes due to
multiple Compton scatterings in the electronic plasma. It plays an important
role in the spectral formation of astrophysical X-ray and gamma-ray sources.
There are several intrinsic limitations for the analytical method in dealing
with the Comptonization problem and Monte Carlo simulation is one of the few
alternatives. We describe an efficient Monte Carlo method that can solve the
Comptonization problem in a fully relativistic way. We expanded the method so
that it is capable of simulating Comptonization in the media where electron
density and temperature varies discontinuously from one region to the other and
in the isothermal media where density varies continuously along photon paths.
The algorithms are presented in detail to facilitate computer code
implementation. We also present a few examples of its application to the
astrophysical research.
