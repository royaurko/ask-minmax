In the present paper, we develop the parity theory invented in \cite{ManSb};
we construct new parities for two-component (virtual and free) links. New
parities significantly depend on geometrical properties of diagrams; in
particular, they are mutation-sensitive.
  New parities can be used practically in all problems, where parities were
previously applied.
