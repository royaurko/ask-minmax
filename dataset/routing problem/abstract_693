We develop a coupled nonlinear oscillator model involving magnetization and
strain to explain several experimentally observed dynamical features exhibited
by forced magnetostrictive ribbon. Here we show that the model recovers the
observed period doubling route to chaos as function of the dc field for a fixed
ac field and quasiperiodic route to chaos as a function of the ac field,
keeping the dc field constant. The model also predicts induced and suppressed
chaos under the influence of an additional small-amplitude near resonant ac
field. Our analysis suggests rich dynamics in coupled order parameter systems
like magnetomartensitic and magnetoelectric materials.
