We prove that finding an epsilon-Nash equilibrium in a succinctly
representable game with many players is PPAD-hard for constant epsilon. Our
proof uses succinct games, i.e. games whose payoff function is represented by a
circuit. Our techniques build on a recent query complexity lower bound by
Babichenko.
