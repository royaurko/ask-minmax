For any field K and any transitive subgroup G of S_8, let G acts naturally on
K(x_1, . . ., x_8) by permutations of the variables, we prove that under some
minor conditions K(x_1, . . ., x_8)^G is always K-rational except G is A_8 or G
is isomorphic to PGL(2, 7). We pay special attentions on the characteristic 2
cases.
