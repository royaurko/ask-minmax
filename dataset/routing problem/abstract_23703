Our model is a constrained homogeneous random walk in a nonnegative orthant
Z_+^d. The convergence to stationarity for such a random walk can often be
checked by constructing a Lyapunov function. The same Lyapunov function can
also be used for computing approximately the stationary distribution of this
random walk, using methods developed by Meyn and Tweedie. In this paper we show
that, for this type of random walks, computing the stationary probability
exactly is an undecidable problem: no algorithm can exist to achieve this task.
We then prove that computing large deviation rates for this model is also an
undecidable problem. We extend these results to a certain type of queueing
systems. The implication of these results is that no useful formulas for
computing stationary probabilities and large deviations rates can exist in
these systems.
