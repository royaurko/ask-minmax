The vector transform operators are investigated; these operators are used at
the solution of boundary value problems in piecewise homogeneous spherically
symmetric areas. In particular, examples of transformation operators for vector
boundary value problems are given for third vector boundary value problem in
the unit circle and for the Dirichlet problem in the unit circle.
