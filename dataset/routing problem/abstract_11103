The goal of the LP+ project at the K.U.Leuven is to design an expressive
logic, suitable for declarative knowledge representation, and to develop
intelligent systems based on Logic Programming technology for solving
computational problems using the declarative specifications. The ID-logic is an
integration of typed classical logic and a definition logic. Different
abductive solvers for this language are being developed. This paper is a report
of the integration of high order aggregates into ID-logic and the consequences
on the solver SLDNFA.
