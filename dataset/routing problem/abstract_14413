In [2] we introduced a method combining together an observability inequality
and a spectral decomposition to get a logarithmic stability estimate for the
inverse problem of determining both the potential and the damping coefficient
in a dissipative wave equation from boundary measurements. The present work
deals with an adaptation of that method to obtain a logarithmic stability
estimate for the inverse problem of determining a boundary damping coefficient
from boundary measurements. As in our preceding work, the different boundary
measurements are generated by varying one of the initial conditions.
