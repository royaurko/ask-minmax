We first study the influence of an efficient feedback strategy named
prediction feedback strategy (PFS) based on a multi-route scenario in which
dynamic information can be generated and displayed on the board to guide road
users to make a choice. In this scenario, our model incorporates the effects of
adaptability into the cellular automaton models of traffic flow. Simulation
results adopting this optimal information feedback strategy have demonstrated
high efficiency in controlling spatial distribution of traffic patterns
compared with the other three information feedback strategies, i.e., vehicle
number and flux. At the end of this paper, we also discuss in what situation
PFS will become invalid in multi-route systems.
