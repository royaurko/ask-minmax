We study the initial-value problem for a general class of nonlinear nonlocal
coupled wave equations. The problem involves convolution operators with kernel
functions whose Fourier transforms are nonnegative. Some well-known examples of
nonlinear wave equations, such as coupled Boussinesq-type equations arising in
elasticity and in quasi-continuum approximation of dense lattices, follow from
the present model for suitable choices of the kernel functions. We establish
local existence and sufficient conditions for finite time blow-up and as well
as global existence of solutions of the problem.
