Segal-Halevi, Hassidim, and Aumann (AAMAS, 2015) propose the problem of
cutting sticks so that at least k sticks have equal length and no other stick
is longer. This allows for an envy-free allocation of sticks to k players, one
each. The resulting number of sticks should also be minimal.
  We analyze the structure of this problem and devise a linear-time algorithm
for it.
