Bounded-rate multi-mode systems are hybrid systems that can switch among a
finite set of modes. Its dynamics is specified by a finite number of
real-valued variables with mode-dependent rates that can vary within given
bounded sets. Given an arbitrary piecewise linear trajectory, we study the
problem of following the trajectory with arbitrary precision, using motion
primitives given as bounded-rate multi-mode systems. We give an algorithm to
solve the problem and show that the problem is co-NP complete. We further prove
that the problem can be solved in polynomial time for multi-mode systems with
fixed dimension. We study the problem with dwell-time requirement and show the
decidability of the problem under certain positivity restriction on the rate
vectors. Finally, we show that introducing structure to the multi-mode systems
leads to undecidability, even when using only a single clock variable.
