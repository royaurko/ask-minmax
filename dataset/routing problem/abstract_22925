We address the problem of minimal-change integrity maintenance in the context
of integrity constraints in relational databases. We assume that
integrity-restoration actions are limited to tuple deletions. We identify two
basic computational issues: repair checking (is a database instance a repair of
a given database?) and consistent query answers (is a tuple an answer to a
given query in every repair of a given database?). We study the computational
complexity of both problems, delineating the boundary between the tractable and
the intractable. We consider denial constraints, general functional and
inclusion dependencies, as well as key and foreign key constraints. Our results
shed light on the computational feasibility of minimal-change integrity
maintenance. The tractable cases should lead to practical implementations. The
intractability results highlight the inherent limitations of any integrity
enforcement mechanism, e.g., triggers or referential constraint actions, as a
way of performing minimal-change integrity maintenance.
