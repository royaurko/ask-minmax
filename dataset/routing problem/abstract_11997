For the parabolic obstacle-problem-like equation $$\Delta u - \partial_t u =
\lambda_+ \chi_{\{u>0\}} - \lambda_- \chi_{\{u<0\}} ,$$ where $\lambda_+$ and
$\lambda_-$ are positive Lipschitz functions, we prove in arbitrary finite
dimension that the free boundary $\partial\{u>0\} \cup\partial\{u<0\}$ is in a
neighborhood of each ``branch point'' the union of two Lipschitz graphs that
are continuously differentiable with respect to the space variables. The result
extends the elliptic paper \cite{imrn} to the parabolic case. The result is
optimal in the sense that the graphs are in general not better than Lipschitz,
as shown by a counter-example.
