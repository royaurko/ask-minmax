In this paper, we propose a possible new approach towards solving the gauge
hierarchy problem without supersymmetry and without extra spacetime dimensions.
This approach relies on the finiteness of string theory and the conjectured
stability of certain non-supersymmetric string vacua. One crucial ingredient in
this approach is the idea of ``misaligned supersymmetry'', which explains how
string theories may be finite even without exhibiting spacetime supersymmetry.
This approach towards solving the gauge hierarchy problem is therefore
complementary to recent proposals involving both large and small extra
spacetime dimensions. This approach may also give a new perspective towards
simultaneously solving the cosmological constant problem.
