For the first time, we have introduced the concept of N-groups, N-semigroups,
N-loops, and N-groupoids. We also define a mixed N-algebraic structure. The
main aim of this book is to attract young mathematicians to this interesting
field. It contains more than 200 new definitions. These concepts find
applications in fields like finite automaton, coloring problems and coding
theory.
