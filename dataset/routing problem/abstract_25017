We algorithmize the recent structural characterization for claw-free graphs
by Chudnovsky and Seymour. Building on this result, we show that Dominating Set
on claw-free graphs is (i) fixed-parameter tractable and (ii) even possesses a
polynomial kernel. To complement these results, we establish that Dominating
Set is not fixed-parameter tractable on the slightly larger class of graphs
that exclude K1;4 as an induced subgraph. Our results provide a dichotomy for
Dominating Set in K1;L-free graphs and show that the problem is fixed-parameter
tractable if and only if L <= 3. Finally, we show that our algorithmization can
also be used to show that the related Connected Dominating Set problem is
fixed-parameter tractable on claw-free graphs.
