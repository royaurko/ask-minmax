The archetypical strongly correlated Mott-phenomena compound V2O3 is known to
show a paramagnetic metal-insulator transition driven by doping with chromium
atoms and/or (negative) pressure. Via charge self-consistent density-functional
theory+dynamical mean-field theory calculations we demonstrate that these two
routes cannot be understood as equivalent. To this end, the explicit
description of Cr-doped V2O3 by means of supercell calculations and the virtual
crystal approximation is performed. Already the sole introduction of chromium's
additional electron to the system is shown to modify the overall correlated
electronic structure substantially. Correlation-induced charge transfers
between Cr and the remaining V ions occur and the transition-metal orbital
polarization is increased by the electron doping, in close agreement with
experimental findings.
