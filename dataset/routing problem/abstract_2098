We study coherent and incoherent interactions between discrete vortex and
fundamental solitons in two-dimensional photonic lattices, presenting a new
scheme for all-optical routings and topological transformations of vorticities.
Due to the multi-lobe intensity and step-phase structure of the discrete vortex
soliton, the coherent soliton-interactions allow both solitons to be steered
into multiple different possible destination ports depending on the initial
phase of the discrete fundamental soliton. We show that charge-flipping of
phase singularities and orbital angular momentum transfer can occur during the
coherent interactions between the two solitons. For incoherent interactions, by
controlling the relative intensities of the two solitons, we reveal that
soliton-steering can be realized by either attracting the discrete fundamental
soliton to four ports or localizing the four-lobe discrete vortex soliton into
a ring soliton.
