Analytical solution of second Stokes problem of behaviour of rarefied gas
with Cercignani boundary accomodation conditions The second Stokes problem
about behaviour of rarefied gas filling half-space is analytically solved. A
plane, limiting half-space, makes harmonious fluctuations in the plane. The
kinetic BGK-equation (Bhatnagar, Gross, Krook) is used. The boundary
accomodation conditions of Cercignani of reflexion gaseous molecules from a
wall are considered. Distribution function of the gaseous molecules is
constructed. The velocity of gas in half-space is found, also its value direct
at a wall is found. The force resistance operating from gas on border is found.
Besides, the capacity of dissipation of the energy falling to unit of area of
the fluctuating plate limiting gas is obtained.
