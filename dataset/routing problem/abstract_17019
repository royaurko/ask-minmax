We consider isometric actions of lattices in semisimple algebraic groups on
(possibly non-compact) homogeneous spaces with (possibly infinite) invariant
Radon measure. We assume that the action has a dense orbit, and demonstrate two
novel and non-classical dynamical phenomena that arise in this context. The
first is the existence of a mean ergodic theorem even when the invariant
measure is infinite, which implies the existence of an associated limiting
distribution, possibly different than the invariant measure. The second is
uniform quantitative equidistribution of all orbits in the space, which follows
from a quantitative mean ergodic theorem for such actions. In turn, these
results imply quantitative ratio ergodic theorems for isometric actions of
lattices. This sheds some unexpected light on certain equidistribution problems
posed by Arnol'd and also on the equidistribution conjecture for dense
subgroups of isometries formulated by Kazhdan. We briefly describe the general
problem regarding ergodic theorems for actions of lattices on homogeneous
spaces and its solution via the duality principle \cite{GN2}, and give a number
of examples to demonstrate our results. Finally, we also prove results on
quantitative equidistribution for transitive actions.
