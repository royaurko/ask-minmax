This is a noncommutative version of the previous work entitled "Deformation
Expression for Elements of Algebras (I)." In general in a noncommutative
algebra, there is no canonical way to express elements in univalent way, which
is often called "ordering problem". In this note we discuss this problem in the
case of the Weyl algebra of 2m-generators. By fixing an expression, we extends
Weyl algebra transcendentally. We treat *-exponential functions of linear
forms, and quadratic forms of crossed symbol under generic expression
parameters.
