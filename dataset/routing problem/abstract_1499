We present an ultrafast route for a controlled, toggle switching of magnetic
vortex cores with ultrashort unipolar magnetic field pulses. The switching
process is found to be largely insensitive to extrinsic parameters, like sample
size and shape, and it is faster than any field-driven magnetization reversal
process previously known from micromagnetic theory. Micromagnetic simulations
demonstrate that the vortex core reversal is mediated by a rapid sequence of
vortex-antivortex pair-creation and annihilation sub-processes. Specific
combinations of field pulse strength and duration are required to obtain a
controlled vortex cores reversal. The operational range of this reversal
mechanism is summarized in a switching diagram for a 200 nm Permalloy disk.
