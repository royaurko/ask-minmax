A natural way to represent on the plane both a planar graph and its dual is
to follow the definition of the dual, thus, to place vertices inside their
corresponding primal faces, and to draw the dual edges so that they only cross
their corresponding primal edges. The problem of constructing such drawings has
a long tradition when the drawings of both primal and dual are required to be
straight-line. We consider the same problem for a planar graph and its
rectangular dual. We show that the rectangular dual can be resized to host a
planar straight-line drawing of its primal.
