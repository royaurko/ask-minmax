There is a number of known NP class problems, and majority of them have been
shown to be equivalent to others. In particular now it is clear that
construction of a Gr\"{o}bner basis (or Buchberger algorithm) must be one of
equivalent problems, but there was no example. In the following paper the
reduction is constructed.
