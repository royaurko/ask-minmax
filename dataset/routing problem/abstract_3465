We consider variations on the following problem: given an NFA M and a pattern
p, does there exist an x in L(M) such that p matches x? We consider the
restricted problem where M only accepts a finite language. We also consider the
variation where the pattern p is required only to match a factor of x. We show
that both of these problems are NP-complete. We also consider the same problems
for context-free grammars; in this case the problems become PSPACE-complete.
