We prove that the smooth solutions to the Cauchy problem for the
three-dimensional compressible barotropic magnetohydrodynamic equations with
conserved total mass and finite total energy lose the initial smoothness within
a finite time. Further, we show that the same result holds for the solution to
the Cauchy problem for the multidimensional compressible Navier-Stokes system.
Moreover, for the solution with a finite momentum of inertia we get the
two-sided estimates of different components of total energy.
