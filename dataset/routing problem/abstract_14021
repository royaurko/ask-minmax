The paper is devoted to invariant theory problems. In particular, to the
problem of finding generators of invariant fields in an explicit form. The set
of generators is given for invariant field of unitriangular group of adjoint
representation of $GL(n,K)$. Moreover, the set of generators of borel group
invariant field is constructed and their algebraic independence is proved.
Keywords: Lie group, adjoint representation, the field of invariant, generators
of the field of invariant, Borel group.
