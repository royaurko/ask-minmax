An inverse scattering problem for a quantized scalar field ${\bm \phi}$
obeying a linear Klein-Gordon equation $(\square + m^2 + V) {\bm \phi} = J
\mbox{in $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3$}$ is considered, where $V$ is a
repulsive external potential and $J$ an external source $J$. We prove that the
scattering operator $\mathscr{S}= \mathscr{S}(V,J)$ associated with ${\bm
\phi}$ uniquely determines $V$. Assuming that $J$ is of the form
$J(t,x)=j(t)\rho(x)$, $(t,x) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3$, we represent
$\rho$ (resp. $j$) in terms of $j$ (resp. $\rho$) and $\mathscr{S}$.
