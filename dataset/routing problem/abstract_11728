Much progress has been made in the last few decades in developing the
necessary mathematics for understanding the full implications of the
quantum-mechanical many-body problem and why the material world appears to be
as stable as it is despite the serious -1/|x|singularity of the Coulomb
potential that attracts negative electrons to positive atomic nuclei. Many
problems remain, however, especially the understanding of the interaction of
matter and the quantized radiation field discovered by Planck in 1900. A short
review of some of the main topics is given.
