We introduce a problem setting which we call ``the freedom fighters'
problem''. It subtly differs from the prisoners' problem. We propose a
steganographic method that allows Alice and Bob to fool Wendy the warden in
this setting. Their messages are hidden in encryption keys. The recipient has
no prior knowledge of these keys, and has to cryptanalyze ciphertexts in order
to recover them. We show an example of the protocol and give a partial security
analysis.
