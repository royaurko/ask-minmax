We investigate the positivity of the Euclidean path integral measure for
low-energy modes in dense fermionic matter. We show that the sign problem
usually associated with fermions is absent if one considers only low-energy
degrees of freedom. We describe a method for simulating dense QCD on the
lattice and give a proof using rigorous inequalities that the color-flavor
locked (CFL) phase is the true vacuum of three flavor, massless QCD.
