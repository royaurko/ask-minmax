We give a new algorithmic solution to the well-known five-point relative pose
problem. Our approach does not deal with the famous cubic constraint on an
essential matrix. Instead, we use the Cayley representation of rotations in
order to obtain a polynomial system from epipolar constraints. Solving that
system, we directly get relative rotation and translation parameters of the
cameras in terms of roots of a 10th degree polynomial.
