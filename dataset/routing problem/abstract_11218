A canonical formalism of f(R)-type gravity is proposed, resolving the problem
in the formalism of Buchbinder and Lyakhovich(BL). The new coordinates
corresponding to the time derivatives of the metric are taken to be its Lie
derivatives which is the same as in BL. The momenta canonically conjugate to
them and Hamiltonian density are defined similarly to the formalism of
Ostrogradski. It is shown that our method surely resolves the problem of BL.
