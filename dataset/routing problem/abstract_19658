We discuss the divergence problems recently identified in some extrapolation
operators for weakly-relational numeric domains. We identify the cause of the
divergences and point out that resorting to more concrete, syntactic domains
can be avoided by researching suitable algorithms for the elimination of
redundant constraints in the chosen representation.
