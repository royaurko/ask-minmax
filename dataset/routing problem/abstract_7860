In this paper Quintic Spline is defined for the numerical solutions of the
fourth order linear special case Boundary Value Problems. End conditions are
also derived to complete the definition of spline.The algorithm developed
approximates the solutions, and their higher order derivatives of differential
equations. Numerical illustrations are tabulated to demonstrate the practical
usefulness of method.
