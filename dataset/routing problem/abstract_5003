We study the problem of preemptive scheduling n jobs with given release times
on m identical parallel machines. The objective is to minimize the average flow
time. We show that when all jobs have equal processing times then the problem
can be solved in polynomial time using linear programming. Our algorithm can
also be applied to the open-shop problem with release times and unit processing
times. For the general case (when processing times are arbitrary), we show that
the problem is unary NP-hard.
