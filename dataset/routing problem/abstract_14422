We construct certain isogeny graphs of principally polarized ordinary abelian
surfaces over finite fields and prove (under the Generalized Riemann
Hypothesis) rapid mixing properties for these graphs. We use these graphs,
together with a recent algorithm of Dudeanu, Jetchev and Robert for computing
explicit isogenies in genus 2, to prove ran- dom self-reducibility of the
discrete logarithm problem within the subclass of principally polarizable
ordinary abelian surfaces with maximal endomorphism ring. In addition, we
remove the heuristics in the complexity analysis of an algorithm of Galbraith
for explicitly computing isogenies between two elliptic curves in the same
isogeny class and generalize it in genus 2.
