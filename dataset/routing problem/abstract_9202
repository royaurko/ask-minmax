Many geophysical flow or wave propagation problems can be modeled with
two-dimensional depth-averaged equations, of which the shallow water equations
are the simplest example. We describe the GeoClaw software that has been
designed to solve problems of this nature, consisting of open source Fortran
programs together with Python tools for the user interface and flow
visualization. This software uses high-resolution shock-capturing finite volume
methods on logically rectangular grids, including latitude--longitude grids on
the sphere. Dry states are handled automatically to model inundation. The code
incorporates adaptive mesh refinement to allow the efficient solution of
large-scale geophysical problems. Examples are given illustrating its use for
modeling tsunamis, dam break problems, and storm surge. Documentation and
