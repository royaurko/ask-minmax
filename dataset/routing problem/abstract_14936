A toric manifold is a compact non-singular toric variety equipped with a
natural half-dimensional compact torus action. A torus manifold is an oriented,
closed, smooth manifold of dimension $2n$ with an effective action of a compact
torus $T^{n}$ having a non-empty fixed point set. Hence, a torus manifold can
be thought of as a generalization of a toric manifold. In the present paper, we
focus on a certain class $\mM$ in the family of torus manifolds with
codimension one extended actions, and we give a topological classification of
$\mM$. As a result, their topological types are completely determined by their
cohomology rings and real characteristic classes.
  The problem whether the cohomology ring determines the topological type of a
toric manifold or not is one of the most interesting open problems in toric
topology. One can also ask this problem for the class of torus manifolds even
if its orbit spaces are highly structured. Our results provide a negative
answer to this problem for torus manifolds. However, we find a sub-class of
torus manifolds with codimension one extended actions which is not in the class
of toric manifolds but which is classified by their cohomology rings.
