This paper gives an overview of the attempts to determine the distribution of
dark matter in low surface brightness disk and gas-rich dwarf galaxies, both
through observations and computer simulations. Observations seem to indicate an
approximately constant dark matter density in the inner parts of galaxies,
while cosmological computer simulations indicate a steep power-law-like
behaviour. This difference has become known as the "core/cusp problem", and
remains one of the unsolved problems in small-scale cosmology.
