We consider the problem of maximizing the sum of squares of the leading
coefficients of polynomials $P_{i_1}(x),\ldots ,P_{i_m}(x)$ (where $P_j(x)$ is
a polynomial of degree $j$) under the restriction that the sup-norm of
$\sum_{j=1}^m P_{i_j}^2(x)$ is bounded on the interval $[-b,b]$ ($b>0$). A
complete solution of the problem is presented using duality theory of convex
analysis and the theory of canonical moments. It turns out, that contrary to
many other extremal problems the structure of the solution will depend heavily
on the size of the interval $[-b,b]$.
