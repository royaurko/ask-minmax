In the first part of the paper we present the dressing method which generates
multi-soliton solutions to integrable systems of nonlinear partial differential
equations. We compare the approach of Neugebauer with that of Zakharov, Shabat
and Mikhailov. In both cases we discuss the group reductions and reductions
defined by some multilinear constraints on matrices of the linear problem. The
second part of the paper describes the soliton surfaces approach. The so called
Sym-Tafel formula simplifies the explicit reconstruction of the surface from
the knowledge of its fundamental forms, unifies various integrable
nonlinearities and enables one to apply powerful methods of the theory of
solitons to geometrical problems. The Darboux-Bianchi-B\"acklund transformation
(i.e., the dressing method on the level of soliton surfaces) reconstructs
explicitly many classical transformations of XIX century. We present examples
of interesting classes of surfaces obtained from spectral problems. In
particular, we consider spectral problems in Clifford algebras associated with
orthogonal coordinates. Finally, compact formulas for multi-soliton surfaces
are discussed and applied for the Localized Induction Equation with axial flow.
