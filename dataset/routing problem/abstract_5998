Let $G$ be a group, and let $S$ be a finite subset of $G$ that generates $G$
as a monoid. The co-word problem is the collection of words in the free monoid
$S^{\ast}$ that represent non-trivial elements of $G$.
  A current conjecture, based originally on a conjecture of Lehnert and
modified into its current form by Bleak, Matucci, and Neuh\"{o}ffer, says that
Thompson's group $V$ is a universal group with context-free co-word problem. In
other words, it is conjectured that a group has a context-free co-word problem
exactly if it is a finitely generated subgroup of $V$.
  Hughes introduced the class $\mathcal{FSS}$ of groups that are determined by
finite similarity structures. An $\mathcal{FSS}$ group acts by local
similarities on a compact ultrametric space. Thompson's group $V$ is a
representative example, but there are many others.
  We show that $\mathcal{FSS}$ groups have context-free co-word problem under a
minimal additional hypothesis. As a result, we can specify a subfamily of
$\mathcal{FSS}$ groups that are potential counterexamples to the conjecture.
