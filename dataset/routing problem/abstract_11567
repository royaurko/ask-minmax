We prove that if $X$ is a real Banach space, with $\dim X\geq 3$, which
contains a subspace of codimension 1 which is 1-complemented in $X$ and whose
group of isometries is almost transitive then $X$ is isometric to a Hilbert
space. This partially answers the Banach-Mazur rotation problem and generalizes
some recent related results.
