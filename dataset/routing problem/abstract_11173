We discuss the main cosmological implications of considering string-loop
effects and a potential for the dilaton in the lowest order string effective
action. Our framework is based on the effective model arising from regarding
homogeneous and isotropic dilaton, metric and Yang-Mills field configurations.
The issues of inflation, entropy crisis and the Polonyi problem as well as the
problem of the cosmological constant are discussed.
