We lift the constraint of a diagonal representation of the Hamiltonian by
searching for square integrable bases that support an infinite tridiagonal
matrix representation of the wave operator. The class of solutions obtained as
such includes the discrete (for bound states) as well as the continuous (for
scattering states) spectrum of the Hamiltonian. The problem translates into
finding solutions of the resulting three-term recursion relation for the
expansion coefficients of the wavefunction. These are written in terms of
orthogonal polynomials, some of which are modified versions of known
polynomials. The examples given, which are not exhaustive, include problems in
one and three dimensions.
