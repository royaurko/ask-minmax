Capacitated p-median problem (CPMP) is an important variation of facility
location problem in which p capacitated medians are economically selected to
serve a set of demand vertices so that the total assigned demand to each of the
candidate medians must not exceed its capacity. This paper surveys and analyses
the combination of Cuckoo Search and K-Means algorithms to solve the CPMP. In
order to check for quality and validity of the suggestive method, we compared
the final solution produced over the two test problems of Osman and
Christofides, each of which including 10 sample tests. According to the
results, the suggested meta-heuristic algorithm shows superiority over the rest
known algorithms in this field as all the best known solutions in the first
problem set, and several sample sets in the second problem set have been
improved within reasonable periods of time.
