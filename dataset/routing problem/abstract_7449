In this paper, we survey the status of attacks on the ring and polynomial
learning with errors problems (RLWE and PLWE). Recent work on the security of
these problems [Eisentr\"ager-Hallgren-Lauter, Elias-Lauter-Ozman-Stange] gives
rise to interesting questions about number fields. We extend these attacks and
survey related open problems in number theory, including spectral distortion of
an algebraic number and its relationship to Mahler measure, the monogenic
property for the ring of integers of a number field, and the size of elements
of small order modulo q.
