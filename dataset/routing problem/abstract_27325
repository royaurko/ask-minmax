We consider the problem of multivariate density deconvolution when the
interest lies in estimating the distribution of a vector valued random variable
but precise measurements on the variable of interest are not available,
observations being contaminated with additive measurement errors. The existing
sparse literature on the problem assumes the density of the measurement errors
to be completely known. We propose robust Bayesian semiparametric multivariate
deconvolution approaches when the measurement error density is not known but
replicated proxies are available for each unobserved value of the random
vector. Additionally, we allow the variability of the measurement errors to
depend on the associated unobserved value of the vector of interest through
unknown relationships. Basic properties of finite mixture models, multivariate
normal kernels and exchangeable priors are exploited in many novel ways to meet
the modeling and computational challenges. Theoretical results that show the
flexibility of the proposed methods are provided. We illustrate the efficiency
of the proposed methods in recovering the true density of interest through
simulation experiments. The methodology is applied to estimate the joint
consumption pattern of different dietary components from contaminated 24 hour
recalls.
