I visually explore the features of geodesic orbits in arbitrary stationary
axisymmetric vacuum (SAV) spacetimes that are constructed from a complex Ernst
potential. Some of the geometric features of integrable and chaotic orbits are
highlighted. The geodesic problem for these SAV spacetimes is rewritten as a
two degree of freedom problem and the connection between current ideas in
dynamical systems and the study of two manifolds sought. The relationship
between the Hamilton-Jacobi equations, canonical transformations, constants of
motion and Killing tensors are commented on. Wherever possible I illustrate the
concepts by means of examples from general relativity. This investigation is
designed to build the readers' intuition about how integrability arises, and to
summarize some of the known facts about two degree of freedom systems. Evidence
is given, in the form of orbit-crossing structure, that geodesics in SAV
spacetimes might admit, a fourth constant of motion that is quartic in momentum
(by contrast with Kerr spacetime, where Carter's fourth constant is quadratic).
