As a practical foundation for a homotopy theory of abstract spacetime, we
extend a category of certain compact partially ordered spaces to a convenient
category of locally preordered spaces. In particular, we show that our new
category is Cartesian closed and that the forgetful functor to the category of
compactly generated spaces creates all limits and colimits.
