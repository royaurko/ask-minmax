We discuss some important issues arising from computational efforts in
dynamical systems and fluid dynamics. Various individuals have misunderstood
these issues since the onset of these problem areas; indeed, they have been
routinely misinterpreted, and even viewed as "laws" by some. This paper hopes
to stimulate appropriate corrections and to realign thinking, with the overall
goal being sound future progress in dynamical systems and fluid dynamics.
