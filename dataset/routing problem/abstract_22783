We study the classical Antonov problem (of retrieving the statistical
equilibrium properties of a self-gravitating gas of classical particles obeying
Boltzmann statistics in space and confined in a spherical box) for a rotating
system. It is shown that a critical angular momentum $\lambda_c$ (or, in the
canonical language, a critical angular velocity $\omega_c$) exists, such that
for $\lambda<\lambda_c$ the system's behaviour is qualitatively similar to that
of a non-rotating gas, with a high energy disordered phase and a low energy
collapsed phase ending with Antonov's limit, below which there is no
equilibrium state. For $\lambda>\lambda_c$, instead, the low-energy phase is
characterized by the formation of two dense clusters (a ``binary star'').
Remarkably, no Antonov limit is found for $\lambda>\lambda_c$. The
thermodynamics of the system (phase diagram, caloric curves, local stability)
is analyzed and compared with the recently-obtained picture emerging from a
different type of statistics which forbids particle overlapping.
