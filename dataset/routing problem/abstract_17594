In this work we aim at applying automata techniques to problems studied in
Dynamic Epistemic Logic, such as epistemic planning. To do so, we first remark
that repeatedly executing ad infinitum a propositional event model from an
initial epistemic model yields a relational structure that can be finitely
represented with automata. This correspondence, together with recent results on
uniform strategies, allows us to give an alternative decidability proof of the
epistemic planning problem for propositional events, with as by-products
accurate upper-bounds on its time complexity, and the possibility to synthesize
a finite word automaton that describes the set of all solution plans. In fact,
using automata techniques enables us to solve a much more general problem, that
we introduce and call epistemic protocol synthesis.
