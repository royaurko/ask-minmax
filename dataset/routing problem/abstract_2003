With the increasing number of detected exoplanet samples, the statistical
properties of planetary systems have become much clearer. In this review, we
summarize the major statistics that have been revealed mainly by radial
velocity and transiting observations, and try to interpret them within the
scope of the classical core-accretion scenario of planet formation, especially
in the formation of different orbital architectures for planetary systems
around main sequence stars. Based on the different possible formation routes
for different planet systems, we tentatively classify them into three major
catalogs: hot Jupiter systems, standard systems and distant giant planet
systems. The standard system can be further categorized into three sub-types
under different circumstances: solar-like systems, hot Super-Earth systems,
sub-giant planet systems. We also review the planet detection and formation in
binary systems as well as planets in star clusters.
