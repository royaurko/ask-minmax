An explicit example is presented (a one-loop triangle graph) where
dimensional regularization fails to regulate the infra-red singularities that
emerge at intermediate steps of studying large-$Q^2$ Sudakov factorization. The
mathematical nature of the phenomenon is explained within the framework of the
theory of the $As$-operation.
