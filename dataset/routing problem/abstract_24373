Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have revolutionised Bayesian data
analysis over the years by making the direct computation of posterior
probability densities feasible on modern workstations. However, the calculation
of the prior predictive, the Bayesian evidence, has proved to be notoriously
difficult with standard techniques. In this work a method is presented that
lets one calculate the Bayesian evidence using nothing but the results from
standard MCMC algorithms, like Metropolis-Hastings. This new method is compared
to other methods like MultiNest, and greatly outperforms the latter in several
cases. One of the toy problems considered in this work is the analysis of mock
pulsar timing data, as encountered in pulsar timing array projects. This method
is expected to be useful as well in other problems in astrophysics, cosmology
and particle physics.
