We deal with a problem of the explicit reconstruction of any holomorphic
function $f$ on $\mathbb{C}^2$ from its restricions on a union of complex
lines. The validity of such a reconstruction essentially depends on the mutual
repartition of these lines, condition that can be analytically described. The
motivation of this problem comes also from possible applications in
mathematical economics and medical imaging.
