Numerical solution of one-dimensional stochastic integral equations because
of the randomness has its own problems, i.e. some of them no have analytically
solution or finding their analytic solution is very difficult. This problem for
two-dimensional equations is twofold. Thus, finding an efficient way to
approximate solutions of these equations is an essential requirement. To begin
this important issue in this paper, we will give an efficient method based on
Haar wavelet to approximate a solution for the two-dimensional linear
stochastic Volterra integral equation. We also give an example to demonstrate
the accuracy of the method.
