We introduce a novel method within the shell model Monte Carlo approach to
calculate the ground-state energy of a finite-size system with an odd number of
particles by using the asymptotic behavior of the imaginary-time
single-particle Green's functions. The method circumvents the sign problem that
originates from the projection on an odd number of particles and has hampered
direct application of the shell model Monte Carlo method to odd-particle
systems. We apply this method to calculate pairing gaps of nuclei in the iron
region. Our results are in good agreement with experimental pairing gaps.
