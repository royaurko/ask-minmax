We prove uniqueness and stability for the inverse boundary value problem of
the two dimensional Schr\"odinger equation. We do not assume the potentials to
be continuous or even bounded. Instead, we assume that some of their positive
fractional derivatives are in a specific Lorentz space. These spaces are a
natural generalization to the usual fractional Sobolev spaces. The thesis
consists of two parts.
  In the first part, we define the generalized fractional Sobolev spaces and
prove some of their properties including embeddings and interpolation
identities. In particular we sharpen the usual Sobolev embedding into the space
of H\"older-continuous functions, by showing that a particular kind of space
embeds into the space of continuous functions without any modulus of
continuity.
  The inverse problem is considered in the second part of the thesis. We prove
a new Carleman estimate for $\partial$. This estimate has a fast decay rate,
which will allow us to consider potentials with very low regularity. After that
we use Bukhgeim's oscillating exponential solutions, Alessandrini's identity
and stationary phase to get information about the difference of the potentials
from the difference of the Cauchy data. The stability estimate will be of
logarithmic type, but works with potentials of low regularity.
