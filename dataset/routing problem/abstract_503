In this paper we examine mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET) composed by unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs). Due to the high-mobility of the nodes, these networks
are very dynamic and the existing routing protocols partly fail to provide a
reliable communication. We present Predictive-OLSR an extension to the
Optimized Link-State Routing (OLSR) protocol: it enables efficient routing in
very dynamic conditions. The key idea is to exploit GPS information to aid the
routing protocol. Predictive-OLSR weights the expected transmission count (ETX)
metric, taking into account the relative speed between the nodes. We provide
numerical results obtained by a MAC-layer emulator that integrates a flight
simulator to reproduce realistic flight conditions. These numerical results
show that Predictive-OLSR significantly outperforms OLSR and BABEL, providing a
reliable communication even in very dynamic conditions.
