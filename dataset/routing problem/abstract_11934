By linearizing the inhomogeneous Burgers equation through the Hopf-Cole
transformation, we formulate the solution of the initial value problem of the
corresponding linear heat type equation using the Feynman-Kac path integral
formalism. For illustration, we present the exact solution for the forcing term
of the form: $F(x,t)=\omega ^2x+f(t).$ We also present the initial value
problem solution for the case with a constant forcing term to compare with the
known result.
