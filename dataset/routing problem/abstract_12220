We consider the one-sided exit problem for (fractionally) integrated random
walks and L\'evy processes. We prove that the rate of decrease of the non-exit
probability -- the so-called survival exponent -- is universal in this class of
processes. In particular, the survival exponent can be inferred from the
(fractionally) integrated Brownian motion. This, in particular, extends Sinai's
result on the survival exponent for the integrated simple random walk to
general random walks with some finite exponential moment. Further, we prove
existence and monotonicity of the survival exponent of fractionally integrated
processes. We show that this exponent is related to a constant appearing in the
study of random polynomials.
