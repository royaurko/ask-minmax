We address the observability problem for ensembles that are described by
probability distributions. The problem is to reconstruct a probability
distribution of the initial state from the time-evolution of the probability
distribution of the output under a classical finite-dimensional linear system.
We present two solutions to this problem, one based on formulating the problem
as an inverse problem and the other one based on reconstructing all the moments
of the distribution. The first approach leads us to a connection between the
reconstruction problem and mathematical tomography problems. In the second
approach we use the framework of tensor systems to describe the dynamics of the
moments which leads to a more systems theoretic treatment of the reconstruction
problem. Furthermore we show that both frameworks are inherently related. The
appeal of having two dual view points, the first being more geometric and the
second one being more systems theoretic, is illuminated in several examples of
theoretical or practical importance.
