The iterative phase retrieval problem for complex-valued objects from Fourier
transform magnitude data is known to suffer from the twin image problem. In
particular, when the object support is centro-symmetric, the iterative solution
often stagnates such that the resultant complex image contains the features of
both the desired solution and its inverted and complex-conjugated replica. The
conventional approach to address the twin image problem is to modify the object
support during initial iterations which can possibly lead to elimination of one
of the twin images. However, at present there seems to be no deterministic
procedure to make sure that the twin image will always be very weak or absent.
In this work we make an important observation that the ideal solution without
the twin image is typically more sparse (in some suitable transform domain) as
compared to the stagnated solution containing the twin image. We further show
that introducing a sparsity enhancing step in the iterative algorithm can
address the twin image problem without the need to change the object support
throughout the iterative process even when the object support is
centro-symmetric. In a simulation study, we use binary and gray-scale pure
phase objects and illustrate the effectiveness of the sparsity assisted phase
recovery in the context of the twin image problem. The results have important
implications for a wide range of topics in Physics where the phase retrieval
problem plays a central role.
