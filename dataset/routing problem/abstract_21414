This is a survey paper on commutative Koszul algebras and Castelnuovo-Mumford
regularity. We describe several techniques to establish the Koszulness of
algebras. We discuss variants of the Koszul property such as strongly Koszul,
absolutely Koszul and universally Koszul. We present several open problems
related with these notions and their local variants.
