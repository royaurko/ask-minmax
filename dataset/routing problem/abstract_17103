This paper concerns linear first-order hyperbolic systems in one space
dimension of the type $$ \partial_tu_j + a_j(x,t)\partial_xu_j +
\sum\limits_{k=1}^nb_{jk}(x,t)u_k = f_j(x,t),\; x \in (0,1),\; j=1,\ldots,n, $$
with periodicity conditions in time and reflection boundary conditions in
space. We state a non-resonance condition (depending on the coefficients $a_j$
and $b_{jj}$ and the boundary reflection coefficients), which implies Fredholm
solvability of the problem in the space of continuous functions. Further, we
state one more non-resonance condition (depending also on $\partial_ta_j$),
which implies $C^1$-solution regularity. Moreover, we give examples showing
that both non-resonance conditions cannot be dropped, in general. Those
conditions are robust under small perturbations of the problem data. Our
results work for many non-strictly hyperbolic systems, but they are new even in
the case of strict hyperbolicity.
