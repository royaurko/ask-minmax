Delattre et al. (2013) considered n independent stochastic differential
equations (SDE's), where in each case the drift term is associated with a
random effect, the distribution of which depends upon unknown parameters.
Assuming the independent and identical (iid) situation the contributors provide
independent proofs of consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum
likelihood estimators (MLE's) of the hyper-parameters of their random effects
parameters.
  In this article, as an alternative route to proving consistency and
asymptotic normality in the SDE set-up involving random effects, we verify the
regularity conditions required by existing relevant theorems. But much more
importantly, we further consider the independent, but non-identical set-up
associated with the random effects based SDE framework, and prove asymptotic
results associated with the MLE's.
