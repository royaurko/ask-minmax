The fermion mass problem is briefly reviewed. The observed hierarchy of quark
and charged lepton masses strongly suggests the existence of an approximately
conserved chiral flavour symmetry beyond the Standard Model. It is argued that
in models of this type, the requirement of a natural explanation for both the
atmospheric and solar neutrino problems leads to an essentially unique picture
of neutrino masses and mixing angles. The anti-grand unification model is used
as an explicit example to illustrate these ideas.
