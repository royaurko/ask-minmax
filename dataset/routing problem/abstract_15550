Average persistent current over a set of diffusive metallic rings with fixed
number of electrons is considered. We study the the case where the phase
breaking time is much greater than an inverse average inter-level distance. In
such a situation, many return events for an electron have to be taken into
account. As a result, one arrives at a non-perturbative problem for a fixed by
an external magnetic field Cooperon mode. This multi-Cooperon problem has been
considered previously by Altland et al., Europhys. Lett., 2, 155 (1992) and in
several following papers within the framework of supersymmetric approach. Such
an approach involves very tedious calculations which were performed using
computer algebra package. Here we solve the problem in question with the help
of replica trick. It is demonstrated that the replica trick in combination with
a proper analytical continuation in the replica space allows one to obtain the
results in much more explicit way.
