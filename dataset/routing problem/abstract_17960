In this paper we study $k$-equivariant wave maps from the hyperbolic plane
into the $2$-sphere as well as the energy critical equivariant $SU(2)$
Yang-Mills problem on $4$-dimensional hyperbolic space. The latter problem
bears many similarities to a $2$-equivariant wave map into a surface of
revolution. As in the case of $1$-equivariant wave maps considered
in~\cite{LOS1}, both problems admit a family of stationary solutions indexed by
a parameter that determines how far the image of the map wraps around the
target manifold. Here we show that if the image of a stationary solution is
contained in a geodesically convex subset of the target, then it is
asymptotically stable in the energy space. However, for a stationary solution
that covers a large enough portion of the target, we prove that the
Schr\"odinger operator obtained by linearizing about such a harmonic map admits
a simple positive eigenvalue in the spectral gap. As there is no a priori
nonlinear obstruction to asymptotic stability, this gives evidence for the
existence of metastable states (i.e., solutions with anomalously slow decay
rates) in these simple geometric models.
