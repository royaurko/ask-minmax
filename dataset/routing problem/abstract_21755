In this work, we study the initial value problems associated to some linear
perturbations of KdV equations. Our focus is in the well-posedness issues for
initial data given in the $L^2$-based Sobolev spaces. We derive bilinear
estimate in a space with weight in the time variable and obtain sharp local
well-posedness results.
