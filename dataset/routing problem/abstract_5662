We have recently solved the inverse scattering problem for one parameter
families of vector fields, and used this result to construct the formal
solution of the Cauchy problem for a class of integrable nonlinear partial
differential equations connected with the commutation of multidimensional
vector fields, like the heavenly equation of Plebanski, the dispersionless
Kadomtsev - Petviashvili (dKP) equation and the two-dimensional dispersionless
Toda (2ddT) equation, as well as with the commutation of one dimensional vector
fields, like the Pavlov equation. We also showed that the associated
Riemann-Hilbert inverse problems are powerfull tools to establish if the
solutions of the Cauchy problem break at finite time,to construct their
longtime behaviour and characterize classes of implicit solutions. In this
paper, using the above theory, we concentrate on the heavenly and Pavlov
equations, i) establishing that their localized solutions evolve without
breaking, unlike the cases of dKP and 2ddT; ii) constructing the longtime
behaviour of the solutions of their Cauchy problems; iii) characterizing a
distinguished class of implicit solutions of the heavenly equation.
