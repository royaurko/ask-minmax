The tunneling rate, with exact prefactor, is calculated to first order in
$\hbar$ for an empty closed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe with
decaying cosmological term $\Lambda \sim R^{-m}$ ($R$ is the scale factor and
$m$ is a parameter $0\leq m \leq 2$). This model is equivalent to a cosmology
with the equation of state $p_{\chi}=(m/3 -1)\rho_{\chi}$. The calculations are
performed by applying the dilute-instanton approximation on the corresponding
Duru-Kleinert path integral.
  It is shown that the highest tunneling rate occurs for $m=2$ corresponding to
the cosmic string matter universe. The obtained most probable cosmological
term, like one obtained by Strominger, accounts for a possible solution to the
cosmological constant problem.
