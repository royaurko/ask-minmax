This paper presents a general form of integral sliding mode manifold, and
proposes an algorithmic approach based on Sum of Squares (SOS) programming to
design generalized integral sliding mode manifold and controller for nonlinear
systems with both matched and unmatched uncertainties. The approach also gives
a sufficient condition for successful design of controller and manifold
parameters. The result of the paper is then verified by several simulation
examples and two practical applications, namely Glucose-insulin regulation
problem and the unicycle dynamics steering problem are considered.
