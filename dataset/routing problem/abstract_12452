The pseudo-Euclidean Toda-like system of cosmological origin is considered.
When certain restrictions on the parameters of the model are imposed, the
dynamics of the model near the ``singularity'' is reduced to a billiard on the
(n-1)-dimensional Lobachevsky space H^{n-1}. The geometrical criterion for the
finiteness of the billiard volume and its compactness is suggested. This
criterion reduces the problem to the problem of illumination of
(n-2)-dimensional sphere S^{n-2} by point-like sources. Some examples are
considered.
