We present a new strategy for solving stiff ODEs with explicit methods. By
adaptively taking a small number of stabilizing small explicit time steps when
necessary, a stiff ODE system can be stabilized enough to allow for time steps
much larger than what is indicated by classical stability analysis. For many
stiff problems the cost of the stabilizing small time steps is small, so the
improvement is large. We illustrate the technique on a number of well-known
stiff test problems.
