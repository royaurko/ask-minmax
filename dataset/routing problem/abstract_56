Acellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a monstrously large single
cell visible by an unaided eye. It shows sophisticated behavioural traits in
foraging for nutrients and developing an optimal transport network of
protoplasmic tubes spanning sources of nutrients. The slime mould sufficiently
approximates man-made transport networks on a flat substrate. Does slime mould
imitate man-made transport networks on three-dimensional terrain as well as it
does on a flat substrate? We simplified the problem to approximation of a
single transport route. In laboratory experiments with 3D Nylon terrains of USA
and Germany we imitated development of route 20, the longest road in USA, and
autobahn 7, the longest national motorway in Europe. We found that slime mould
builds longer transport routes on 3D terrains, comparing to flat agar plates
yet sufficiently approximates man-made transport routes studied. We discuss how
nutrients placed in destination sites affect performance of slime mould, how
the mould navigates around elevations, and offer an automaton model of slime
mould which might explain variability of the protoplasmic routes constructed.
We also display results of scoping experiments with slime mould on 3D terrains
of Russia and United Kingdom.
