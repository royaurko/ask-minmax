This paper addresses a problem on the structural design of control systems,
and explicitly takes into consideration the possible application to large-scale
systems. More precisely, we aim to determine the minimum number of
manipulated/measured state variables ensuring structural controllability/
observability of the linear continuous-time switching system. Further, the
solution can be determined by an efficient procedure, i.e., polynomial in the
number of state variables.
