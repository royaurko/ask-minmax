A versatile new approach for calculating the depletion potential in a hard
sphere mixture is presented. This is valid for any number of components and for
arbitrary densities. We describe two different routes to the depletion
potential for the limit in which the density of one component goes to zero.
Both routes can be implemented within density functional theory and simulation.
We illustrate the approach by calculating the depletion potential for a big
hard sphere in a fluid of small spheres near a planar hard wall. The density
functional results are in excellent agreement with simulations.
