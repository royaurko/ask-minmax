In this paper we consider the following problem: is it possible to recover a
smooth plane curve of degree at least three from its inflection lines? We
answer positively to the posed question for a general smooth plane quartic
curve, making the additional assumption that also one inflection point is
given, and for any smooth plane cubic curve.
