We describe novel optical switching schemes operating at femtosecond time
scales by employing free carrier (FC) excitation. Such unprecedented switching
times are made possible by spatially patterning the density of the excited FCs.
In the first realization, we rely on diffusion, i.e., on the nonlocality of the
FC nonlinear response of the semiconductor, to erase the initial FC pattern
and, thereby, eliminate the reflectivity of the system. In the second
realization, we erase the FC pattern by launching a second pump pulse at a
controlled delay. We discuss the advantages and limitations of the proposed
approaches and demonstrate their potential applicability for switching
ultrashort pulses propagating in silicon waveguides. We show switching
efficiencies of up to $50\%$ for $100$ fs pump pulses, which is an unusually
high level of efficiency for such a short interaction time, a result of the use
of the strong FC nonlinearity. Due to limitations of saturation and pattern
effects, these schemes can be employed for switching applications that require
femtosecond features but standard repetition rates. Such applications include
switching of ultrashort pulses, femtosecond spectroscopy (gating),
time-reversal of short pulses for aberration compensation, and many more. This
approach is also the starting point for ultrafast amplitude modulations and a
new route toward the spatio-temporal shaping of short optical pulses.
