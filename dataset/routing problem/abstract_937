The current Internet is based on a fundamental assumption of reliability and
good intent among actors in the network. Unfortunately, unreliable and
malicious behaviour is becoming a major obstacle for Internet communication. In
order to improve the trustworthiness and reliability of the network
infrastructure, we propose a novel trust model to be incorporated into BGP
routing. In our approach, trust model is defined by combining voting and
recommendation to direct trust estimation for neighbour routers located in
different autonomous systems. We illustrate the impact of our approach with
cases that demonstrate the indication of distrusted paths beyond the nearest
neighbours and the detection of a distrusted neighbour advertising a trusted
path. We simulated the impact of weighting voted and direct trust in a
rectangular grid of 15*15 nodes (autonomous systems) with a randomly connected
topology.
