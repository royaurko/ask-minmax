Perturbative QCD predicts and describes various features of multihadron
production. An amazing similarity between observable hadron systems and
calculable underlying parton ensembles justifies the attempts to use the
language of quarks and gluons down to small momentum scales, to approach the
profound problems that are commonly viewed as being entirely non-perturbative.
