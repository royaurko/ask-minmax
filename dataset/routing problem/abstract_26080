In models of supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking and mediation, strongly coupled
SUSY-breaking sectors can play a significant role in determining the low-energy
spectrum of the model. For example, strong dynamics may provide a natural
solution to both the SUSY flavor problem and the mu / B mu problem. Recently,
it has been suggested that a large class of these models lead to identical
boundary conditions at the SUSY breaking scale. These boundary conditions would
severely constrain the models' viability. We demonstrate that the boundary
conditions are instead sensitive to the details of the hidden sector, so that
only specific hidden sectors may be ruled out by phenomenological
considerations. We determine the high scale boundary conditions using the
operator product expansion of the hidden sector. The techniques used to
determine the beta functions are generally applicable to the RG flow of any
approximately conformal hidden sector. The discrepancy with previously proposed
boundary conditions can be traced to the fact that the renormalization group
(RG) flow involves multiple fixed points.
