In this paper we present a framework which provides an analytical (i.e.,
infinitely differentiable) transformation between spatial coordinates and
orbital elements for the solution of the gravitational two-body problem. The
formalism omits all singular variables which otherwise would yield
discontinuities. This method is based on two simple real functions for which
the derivative rules are only required to be known, all other applications --
e.g., calculating the orbital velocities, obtaining the partial derivatives of
radial velocity curves with respect to the orbital elements -- are thereafter
straightforward. As it is shown, the presented formalism can be applied to find
optimal instants for radial velocity measurements in transiting exoplanetary
systems to constrain the orbital eccentricity as well as to detect secular
variations in the eccentricity or in the longitude of periastron.
