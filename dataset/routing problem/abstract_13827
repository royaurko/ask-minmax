Let $p$ and $q$ be two imprecise points, given as probability density
functions on $\mathbb R^2$, and let $\cal R$ be a set of $n$ line segments
(obstacles) in $\mathbb R^2$. We study the problem of approximating the
probability that $p$ and $q$ can see each other; that is, that the segment
connecting $p$ and $q$ does not cross any segment of $\cal R$. To solve this
problem, we approximate each density function by a weighted set of polygons; a
novel approach to dealing with probability density functions in computational
geometry.
