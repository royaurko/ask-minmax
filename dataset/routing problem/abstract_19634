We solve numerically the nonlinear differential equation for the Hele-Shaw,
Saffman-Taylor problem derived in the preceding work. Stationary solutions with
no free phenomenological parameters are found to fit the measured patterns. The
calculated finger half-widths as a function of the physical parameters of the
cell, compare satisfactorily with experiment.
