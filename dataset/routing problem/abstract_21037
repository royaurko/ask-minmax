In this article we prove that solutions of singular fully nonlinear partial
differential equations are $C^{1,\beta}$. We also prove the simplicity of the
principal eigenvalues for the Dirichlet Problem associated to these operators
using that regularity, a strict comparison principle and Sard's theorem.
