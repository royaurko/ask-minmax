Networks observed in the real world often have many short loops. This
violates the tree-like assumption that underpins the majority of random graph
models and most of the methods used for their analysis. In this paper we sketch
possible research routes to be explored in order to make progress on networks
with many short loops, involving old and new random graph models and ideas for
novel mathematical methods. We do not present conclusive solutions of problems,
but aim to encourage and stimulate new activity and in what we believe to be an
important but under-exposed area of research. We discuss in more detail the
Strauss model, which can be seen as the `harmonic oscillator' of `loopy' random
graphs, and a recent exactly solvable immunological model that involves random
graphs with extensively many cliques and short loops.
