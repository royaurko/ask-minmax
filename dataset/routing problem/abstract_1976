Poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was thermally evaporated and deposited in
vacuum. Infrared spectroscopy was used to confirm that the thin films were
indeed P3HT, and showed that in-situ thermal evaporation provides a viable
route for contaminant-free surface/interface analysis of P3HT in an ultrahigh
vacuum (UHV) environment. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) as well
as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were carried out to
examine the frontier orbitals and core energy levels of P3HT thin films vapor
deposited in UHV on clean polycrystalline silver (Ag) surfaces. UPS spectra
enable the determination of the vacuum shift at the polymer/metal interface,
the valence band maximum (VBM), and the energy of the \Pi-band of the overlayer
film. The P3HT vacuum level decreased in contrast to that of the underlying Ag
as the film thickness increased. XPS and UPS data confirmed the chemical
integrity (stoichiometry) of the polymer at high coverage, as well as the shift
of the C 1s and S 2p binding energy peaks and the secondary-electron edge with
increasing film thickness, indicating that band bending is present at the
P3HT/Ag interface and that the measured onset of the valence band is about 0.8
+- 0.05 eV relative to the Fermi level.
