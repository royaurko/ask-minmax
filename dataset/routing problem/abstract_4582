We investigate a special case of the Induced Subgraph Isomorphism problem,
where both input graphs are interval graphs. We show the NP-hardness of this
problem, and we prove fixed-parameter tractability of the problem with
non-standard parameterization, where the parameter is the difference
|V(G)|-|V(H)|, with G and H being the larger and the smaller input graph,
respectively. Intuitively, we can interpret this problem as "cleaning" the
graph G, regarded as a pattern containing extra vertices indicating errors, in
order to obtain the graph H representing the original pattern. We also prove
W[1]-hardness for the standard parameterization where the parameter is |V(H)|.
