Variational problems that involve Wasserstein distances have been recently
proposed to summarize and learn from probability measures. Despite being
conceptually simple, such problems are computationally challenging because they
involve minimizing over quantities (Wasserstein distances) that are themselves
hard to compute. We show that the dual formulation of Wasserstein variational
problems introduced recently by Carlier et al. (2014) can be regularized using
an entropic smoothing, which leads to smooth, differentiable, convex
optimization problems that are simpler to implement and numerically more
stable. We illustrate the versatility of this approach by applying it to the
computation of Wasserstein barycenters and gradient flows of spacial
regularization functionals.
