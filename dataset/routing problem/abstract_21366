This contribution presents a simple Finite Element model aimed at efficient
simulation of layered glass units. The adopted approach is based on considering
independent kinematics of each layer, tied together via Lagrange multipliers.
Validation and verification of the resulting model against independent data
demonstrate its accuracy, showing its potential for generalization towards more
complex problems.
