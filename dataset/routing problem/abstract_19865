A brief overview of various problems related to the description of a
polarized proton in quark models is presented. Structure functions are
discussed both for longitudinal and transverse polarization. A recently
introduced quantity, relevant in the study of single-spin asymmetries, is shown
to be in principle non-vanishing when computed in chiral models.
