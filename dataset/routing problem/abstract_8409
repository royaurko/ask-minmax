We establish the existence of a positive ground state solution for a
Kirchhoff problem in $\mathbb{R}^2$ involving critical exponential growth, that
is, the nonlinearity behaves like $\exp(\alpha_{0}s^{2})$ as $|s| \to \infty$,
for some $\alpha_{0}>0$. In order to obtain our existence result we used
minimax techniques combined with the Trudinger-Moser inequality.
