This paper is focused on two issues: the K\pi spectrum near threshold - the
kappa problem -, and the pi\pi spectrum between 1.2 and 1.5 GeV/(c^2) -- the
f_0(1370) problem. Both problems will be analysed from the perspective of the
$D$ meson decays, with some additional information from $\tau$ and B decays.
