The dark silicon problem, which limits the power-growth of future computer
generations, is interpreted as a heat energy transport problem when increasing
the energy emitting surface area within a given volume. A comparison of two
3D-configuration models, namely a standard slicing and a fractal surface
generation within the Menger sponge geometry is presented. It is shown, that
for iteration orders $n>3$ the fractal model shows increasingly better thermal
behavior. As a consequence cooling problems may be minimized by using a fractal
architecture. Therefore the Menger sponge geometry is a good example for
fractal architectures applicable not only in computer science, but also e.g. in
chemistry when building chemical reactors, optimizing catalytic processes or in
sensor construction technology building highly effective sensors for toxic
gases or water analysis.
