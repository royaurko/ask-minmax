We show undecidability of the satisfiability problem of what is arguably the
simplest non-sub-Boolean modal logic with an implicit notion of binding. This
work enriches the series of existing results of undecidability of modal logics
with binders, which started with Hybrid Logics and continued with Memory
Logics.
