The finite element method has become a preeminent simulation technique in
electromagnetics. For problems involving anisotropic media and metamaterials,
proper algorithms should be developed. It has been proved that discretizing in
quadratic triangular elements may lead to an improved accuracy. Here we present
a collection of elemental matrices evaluated analytically for quadratic
triangular elements. They could be useful for the finite element method in
advanced electromagnetics.
