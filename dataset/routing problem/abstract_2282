Many shear flows follow a route to turbulence that has striking similarities
to bifurcation scenarios in low-dimensional dynamical systems. Among the
bifurcations that appear, crisis bifurcations are important because they cause
global transitions between open and closed attractors, or indicate drastic
increases in the range of the state space that is covered by the dynamics. We
here study exterior and interior crisis bifurcations in direct numerical
simulations of transitional plane Poiseuille flow in a mirror-symmetric
subspace. We trace the state space dynamics from the appearance of the first
three-dimensional exact coherent structures to the transition from an attractor
to a chaotic saddle in an exterior crisis. For intermediate Reynolds numbers,
the attractor undergoes several interior crises, in which new states appear and
intermittent behavior can be observed. The bifurcations contribute to
increasing the complexity of the dynamics and to a more dense coverage of state
space.
