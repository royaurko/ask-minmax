The asymptotic behavior of the first eigenvalues of magnetic Laplacian
operators with large magnetic fields and Neumann realization in polyhedral
domains is characterized by a hierarchy of model problems. We investigate
properties of the model problems (continuity, semi-continuity, existence of
generalized eigenfunctions). We prove estimates for the remainders of our
asymptotic formula. Lower bounds are obtained with the help of a classical IMS
partition based on adequate coverings of the polyhedral domain, whereas upper
bounds are established by a novel construction of quasimodes, qualified as
sitting or sliding according to spectral properties of local model problems.
