Many databases on the web are "hidden" behind (i.e., accessible only through)
their restrictive, form-like, search interfaces. Recent studies have shown that
it is possible to estimate aggregate query answers over such hidden web
databases by issuing a small number of carefully designed search queries
through the restrictive web interface. A problem with these existing work,
however, is that they all assume the underlying database to be static, while
most real-world web databases (e.g., Amazon, eBay) are frequently updated. In
this paper, we study the novel problem of estimating/tracking aggregates over
dynamic hidden web databases while adhering to the stringent query-cost
limitation they enforce (e.g., at most 1,000 search queries per day).
Theoretical analysis and extensive real-world experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and their superiority over baseline
solutions (e.g., the repeated execution of algorithms designed for static web
databases).
