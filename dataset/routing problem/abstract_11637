We study properties of the semilinear elliptic equation $\Delta u = 1/u$ on
domains in $R^n$, with an eye toward nonnegative singular solutions as limits
of positive smooth solutions. We prove the nonexistence of such solutions in
low dimensions when we also require them to be stable for the corresponding
variational problem. The problem of finding singular solutions is related to
the general study of singularities of minimal hypersurfaces in Euclidean space.
