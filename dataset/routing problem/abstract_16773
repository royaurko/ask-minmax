In many time-dependent problems of practical interest the parameters entering
the equations describing the evolution of the various quantities exhibit
uncertainty. One way to address the problem of how this uncertainty impacts the
solution is to expand the solution using polynomial chaos expansions and obtain
a system of differential equations for the evolution of the expansion
coefficients. We present an application of the Mori-Zwanzig formalism to the
problem of constructing reduced models of such systems of differential
equations. In particular, we construct reduced models for a subset of the
polynomial chaos expansion coefficients that are needed for a full description
of the uncertainty caused by the uncertain parameters. We also present a
Markovian reformulation of the Mori-Zwanzig reduced equation which replaces the
solution of the orthogonal dynamics equation with an infinite hierarchy of
ordinary differential equations. The viscous Burgers equation with uncertain
viscosity parameter is used to illustrate the construction. For this example we
provide a way to estimate the necessary parameters that appear in the reduced
model without having to solve the full system.
