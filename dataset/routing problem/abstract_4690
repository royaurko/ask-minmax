A natural way to model dynamic systems under uncertainty is to use fuzzy
boundary value problems (FBVPs) and related uncertain systems. In this paper we
use fuzzy Laplace transform to ?find the solution of two-point boundary value
under generalized Hukuhara differentiability. We illustrate the method for the
solution of the well known two-point boundary value problem Schrodinger
equation, and homogeneous boundary value problem. Consequently, we investigate
the solutions of FBVPs under as a new application of fuzzy Laplace transform.
