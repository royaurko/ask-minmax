There are a large number of methods for solving under-determined linear
inverse problem. Many of them have very high time complexity for large
datasets. We propose a new method called Two-Stage Sparse Representation (TSSR)
to tackle this problem. We decompose the representing space of signals into two
parts, the measurement dictionary and the sparsifying basis. The dictionary is
designed to approximate a sub-Gaussian distribution to exploit its
concentration property. We apply sparse coding to the signals on the dictionary
in the first stage, and obtain the training and testing coefficients
respectively. Then we design the basis to approach an identity matrix in the
second stage, to acquire the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) and
universality property. The testing coefficients are encoded over the basis and
the final representing coefficients are obtained. We verify that the projection
of testing coefficients onto the basis is a good approximation of the signal
onto the representing space. Since the projection is conducted on a much
sparser space, the runtime is greatly reduced. For concrete realization, we
provide an instance for the proposed TSSR. Experiments on four biometrics
databases show that TSSR is effective and efficient, comparing with several
classical methods for solving linear inverse problem.
