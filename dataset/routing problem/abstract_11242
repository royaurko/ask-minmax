This paper is concerned with the problem of approximating the determinant of
A for a large sparse symmetric positive definite matrix A. It is shown that an
efficient solution of this problem is obtained by using a sparse approximate
inverse of A. The method is explained and theoretical properties are discussed.
A posteriori error estimation techniques are presented. Furthermore, results of
numerical experiments are given which illustrate the performance of this new
method.
