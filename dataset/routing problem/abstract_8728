We establish interpolation problems related to all the $q$-Painlev\'e
equations of types from $E_7^{(1)}$ to $(A_2+A_1)^{(1)}$. By solving those
problems, we can derive the evolution equations, the scalar Lax pairs and the
determinant formulae of special solutions for the corresponding $q$-Painlev\'e
equations.
