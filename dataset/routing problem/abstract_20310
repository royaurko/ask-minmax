We prove sharp $L^2$ regularity results for classes of strongly singular
Radon transfoms on the Heisenberg group by means of oscillatory integrals. We
show that the problem in question can be effectively treated by establishing
uniform estimates for certain oscillatory integrals whose canonical relations
project with two-sided fold singularities; this new approach also allows us to
treat operators which are not necessarily translation invariant.
