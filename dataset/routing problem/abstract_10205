Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a fundamental computational problem in
statistics. The problem is to maximize the likelihood function with respect to
given data on a statistical model. An algebraic approach to this problem is to
solve a very structured parameterized polynomial system called likelihood
equations. For general choices of data, the number of complex solutions to the
likelihood equations is finite and called the ML-degree of the model. The only
solutions to the likelihood equations that are statistically meaningful are the
real/positive solutions. However, the number of real/positive solutions is not
characterized by the ML-degree. We use discriminants to classify data according
to the number of real/positive solutions of the likelihood equations. We call
these discriminants data-discriminants (DD). We develop a probabilistic
algorithm for computing DDs. Experimental results show that, for the benchmarks
we have tried, the probabilistic algorithm is more efficient than the standard
elimination algorithm. Based on the computational results, we discuss the real
root classification problem for the 3 by 3 symmetric matrix~model.
