We investigate elliptic boundary-value problems with additional unknown
functions in boundary conditions. These problems were introduced by Lawruk. We
prove that the operator corresponding to such a problem is bounded and Fredholm
on appropriate couples of the inner product isotropic H\"ormander spaces
$H^{s,\varphi}$, which form the refined Sobolev scale. The order of
differentiation for these spaces is given by the real number $s$ and positive
function $\varphi$ that varies slowly at infinity in the sense of Karamata. We
consider this problem for an arbitrary elliptic equation $Au=f$ on a bounded
Euclidean domain $\Omega$ under the condition that $u\in
H^{s,\varphi}(\Omega)$, $s<\mathrm{ord}\,A$, and $f\in L_{2}(\Omega)$. We prove
theorems on the a priori estimate and regularity of the generalized solutions
to this problem.
