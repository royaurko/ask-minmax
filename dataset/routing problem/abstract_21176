A formula for the radii and positions of four circles in the plane for an
arbitrary linearly independent circle configuration is found. Among special
cases is the recent extended Descartes Theorem on the Descartes configuration
and an analytic solution to the Apollonian problem. The general theorem for
n-spheres is also considered.
