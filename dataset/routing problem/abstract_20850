In this paper, we obtain Groebner-Shirshov (non-commutative Gr\"obner) bases
for the braid groups in the Birman-Ko-Lee generators enriched by new ``Garside
word" $\delta$. It gives a new algorithm for getting the Birman-Ko-Lee Normal
Form in the braid groups, and thus a new algorithm for solving the word problem
in these groups.
