Modular curves like X_0(N) and X_1(N) appear very frequently in arithmetic
geometry. While their complex points are obtained as a quotient of the upper
half plane by some subgroups of SL_2(Z), they allow for a more arithmetic
description as a solution to a moduli problem. This description turns out to be
very useful in many applications. We wish to give such a moduli description for
two modular curves: those associated to non-split Cartan subgroups and their
normaliser in GL_2(F_p). These modular curves appear for instance in Serre's
problem of classifying all possible Galois structures of p-torsion points on
elliptic curves over number fields. Some classical results about the geometry
of those curves can be proven using this moduli description. For instance, we
can count the number of elliptic points, describe the cusps and the degeneracy
maps. We also give a moduli-theoretic interpretation and a new proof of a
result of Chen.
