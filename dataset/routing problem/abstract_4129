We study convex relaxation algorithms for phase retrieval on imaging
problems. We show that structural assumptions on the signal and the
observations, such as sparsity, smoothness or positivity, can be exploited to
both speed-up convergence and improve recovery performance. We detail
experimental results in molecular imaging problems simulated from PDB data.
