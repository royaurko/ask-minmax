Topological 4-dimensional surgery is conjectured to fail, in general, for
free fundamental groups. M. Freedman and P. Teichner have shown that surgery
problems with an arbitrary fundamental group have a solution, provided they
satisfy a certain condition on Dwyer's filtration on second homology. We give a
new geometric proof of this result, and analyze its relation to the canonical
surgery problems.
