Given a quadratic two-parameter matrix polynomial Q, we develop a systematic
approach to generating a vector space of linear two-parameter matrix
polynomials. We identify a set of linearizations of Q that lie in the vector
space. Finally, we determine a class of linearizations for a quadratic two-
parameter eigenvalue problem.
