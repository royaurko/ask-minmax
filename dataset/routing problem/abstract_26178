In this paper we investigate novel applications of a new class of equations
which we call time-delayed backward stochastic differential equations.
Time-delayed BSDEs may arise in finance when we want to find an investment
strategy and an investment portfolio which should replicate a liability or meet
a target depending on the applied strategy or the past values of the portfolio.
In this setting, a managed investment portfolio serves simultaneously as the
underlying security on which the liability/target is contingent and as a
replicating portfolio for that liability/target. This is usually the case for
capital-protected investments and performance-linked pay-offs. We give examples
of pricing, hedging and portfolio management problems (asset-liability
management problems) which could be investigated in the framework of
time-delayed BSDEs. Our motivation comes from life insurance and we focus on
participating contracts and variable annuities. We derive the corresponding
time-delayed BSDEs and solve them explicitly or at least provide hints how to
solve them numerically. We give a financial interpretation of the theoretical
fact that a time-delayed BSDE may not have a solution or may have multiple
solutions.
