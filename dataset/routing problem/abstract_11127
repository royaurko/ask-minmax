The quantified constraint satisfaction problem (QCSP) is a powerful framework
for modelling computational problems. The general intractability of the QCSP
has motivated the pursuit of restricted cases that avoid its maximal
complexity. In this paper, we introduce and study a new model for investigating
QCSP complexity in which the types of constraints given by the existentially
quantified variables, is restricted. Our primary technical contribution is the
development and application of a general technology for proving positive
results on parameterizations of the model, of inclusion in the complexity class
coNP.
