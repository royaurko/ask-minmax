We consider the Cauchy problem on nonlinear scalar conservation laws with a
diffusion-type source term related to an index $s\in \R$ over the whole space
$\R^n$ for any spatial dimension $n\geq 1$. Here, the diffusion-type source
term behaves as the usual diffusion term over the low frequency domain while it
admits on the high frequency part a feature of regularity-gain and
regularity-loss for $s< 1$ and $s>1$, respectively. For all $s\in \R$, we not
only obtain the $L^p$-$L^q$ time-decay estimates on the linear solution
semigroup but also establish the global existence and optimal time-decay rates
of small-amplitude classical solutions to the nonlinear Cauchy problem. In the
case of regularity-loss, the time-weighted energy method is introduced to
overcome the weakly dissipative property of the equation. Moreover, the
large-time behavior of solutions asymptotically tending to the heat diffusion
waves is also studied. The current results have general applications to several
concrete models arising from physics.
