A simple method for some class of inverse obstacle scattering problems is
introduced. The observation data are given by a wave field measured on a known
surface surrounding unknown obstacles over a finite time interval. The wave is
generated by an initial data with compact support outside the surface. The
method yields the distance from a given point outside the surface to obstacles
and thus more than the convex hull.
