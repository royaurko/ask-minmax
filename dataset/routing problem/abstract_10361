Recently, many structured tensors are defined and their properties are
discussed in the literature. In this paper, we introduce a new class of
structured tensors, called exceptionally regular tensor, which is relevant to
the tensor complementarity problem. We show that this class of tensors is a
wide class of tensors which includes many important structured tensors as its
special cases. By constructing two examples, we demonstrate that an
exceptionally regular tensor can be, but not always, an $R$-tensor. We also
show that within the class of the semi-positive tensors, the class of
exceptionally regular tensors coincides with the class of $R$-tensors. In
addition, we consider the tensor complementarity problem with an exceptionally
regular tensor or an $R$-tensor or a $P_0+R_0$-tensor, and show that the
solution sets of these classes of tensor complementarity problems are nonempty
and compact.
