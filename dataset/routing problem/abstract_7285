This paper proposes and analyzes a full discretization of the exterior
transient Stokes problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The method is
based on a single layer boundary integral representation, using Galerkin
semidiscretization in the space variables and multistep Convolution Quadrature
in time. Convergence estimates are based on a Laplace domain analysis, which
translates into a detailed study of the exterior Brinkman problem. Some
numerical experiments are provided.
