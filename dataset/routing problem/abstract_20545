We consider the problem when lens spaces are given from homology spheres, and
demonstrate that many lens spaces are obtained from L-space homology sphere
which the Ozsv\'ath Szab\'o's correction term $d(Y)$ is equal to 2. We show an
inequality of slope and genus when $Y$ is L-space and $Y_p(K)$ is lens space.
