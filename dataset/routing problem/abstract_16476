This paper introduces a new public key cryptosystem based on two hard
problems : the cube root extraction modulo a composite moduli (which is
equivalent to the factorisation of the moduli) and the discrete logarithm
problem. These two hard problems are combined during the key generation,
encryption and decryption phases. By combining the IFP and the DLP we introduce
a secure and efficient public key cryptosystem. To break the scheme, an
adversary may solve the IFP and the DLP separately which is computationally
infeasible. The key generation is a simple operation based on the discrete
logarithm modulo a composite moduli. The encryption phase is based both on the
cube root computation and the DLP. These operations are computationally
efficient.
