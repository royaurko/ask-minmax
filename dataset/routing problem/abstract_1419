Muon spin relaxation experiments have been carried out in the Kondo compound
PrInAg_2. The zero-field muon relaxation rate is found to be independent of
temperature between 0.1 and 10 K, which rules out a magnetic origin (spin
freezing or a conventional Kondo effect) for the previously-observed specific
heat anomaly at \sim0.5 K. The low-temperature muon relaxation is
quantitatively consistent with nuclear magnetism including hyperfine
enhancement of the ^{141}Pr nuclear moment. This is strong evidence against a
Pr^{3+} electronic magnetic moment, and for the \Gamma_3
crystalline-electric-field-split ground state required for a nonmagnetic route
to heavy-electron behavior. The data imply the existence of an exchange
interaction between neighboring Pr^{3+} ions of the order of 0.2 K in
temperature units, which should be taken into account in a complete theory of a
nonmagnetic Kondo effect in PrInAg_2.
