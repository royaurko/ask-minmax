VANET (Vehicular Ad-hoc Network) is a new technology which has taken enormous
attention in the recent years. Vehicular ad hoc network is formed by cars which
are called nodes; allow them to communicate with one another without using any
fixed road side unit. It has some unique characteristics which make it
different from other ad hoc network as well as difficult to define any exact
mobility model and routing protocols because of their high mobility and
changing mobility pattern. Hence performance of routing protocols can vary with
the various parameters such as speed, pause time, node density and traffic
scenarios. In this research paper, the performance of two on-demand routing
protocols AODV & DSR has been analyzed by means of packet delivery ratio, loss
packet ratio & average end-to-end delay with varying pause time, speed time and
node density under TCP & CBR connection.
