We consider emission of a photon by an electron in the field of a strong
laser wave. Polarization effects in this process are important for a number of
physical problems. A probability of this process for circularly or linearly
polarized laser photons and for arbitrary polarization of all other particles
is calculated. We obtain the complete set of functions which describe such a
probability in a compact invariant form. Besides, we discuss in some detail the
polarization effects in the kinematics relevant to the problem of electron to
photon conversion at photon-photon and photon-electron colliders.
