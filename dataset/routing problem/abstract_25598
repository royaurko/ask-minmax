In the symmetric group Sym(n) with n at least 5 let H be a conjugacy class of
elements of order 2 and let \Gamma be the Cayley graph whose vertex set is the
group G generated by H (so G is Sym(n) or Alt(n)) and whose edge set is
determined by H. We are interested in the metric structure of this graph. In
particular, for g\in G let B_{r}(g) be the metric ball in \Gamma of radius r
and centre g. We show that the intersection numbers \Phi(\Gamma; r,
g):=|\,B_{r}(e)\,\cap\,B_{r}(g)\,| are generalized Stirling functions in n and
r. The results are motivated by the study of error graphs and related
reconstruction problems.
