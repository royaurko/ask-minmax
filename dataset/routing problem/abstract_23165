This paper is concerned with the initial-boundary value problem for the
Einstein equations in a first-order generalized harmonic formulation. We impose
boundary conditions that preserve the constraints and control the incoming
gravitational radiation by prescribing data for the incoming fields of the Weyl
tensor. High-frequency perturbations about any given spacetime (including a
shift vector with subluminal normal component) are analyzed using the
Fourier-Laplace technique. We show that the system is boundary-stable. In
addition, we develop a criterion that can be used to detect weak instabilities
with polynomial time dependence, and we show that our system does not suffer
from such instabilities. A numerical robust stability test supports our claim
that the initial-boundary value problem is most likely to be well-posed even if
nonzero initial and source data are included.
