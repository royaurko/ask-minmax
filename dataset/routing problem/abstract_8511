In this paper, we consider the problem: given a symmetric concave
configuration of four bodies, under what conditions is it possible to choose
positive masses which make it central. We show that there are some regions in
which no central configuration is possible for positive masses. Conversely, for
any configuration in the complement of the union of these regions, it is always
possible to choose positive masses to make the configuration central.
