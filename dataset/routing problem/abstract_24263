The famous \emph{circular law} asserts that if $M_n$ is an $n \times n$
matrix with iid complex entries of mean zero and unit variance, then the
empirical spectral distribution (ESD) of the normalized matrix
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} M_n$ converges almost surely to the uniform distribution on
the unit disk $\{z \in \C: |z| \leq 1 \}$. After a long sequence of partial
results that verified this law under additional assumptions on the distribution
of the entries, the full circular law was recently established in
\cite{TVcir2}. In this survey we describe some of the key ingredients used in
the establishment of the circular law, in particular recent advances in
understanding the Littlewood-Offord problem and its inverse.
