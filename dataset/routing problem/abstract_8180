The problem of blackbody radiation in flat space with non-compact extra
dimensions was analysed recently. In the present article we reanalyse this
problem with compact (and non-compact) extra dimensions in flat space to
observe the consequences of this approach upon Wien's displacement and
Stefan-Boltzmann law.
