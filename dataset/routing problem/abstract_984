This study is about harvesting point of interest from GPS trajectories.
Trajectories are the paths that moving objects move by follow through space in
a function of time while GPS trajectories generally are point-sequences with
geographic coordinates, time stamp, speed and heading. User can get information
from GPS enable device. For example, user can acquire present location, search
the information around them and design driving routes to a destination and thus
design travel itineraries. By sharing GPS logs among each other, people are
able to find some places that attract them from other people's travel route.
Analysis on the GPS logs can get the point of interest that is popular. By
present the point of interest, user can choose travel place easily and the
travel itineraries is plan based on the user preferences.
