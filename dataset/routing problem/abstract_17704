This paper is devoted to solve the galactic rotation problem for ESO138-G014
galaxy based on two theories: dark matter and Modified Newtonian Dynamics. Here
we did the rotation curve analysis with two possible choices for the dark
matter density profile, namely Burkert and Navarro, Frenk and White profiles.
The analysis shows the dark matter distribution favored to Burkert profile
(cored dark matter). The standard hypothesis for most spiral galaxies are known
to be embedded in dark matter haloes has now been overshadowed by Modified
Newtonian Dynamics, known as MOND, the leading alternative of dark matter. MOND
addresses the problem of a new fundamental constant $a_0$, called the
acceleration constant, at which acceleration scale of Newton second law fails
to hold. In this respect, we investigate this issue by testing the rotation
curve within the MOND framework with the observations to obtain the reliable
disk mass, $M_D$. We investigate whether ESO138-G014 is compatible with MOND or
dark matter is still favorable for the galactic rotation problem.
