Geometric problems are usually formulated by means of (exterior) differential
systems. In this theory, one enriches the system by adding algebraic and
differential constraints, and then looks for regular solutions.
 Here we adopt a dual approach, which consists to enrich a plane field, as this
is often practised in control theory, by adding brackets of the vector fields
tangent to it, and then, look for singular solutions of the obtained
distribution. We apply this to the isometry problem of rigid geometric
structures.
