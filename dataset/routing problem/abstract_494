This paper presents the realistic approach towards the quantitative analysis
and simulation of Energy Efficient Hierarchical Cluster (EEHC)-based routing
for wireless sensor networks. Here the efforts have been done to combine
analytical hardware model with the modified EEHC-based routing model. The
dependence of various performance metrics like: optimum number of clusters,
Energy Consumption, and Energy consumed per round etc. based on analytical
hardware sensor model and EEHC model has been presented.
