We describe the most efficient solutions to the word problem of Artin's braid
group known so far, i.e., in other words, the most efficient solutions to the
braid isotopy problem, including the Dynnikov method, which could be especially
suitable for cryptographical applications. Most results appear in literature;
however, some results about the greedy normal form and the symmetric normal
form and their connection with grid diagrams may have never been stated
explicitly.
