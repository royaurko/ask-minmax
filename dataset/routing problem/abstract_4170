We consider the Tarski--Bang problem about covering by planks and show that
the symplectic techniques may be useful in this problem. We are able to handle
some particular cases with the symplectic techniques, and show that the general
cases would follow from a certain "subadditivity conjecture" in symplectic
geometry. We also prove several related results by more elementary methods.
