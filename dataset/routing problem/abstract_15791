We consider, in a Hilbert space $H$, the convolution integro-differential
equation $u''(t)-h*Au(t)=f(t)$, $0\le t\le T$, $h*v(t)=\int_0^t h(t-s)v(s) ds$,
where $A$ is a linear closed densely defined (possibly selfadjoint and/or
positive definite) operator in $H$. Under suitable assumptions on the data we
solve the inverse problem consisting of finding the kernel $h$ from the extra
data (measured data) of the type $g(t):=(u(t),\phi)$, where $\phi$ is some
eigenvector of $A^*$. An inverse problem for the first-order equation
$u'(t)-l*Au(t)=f(t)$, $0\le t\le T$, is also studied when $A$ enjoys the same
properties as in the previous case.
