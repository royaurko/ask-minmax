For commuting linear operators $P_0,P_1,..., P_\ell$ we describe a range of
conditions which are weaker than invertibility. When any of these conditions
hold we may study the composition $P=P_0P_1... P_\ell$ in terms of the
component operators or combinations thereof. In particular the general
inhomogeneous problem $Pu=f$ reduces to a system of simpler problems. These
problems capture the structure of the solution and range spaces and, if the
operators involved are differential, then this gives an effective way of
lowering the differential order of the problem to be studied. Suitable systems
of operators may be treated analogously. For a class of decompositions the
higher symmetries of a composition $P$ may be derived from generalised
symmmetries of the component operators $P_i$ in the system.
