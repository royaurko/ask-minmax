In this work, we find base and dimension of a subspace appeared in works by
V. A. Sharafutdinov. The same problem, but expressed in terms of polynomials
from matrix minors, was initially solved by W. Hodge. The new result of this
paper is the explicit base of the space and considerable simplification of the
formula for its dimension.
