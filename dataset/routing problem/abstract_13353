What exists "out there"? What does "doing physics" mean? What are the
axiomatic ideas for microphysics? What is a particle? What is an apparatus made
of? We show that Quantum Mechanics textbooks cannot truly answer this kind of
question whereas they should. By adopting a pure "hitological" point of view
for microphysics, we introduce the Hit in Apparatuses Theory (HAT) and the
Vacuum of Apparatuses (VA) that restore, through Object Orientation (OO), an
intuitive ontology to deal with this kind of physics. Through a review of what
it means to "observe" and what relativism means in Special and General
Relativities (SR and GR), we address the problem of finding common maths for GR
and QM. Finally, with our new HAT, we address the measurement problem in QM and
propose two possible approaches.
