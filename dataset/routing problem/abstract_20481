We show that the problem of non conservation of energy found in the
spontaneous localization model developed by Ghirardi, Rimini and Weber is very
similar to the inconsistency between the stochastic models for turbulence and
the Navier-Stokes equation. This sort of analogy may be useful in the
development of both areas.
