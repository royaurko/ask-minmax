This paper is concerned with developing efficient numerical methods for
acoustic wave scattering in random media which can be expressed as random
perturbations of homogeneous media. We first analyze the random Helmholtz
problem by deriving some wave-number-explicit solution estimates. We then
establish a multi-modes representation of the solution as a power series of the
perturbation parameter and analyze its finite modes approximations. Based on
this multi-modes representation, we develop a Monte Carlo interior penalty
discontinuous Galerkin (MCIP-DG) method for approximating the mode functions,
which are governed by recursively defined nearly deterministic Helmholtz
equations. Optimal order error estimates are derived for the method and an
efficient algorithm, which is based on the LU direct solver, is also designed
for efficiently implementing the proposed multi-modes MCIP-DG method. It is
proved that the computational complexity of the whole algorithm is comparable
to that of solving one deterministic Helmholtz problem using the LU director
solver. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical results
and to gauge the performance of the proposed numerical method and algorithm.
