An ad hoc network of vehicles (VANET) consists of vehicles that exchange
information via radio in order to improve road safety, traffic management and
do better distribution of traffic load in time and space. Along with this it
allows Internet access for passengers and users of vehicles. A significant
characteristic while studying VANETs is the requirement of having a mobility
model that gives aspects of real vehicular traffic. These scenarios play an
important role in performance of VANETs. In our paper we have demonstration and
description of generating realistic mobility model using various tools such as
eWorld, OpenStreetMap, SUMO and TraNS. Generated mobility scenario is added to
NS-2.34 (Network Simulator) for analysis of DSR and AODV routing protocol under
802.11p (DSRC/WAVE) and 802.11a. Results after analysis shows 802.11p is more
suitable than 802.11a for VANET.
