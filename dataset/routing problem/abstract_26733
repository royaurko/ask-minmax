Device-free (DF) localization is an emerging technology that allows the
detection and tracking of entities that do not carry any devices nor
participate actively in the localization process. Typically, DF systems require
a large number of transmitters and receivers to achieve acceptable accuracy,
which is not available in many scenarios such as homes and small businesses. In
this paper, we introduce MonoStream as an accurate single-stream DF
localization system that leverages the rich Channel State Information (CSI) as
well as MIMO information from the physical layer to provide accurate DF
localization with only one stream. To boost its accuracy and attain low
computational requirements, MonoStream models the DF localization problem as an
object recognition problem and uses a novel set of CSI-context features and
techniques with proven accuracy and efficiency. Experimental evaluation in two
typical testbeds, with a side-by-side comparison with the state-of-the-art,
shows that MonoStream can achieve an accuracy of 0.95m with at least 26%
enhancement in median distance error using a single stream only. This
enhancement in accuracy comes with an efficient execution of less than 23ms per
location update on a typical laptop. This highlights the potential of
MonoStream usage for real-time DF tracking applications.
