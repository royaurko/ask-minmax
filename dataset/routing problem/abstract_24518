While little Higgs models provide an interesting way to address the hierarchy
problem, concrete models in the literature typically face two major obstacles.
First, the mechanism for generating a Higgs quartic coupling often leads to
large violations of custodial symmetry. Second, there is a tension between
precision electroweak observables in the gauge sector and fine-tuning in the
top sector. In this work, we present a new little Higgs model which solves both
of these problems. The model is based on an SO(6)xSO(6)/SO(6) coset space which
has custodial symmetry built in. The Higgs quartic coupling takes a
particularly simple form and does not suffer from the "dangerous singlet"
pathology. We introduce a gauge breaking module which decouples the mass of
gauge partners from the mass of top partners, allowing for natural electroweak
symmetry breaking. The collider phenomenology is dominated by production and
decay of the top partners, which are considerably lighter than in traditional
little Higgs theories.
