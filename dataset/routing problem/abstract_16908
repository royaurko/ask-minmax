We investigate the asymptotic behavior for type II Hermite-Pade approximation
to two functions, where each function has two branch points and the pairs of
branch points are separated. We give a classification of the cases such that
the limiting counting measures for the poles of the Hermite-Pade approximants
are described by an algebraic function of order 3 and genus 0. This situation
gives rise to a vector-potential equilibrium problem for three measures and the
poles of the common denominator are asymptotically distributed like one of
these measures. We also work out the strong asymptotics for the corresponding
Hermite-Pade approximants by using a 3x3 Riemann-Hilbert problem that
characterizes this Hermite-Pade approximation problem.
