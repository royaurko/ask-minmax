We have considered the persistence of unvisited sites of a lattice, i.e., the
probability $S(t)$ that a site remains unvisited till time $t$ in presence of
mutually repulsive random walkers. The dynamics of this system has direct
correspondence to that of the domain walls in a certain system of Ising spins
where the number of domain walls become fixed following a zero termperature
quench. Here we get the result that $S(t) \propto \exp(-\alpha t^{\beta})$
where $\beta$ is close to 0.5 and $\alpha$ a function of the density of the
walkers $\rho$. The number of persistent sites in presence of independent
walkers of density $\rho^\prime$ is known to be $S^\prime (t) = \exp(-2
\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \rho^\prime t^{1/2})$. We show that a mapping of the
interacting walkers' problem to the independent walkers' problem is possible
with $\rho^\prime = \rho/(1-\rho)$ provided $\rho^\prime, \rho$ are small. We
also discuss some other intricate results obtained in the interacting walkers'
case.
