In this work we consider the problem of gathering autonomous robots in the
plane. In particular, we consider non-transparent unit-disc robots (i.e., fat)
in an asynchronous setting. Vision is the only mean of coordination. Using a
state-machine representation we formulate the gathering problem and develop a
distributed algorithm that solves the problem for any number of robots.
  The main idea behind our algorithm is for the robots to reach a configuration
in which all the following hold: (a) The robots' centers form a convex hull in
which all robots are on the convex, (b) Each robot can see all other robots,
and (c) The configuration is connected, that is, every robot touches another
robot and all robots together form a connected formation. We show that starting
from any initial configuration, the robots, making only local decisions and
coordinate by vision, eventually reach such a configuration and terminate,
yielding a solution to the gathering problem.
