We develop a new and efficient method to systematically analyse four
dimensional effective supergravities which descend from flux compactifications.
The issue of finding vacua of such systems, both supersymmetric and
non-supersymmetric, is mapped into a problem in computational algebraic
geometry. Using recent developments in computer algebra, the problem can then
be rapidly dealt with in a completely algorithmic fashion. Two main results are
(1) a procedure for calculating constraints which the flux parameters must
satisfy in these models if any given type of vacuum is to exist; (2) a stepwise
process for finding all of the isolated vacua of such systems and their
physical properties. We illustrate our discussion with several concrete
examples, some of which have eluded conventional methods so far.
