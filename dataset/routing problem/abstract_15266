In this paper we develop an abstract method to handle the problem of unique
continuation for the Schr\"odinger equation $(i\partial_t+\Delta)u=V(x)u$. In
general the problem is to find a class of potentials $V$ which allows the
unique continuation. The key point of our work is to make a direct link between
the problem and the weighted $L^2$ resolvent estimates
$\|(-\Delta-z)^{-1}f\|_{L^2(|V|)}\leq C\|f\|_{L^2(|V|^{-1})}$. We carry out it
in an abstract way, and thereby we do not need to deal with each of the
potential classes. To do so, we will make use of limiting absorption principle
and Kato $H$-smoothing theorem in spectral theory, and employ some tools from
harmonic analysis. Once the resolvent estimate is set up for a potential class,
from our abstract theory the unique continuation would follow from the same
potential class. Also, it turns out that there can be no dented surface on the
boundary of the maximal open zero set of the solution $u$. In this regard,
another main issue for us is to know which class of potentials allows the
resolvent estimate. We establish such a new class which contains previously
known ones, and will also apply it to the problem of well-posedness for the
equation.
