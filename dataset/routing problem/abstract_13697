A remarkable connection between the order of a maximum clique and the
Lagrangian of a graph was established by Motzkin and Straus in 1965. This
connection and its extensions were applied in Tur\'{a}n problems of graphs and
uniform hypergraphs. Very recently, the study of Tur\'{a}n densities of
non-uniform hypergraphs has been motivated by extremal poset problems. In this
paper, we give some Motzkin-Straus type results for non-uniform hypergraphs.
