We study the non-canonical method for solving the Satisfiability problem
which given by a formula in the form of the conjunctive normal form. The
essence of this method consists in counting the number of tuples of Boolean
variables, on which at least one clause of the given formula is false. On this
basis the solution of the problem obtains in the form YES or NO without
constructing tuple, when the answer is YES. It is found that if the clause in
the given formula has pairwise contrary literals, then the problem can be
solved efficiently. However, when in the formula there are a long chain of
clauses with pairwise non-contrary literals, the solution leads to an
exponential calculations.
