We consider the problem of the computation of $\inf_p \theta p$ over the set
of exponent pairs $P \ni p$ under linear constraints for a certain class of
objective functions $\theta$. An effective algorithm is presented. The output
of the algorithm leads to the improvement and establishing new estimates in the
various divisor problems in the analytic number theory.
