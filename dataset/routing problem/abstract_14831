Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a data analysis technique which
allows compression and interpretation of nonnegative data. NMF became widely
studied after the publication of the seminal paper by Lee and Seung (Learning
the Parts of Objects by Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, Nature, 1999, vol.
401, pp. 788--791), which introduced an algorithm based on Multiplicative
Updates (MU). More recently, another class of methods called Hierarchical
Alternating Least Squares (HALS) was introduced that seems to be much more
efficient in practice.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of approximating a not necessarily
nonnegative matrix with the product of two nonnegative matrices, which we refer
to as Nonnegative Factorization (NF); this is the subproblem that HALS methods
implicitly try to solve at each iteration. We prove that NF is NP-hard for any
fixed factorization rank, using a reduction to the maximum edge biclique
problem.
  We also generalize the multiplicative updates to NF, which allows us to shed
some light on the differences between the MU and HALS algorithms for NMF and
give an explanation for the better performance of HALS. Finally, we link
stationary points of NF with feasible solutions of the biclique problem to
obtain a new type of biclique finding algorithm (based on MU) whose iterations
have an algorithmic complexity proportional to the number of edges in the
graph, and show that it performs better than comparable existing methods.
