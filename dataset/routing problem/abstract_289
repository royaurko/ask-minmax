We use the Percus-Yevick approach in the chemical-potential route to evaluate
the equation of state of hard hyperspheres in five dimensions. The evaluation
requires the derivation of an analytical expression for the contact value of
the pair distribution function between particles of the bulk fluid and a solute
particle with arbitrary size. The equation of state is compared with those
obtained from the conventional virial and compressibility thermodynamic routes
and the associated virial coefficients are computed. The pressure calculated
from all routes is exact up to third density order, but it deviates with
respect to simulation data as density increases, the compressibility and the
chemical-potential routes exhibiting smaller deviations than the virial route.
Accurate linear interpolations between the compressibility route and either the
chemical-potential route or the virial one are constructed.
