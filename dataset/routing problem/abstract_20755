A model equation for the motion of a vortex filament immersed in three
dimensional, incompressible and inviscid fluid is investigated as a humble
attempt to model the motion of a tornado. We solve an initial-boundary value
problem in the half space where we impose a boundary condition in which the
vortex filament is allowed to move on the boundary.
