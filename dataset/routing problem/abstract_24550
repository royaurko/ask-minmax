In the context of adaptive Monte Carlo algorithms, we cannot directly
generate independent samples from the distribution of interest but use a proxy
which we need to be close to the target. Generally, such a proxy distribution
is a parametric family on the sampling spaces of the target distribution. For
continuous sampling problems in high dimensions, we often use the multivariate
normal distribution as a proxy for we can easily parametrise it by its moments
and quickly sample from it. Our objective is to construct similarly flexible
parametric families on binary sampling spaces too large for exhaustive
enumeration. The binary sampling problem is more difficult than its continuous
counterpart since the choice of a suitable proxy distribution is not obvious.
