A cycle double cover (CDC) of an undirected graph is a collection of the
graph's cycles such that every edge of the graph belongs to exactly two cycles.
We describe a constructive method for generating all the cubic graphs that have
a 6-CDC (a CDC in which every cycle has length 6). As an application of the
method, we prove that all such graphs have a Hamiltonian cycle. A sense of
direction is an edge labeling on graphs that follows a globally consistent
scheme and is known to considerably reduce the complexity of several
distributed problems. In [9], a particular instance of sense of direction,
called a chordal sense of direction (CSD), is studied and the class of
k-regular graphs that admit a CSD with exactly k labels (a minimal CSD) is
analyzed. We now show that nearly all the cubic graphs in this class have a
6-CDC, the only exception being K4.
