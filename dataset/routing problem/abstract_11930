A discrete system of coupled waves (with nonanalytic dispersion relation) is
derived in the context of the spectral transform theory for the Ablowitz Ladik
spectral problem (discrete version of the Zakharov-Shabat system). This 3-wave
evolution problem is a discrete version of the stimulated Raman scattering
equations, and it is shown to be solvable for arbitrary boundary value of the
two radiation fields and initial value of the medium state. The spectral
transform is constructed on the basis of the D-bar approach.
