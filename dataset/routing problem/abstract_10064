It is well known that the constraint satisfaction problem over a general
relational structure $\mathbb{A}$ is polynomial time equivalent to the
constraint problem over some associated digraph. We present a variant of this
construction and show that the corresponding constraint satisfaction problem is
logspace equivalent to that over $\mathbb{A}$. Moreover, we show that almost
all of the commonly encountered polymorphism properties are held equivalently
on the $\mathbb{A}$ and the constructed digraph. As a consequence, the
Algebraic CSP dichotomy conjecture as well as the conjectures characterizing
CSPs solvable in logspace and in nondeterministic logspace are equivalent to
their restriction to digraphs.
