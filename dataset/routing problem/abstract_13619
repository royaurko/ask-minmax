As, the number of vehicles are increased day by day in rapid manner. It
causes the problem of traffic congestion, pollution (noise and air). To
overcome this problem A FPGA based parking system has been proposed. In this
paper, parking system is implemented using Finite State Machine modelling. The
system has two main modules i.e. identification module and slot checking
module. Identification module identifies the visitor. Slot checking module
checks the slot status. These modules are modeled in HDL and implemented on
FPGA. A prototype of parking system is designed with various interfaces like
sensor interfacing, stepper motor and LCD.
