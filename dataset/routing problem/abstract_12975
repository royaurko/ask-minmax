This paper is devoted to the problem of classification, up to smooth
isomorphisms or up to orbital equivalence, of smooth integrable vector fields
on 2-dimensional surfaces, under some nondegeneracy conditions. The main
continuous invariants involved in this classification are the left equivalence
classes of period or monodromy functions, and the cohomology classes of period
cocycles, which can be expressed in terms of Puiseux series. We also study the
problem of Hamiltonianization of these integrable vector fields by a compatible
symplectic or Poisson structure.
