Border basis detection (BBD) is described as follows: given a set of
generators of an ideal, decide whether that set of generators is a border basis
of the ideal with respect to some order ideal. The motivation for this problem
comes from a similar problem related to Gr\"obner bases termed as Gr\"obner
basis detection (GBD) which was proposed by Gritzmann and Sturmfels (1993). GBD
was shown to be NP-hard by Sturmfels and Wiegelmann (1996). In this paper, we
investigate the computational complexity of BBD and show that it is
NP-complete.
