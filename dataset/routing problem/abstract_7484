In this note we construct a solution of a matrix interval linear equation of
the form X=AX+B (the discrete stationary Bellman equation) over partially
ordered semirings, including the semiring of nonnegative real numbers and all
idempotent semirings. We discuss also the computational complexity of problems
in interval idempotent linear algebra. In the traditional Interval Analysis
problems of this kind are generally NP-hard. In the note we consider matrix
equations over positive semirings; in this case the computational complexity of
the problem is polynomial.
  Idempotent and other positive semirings arise naturally in optimization
problems. Many of these problems turn out to be linear over appropriate
idempotent semirings. In this case, the system of equations X=AX+B appears to
be a natural analog of a usual linear system in the traditional linear algebra
over fields. B. A. Carre showed that many of the well-known algorithms of
discrete optimization are analogous to standard algorithms of the traditional
computational linear algebra.
