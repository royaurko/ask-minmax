In the SCHED problem we are given a set of n jobs, together with their
processing times and precedence constraints. The task is to order the jobs so
that their total completion time is minimized. SCHED is a special case of the
Traveling Repairman Problem with precedences. A natural dynamic programming
algorithm solves both these problems in 2^n n^O(1) time, and whether there
exists an algorithms solving SCHED in O(c^n) time for some constant c < 2 was
an open problem posted in 2004 by Woeginger. In this paper we answer this
question positively.
