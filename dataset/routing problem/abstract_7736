The pre-big bang's kinetic driven inflationary mechanism is not an adequate
form of inflation: the Planck length grows more rapidly than the scale factor.
In order to explain our large universe, the resulting post-big bang universe
requires the same unnatural constants (Planck problem) as those of any other
non-inflationary big bang model.
