In 5D SUSY GUTs, wave-function localization permits to reproduce flavour
hierarchy. As this mechanism also acts on SUSY breaking parameters, it can
potentially solve the SUSY flavour problem. We carry out an analysis of the
Holographic Grand Unification framework, where we take properly into account
effects of matrix anarchy. In this contribution, we focus on brane-localized
SUSY breaking and its consequences.
