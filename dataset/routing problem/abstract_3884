In this paper we obtain, for a semilinear elliptic problem in R^N, families
of solutions bifurcating from the bottom of the spectrum of $-\Delta$. The
problem is variational in nature and we apply a nonlinear reduction method
which allows us to search for solutions as critical points of suitable
functionals defined on finite-dimensional manifolds.
