Large-time behavior of solutions to the inflow problem of full compressible
Navier-Stokes equations is investigated on the half line $R^+ =(0,+\infty)$.
The wave structure which contains four waves: the transonic(or degenerate)
boundary layer solution, 1-rarefaction wave, viscous 2-contact wave and
3-rarefaction wave to the inflow problem is described and the asymptotic
stability of the superposition of the above four wave patterns to the inflow
problem of full compressible Navier-Stokes equations is proven under some
smallness conditions. The proof is given by the elementary energy analysis
based on the underlying wave structure. The main points in the proof are the
degeneracies of the transonic boundary layer solution and the wave interactions
in the superposition wave.
