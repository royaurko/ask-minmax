Delay tolerant Networks (DTNs) leverage the mobility of relay nodes to
compensate for lack of permanent connectivity and thus enable communication
between nodes that are out of range of each other. To decrease message delivery
delay, the information to be transmitted is replicated in the network. We study
replication mechanisms that include Reed-Solomon type codes as well as network
coding in order to improve the probability of successful delivery within a
given time limit. We propose an analytical approach that allows us to compute
the probability of successful delivery. We study the effect of coding on the
performance of the network while optimizing parameters that govern routing.
