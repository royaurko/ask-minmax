A description of all the admissible weights similar to the Muckenhoupt class
$A_p$ is an open problem for the weighted Morrey spaces. In this paper
necessary condition and sufficient condition for two-weight norm inequalities
on Morrey spaces to hold are given for the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator.
Necessary and sufficient condition is also verified for the power weights.
