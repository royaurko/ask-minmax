Local and global well-posedness results are established for the initial value
problem associated to the 1D Zakharov-Rubenchik system. We show that our
results are sharp in some situations by proving Ill-posedness results
otherwise. The global results allow us to study the norm growth of solutions
corresponding to the Schrodinger equation term. We use ideas recently
introduced to study the classical Zakharov systems.
