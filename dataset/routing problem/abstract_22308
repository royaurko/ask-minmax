We propose a bundle trust-region algorithm to minimize locally Lipschitz
functions which are potentially nonsmooth and nonconvex. We prove global
convergence of our method and show by way of an example that the classical
convergence argument in trust-region methods based on the Cauchy point fails in
the nonsmooth setting. Our method is tested experimentally on three problems in
automatic control.
