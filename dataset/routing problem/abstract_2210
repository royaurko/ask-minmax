We provide a thorough theoretical analysis of qubit state measurement in a
setup where a driven, parametrically-coupled cavity system is directly coupled
to the qubit, with one of the cavities having a weak Kerr nonlinearity. Such a
system could be readily realized using circuit QED architectures. We
demonstrate that this setup is capable in the standard linear-response regime
of both producing a highly amplified output signal while at the same time
achieving near quantum-limited performance: the measurement backaction on the
qubit is near the minimal amount required by the uncertainty principle. This
setup thus represents a promising route for performing efficient large-gain
qubit measurement that is completely on-chip, and that does not rely on the use
of circulators or complex non-reciprocal amplifiers.
