A set of regularly distributed transmission eigenvalues generates a density
function. We use such a density function inversely determines the form of the
indicator function. Using the entire function theory, we reduce an uniqueness
problem with interior transmission eigenvalues induced by time-harmonic Maxwell
equation to an uniqueness problem in entire function theory. In such an inverse
problem, the definite integral of the square root of refraction index is the
main parameter.
