In this paper we find the families of relative equilibria for the three body
problem in the plane, when the interaction between the bodies is given by a
quasi-homogeneous potential, which is the sum of two homogeneous functions. The
number of the relative equilibria depends of the values of the masses and of
the size of the system, measured by the moment of inertia.
