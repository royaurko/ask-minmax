We embed the S-MSSM -- a singlet extension of the minimal supersymmetric
standard model with an explicit mu-term and supersymmetric mass term -- in a
gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking scheme. We find that by absolving the
singlet of its responsibility for solving the mu-problem, we are instead able
to solve the little hierarchy problem naturally. Specifically, we find that
even with a minimal embedding of the S-MSSM into a gauge-mediated scheme, we
can easily raise the lightest Higgs mass above 114 GeV, while keeping top
squarks below the TeV scale, maintaining perturbative unification of the gauge
couplings, and without tuning the other parameters of the model.
