We consider a piezothermoelastic panel occupied by a material of hexagonal
crystal class. We study the response when the boundary conditions vary very
slowly with time and one of the bounding faces is subject to thermal exposure.
We show that in some cases the temperature on the other bounding face can be
controlled by the difference of electric potential between the faces.
