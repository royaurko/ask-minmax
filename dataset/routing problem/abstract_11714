An inverse problem is considered for an inhomogeneous Schr\"odinger equation.
Assuming that the potential vanishes outside a finite interval and satisfies
some other technical assumptions, one proves the uniqueness of the recovery of
this potential from the knowledge of the wave function at the ends of the above
interval for all energies. An algorithm is given for the recovery of the
potential from the above data.
