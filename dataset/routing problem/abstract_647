Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are collections of mobile nodes that can
communicate with one another using multihop wireless links. MANETs are often
deployed in the environments, where there is no fixed infrastructure and
centralized management. The nodes of mobile ad hoc networks are susceptible to
compromise. In such a scenario, designing an efficient, reliable and secure
routing protocol has been a major challengesue over the last many years. The
routing protocol Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) has no security
measures in-built in it. It is vulnerable to many types of routing attacks. The
flood attack is one of them. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective
technique to secure Ad hoc Ondemand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol
against flood attacks. To deal with a flood attack, we have proposed Neighbor
Defense Technique for Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (NDTAODV). This makes
AODV more robust. The proposed technique has been designed to isolate the flood
attacker with the use of timers, peak value and hello alarm technique. We have
simulated our work in Network Simulator NS-2.33 (NS-2) with different pause
times by way of different number of malicious nodes. We have compared the
performance of NDTAODV with the AODV in normal situation as well as in the
presence of malicious attacks. We have considered Packet Delivery Fraction
(PDF), Average Throughput (AT) and Normalized Routing Load (NRL) for comparing
the performance of NDTAODV and AODV.
