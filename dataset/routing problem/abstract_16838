We construct an explicit reversible symplectic integrator for the planar
3-body problem with zero angular momentum. We start with a Hamiltonian of the
planar 3-body problem that is globally regularised and fully symmetry reduced.
This Hamiltonian is a sum of 10 polynomials each of which can be integrated
exactly, and hence a symplectic integrator is constructed. The performance of
the integrator is examined with three numerical examples: The figure eight, the
pythagorean orbit, and a periodic collision orbit.
