In this note we show that a recent existence result on quasiequilibrium
problems, which seems to improve deeply some well-known results, is not
correct. We exhibit a counterexample and we furnish a generalization of a lemma
about continuous "-minimizers of quasiconvex functions depending on a
parameter. This allows to establish an existence result of approximate
solutions of quasiequilibrium problems.
