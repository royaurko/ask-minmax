In this paper we develop constructive invertibility conditions for the
twisted convolution. Our approach is based on splitting the twisted convolution
with rational parameters into a finite number of weighted convolutions, which
can be interpreted as another twisted convolution on a finite cyclic group. In
analogy with the twisted convolution of finite discrete signals, we derive an
anti-homomorphism between the sequence space and a suitable matrix algebra
which preserves the algebraic structure. In this way, the problem reduces to
the analysis of finite matrices whose entries are sequences supported on
corresponding cosets. The invertibility condition then follows from Cramer's
rule and Wiener's lemma for this special class of matrices. The problem results
from a well known approach of studying the invertibility properties of the
Gabor frame operator in the rational case. The presented approach gives further
insights into Gabor frames. In particular, it can be applied for both the
continuous (on $\Rd$) and the finite discrete setting. In the latter case, we
obtain algorithmic schemes for directly computing the inverse of Gabor
frame-type matrices equivalent to those known in the literature.
