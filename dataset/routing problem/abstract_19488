For several computational procedures such as finding radicals and Noether
normalizations, it is important to choose as sparse as possible a system of
parameters in a polynomial ideal or modulo a polynomial ideal. We describe new
strategies for these tasks, thus providing solutions to problems (1) and (2)
posed in [Eisenbud-Huneke-Vasconcelos 1992].
