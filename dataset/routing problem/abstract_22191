The problem of model discriminability and parameter identifiability for
dephasing two-level systems subject to Hamiltonian control is studied. Analytic
solutions of the Bloch equations are used to derive explicit expressions for
observables as functions of time for different models. This information is used
to give criteria for model discrimination and parameter estimation based on
simple experimental paradigms.
