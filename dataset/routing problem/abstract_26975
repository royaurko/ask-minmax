The coarsest bisimulation-finding problem plays an important role in the
formal analysis of concurrent systems. For example, solving this problem allows
the behavior of different processes to be compared or specifications to be
verified. Hence, in this paper an efficient concurrent bisimulation algorithm
is presented. It is based on the sequential Paige and Tarjan algorithm and the
concept of the state signatures. The original solution follows Hopcroft's
principle "process the smaller half". The presented algorithm uses its
generalized version "process all but the largest one" better suited for
concurrent and parallel applications. The running time achieved is comparable
with the best known sequential and concurrent solutions. At the end of the
work, the results of tests carried out are presented. The question of the lower
bound for the running time of the optimal algorithm is also discussed.
