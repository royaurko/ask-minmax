In this paper we deal with a strongly ill-posed second-order degenerate
parabolic problem in the unbounded open set $\Omega\times {\mathcal O}\subset
\mathbb R^{M+N}$, related to a linear equation with unbounded coefficients,
with no initial condition, but endowed with the usual Dirichlet condition on
$(0,T)\times \partial(\Omega\times {\mathcal O})$ and an additional condition
involving the $x$-normal derivative on $\Gamma\times {\mathcal O}$, $\Gamma$
being an open subset of $\Omega$.
  The task of this paper is twofold: determining sufficient conditions on our
data implying the uniqueness of the solution $u$ to the boundary value problem
as well as determining a pair of metrics with respect of which $u$ depends
continuously on the data.
  The results obtained for the parabolic problem are then applied to a similar
problem for a convolution integrodifferential linear parabolic equation.
