We review the stability properties of several discretizations of the
Helmholtz equation at large wavenumbers. For a model problem in a polygon, a
complete $k$-explicit stability (including $k$-explicit stability of the
continuous problem) and convergence theory for high order finite element
methods is developed. In particular, quasi-optimality is shown for a fixed
number of degrees of freedom per wavelength if the mesh size $h$ and the
approximation order $p$ are selected such that $kh/p$ is sufficiently small and
$p = O(\log k)$, and, additionally, appropriate mesh refinement is used near
the vertices. We also review the stability properties of two classes of
numerical schemes that use piecewise solutions of the homogeneous Helmholtz
equation, namely, Least Squares methods and Discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
methods. The latter includes the Ultra Weak Variational Formulation.
