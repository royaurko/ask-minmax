The unique existence of a weak solution to the homogeneous closed Dirichlet
problem on certain D-star-shaped domains is proven for a mixed
elliptic-hyperbolic equation. Equations of this kind arise in models for
electromagnetic wave propagation in cold plasma. A related class of open
boundary value problems is shown to possess strong solutions.
