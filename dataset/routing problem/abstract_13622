We consider the obstacle problem for the infinity Laplace equation. Given a
Lipschitz boundary function and a Lipschitz obstacle we prove the existence and
uniqueness of a super infinity-harmonic function constrained to lie above the
obstacle which is infinity harmonic where it lies strictly above the obstacle.
Moreover, we show that this function is the limit of value functions of a game
we call obstacle tug-of-war.
