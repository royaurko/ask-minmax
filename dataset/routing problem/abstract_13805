Combining probabilistic and analytic tools from potential theory, we
investigate Dirichlet problems associated with the Dunkl Laplacian $\Delta_k$.
We establish, under some conditions on the open set $D\subset\R^d$, the
existence of a unique continuous function $h$ in the closure of $D$, twice
differentiable in $D$, such that $$ \Delta_kh=0
\quad\textrm{in}\;D\quad\textrm{and}\quad h=f\quad\textrm{on}\; \partial D. $$
We also give a probabilistic formula characterizing the solution $h$. The
function $f$ is assumed to be continuous on the Euclidean boundary $\partial D$
of $D$.
