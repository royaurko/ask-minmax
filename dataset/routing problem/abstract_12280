A finite element method is presented to compute time harmonic microwave
fields in three dimensional configurations. Nodal-based finite elements have
been coupled with an absorbing boundary condition to solve open boundary
problems. This paper describes how the modeling of large devices has been made
possible using parallel computation, New algorithms are then proposed to
implement this formulation on a cluster of workstations (10 DEC ALPHA 300X) and
on a CRAY C98. Analysis of the computation efficiency is performed using simple
problems. The electromagnetic scattering of a plane wave by a perfect electric
conducting airplane is finally given as example.
