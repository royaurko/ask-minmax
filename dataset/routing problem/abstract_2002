The control of epidemic spreading is essential to avoid potential fatal
consequences and also, to lessen unforeseen socio-economic impact. The need for
effective control is exemplified during the severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) in 2003, which has inflicted near to a thousand deaths as well as
bankruptcies of airlines and related businesses. In this article, we examine
the efficacy of control strategies on the propagation of infectious diseases
based on removing connections within real world airline network with the
associated economic and social costs taken into account through defining
appropriate quantitative measures. We uncover the surprising results that
removing less busy connections can be far more effective in hindering the
spread of the disease than removing the more popular connections. Since
disconnecting the less popular routes tend to incur less socio-economic cost,
our finding suggests the possibility of trading minimal reduction in
connectivity of an important hub with efficiencies in epidemic control. In
particular, we demonstrate the performance of various local epidemic control
strategies, and show how our approach can predict their cost effectiveness
through the spreading control characteristics.
