We study approximation algorithms for several variants of the MaxCover
problem, with the focus on algorithms that run in FPT time. In the MaxCover
problem we are given a set N of elements, a family S of subsets of N, and an
integer K. The goal is to find up to K sets from S that jointly cover (i.e.,
include) as many elements as possible. This problem is well-known to be NP-hard
and, under standard complexity-theoretic assumptions, the best possible
polynomial-time approximation algorithm has approximation ratio (1 - 1/e). We
first consider a variant of MaxCover with bounded element frequencies, i.e., a
variant where there is a constant p such that each element belongs to at most p
sets in S. For this case we show that there is an FPT approximation scheme
(i.e., for each B there is a B-approximation algorithm running in FPT time) for
the problem of maximizing the number of covered elements, and a randomized FPT
approximation scheme for the problem of minimizing the number of elements left
uncovered (we take K to be the parameter). Then, for the case where there is a
constant p such that each element belongs to at least p sets from S, we show
that the standard greedy approximation algorithm achieves approximation ratio
exactly (1-e^{-max(pK/|S|, 1)}). We conclude by considering an unrestricted
variant of MaxCover, and show approximation algorithms that run in exponential
time and combine an exact algorithm with a greedy approximation. Some of our
results improve currently known results for MaxVertexCover.
