A Lie-Rinehart algebra consists of a commutative algebra and a Lie algebra
with additional structure which generalizes the mutual structure of interaction
between the algebra of functions and the Lie algebra of smooth vector fields on
a smooth manifold. Lie-Rinehart algebras provide the correct categorical
language to solve the problem whether Kaehler quantization commutes with
reduction which, in turn, may be seen as a descent problem.
