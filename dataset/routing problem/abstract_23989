We present the failure of the standard coupled-channels method in explaining
the inelastic scattering together with other observables such as elastic
scattering, excitation function and fusion data. We use both microscopic
double-folding and phenomenological deep potentials with shallow imaginary
components. We argue that the solution of the problems for the inelastic
scattering data is not related to the central nuclear potential, but to the
coupling potential between excited states. We present that these problems can
be addressed in a systematic way by using a different shape for the coupling
potential instead of the usual one based on Taylor expansion.
