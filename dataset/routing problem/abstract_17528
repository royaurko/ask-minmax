Object Oriented Design methodology is an emerging software development
approach for complex systems with huge set of requirements. Unlike procedural
approach, it captures the requirements as a set of data rather than services,
encapsulated as a single entity. The success such a project relies on major
factors like design patterns framework, key principles, metric standards and
best practices adapted by the industry. The patterns are key structures for
recursive problem bits in the problem domain. The combination of design
patterns forms a framework which suits the problem statement in hand. The
pattern includes static design and dynamic behavior of different types of
entities which can be mapped as a functional diagram with cardinalities between
them. The degree of cardinality represents the coupling factor which the
industry perceives and measures for software design quality. The organization
specific design principles and rich repository of on-the-shelf patterns are the
major design-quality-influencing-factor contribute to software success. These
are the asset of an industry to deliver a quality product to sustain itself in
the competitive market.
