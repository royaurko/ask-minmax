An edge-colored graph $G$ is {\em rainbow connected} if any two vertices are
connected by a path whose edges have distinct colors. The {\em rainbow
connection} of a connected graph $G$, denoted $rc(G)$, is the smallest number
of colors that are needed in order to make $G$ rainbow connected. In the first
result of this paper we prove that computing $rc(G)$ is NP-Hard solving an open
problem from \cite{Ca-Yu}. In fact, we prove that it is already NP-Complete to
decide if $rc(G)=2$, and also that it is NP-Complete to decide whether a given
edge-colored (with an unbounded number of colors) graph is rainbow connected.
On the positive side, we prove that for every $\epsilon >0$, a connected graph
with minimum degree at least $\epsilon n$ has {\em bounded} rainbow connection,
where the bound depends only on $\epsilon$, and a corresponding coloring can be
constructed in polynomial time. Additional non-trivial upper bounds, as well as
open problems and conjectures are also presented.
