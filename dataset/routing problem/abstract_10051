After intensive research, heterogenous face recognition is still a
challenging problem. The main difficulties are owing to the complex
relationship between heterogenous face image spaces. The heterogeneity is
always tightly coupled with other variations, which makes the relationship of
heterogenous face images highly nonlinear. Many excellent methods have been
proposed to model the nonlinear relationship, but they apt to overfit to the
training set, due to limited samples. Inspired by the unsupervised algorithms
in deep learning, this paper proposes an novel framework for heterogeneous face
recognition. We first extract Gabor features at some localized facial points,
and then use Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) to learn a shared
representation locally to remove the heterogeneity around each facial point.
Finally, the shared representations of local RBMs are connected together and
processed by PCA. Two problems (Sketch-Photo and NIR-VIS) and three databases
are selected to evaluate the proposed method. For Sketch-Photo problem, we
obtain perfect results on the CUFS database. For NIR-VIS problem, we produce
new state-of-the-art performance on the CASIA HFB and NIR-VIS 2.0 databases.
