An infinite number of conserved quantities in the field dynamics $\phi_t = L
U(\phi) + \rho$ for a linear Hermitian (or anti-Hermitian) operator $L$, an
arbitrary function $U$ and a given source $\rho$ are presented. These integrals
of motion are the multipole moments of the potential created by $\phi$ in the
far-field. In the singular limit of a bistable scalar field $\phi = \phi_{\pm}$
(i.e. Ising limit) this theory describes a dissipative boundary motion (such as
Stefan or Saffman-Taylor problem that is the continuous limit of the
DLA-fractal growth) and can be exactly integrable. These conserved quantities
are the polynomial conservation laws attributed to the integrability. The
criterion for integrability is the uniqueness of the inverse potential
problem's solution.
