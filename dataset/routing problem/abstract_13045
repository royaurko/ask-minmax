We study interior regularity of solutions of a generalized stationary Stokes
problem in the plane. The main, elliptic part of the problem is given in the
form div(A(Du)), where D is the symmetric part of the gradient. The model case
is A(Du)=(kappa+|Du|)^{p-2}Du. We show optimal BMO and Campanato estimates for
A(Du). Some corollaries for the generalized stationary Navier-Stokes system and
for its evolutionary variant are also mentioned.
