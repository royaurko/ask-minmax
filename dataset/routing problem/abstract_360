In order to make full use of geographic routing techniques developed for
large scale networks, nodes must be localized. However, localization and
virtual localization techniques in sensor networks are dependent either on
expensive and sometimes unavailable hardware (e.g. GPS) or on sophisticated
localization calculus (e.g. triangulation) which are both error-prone and with
a costly overhead.
  Instead of localizing nodes in a traditional 2-dimensional space, we intend
to use directly the raw distance to a set of anchors to route messages in the
multi-dimensional space. This should enable us to use any geographic routing
protocol in a robust and efficient manner in a very large range of scenarios.
