Two approximations, derived from continuous expansions of Riemann-Liouville
fractional derivatives into series involving integer order derivatives, are
studied. Using those series, one can formally transform any problem that
contains fractional derivatives into a classical problem in which only
derivatives of integer order are present. Corresponding approximations provide
useful numerical tools to compute fractional derivatives of functions.
Application of such approximations to fractional differential equations and
fractional problems of the calculus of variations are discussed. Illustrative
examples show the advantages and disadvantages of each approximation.
