A method is suggested for the computation of the generalized dimensions of
fractal attractors at the period-doubling transition to chaos. The approach is
based on an eigenvalue problem formulated in terms of functional equations,
with a coefficient expressed in terms of Feigenbaum's universal fixed-point
function. The accuracy of the results is determined only by precision of the
representation of the universal function.
