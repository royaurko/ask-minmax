The present paper addresses the problem of attainment of the supremums in
various equivalent definitions of hereditary density hd and hereditary Lindelof
degree hL of Boolean algebras. We partially answer two problems of J. Donald
Monk (Problems 50 and 54 in his book "Cardinal Invariants on Boolean Algebras),
showing consistency of different attainment behaviour and proving that (for the
considered variants) this is the best result we can expect.
