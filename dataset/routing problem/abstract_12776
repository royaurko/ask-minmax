For the linear partial differential equation
$P(\partial_x,\partial_t)u=f(x,t)$, where
$x\in\mathbb{R}^n,\;t\in\mathbb{R}^1$, with $P(\partial_x,\partial_t)$ is
$\prod^m_{i=1}(\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}-a_iP(\partial_x))$ or
$\prod^m_{i=1}(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial{t^2}}-a_i^2P(\partial_x))$, the
contributors give the analytic solution of the cauchy problem using the abstract
operators $e^{tP(\partial_x)}$ and
$\frac{\sinh(tP(\partial_x)^{1/2})}{P(\partial_x)^{1/2}}$. By representing the
operators with integrals, explicit solutions are obtained with an integral form
of a given function.
