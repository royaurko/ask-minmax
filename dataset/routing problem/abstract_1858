Using many-body perturbation theory within the $G_0W_0$ approximation, we
explore routes for computing the ionization potential (IP), electron affinity
(EA), and fundamental gap of three gas-phase molecules -- benzene, thiophene,
and (1,4) diamino-benzene -- and compare with experiments. We examine the
dependence of the IP on the number of unoccupied states used to build the
dielectric function and the self energy, as well as the dielectric function
plane-wave cutoff. We find that with an effective completion strategy for
approximating the unoccupied subspace, and a converged dielectric function
kinetic energy cutoff, the computed IPs and EAs are in excellent quantitative
agreement with available experiment (within 0.2 eV), indicating that a one-shot
$G_0W_0$ approach can be very accurate for calculating addition/removal
energies of small organic molecules. Our results indicate that a sufficient
dielectric function kinetic energy cutoff may be the limiting step for a wide
application of $G_0W_0$ to larger organic systems.
