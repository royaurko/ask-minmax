The area of Handwritten Signature Verification has been broadly researched in
the last decades and still remains as an open research problem. This report
focuses on offline signature verification, characterized by the usage of static
(scanned) images of signatures, where the objective is to discriminate if a
given signature is genuine (produced by the claimed individual), or a forgery
(produced by an impostor). We present an overview of how the problem has been
handled by several researchers in the past few decades and the recent
advancements in the field.
