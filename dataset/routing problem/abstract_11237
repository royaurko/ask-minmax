We consider a Wilson-Dirac operator with improved chiral properties. We show
that, for arbitrarily rough gauge fields, it satisfies the index theorem if we
identify the zero modes with the small real eigenvalues of the fermion operator
and use the geometrical definition of topological charge. This is also
confirmed in a numerical study of the quenched Schwinger model. These results
suggest that integer definitions of the topological charge based on counting
real modes of the Wilson operator are equivalent to the geometrical definition.
The problem of exceptional configurations and the sign problem in simulations
with an odd number of dynamical Wilson fermions are briefly discussed.
