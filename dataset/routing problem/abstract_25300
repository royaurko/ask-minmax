We present a discussion of two-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD)
configurations, concerning the equilibria of accretion disks of a strongly
magnetized astrophysical object. We set up a viscoresistive scenario which
generalizes previous two-dimensional analyses by reconciling the ideal MHD
coupling of the vertical and the radial equilibria within the disk with the
standard mechanism of the angular momentum transport, relying on dissipative
properties of the plasma configuration. The linear features of the considered
model are analytically developed and the non-linear configuration problem is
addressed, by fixing the entire disk profile at the same order of
approximation. Indeed, the azimuthal and electron force balance equations are
no longer automatically satisfied when poloidal currents and matter fluxes are
included in the problem. These additional components of the equilibrium
configuration induce a different morphology of the magnetic flux surface, with
respect to the ideal and simply rotating disk.
