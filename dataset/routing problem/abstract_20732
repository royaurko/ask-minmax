We study parameter estimation problem for diagonalizable stochastic partial
differential equations driven by a multiplicative fractional noise with any
Hurst parameter $H\in(0,1)$. Two classes of estimators are investigated:
traditional maximum likelihood type estimators, and a new class called
closed-form exact estimators. Finally the general results are applied to
stochastic heat equation driven by a fractional Brownian motion.
