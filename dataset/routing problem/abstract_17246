We address the issue of incorporating a particular yet expressive form of
integrity constraints (namely, denial constraints) into probabilistic
databases. To this aim, we move away from the common way of giving semantics to
probabilistic databases, which relies on considering a unique interpretation of
the data, and address two fundamental problems: consistency checking and query
evaluation. The former consists in verifying whether there is an interpretation
which conforms to both the marginal probabilities of the tuples and the
integrity constraints. The latter is the problem of answering queries under a
"cautious" paradigm, taking into account all interpretations of the data in
accordance with the constraints. In this setting, we investigate the complexity
of the above-mentioned problems, and identify several tractable cases of
practical relevance.
