Ba7Ir3O13+{\delta} in thin film form is discovered. These films are
characterized by colossal permittivity (CP) ~104 at room temperature,
attributable to the colossal internal barrier layer capacitance effect at
atomically thin domain boundaries. These findings suggest a new route to
seeking novel CP materials through designing atomically thin domain boundaries.
