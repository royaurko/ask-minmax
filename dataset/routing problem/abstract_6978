In this paper the boundary value problem for one class of the
operator-differential equations of the third order on a semi-axis, where one of
the boundary conditions is perturbed by some linear operator is researched.
There are received sufficient conditions on the operator coefficients of the
considered boundary value problem, providing its correct and univalent
resolvability in Sobolev type space.
