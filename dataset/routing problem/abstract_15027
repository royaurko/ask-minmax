We address the problem of estimating a rigid transformation between two point
sets, which is a key module for target tracking system using Light Detection
And Ranging (LiDAR). A fast implementation of Expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm is presented whose complexity is O(N) with $N$ the number of scan
points.
