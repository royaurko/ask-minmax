Problem of cosmological singularity of general relativity theory is
discussed. The possible resolution of this problem in the framework of
inflationary cosmology is proposed. Physical conditions leading to bouncing
inflationary solutions in the frame of general relativity theory and gauge
theories of gravitation are compared. It is shown that gauge theories of
gravitation allow to build regular inflationary cosmological models of closed,
open and flat type with dominating ultrarelativistic matter at a bounce.
