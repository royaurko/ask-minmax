We examine a class of gauge theories obtained by projecting out certain
fields from an N=4 supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory. These theories are
non-supersymmetric and in the large N limit are known to be conformal. Recently
it was proposed that the hierarchy problem could be solved by embedding the
standard model in a theory of this kind with finite N. In order to check this
claim one must find the conformal points of the theory. To do this we calculate
the one-loop beta functions for the Yukawa and quartic scalar couplings. We
find that with the beta functions set to zero the one-loop quadratic
divergences are not canceled at sub-leading order in N; thus the hierarchy
between the weak scale and the Planck scale is not stabilized unless N is of
the order 10^28 or larger. We also find that at sub-leading orders in N
renormalization induces new interactions, which were not present in the
original Lagrangian.
