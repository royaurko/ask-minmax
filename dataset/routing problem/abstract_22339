We consider the problem of the strong unique continuation for an elasticity
system with general residual stress. Due to the known counterexamples, we
assume the coefficients of the elasticity system are in the Gevrey class of
appropriate indices. The main tools are Carleman estimates for product of two
second order elliptic operators.
