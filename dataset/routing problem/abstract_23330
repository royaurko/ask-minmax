We construct models in which electroweak symmetry is spontaneously broken by
supersymmetric strong dynamics at the TeV scale. The order parameter is a
composite of scalars, and the longitudinal components of the W and Z are
strongly-coupled bound states of scalars. The usual phenomenological problems
of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking are absent: the sign of the S
parameter unconstrained in strongly interacting SUSY theories, and fermion
masses are generated without flavor-changing neutral currents or large
corrections to the rho parameter. The lightest neutral Higgs scalar can be
heavier than M_Z without radiative corrections from standard-model fields. All
the mass scales in the model can be naturally related in low-scale models of
supersymmetry breaking. The mu problem can also be solved naturally, and the
model can incorporate perturbative unification of standard-model gauge
couplings with intermediate thresholds.
