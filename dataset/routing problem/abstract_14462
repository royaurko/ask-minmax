We present a complete, certificate-based decision procedure for first-order
univariate polynomial problems in Isabelle. It is built around an executable
function to decide the sign of a univariate polynomial at a real algebraic
point. The procedure relies on no trusted code except for Isabelle's kernel and
code generation. This work is the first step towards integrating the MetiTarski
theorem prover into Isabelle.
