We describe a large-scale computational experiment to study structure in the
numbers of real solutions to osculating instances of Schubert problems. This
investigation uncovered Schubert problems whose computed numbers of real
solutions variously exhibit nontrivial upper bounds, lower bounds, gaps, and a
congruence modulo four. We present a family of Schubert problems, one in each
Grassmannian, and prove their osculating instances have the observed lower
bounds and gaps.
