Temporal information has been the focus of recent attention in information
extraction, leading to some standardization effort, in particular for the task
of relating events in a text. This task raises the problem of comparing two
annotations of a given text, because relations between events in a story are
intrinsically interdependent and cannot be evaluated separately. A proper
evaluation measure is also crucial in the context of a machine learning
approach to the problem. Finding a common comparison referent at the text level
is not obvious, and we argue here in favor of a shift from event-based measures
to measures on a unique textual object, a minimal underlying temporal graph, or
more formally the transitive reduction of the graph of relations between event
boundaries. We support it by an investigation of its properties on synthetic
data and on a well-know temporal corpus.
