This volume contains the proceedings of HCVS 2014, the First Workshop on Horn
Clauses for Verification and Synthesis which was held on July 17, 2014 in
Vienna, Austria as a satellite event of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC)
and part of the Vienna Summer of Logic (VSL 2014).
  HCVS 2014 was affiliated to the 26th International Conference on Computer
Aided Verification (CAV 2014) and to the 30th International Conference on Logic
Programming (ICLP 2014).
  Most Program Verification and Synthesis problems of interest can be modeled
directly using Horn clauses and many recent advances in the Constraint/Logic
Programming and Program Verification communities have centered around
efficiently solving problems presented as Horn clauses.
  Since Horn clauses for verification and synthesis have been advocated by
these communities in different times and from different perspectives, the HCVS
workshop was organized to stimulate interaction and a fruitful exchange and
integration of experiences.
