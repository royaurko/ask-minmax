In a recent important breakthrough D. Christodoulou has solved a long
standing problem of General Relativity of evolutionary formation of trapped
surfaces in the Einstein-vacuum space-times. He has identified an open set of
regular initial conditions on an outgoing null hypersurface (both finite and at
past null infinity) leading to a formation a trapped surface in the
corresponding vacuum space-time to the future of the initial outgoing
hypersurface and another incoming null hypersurface with the prescribed
Minkowskian data.
  In this paper we give a simpler proof for a finite problem by enlarging the
admissible set of initial conditions and, consistent with this, relaxing the
corresponding propagation estimates just enough that a trapped surface still
forms. We also reduce the number of derivatives needed in the argument from two
derivatives of the curvature to just one. More importantly, the proof, which
can be easily localized with respect to angular sectors, has the potential for
further developments.
