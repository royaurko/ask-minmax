We give a generalization of the method of "Elliptic Curve Chabauty" to higher
genus curves and their Jacobians. This method can sometimes be used in
conjunction with covering techniques and a modified version of the Mordell-Weil
sieve to provide a complete solution to the problem of determining the set of
rational points of an algebraic curve $Y$.
