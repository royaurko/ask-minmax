In this work we investigate the problem of secretly broadcasting five qubit
entangled state between three different partners We implement the protocol
described in ref [16] on three particle W-state shared by three distant
partners Alice,Bob and Charlie. The problem is interesting in the sense it is
the first attempt to broadcast five qubit entangled state between three
parties.
