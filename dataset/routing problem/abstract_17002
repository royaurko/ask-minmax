We point out that SO(2N_{c}) gauge theory with N_{f} fundamental Dirac
fermions does not have a sign problem at finite baryon number chemical
potential \mu_{B}. One can thus use lattice Monte Carlo simulations to study
this theory at finite density. The absence of a sign problem in the SO(2N_{c})
theory is particularly interesting because a wide class of observables in the
SO(2N_{c}) theory coincide with observables in QCD in the large N_{c} limit, as
we show using the technique of large N_{c} orbifold equivalence. We argue that
the orbifold equivalence between the two theories continues to hold at \mu_{B}
\neq 0 provided one adds appropriate deformation terms to the SO(2N_{c})
theory. This opens up the prospect of learning about QCD at \mu_{B} \neq 0
using lattice studies of the SO(2N_{c}) theory.
