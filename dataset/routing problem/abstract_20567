This article is written with the hope to draw attention to a method that uses
integral transforms to find exact values for a large class of convergent series
(and, in particular, series of rational terms). We apply the method to some
series that generalize a problem published in `The College Mathematics
Journal'. Some of the results thus obtained have not been founded in standard
references.
