Light vector-like quarks with non-renormalizable couplings to the Higgs are a
common feature of models trying to address the electroweak (EW) hierarchy
problem by treating the Higgs as a pseudo-goldstone boson of a global
(approximate) symmetry. We systematically investigate the implications of the
leading dimension five operators on Higgs phenomenology in presence of
dynamical up- and down-type weak singlet as well as weak doublet vector-like
quarks. After taking into account constraints from precision EW and flavour
observables we show that contrary to the renormalizable models, significant
modifications of Higgs properties are still possible and could shed light on
the role of vector-like quarks in solutions to the EW hierarchy problem. We
also briefly discuss implications of higher dimensional operators for direct
vector-like quark searches at the LHC.
