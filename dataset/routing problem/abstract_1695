The effect of atomic substitution of Te in iron based superconductors FeSe
(1:1 type), which exhibits the simplest crystal structure among the iron-based
superconductors, has been investigated in terms of structural, electronic
transport and magnetic properties. Polycrystalline samples with nominal Se:Te
in FeSe1-xTex samples for x=0.5350{\deg}C, 0.5700{\deg}C, 0.6700{\deg}C and
0.75700{\deg}C were synthesized by the solid-state reaction method. It has been
observed that the most superconducting properties seen in x=0.6700{\deg}C
samples as dc magnetic susceptibility, ac susceptibility and resistivity
measurements. Tc enhancement is well correlated with the Te substitution up to
75% and c lattice parameters monotonically increased with increasing Te
concentration.
