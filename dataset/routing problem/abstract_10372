The problem of sending a secret message over the Gaussian multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap channel is studied. While the capacity of this
channel is known, it is not clear how to construct optimal coding schemes that
achieve this capacity. In this work we show how to use linear operations along
with successive interference cancellation in order to reduce the problem to
that of designing optimal codes for the single-antenna additive-noise Gaussian
wiretap channel. Much like popular communication techniques in the absence of
an eavesdropper, the data is carried over parallel streams. The derivation of
the schemes is based upon joint triangularization of channel matrices. We find
that the same techniques can be used to re-derive capacity expressions for the
MIMO wiretap channel in a way that is simple and closely connected to a
transmission scheme. This technique allows to extend the previously proven
strong security for scalar Gaussian channels to the MIMO case. We further
consider the problem of transmitting confidential messages over a two-user
broadcast MIMO channel. For that problem, we find that derivation of both the
capacity and a transmission scheme is a direct corollary of the analysis we
applied to the MIMO wiretap channel.
