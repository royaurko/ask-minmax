A novel method of summing asymptotic series is advanced. Such series
repeatedly arise when employing perturbation theory in powers of a small
parameter for complicated problems of condensed matter physics, statistical
physics, and various applied problems. The method is based on the self-similar
approximation theory involving self-similar root approximants. The constructed
self-similar continued roots extrapolate asymptotic series to finite values of
the expansion parameter. The self-similar continued roots contain, as a
particular case, continued fractions and Pad\'{e} approximants. A theorem on
the convergence of the self-similar continued roots is proved. The method is
illustrated by several examples from condensed-matter physics.
