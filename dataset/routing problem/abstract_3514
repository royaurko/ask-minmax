We propose a relativistic one-parameter Hermitian theory for the Coulomb
problem with an electric charge greater than 137. In the non-relativistic
limit, the theory becomes identical to the Schr\"odinger-Coulomb problem for
all Z. Moreover, it agrees with the Dirac-Coulomb problem to order (\alph Z)^2,
where \alpha is the fine structure constant. The vacuum in the theory is stable
and does not suffer from the "charged vacuum" problem for all Z. Moreover,
transition between positive and negative energy states could be eliminated. The
relativistic bound states energy spectrum and corresponding spinor
wavefunctions are obtained.
