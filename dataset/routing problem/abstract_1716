By means of first-principles density functional theory calculations, we find
that hydrogen-passivated ultrathin silicon nanowires (SiNWs) along [100]
direction with symmetrical multiple surface dangling bonds (SDBs) and boron
doping can have a half-metallic ground state with 100% spin polarization, where
the half-metallicity is shown quite robust against external electric fields.
Under the circumstances with various SDBs, the H-passivated SiNWs can also be
ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic semiconductors. The present study not only
offers a possible route to engineer half-metallic SiNWs without containing
magnetic atoms but also sheds light on manipulating spin-dependent properties
of nanowires through surface passivation.
