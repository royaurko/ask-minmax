Samples of Y0.4Pr0.6Ba2-xSrxCu3O7 have been synthesized by a solid- state
reaction route. The samples with x = 0.60 crystallize in an orthorhombic
structure (with orthorhombic distortion decreasing with increasing x), while
the samples with x=0.80 and 1.0 crystallize in a pseudo tetragonal structure.
Resistance (R) measurements as a function of temperature (T) show that x = 0.0
sample is highly semiconducting with R2K/R300K ratio of ~ 65. This ratio
decreases to only ~23 and 5 for x=0.20 and x=0.4 samples, respectively.
Further, the x=0.60 sample shows onset of a broad superconducting transition
temperature (Tconset) at around 20 K without achieving the TcR=0 state down to
2 K. The TcR=0 state is observed in x = 0.80 and 1.00 samples at around 5 and
14 K, respectively. Thermo-electric power (S), also exhibits TcS~0 state at
around 11 K and 16 K, respectively for x = 0.8 and 1.00 samples. Thermo
electric power at room temperature is positive and decreases with increasing x,
indicating enhanced number of mobile holes. These results demonstrate that
substitution of Sr at Ba-site systematically induces metallicity and eventually
superconductivity in Y0.4Pr0.6Ba2-xSrxCu3O7 system. The results are explained
on the basis of reduced Pr(4f) orbital hybridization with O(2p) in supercondu
cting Cu-O2 planes, resulting in delocalization of the mobile carriers. The
role of decreased Pr/Ba intermixing disorder is also considered.
