We present the results obtained in the three-flavour ($N_f=3$)
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model which is extended by the $U(1)_A$ breaking six-quark
't Hooft interaction and eight-quark interactions. We address the problem of
stability, and some phenomenological consequences of the models with
multi-quark interactions.
