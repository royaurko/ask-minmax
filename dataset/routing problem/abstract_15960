Previously, the near-threhold $pp\to pp\pi^0$ reaction was studied with the
use of transition operators derived from chiral perturbation theory ($\chi$PT)
and the nuclear wave functions generated by high-precision phenomenological
potentials. A conceptual problem in that approach was that the transition
amplitude receives contributions from very high momentum components (above the
cutoff scale of $\chi$PT) in the nuclear wave functions. In the present work,
we avoid this problem by replacing the "bare" phenomenological potentials with
V_{low-k}, which is an effective potential derived from a bare potential by
integrating out momentum components higher than a specified cutoff scale. The
use of V_{low-k} is found to give an enhancement of the $pp\to pp\pi^0$ cross
sections over the values obtained with bare potentials. Although this
enhancement brings the calculated cross sections closer to the experimental
values, the incident-energy dependence of the cross section is not well
reproduced, a problem that seems to indicate the necessity of including higher
chiral order terms than considered in the present work.
