We consider a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference channel
(IC), where a single data stream per user is transmitted and each receiver
treats interference as noise. The paper focuses on the open problem of
computing the outermost boundary (so-called Pareto boundary-PB) of the
achievable rate region under linear transceiver design. The Pareto boundary
consists of the strict PB and non-strict PB. For the two user case, we compute
the non-strict PB and the two ending points of the strict PB exactly. For the
strict PB, we formulate the problem to maximize one rate while the other rate
is fixed such that a strict PB point is reached. To solve this non-convex
optimization problem which results from the hard-coupled two transmit
beamformers, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm. Furthermore, we
extend the algorithm to the multi-user scenario and show convergence. Numerical
simulations illustrate that the proposed algorithm computes a sequence of
well-distributed operating points that serve as a reasonable and complete inner
bound of the strict PB compared with existing methods.
