We consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a Gaussian or binary
distribution in such a way that the resulting undirected graphical model is
sparse. Our approach is to solve a maximum likelihood problem with an added
l_1-norm penalty term. The problem as formulated is convex but the memory
requirements and complexity of existing interior point methods are prohibitive
for problems with more than tens of nodes. We present two new algorithms for
solving problems with at least a thousand nodes in the Gaussian case. Our first
algorithm uses block coordinate descent, and can be interpreted as recursive
l_1-norm penalized regression. Our second algorithm, based on Nesterov's first
order method, yields a complexity estimate with a better dependence on problem
size than existing interior point methods. Using a log determinant relaxation
of the log partition function (Wainwright & Jordan (2006)), we show that these
same algorithms can be used to solve an approximate sparse maximum likelihood
problem for the binary case. We test our algorithms on synthetic data, as well
as on gene expression and senate voting records data.
