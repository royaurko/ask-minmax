In this article we study the problem of recovering the unknown solution of a
linear ill-posed problem, via iterative regularization methods. We review the
problem of projection-regularization from a statistical point of view. A basic
purpose of the paper is the consideration of adaptive model selection for
determining regularization parameters. This article introduces a new
regularized estimator which has the best possible adaptive properties for a
wide range of linear functionals. We derive non asymptotic upper bounds for the
mean square error of the estimator and give the optimal convergence rates.
