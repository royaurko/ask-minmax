We discuss the problems of consensus and unity in science. The natural
sciences seem to contrast with many other areas of endeavor in that a high
level of consensus seems to exist in them. However, a careful analysis of the
structure of particular physical theories,such as those concerned with
electrons, shows that there is great heterogeneity of both theory and
methodology. We argue that the natural science community tends to be tolerant
of diversity. We contrast this tolerance among natural scientists with the more
overt disagreement occurring in the social sciences and humanities. Our central
theme is that many intellectual problems arise from straining too hard to make
a successful perspective into a total worldview.
