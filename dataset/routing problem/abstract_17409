We develop a novel method for detection of signals and reconstruction of
images in the presence of random noise. The method uses results from
percolation theory. We specifically address the problem of detection of
multiple objects of unknown shapes in the case of nonparametric noise. The
noise density is unknown and can be heavy-tailed. The objects of interest have
unknown varying intensities. No boundary shape constraints are imposed on the
objects, only a set of weak bulk conditions is required. We view the object
detection problem as a multiple hypothesis testing for discrete statistical
inverse problems. We present an algorithm that allows to detect greyscale
objects of various shapes in noisy images. We prove results on consistency and
algorithmic complexity of our procedures. Applications to cryo-electron
microscopy are presented.
