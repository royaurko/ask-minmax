A sequential problem in decentralized detection is considered. Two observers
can make repeated noisy observations of a binary hypothesis on the state of the
environment. At any time, observer 1 can stop and send a final binary message
to observer 2 or it may continue to take more measurements. Every time observer
1 postpones its final message to observer 2, it incurs a penalty. Observer 2's
operation under two different scenarios is explored. In the first scenario,
observer 2 waits to receive the final message from observer 1 and then starts
taking measurements of its own. It is then faced with a stopping problem on
whether to stop and declare a decision on the hypothesis or to continue taking
measurements. In the second scenario, observer 2 starts taking measurements
from the beginning. It is then faced with a different stopping problem. At any
time, observer 2 can decide whether to stop and declare a decision on the
hypothesis or to continue to take more measurements and wait for observer 1 to
send its final message. Parametric characterization of optimal policies for the
two observers are obtained under both scenarios. A sequential methodology for
finding the optimal policies is presented. The parametric characterizations are
then extended to problem with increased communication alphabet for the final
message from observer 1 to observer 2; and to the case of multiple peripheral
sensors that each send a single final message to a coordinating sensor who
makes the final decision on the hypothesis.
