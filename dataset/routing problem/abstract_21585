Formulas are derived for solutions of many-body wave scattering problems by
small particles in the case of acoustically soft, hard, and impedance particles
embedded in an inhomogeneous medium. The limiting case is considered, when the
size $a$ of small particles tends to zero while their number tends to infinity
at a suitable rate. Equations for the limiting effective (self-consistent)
field in the medium are derived.
