The goal of the present work is to revisit the cranking formula of the
vibrational parameters, especially its well known drawbacks. The latter can be
summarized as spurious resonances or singularities in the behavior of the mass
parameters in the limit of unpaired systems. It is found that these problems
are simply induced by the presence of two derivatives in the formula. In
effect, this formula is based on the hypothesis of contributions of excited
states due only to two quasiparticles. But it turns out that this is not the
case for the derivatives. We deduce therefore that the derivatives are not well
founded in the formula. We propose then simply to suppress these terms from the
formula. Although this solution seems to be simplistic, it solves definitively
all its inherent problems.
