We consider the problem of state selection for a stochastic system, initially
in an unstable stationary state, when multiple metastable states compete for
occupation. Using path-integral techniques we derive remarkably simple and
accurate formulas for state-selection probabilities. The method is sufficiently
general that it is applicable to a wide variety of problems.
