In the theory of minimal submanifold, the following problem is fundamental:
when does a given Riemannian manifold admit (or does not admit) a minimal
isometric immersion into an Euclidean space form of arbitrary dimension? A
partial solution of this problem was obtained by B.Y. Chen as an application of
his fundamental inequality [1]. In this paper we obtain another partial
solution of this problem.
