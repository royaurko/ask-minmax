I present theoretical calculations of reflection beamshifts, Goos-H\"anchen
and Imbert-Fedorov shifts, due to the presence of a monolayer graphene on a
dielectric media when using a beam with wavelength in the visible range.
Specifically, I look at beamshifts for different polarization states (p, s,
$45^0$, $\sigma^+$). The Goos-H\"anchen shifts I calculated are in good
agreement with results of a recent experiment. I will discuss other possible
experimental routes to determine beamshifts in graphene.
