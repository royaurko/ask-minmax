The recently introduced longest common substring with $k$-mismatches
($k$-LCF) problem is to find, given two sequences $S_1$ and $S_2$ of length $n$
each, a longest substring $A_1$ of $S_1$ and $A_2$ of $S_2$ such that the
Hamming distance between $A_1$ and $A_2$ is at most $k$. So far, the only
subquadratic time result for this problem was known for $k =
1$~\cite{FGKU2014}. We first present two output-dependent algorithms solving
the $k$-LCF problem and show that for $k = O(\log^{1-\varepsilon} n)$, where
$\varepsilon > 0$, at least one of them works in subquadratic time, using
$O(n)$ words of space. The choice of one of these two algorithms to be applied
for a given input can be done after linear time and space preprocessing.
Finally we present a tabulation-based algorithm working, in its range of
applicability, in $O(n^2\log\min(k+\ell_0, \sigma)/\log n)$ time, where
$\ell_0$ is the length of the standard longest common substring.
