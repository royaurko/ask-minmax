By introducing local $Z_N$ symmetries with $N=11,13$ in two 3-3-1 models, it
is possible to implement an automatic Peccei-Quinn symmetry, keeping the axion
protected against gravitational effects at the same time. Both models have a
$Z_2$ domain wall problem and the neutrinos are strictly Dirac particles.
