Geographic routing consists in using the position information of nodes to
assist in the routing process, and has been a widely studied subject in sensor
networks. One of the outstanding challenges facing geographic routing has been
its applicability. Authors either make some broad assumptions on an idealized
version of wireless networks which are often unverifiable, or they use costly
methods to planarize the communication graph.
  The overarching questions that drive us are the following. When, and how
should we use geographic routing? Is there a criterion to tell whether a
communication network is fit for geographic routing? When exactly does
geographic routing make sense?
  In this paper we formulate the four principles that define geographic routing
and explore their topological consequences. Given a localized communication
network, we then define and compute its geographic eccentricity, which measures
its fitness for geographic routing. Finally we propose a distributed algorithm
that either enables geographic routing on the network or proves that its
geographic eccentricity is too high.
