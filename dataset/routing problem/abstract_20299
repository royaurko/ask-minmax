Via Gauge theory, we give a new proof of partial regularity for harmonic maps
in dimension m>2 into arbitrary targets. This proof avoids the use of adapted
frames and permits to consider targets of "minimal" C^2 regularity. The proof
we present moreover extends to a large class of elliptic systems of quadratic
growth.
