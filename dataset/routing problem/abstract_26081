We propose a method for the (re)-construction of a regularized functional
integral, well defined in the ultraviolet limit, from a solution of the
functional renormalization group equation of the effective average action. The
functional integral is required to reproduce this solution. The method is of
particular interest for asymptotically safe theories. The bare action for the
Einstein-Hilbert truncation of Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) is computed and
its flow is analyzed. As a second example conformally reduced gravity is
explored. Various conceptual issues related to the reconstruction problem are
discussed.
