We use an inverse scattering approach to study multi-peakon solutions of the
Degasperis-Procesi (DP) equation, an integrable PDE similar to the Camassa-Holm
shallow water equation. The spectral problem associated to the DP equation is
equivalent under a change of variables to what we call the cubic string
problem, which is a third order non-selfadjoint generalization of the
well-known equation describing the vibrational modes of an inhomogeneous string
attached at its ends. We give two proofs that the eigenvalues of the cubic
string are positive and simple; one using scattering properties of DP peakons,
and another using the Gantmacher-Krein theory of oscillatory kernels.
  For the discrete cubic string (analogous to a string consisting of n point
masses) we solve explicitly the inverse spectral problem of reconstructing the
mass distribution from suitable spectral data, and this leads to explicit
formulas for the general n-peakon solution of the DP equation. Central to our
study of the inverse problem is a peculiar type of simultaneous rational
approximation of the two Weyl functions of the cubic string, similar to
classical Pade-Hermite approximation but with lower order of approximation and
an additional symmetry condition instead. The results obtained are intriguing
and nontrivial generalizations of classical facts from the theory of Stieltjes
continued fractions and orthogonal polynomials.
