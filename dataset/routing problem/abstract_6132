The use of Mean-Field theory to unwrap principal phase patterns has been
recently proposed. In this paper we generalize the Mean-Field approach to
process phase patterns with arbitrary degree of undersampling. The phase
unwrapping problem is formulated as that of finding the ground state of a
locally constrained, finite size, spin-L Ising model under a non-uniform
magnetic field. The optimization problem is solved by the Mean-Field Annealing
technique. Synthetic experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm.
