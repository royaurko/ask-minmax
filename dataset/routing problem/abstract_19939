The three-flavor mixing matrix can be parameterized by the rephasing
invariants Gamma_{ijk} = V_{1i} V_{2j} V_{3k}. This formulation brings out the
inherent symmetry of the problem and has some appealing features. Examples
illustrating the parametrization and applications to quark mixing are
presented.
