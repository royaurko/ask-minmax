We give an overview of the progress that has been made in recent years in
understanding the dynamic multiscaling of homogeneous, isotropic turbulence and
related problems. We emphasise the similarity of this problem with the dynamic
scaling of time-dependent correlation functions in the vicinity of a critical
point in, e.g., a spin system. The universality of dynamic-multiscaling
exponents in fluid turbulence is explored by detailed simulations of the GOY
shell model for fluid turbulence.
