We investigate a number of recently reported exact algorithms for the maximum
clique problem (MCQ, MCR, MCS, BBMC). The program code used is presented and
critiqued showing how small changes in implementation can have a drastic effect
on performance. The computational study demonstrates how problem features and
hardware platforms influence algorithm behaviour. The minimum width order
(smallest-last) is investigated, and MCS is broken into its consituent parts
and we discover that one of these parts degrades performance. It is shown that
the standard procedure used for rescaling published results is unsafe.
