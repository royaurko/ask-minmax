A formal mean square error expansion (MSE) is derived for Euler--Maruyama
numerical solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDE). The error
expansion is used to construct a pathwise a posteriori adaptive time stepping
Euler--Maruyama method for numerical solutions of SDE, and the resulting method
is incorporated into a multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method for weak
approximations of SDE. This gives an efficient MSE adaptive MLMC method for
handling a number of low-regularity approximation problems. In low-regularity
numerical example problems, the developed adaptive MLMC method is shown to
outperform the uniform time stepping MLMC method by orders of magnitude,
producing output whose error with high probability is bounded by TOL>0 at the
near-optimal MLMC cost rate O(TOL^{-2}log(TOL)^4).
