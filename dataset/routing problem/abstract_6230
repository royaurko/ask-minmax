It was observed by Veltman a long time ago that a special value for the Higgs
boson mass could lead to a cancellation of the quadratically divergent
corrections to the Higgs boson's squared mass which appear at one loop. We
present a class of low energy models that allow to soften the naturalness
problem in the sense that there can be a cancellation of radiative corrections
appearing at one loop. The naturalness problem is shifted from the one TeV
region to the 10 TeV region. Depending on the specific model under
consideration, this scale can even be shifted to a higher energy scale.
Signatures of these models are discussed.
