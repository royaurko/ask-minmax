We consider a synthesis problem for a remotely controlled linear system where
the communication is constrained because of the shared and unreliable nature of
the channel. Modeling the constraints by a periodic transmission scheme and
random message losses, we present an H-infinity design framework and study the
limitations in the communication required for stabilization.
