We consider a regular indefinite Sturm-Liouville problem with two
self-adjoint boundary conditions affinely dependent on the eigenparameter. We
give sufficient conditions under which the root vectors of this Sturm-Liouville
problem can be selected to form a Riesz basis of a corresponding weighted
Hilbert space.
