The problem of finding supersymmetric brane configurations in the
near-horizon attractor geometry of a Calabi-Yau black hole with
magnetic-electric charges (p^I,q_I) is considered. Half-BPS configurations,
which are static for some choice of global AdS2 coordinate, are found for
wrapped brane configurations with essentially any four-dimensional charges
(u^I,v_I). Half-BPS multibrane configurations can also be found for any
collection of wrapped branes provided they all have the same sign for the
symplectic inner product p^Iv_I-u^Iq_I of their charges with the black hole
charges. This contrasts with the Minkowski problem for which a mutually
preserved supersymmetry requires alignment of all the charge vectors. The
radial position of the branes in global AdS2 is determined by the phase of
their central charge.
