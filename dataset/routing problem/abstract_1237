The photonic density of states (PDOS), like its' electronic coun- terpart, is
one of the key physical quantities governing a variety of phenom- ena and hence
PDOS manipulation is the route to new photonic devices. The PDOS is
conventionally altered by exploiting the resonance within a device such as a
microcavity or a bandgap structure like a photonic crystal. Here we show that
nanostructured metamaterials with hyperbolic dispersion can dramatically
enhance the photonic density of states paving the way for metamaterial based
PDOS engineering.
