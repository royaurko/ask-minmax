We consider a size-structured model for cell division and address the
question of determining the division (birth) rate from the measured stable size
distribution of the population. We propose a new regularization technique based
on a filtering approach. We prove convergence of the algorithm and validate the
theoretical results by implementing numerical simulations, based on classical
techniques. We compare the results for direct and inverse problems, for the
filtering method and for the quasi-reversibility method proposed in
[Perthame-Zubelli].
