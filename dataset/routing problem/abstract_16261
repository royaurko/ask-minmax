A method to solve the problem f(x) = 0 efficiently on any n-dimensional
domain Omega under very broad hypoteses is proposed. The position of the root
of f, assumed unique, is found by computing the center of mass of an
Omega-shaped object having a singular mass density. It is shown that although
the mass of the object is infinite, the position of its center of mass can be
computed exactly and corresponds to the solution of the problem. The exact
analytical result is implemented numerically by means of an adaptive Monte
Carlo sampling technique which provides an exponential rate of convergence. The
method can be extended to functions with multiple roots, providing an efficient
automated root finding algorithm.
