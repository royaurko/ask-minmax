The concept of smooth deformation of a Riemannian manifolds associated with
the extrinsic curvature is explained and applied to FLRW cosmology. We show
that such deformation can be derived from an Einstein-Hilbert-like dynamical
principle producing an observable effect in the sense of Noether. The Gupta
equations are used to address the problem of the cosmological constant to
provide the expression of the function $b(t)$ which is a consequence of the
effect of extrinsic curvature. When using such a modification, we notice on how
the extrinsic curvature compensates both quantitative and qualitative
difference between $ \Lambda$ and $\rho_{\; vac}$ due to the topological
characteristics of the extrinsic geometry. It is also shown that the
coincidence problem can be alleviated in this framework.
