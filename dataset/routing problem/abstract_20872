We consider a type of long-range percolation problem on the positive
integers, motivated by earlier work of others on the appearance of (in)finite
words within a site percolation model. The main issue is whether a given
infinite binary word appears within an iid Bernoulli sequence at locations that
satisfy certain constraints. We settle the issue in some cases, and provide
partial results in others.
