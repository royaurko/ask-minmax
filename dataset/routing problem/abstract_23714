This paper is devoted to the autonomous Lagrange problem of the calculus of
variations with a discontinuous Lagrangian. We prove that every minimizer is
Lipschitz continuous if the Lagrangian is coercive and locally bounded. The
main difference with respect to the previous works in the literature is that we
do not assume that the Lagrangian is convex in the velocity. We also show that,
under some additional assumptions, the DuBois-Reymond necessary condition still
holds in the discontinuous case. Finally, we apply these results to deduce that
the value function of the Bolza problem is locally Lipschitz and satisfies (in
a generalized sense) a Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
