Flocking behavior of multiple agents can be widely observed in nature such as
schooling fish and flocking birds. Recent literature has proposed the
possibility that flocking is possible even only a small fraction of agents are
informed of the desired position and velocity. However, it is still a
challenging problem to determine which agents should be informed or have the
ability to detect the desired information. This paper aims to address this
problem. By combining the ideas of virtual force and pseudo-leader mechanism,
where a pseudo-leader represents an agent who can detect the desired
information, we propose a scheme for choosing pseudo-leaders in a multi-agent
group. The presented scheme can be applied to a multi-agent group even with an
unconnected or switching neighbor graph. Experiments are given to show that the
methods presented in this paper are of high accuracy and perform well.
