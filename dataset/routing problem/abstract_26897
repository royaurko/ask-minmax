In this paper we will present SDeval, a software project that contains tools
for creating and running benchmarks with a focus on problems in computer
algebra. It is built on top of the Symbolic Data project, able to translate
problems in the database into executable code for various computer algebra
systems. The included tools are designed to be very flexible to use and to
extend, such that they can be utilized even in contexts of other communities.
With the presentation of SDEval, we will also address particularities of
benchmarking in the field of computer algebra. Furthermore, with SDEval, we
provide a feasible and automatizable way of reproducing benchmarks published in
current research works, which appears to be a difficult task in general due to
the customizability of the available programs. We will simultaneously present
the current developments in the Symbolic Data project.
