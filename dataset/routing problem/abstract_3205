In the paper we consider the invariant zero assignment problem in a linear
multivariable system with several inputs/outputs by constructing a system
output matrix. The problem is reduced to the pole assignment problem by a state
feedback (modal control) in a descriptor system or a regular one. It is shown
that the zero assignment and pole assignment are mathematically equivalent
problems.
