In the study of time-dependent waves, it is computationally expensive to
solve a problem in which high frequencies (shortwaves, with wavenumber k =
kmax) and low frequencies (longwaves, near k=kmin) mix. Consider a problem in
which low frequencies scatter off a sharp impurity. The impurity generates high
frequencies which propagate and spread throughout the computational domain,
while the domain must be large enough to contain several longwaves.
Conventional spectral methods have computational cost proportional to
O(kmax/kmin \log (kmax/kmin)).
  We present here a multiscale algorithm (implemented for the Schrodinger
equation, but generally applicable) which solves the problem with cost (in
space and time) O(kmax L log(kmax / kmin) \log(kmax L)). Here, L is the width
of the region in which the algorithm resolves all frequencies, and is
independent of kmin.
