In this paper we give some examples of generalized Massey products, arising
from deformations of A-infinity and L-infinity algebras. The generalized Massey
products are given by certain graded commutative algebra structures, depending
on the deformation problem considered. We show that the formal deformations of
infinity algebras give rise to the same algebraic structure as the deformations
of Z2-graded Lie algebras. However, the problem of deforming a Lie algebra into
an L-infinity algebra, or an associative algebra into an A-infinity algebra
gives rise to a new algebra. We also consider deformations of infinity algebras
with a base. In math.QA/9602024, it was shown that the Jacobi identity for a
bracket on the tensor product of a Lie algebra and a graded commutative algebra
is equivalent to a Maurer-Cartan formula. We prove a generalized result in the
case of infinity algebras.
