The role of auxiliary photons in the problem of identifying a state secretly
chosen from a given set of L-photon states is analyzed. It is shown that
auxiliary photons do not increase the ability to discriminate such states by
means of a global measurement using only optical linear elements, conditional
transformation and auxiliary photons.
