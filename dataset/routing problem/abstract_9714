In this paper, we investigate large amplitude solutions to a system of
conservation laws which is transformed, by a change of variable, from the
well-known Keller-Segel model describing cell (bacteria) movement toward the
concentration gradient of the chemical that is consumed by the cells. For the
Cauchy problem and initial-boundary value problem, the global unique
solvability is proved based on the energy method. In particular, our main
purpose is to investigate the convergence rates as the diffusion parameter
$\epsilon$ goes to zero. It is shown that the convergence rates in
$L^\infty$-norm are of the order $(\epsilon)$ and $O(\epsilon^{3/4})$
corresponding to the Cauchy problem and the initial-boundary value problem
respectively.
