In molecular communication, information is conveyed through chemical
messages. With much advancement in the field of nanotechnology, bioengineering
and synthetic biology over the past decade, micro- and nano-scales devices are
becoming a reality. Yet the problem of engineering a reliable communication
system between tiny devices is still an open problem. At the same time, despite
the prevalence of radio communication, there are still areas where traditional
electromagnetic waves find it difficult or expensive to reach. Points of
interest in industry, cities, medical, and military applications often lie in
embedded and entrenched areas, accessible only by ventricles at scales too
small for conventional radio- and micro-waves, or they are located in such a
way that directional high frequency systems are ineffective. Molecular
communication is a biologically inspired communication scheme that could be
employed for solving these problems. Although biologists have studied molecular
communication, it is poorly understood from a telecommunication perspective. In
this paper, we highlight the recent advancements in the field of molecular
communication engineering.
