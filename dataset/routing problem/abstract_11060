We show how to map local fermionic problems onto local spin problems on a
lattice in any dimension. The main idea is to introduce auxiliary degrees of
freedom, represented by Majorana fermions, which allow us to extend the
Jordan-Wigner transformation to dimensions higher than one. We also discuss the
implications of our results in the numerical investigation of fermionic
systems.
