Instances of logical cryptanalysis, circuit verification, and bounded model
checking can often be succinctly represented as a combined satisfiability (SAT)
problem where an instance is a combination of traditional clauses and parity
constraints. This paper studies how such combined problems can be efficiently
solved by augmenting a modern SAT solver with an xor-reasoning module in the
DPLL(XOR) framework. A new xor-reasoning module that deduces all possible
implied literals using incremental Gauss-Jordan elimination is presented. A
decomposition technique that can greatly reduce the size of parity constraint
matrices while allowing still to deduce all implied literals is presented. It
is shown how to eliminate variables occuring only in parity constraints while
preserving the decomposition. The proposed techniques are evaluated
experimentally.
