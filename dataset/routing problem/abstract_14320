In this paper, we present local H\"older estimates for the degenerate
Keller-Segel system
\eqref{eq-cases-aligned-main-problem-of-Keller-Segel-System} below in the range
of $m>1$ and $q>1$ before a blow-up of solutions. To deal with difficulties
caused by the degeneracy of the operator, we find uniform estimates depending
sup-norm of the density function and modified the energy estimates and
intrinsic scales considered in Porous Medium Equation. As its application, the
uniqueness of weak solution to
\eqref{eq-cases-aligned-main-problem-of-Keller-Segel-System} is also showed in
the class of H\"older continuous functions by proving $L^1$-contraction in this
class.
