In this work a linearly constrained minimization of a positive semidefinite
quadratic functional is examined. Our results are concerning infinite
dimensional real Hilbert spaces, with a singular positive operator related to
the functional, and considering as constraint a singular operator. The
difference between the proposed minimization and previous work on this problem,
is that it is considered for all vectors perpendicular to the kernel of the
related operator or matrix.
