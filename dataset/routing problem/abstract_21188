The classical definition of Prym varieties deals with the unramified covers
of curves. The aim of the present paper is to give explicit algebraic
descriptions of the Prym varieties associated to ramified double covers of
algebraic curves. We make a careful study of the connection with the concept of
algebraic completely integrable systems and we apply the methods to some
problems of Mathematical Physics.
