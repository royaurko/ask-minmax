We extend Brenier's transport collapse scheme on the Cauchy problem for
heterogeneous scalar conservation laws and initial-boundary value problem for
homogeneous scalar conservation laws. It is based on averaging out the solution
to the corresponding kinetic equation, and it necessarily converges toward the
entropy admissible solution. In the case of initial-boundary value problem, we
such a procedure is used to construct a numerical scheme which leads us to a
new solution concept for initial-boundary value problem for scalar conservation
laws. The concept is a generalization (refinement) of the previous works on
initial-boundary value problem. We also provide numerical examples.
