A model of static boson-fermion star with spherical symmetry based on the
scalar-tensor theory of gravity with massive dilaton field is investigated
numerically.
  Since the radius of star is \textit{a priori} an unknown quantity, the
corresponding boundary value problem (BVP) is treated as a nonlinear spectral
problem with a free internal boundary. The Continuous Analogue of Newton Method
(CANM) for solving this problem is applied.
  Information about basic geometric functions and the functions describing the
matter fields, which build the star is obtained. In a physical point of view
the main result is that the structure and properties of the star in presence of
massive dilaton field depend essentially both of its fermionic and bosonic
components.
