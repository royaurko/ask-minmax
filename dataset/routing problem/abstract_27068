Multi-Higgs doublet models appear in many interesting extensions of the
standard model (SM). But they suffer from Higgs-mediated flavor changing
neutral current (FCNC) problem which is very generic. In this talk, I describe
that this problem can be resolved or mitigated if we introduce local $U(1)_H$
Higgs flavor gauge symmetry. As examples, I describe chiral $U(1)_{H}$ models
where the right-handed up-type quarks also carry $U(1)_H$ charges and discuss
the top forward-backward asymmetry (FBA) and $B\rightarrow D^{(*)} \tau \nu$
puzzle. Next I describe the two-Higgs doublet models where the usual $Z_2$
symmetry is implemented to $U(1)_H$ and show how the Type-I and Type-II models
are extended. One possible extension of Type-II has the same fermion contents
with the leptophobic $E_6$ $Z^{'}$ model by Rosner, and I discuss the neutrino
sector in this model briefly.
