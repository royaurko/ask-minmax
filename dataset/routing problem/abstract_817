The intermittent route to spatio-temporal complexity is analyzed in a simple
model which displays a subcritical bifurcation without hysteresis. A new type
of spatio-temporal complexity is found, induced by fronts which "convectively
clean" the perturbations around an unstable state. The mechanism which leads to
the existence of these "retracting fronts" is analyzed in the frame of simple
models.
