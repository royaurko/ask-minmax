This is a continuation of the first contributor's development of the theory of
elliptic differential operators with edge degeneracies. That first paper
treated basic mapping theory, focusing on semi-Fredholm properties on weighted
Sobolev and H\"older spaces and regularity in the form of asymptotic expansions
of solutions. The present paper builds on this through the formulation of
boundary conditions and the construction of parametrices for the associated
boundary problems. As before, the emphasis is on the geometric microlocal
structure of the Schwartz kernels of parametrices and generalized inverses.
