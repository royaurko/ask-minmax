Based on the conjecture that rather than the second law of thermodynamics
inevitably be breached as matter approaches a big crunch or a black hole
singularity, the order of events should reverse, a model of the universe that
resolves a number of longstanding problems and paradoxes in cosmology is
presented. A universe that has no beginning (and no need for one), no ending,
but yet is finite, is without singularities, precludes time travel, in which
events are neither determined by initial or final conditions, and problems such
as why the universe has a low entropy past, or conditions at the big bang
appear to be so "special," require no causal explanation, is the result. This
model also has some profound philosophical implications.
