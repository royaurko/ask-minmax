We show that the strong CP problem can, in principle, be solved dynamically
by adding extra-dimensions with compact topology. To this aim we consider a toy
model for QCD, which contains a vacuum angle and a strong CP like problem. We
further consider a higher dimensional theory, which has a trivial vacuum
structure and which reproduces the perturbative properties of the toy model in
the low-energy limit. In the weak coupling regime, where our computations are
valid, we show that the vacuum structure of the low-energy action is still
trivial and the strong CP problem is solved. No axion-like particle occur in
this setup and therefore it is not ruled out by astrophysical bounds.
