We report synthesis, structure, electrical transport and heat capacity of
SmFeAsO. The title compound is synthesized by one-step encapsulation of
stoichiometric FeAs, Sm, and Sm2O3 in an evacuated (10-5 Torr) quartz tube by
prolong (72 hours) annealing at 1100oC. The as synthesized compound is
crystallized in tetragonal structure with P4/nmm space group having lattice
parameters a = 3.93726(33) A and c = 8.49802(07) A. The resistance (R-T)
measurements on the compound exhibited ground state spin-density-wave
(SDW)-like metallic steps below 140 K. Heat capacity CP(T) measurements on the
title compound, showed an anomaly at around 140 K, which is reminiscent of the
SDW ordering of the compound. At lower temperatures the CP(T) shows a clear
peak at around 4.5 K. At lower temperature below 20 K, Cp(T) is also measured
under an applied field of 7 Tesla. It is concluded that the CP(T) peak at 4.5 K
is due to the anti-ferromagnetic(AFM) ordering of Sm3+ spins. These results are
in confirmation with ordering of Sm in Sm2-xCexCuO4.
