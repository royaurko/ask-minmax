We prove a partial result concerning the long-standing problem on limit
periodicity of the Jacobi matrix associated with the balanced measure on the
Julia set of an expending polynomial. Besides this, connections of the problem
with the Faybusovich--Gekhtman flow and many other objects (the Hilbert
transform, the Schwarz derivative, the Ruelle and Laplace operators) that, we
sure, are of an independent interest, are discussed.
