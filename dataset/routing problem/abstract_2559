The electrical conductance of atomic metal contacts represents a powerful
tool to detect nanomagnetism. Conductance reflects magnetism through anomalies
at zero bias -- generally with Fano lineshapes -- due to the Kondo screening of
the magnetic impurity bridging the contact. A full atomic-level understanding
of this nutshell many-body system is of the greatest importance, especially in
view of our increasing need to control nanocurrents by means of magnetism.
Disappointingly, zero bias conductance anomalies are not presently calculable
from atomistic scratch. In this Letter we demonstrate a working route
connecting approximately but quantitatively density functional theory (DFT) and
numerical renormalization group (NRG) approaches and leading to a
first-principles conductance calculation for a nanocontact, exemplified by a Ni
impurity in a Au nanowire. A Fano-like conductance lineshape is obtained
microscopically, and shown to be controlled by the impurity s-level position.
We also find a relationship between conductance anomaly and geometry, and
uncover the possibility of opposite antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic Kondo
screening -- the latter exhibiting a totally different and unexplored zero bias
anomaly. The present matching method between DFT and NRG should permit the
quantitative understanding and exploration of this larger variety of Kondo
phenomena at more general magnetic nanocontacts.
