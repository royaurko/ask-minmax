Finding a hidden partition in a random environment is a general and important
problem, which contains as subproblems many famous questions, such as finding a
hidden clique, finding a hidden coloring, finding a hidden bipartition etc.
  In this paper, we provide a simple SVD algorithm for this purpose, answering
a question of McSherry. This algorithm is very easy to implement and works for
sparse graphs with optimal density.
