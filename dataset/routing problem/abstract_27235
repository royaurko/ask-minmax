Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph. A subset $D\subseteq V$ is a dominating set if
every vertex not in $D$ is adjacent to a vertex in $D$. The domination number
of $G$, denoted by $\gamma(G)$, is the smallest cardinality of a dominating set
of $G$. The bondage number of a nonempty graph $G$ is the smallest number of
edges whose removal from $G$ results in a graph with domination number larger
than $\gamma(G)$. The reinforcement number of $G$ is the smallest number of
edges whose addition to $G$ results in a graph with smaller domination number
than $\gamma(G)$. In 2012, Hu and Xu proved that the decision problems for the
bondage, the total bondage, the reinforcement and the total reinforcement
numbers are all NP-hard in general graphs. In this paper, we improve these
results to bipartite graphs.
