The effect of stellar aberration seems to be one of the simplest phenomena in
astronomical observations. But there is a large literature about it betraying a
problem of asymmetry between observer motion and source motion. This paper
addresses the problem from the point of view of Euclidean space-time, arising
from the proposition that stellar aberration (or Bradley aberration) gives rise
to a Lorentz expansion.
