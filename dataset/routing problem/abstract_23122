We prescribe a choice of 18 variables in all that casts the equations of the
fully nonlinear characteristic formulation of general relativity in
first--order quasi-linear canonical form. At the analytical level, a
formulation of this type allows us to make concrete statements about existence
of solutions. In addition, it offers concrete advantages for numerical
applications as it now becomes possible to incorporate advanced numerical
techniques for first order systems, which had thus far not been applicable to
the characteristic problem of the Einstein equations, as well as in providing a
framework for a unified treatment of the vacuum and matter problems. This is of
relevance to the accurate simulation of gravitational waves emitted in
astrophysical scenarios such as stellar core collapse.
