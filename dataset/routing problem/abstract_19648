The present contributor recently proposed and proved a relationship theorem
between nonlinear polynomial equations and the corresponding Jacobian matrix.
By using this theorem, this paper derives a Newton iterative formula without
requiring the evaluation of nonlinear function values in the solution of
nonlinear polynomial-only problems.
