The time evolution of spatial fluctuations in inhomogeneous d-dimensional
biological systems is analyzed. A single species continuous growth model, in
which the population disperses via diffusion and convection is considered.
Time-independent environmental heterogeneities, such as a random distribution
of nutrients or sunlight are modeled by quenched disorder in the growth rate.
Linearization of this model of population dynamics shows that the fastest
growing localized state dominates in a time proportional to a power of the
logarithm of the system size. Using an analogy with a Schrodinger equation
subject to a constant imaginary vector potential, we propose a delocalization
transition for the steady state of the nonlinear problem at a critical
convection threshold separating localized and extended states. In the limit of
high convection velocity, the linearized growth problem in $d$ dimensions
exhibits singular scaling behavior described by a (d-1)-dimensional
generalization of the noisy Burgers' equation, with universal singularities in
the density of states associated with disorder averaged eigenvalues near the
band edge in the complex plane. The Burgers mapping leads to unusual transverse
spreading of convecting delocalized populations.
