We establish the local in time well-posedness of strong solutions to the
vacuum free boundary problem of the compressible Navier-Stokes-Poisson system
in the spherically symmetric and isentropic motion. Our result captures the
physical vacuum boundary behavior of the Lane-Emden star configurations for all
adiabatic exponents $\gamma>{6/5}$.
