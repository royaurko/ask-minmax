The resolution of the problem of cosmological singularity in the framework of
gauge theories of gravitation is discussed. Generalized cosmological Friedmann
equations for homogeneous isotropic models filled by interacting scalar fields
and usual gravitating matter are deduced. It is shown that generic feature of
cosmological models of flat, open and closed type is their regular bouncing
character.
