We investigate the problem whether a function of several arguments can be
reconstructed from its identification minors. We focus on functions with a
unique identification minor, and we establish some positive and negative
results on the reconstruction problem. In particular, we show that totally
symmetric functions (of sufficiently large arity) are reconstructible and the
class of functions weakly determined by the order of first occurrence (of
sufficiently large arity) is weakly reconstructible.
