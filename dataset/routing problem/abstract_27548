Las Vergnas & Hamidoune studied the number of circuits needed to determine an
oriented matroid. In this paper we study this problem as well as variants of
it. After setting the problem for a general matroid $M$, we discuss the
relationship to subgraphs of the base graph and the intersection graph of
circuits of $M$. We then focus our attention to investigate the variants when
$M$ is uniform or regular as well as in some graphic and cographic cases. All
this leads to consider the notions of (connected) \emph{covering numbers} in
Design Theory and (connected) \emph{cycle} and \emph{bond covers} in Graph
Theory.
