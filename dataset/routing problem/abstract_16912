We give a survey of algorithms for computing topological invariants of
semi-algebraic sets with special emphasis on the more recent developments in
designing algorithms for computing the Betti numbers of semi-algebraic sets.
Aside from describing these results, we discuss briefly the background as well
as the importance of these problems, and also describe the main tools from
algorithmic semi-algebraic geometry, as well as algebraic topology, which make
these advances possible. We end with a list of open problems.
