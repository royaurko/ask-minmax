In this paper we are concerned with the solution of Compressed Sensing (CS)
problems where the signals to be recovered are sparse in coherent and redundant
dictionaries. We extend a primal-dual Newton Conjugate Gradients (pdNCG) method
for CS problems. We provide an inexpensive and provably effective
preconditioning technique for linear systems using pdNCG. Numerical results are
presented on CS problems which demonstrate the performance of pdNCG with the
proposed preconditioner compared to state-of-the-art existing solvers.
