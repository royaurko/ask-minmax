Blow-up solutions to the two-dimensional Gel'fand problem are studied. It is
known that the location of the blow-up points of these solutions is related to
a Hamiltonian function involving the Green function of the domain. We show that
this implies an equivalence between the Morse indices of the solutions and the
associated critical points of the Hamiltonian.
