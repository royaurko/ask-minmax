We investigate the estimation of parameters in the random coefficient
autoregressive model. We consider a nonstationary RCA process and show that the
innovation variance parameter cannot be estimated by the quasi-maximum
likelihood method. The asymptotic normality of the quasi-maximum likelihood
estimator for the remaining model parameters is proven so the unit root problem
does not exist in the random coefficient autoregressive model.
