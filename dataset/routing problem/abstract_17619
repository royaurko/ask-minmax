In this paper, we are concerned with interactions between isoparametric
theory and differential topology. Two foliations are called equivalent if there
exists a diffeomorphism between the foliated manifolds mapping leaves to
leaves. Using differential topology, we obtain several results towards the
classification problem of isoparametric foliations up to equivalence. In
particular, we show that each homotopy $n$-sphere has the "same" isoparametric
foliations as the standard sphere $S^n$ has except for $n=4$, reducing the
classification problem on homotopy spheres to that on the standard sphere.
Moreover, we prove the uniqueness up to equivalence of isoparametric foliations
with two points as the focal submanifolds on each sphere $S^n$ except for
$n=5$. Besides, we show that the uniqueness holds on $S^5$ if and only if
$\pi_0(Diff(S^4))\simeq\mathbb{Z}_2$, i.e., pseudo-isotopy implies isotopy for
diffeomorphisms on $S^4$. At last, some ideas behind the proofs enable us to
discover new exotic smooth structures on certain manifolds.
