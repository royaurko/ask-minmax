We reduce the construction of a weak solution of the Cauchy problem for the
Navier-Stokes system to the construction of a solution to a stochastic problem.
Namely, we construct diffusion processes which allow us to obtain a
probabilistic representation of a weak (in distributional sense) solution to
the Cauchy problem for the Navier- Stokes system.
