In the vicinity of a Feshbach resonance, a system of ultracold atoms on an
optical lattice undergoes rich physical transformations which involve molecule
formation and hopping of molecules on the lattice and thus goes beyond a
single-band Hubbard model description. We propose to probe the behavior of this
system with a harmonic modulation of the magnetic field, and thus of the
scattering length, across the Feshbach resonance, as an alternative to
lattice-depth modulation spectroscopy. In the regime in which the single-band
Hubbard model is still valid, we provide simulation data for this type of
spectroscopy. The method may uncover a route towards the efficient creation of
ultracold molecules and provides an alternate means for lattice modulation
spectroscopy.
