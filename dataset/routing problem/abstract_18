Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) are a set of self organized wireless mobile
nodes that works without any predefined infrastructure. For routing data in
MANETs, the routing protocols relay on mobile wireless nodes. In general, any
routing protocol performance suffers i) with resource constraints and ii) due
to the mobility of the nodes. Due to existing routing challenges in MANETs
clustering based protocols suffers frequently with cluster head failure
problem, which degrades the cluster stability. This paper proposes, Enhanced
CBRP, a schema to improve the cluster stability and in-turn improves the
performance of traditional cluster based routing protocol (CBRP), by electing
better cluster head using weighted clustering algorithm and considering some
crucial routing challenges. Moreover, proposed protocol suggests a secondary
cluster head for each cluster, to increase the stability of the cluster and
implicitly the network infrastructure in case of sudden failure of cluster
head.
