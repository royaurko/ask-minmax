We propose a simple and straightforward method based on Wronskians for the
calculation of bound--state energies and wavefunctions of one--dimensional
quantum--mechanical problems. We explicitly discuss the asymptotic behavior of
the wavefunction and show that the allowed energies make the divergent part
vanish. As illustrative examples we consider an exactly solvable model and the
Gaussian potential well.
