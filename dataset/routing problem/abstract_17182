Inference of hidden classes in stochastic block model is a classical problem
with important applications. Most commonly used methods for this problem
involve na\"{\i}ve mean field approaches or heuristic spectral methods.
Recently, belief propagation was proposed for this problem. In this
contribution we perform a comparative study between the three methods on
synthetically created networks. We show that belief propagation shows much
better performance when compared to na\"{\i}ve mean field and spectral
approaches. This applies to accuracy, computational efficiency and the tendency
to overfit the data.
