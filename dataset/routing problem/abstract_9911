We study the arithmetic analogue of maximal functions on diagonal
hypersurfaces. This paper is a natural step following the papers of
\cite{Magyar_dyadic}, \cite{Magyar_ergodic} and \cite{MSW}. We combine more
precise knowledge of oscillatory integrals and exponential sums to generalize
the asymptotic formula in Waring's problem to an approximation formula for the
fourier transform of the solution set of lattice points on hypersurfaces
arising in Waring's problem and apply this result to arithmetic maximal
functions and ergodic averages. In sufficiently large dimensions, the
approximation formula, $\ell^2$-maximal theorems and ergodic theorems were
previously known. Our contribution is in reducing the dimensional constraint in
the approximation formula using recent bounds of Wooley, and improving the
range of $\ell^p$ spaces in the maximal and ergodic theorems. We also
conjecture the expected range of spaces.
