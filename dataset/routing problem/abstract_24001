The classical Helmholtz problem is applied for modelling and numerical
investigation of inviscid cusp-ended separated flow around circular cylinder.
Two coordinate systems are used: polar for initial calculations and parabolic
as topologically most suited for infinite stagnation zone. Scaling by the shape
of the unknown free line renders the problem to computational domain with fixed
boundaries. Difference schemes and algorithm for Laplace equation and for
Bernoulli integral are devised. A separated flow with drag coefficient $C_x=0$
like the so called ``critical'' flow is obtained. The pressure distribution on
the surface of cylinder and the detachment point compares quantitatively very
well with the predictions of the hodograph method.
