An important task in local helioseismology is the three-dimensional
reconstruction of flows close to the surface of the Sun from travel times
obtained from measured dopplergrams. For quiet parts of the Sun the forward
problem is described in good approximation by a large system of convolution
equations. The data are highly noisy random vectors with a known dense
covariance matrix. This leads to a large statistical linear inverse problem.
  Whereas for deterministic linear inverse problems several computationally
efficient optimal regularization methods exist, for statistical linear inverse
problem only one optimal linear estimator exists, the Pinsker estimator.
However, often it is computationally inefficient since it requires a singular
value decomposition of the forward operator or it is not applicable because of
an unknown covariance matrix, so it is rarely used for real-world problems.
Both reasons do not apply for the helioseismology problem above. We present a
simplified proof of the optimality properties of the Pinsker estimator and show
that it yields significantly better results than the state-of-the-art methods
of the field, Regularized Least Squares (Tikhonov regularization) and SOLA
(approximate inverse).
  Moreover, we discuss the incorporation of the mass conservation constraint in
the Pinsker scheme using staggered grids. With this improvement we can
reconstruct for the first time not only horizontal, but also vertical velocity
components, which are much smaller in amplitude.
