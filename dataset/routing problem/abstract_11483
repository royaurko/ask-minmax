We find the adjoint of the Askey-Wilson divided difference operator with
respect to the inner procuct on L^2(-1,1,(1-x^2)^-1/2 dx) defined as a Cauchy
principle value and show that the Askey-Wilson polynomials are solutions of a
q-Sturm-Liouville problem. From these facts we deduce various properties of
the polynomials in a simple and straightforward way. We also provide an
operator theoretic description of the Askey-Wilson operator.
