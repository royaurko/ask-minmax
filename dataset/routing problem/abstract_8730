The problem of determining nonlinear neutral inclusions in (electrical or
thermal)conductivity is considered. Neutral inclusions, inserted in a matrix
containing a uniform applied electric field, do not disturb the field outside
the inclusions. The well known Hashin coated sphere construction is an example
of a neutral inclusion. In this paper, we consider the problem of constructing
neutral inclusions from nonlinear materials. In particular, we discuss
assemblages of coated ellipsoids.
