The linear eigenvalue problem governing the stability of the mechanical
equilibrium of the fluid in a electrohydrodynamic (EHD) convection problem is
investigated. The analytical study is one of bifurcation. This allows us to
regain the expression of the neutral surface in the classical case. The method
used in the numerical study is a Galerkin type spectral method based on
polynomials and it provides good results.
