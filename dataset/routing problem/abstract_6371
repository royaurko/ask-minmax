The existing experimental evidence on the vector and axial-vector coupling
constants, $G_V$ and $G_A$, for neutron $\beta$-decay exhibits two prominent
problems: (i) the unitarity for the first row of the CKM matrix seems violated;
(ii) one obtains different values of $G_A/G_V$ according to whether one uses as
input the neutron lifetime or neutron-decay correlation observables. We show
that the in-medium modification of $G_A$ can influence both the inner and outer
radiative corrections used in deducing $G_V$ from the super-allowed Fermi
transitions and that this effect may resolve the long-standing problems (i) and
(ii) simultaneously.
