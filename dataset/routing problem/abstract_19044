Although unbiasedness is a basic property of a good test, many tests on
vector parameters or scalar parameters against two-sided alternatives are not
finite-sample unbiased. This was already noticed by Sugiura [Ann. Inst.
Statist. Math. 17 (1965) 261--263]; he found an alternative against which the
Wilcoxon test is not unbiased. The problem is even more serious in multivariate
models. When testing the hypothesis against an alternative which fits well with
the experiment, it should be verified whether the power of the test under this
alternative cannot be smaller than the significance level. Surprisingly, this
serious problem is not frequently considered in the literature. The present
paper considers the two-sample multivariate testing problem. We construct
several rank tests which are finite-sample unbiased against a broad class of
location/scale alternatives and are finite-sample distribution-free under the
hypothesis and alternatives. Each of them is locally most powerful against a
specific alternative of the Lehmann type. Their powers against some
alternatives are numerically compared with each other and with other rank and
classical tests. The question of affine invariance of two-sample multivariate
tests is also discussed.
