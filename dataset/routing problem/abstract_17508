Let $\mathfrak{L}_1$, $\mathfrak{L}_2$, $\mathfrak{L}_3$ be finite
collections of $L_1$, $L_2$, $L_3$, respectively, lines in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and
$J(\mathfrak{L}_1, \mathfrak{L}_2,\mathfrak{L}_3)$ the set of multijoints
formed by them, i.e. the set of points $x \in \mathbb{R}^3$, each of which lies
in at least one line $l_i \in \mathfrak{L}_i$, for all $i=1,2,3$, such that the
directions of $l_1$, $l_2$ and $l_3$ span $\mathbb{R}^3$. We prove here that
$|J(\mathfrak{L}_1, \mathfrak{L}_2,\mathfrak{L}_3)|\lesssim (L_1L_2L_3)^{1/2}$,
and we extend our results to multijoints formed by real algebraic curves in
$\mathbb{R}^3$ of uniformly bounded degree, as well as by curves in
$\mathbb{R}^3$ parametrised by real univariate polynomials of uniformly bounded
degree. The multijoints problem is a variant of the joints problem, as well as
a discrete analogue of the endpoint multilinear Kakeya problem.
