In this paper we study the Hardy problem in R^N with N>2 and in a ball B of
R^N. Using a suitable map we transform the Hardy problem into another one
without the singular term. Then we obtain some bifurcation results from the
radial positive solutions corresponding to some explicit values of the
parameter lambda.
