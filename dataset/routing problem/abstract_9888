We consider partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with
{\omega}-regular conditions specified as parity objectives. The class of
{\omega}-regular languages extends regular languages to infinite strings and
provides a robust specification language to express all properties used in
verification, and parity objectives are canonical forms to express
{\omega}-regular conditions. The qualitative analysis problem given a POMDP and
a parity objective asks whether there is a strategy to ensure that the
objective is satis- fied with probability 1 (resp. positive probability). While
the qualitative analysis problems are known to be undecidable even for very
special cases of parity objectives, we establish decidability (with optimal
complexity) of the qualitative analysis problems for POMDPs with all parity
objectives under finite- memory strategies. We establish optimal (exponential)
memory bounds and EXPTIME-completeness of the qualitative analysis problems
under finite-memory strategies for POMDPs with parity objectives.
