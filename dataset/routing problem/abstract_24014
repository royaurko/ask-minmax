This contribution to the proceedings of the Cracow meeting on `Applications
of Random Matrix Theory' summarizes a series of studies, some old and others
more recent on financial applications of Random Matrix Theory (RMT). We first
review some early results in that field, with particular emphasis on the
applications of correlation cleaning to portfolio optimisation, and discuss the
extension of the Marcenko-Pastur (MP) distribution to a non trivial `true'
underlying correlation matrix. We then present new results concerning different
problems that arise in a financial context: (a) the generalisation of the MP
result to the case of an empirical correlation matrix (ECM) constructed using
exponential moving averages, for which we give a new elegant derivation (b) the
specific dynamics of the `market' eigenvalue and its associated eigenvector,
which defines an interesting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on the unit sphere and
(c) the problem of the dependence of ECM's on the observation frequency of the
returns and its interpretation in terms of lagged cross-influences.
