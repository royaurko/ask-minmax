We introduce a new extragradient iterative process, motivated and inspired by
[S. H. Khan, A Picard-Mann Hybrid Iterative Process, Fixed Point Theory and
Applications, doi:10.1186/1687-1812-2013-69], for finding a common element of
the set of fixed points of a nonexpansive mapping and the set of solutions of a
variational inequality for an inverse strongly monotone mapping in a Hilbert
space. Using this process, we prove a weak convergence theorem for the class of
nonexpansive mappings in Hilbert spaces. Finally, as an application, we give
some theorems by using resolvent operator and strictly pseudocontractive
mapping.
