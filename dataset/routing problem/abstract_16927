The flexible profile approach proposed earlier to create CTM (compact or
reduced order thermal models) is extended to cover the area of conjugate heat
transfer. The flexible profile approach is a methodology that allows building a
highly boundary conditions independent CTM, with any desired degree of
accuracy, that may adequately replace detailed 3D models for the whole spectrum
of applications in which the modeled object may be used. The extension to
conjugate problems radically solves the problem of interfacing two different
domains. Each domain, fluid or solid, can be "compacted" independently creating
two CTM that can be joined together to produce reliable results for any
arbitrary set of external boundary conditions.
