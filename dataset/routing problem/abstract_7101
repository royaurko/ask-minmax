This paper is contributed to study the Cauchy problem of a new integrable
two-component system with peaked soliton (peakon) and weak kink solutions. We
first establish the local well-posedness result for the Cauchy problem in Besov
spaces, and then present a precise blow-up scenario and a new blow-up result
for strong solutions to the system.
