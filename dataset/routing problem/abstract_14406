The determination of the normal and transverse (frictional) inter-particle
forces within a granular medium is a long standing, taunting, and yet
unresolved problem. We present a new formalism which employs the knowledge of
the external forces and the orientations of contacts between particles (of any
given sizes), to compute all the inter-particle forces. Having solved this
problem we exemplify the efficacy of the formalism showing that the force
chains in such systems are determined by an expansion in the eigenfunctions of
a newly defined operator.
