Lattice QCD at finite density suffers from a severe sign problem, which has
so far prohibited simulations of the cold and dense regime. Here we study the
onset of nuclear matter employing a three-dimensional effective theory derived
by combined strong coupling and hopping expansions, which is valid for heavy
but dynamical quarks and has a mild sign problem only. Its numerical
evaluations agree between a standard Metropolis and complex Langevin algorithm,
where the latter is free of the sign problem. Our continuum extrapolated data
clearly show a first order phase transition building up at $\mu_B \approx m_B$
as the temperature approaches zero. An excellent description of the data is
achieved by an analytic solution in the strong coupling limit.
