In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 3423 (2001)] D.C. Hong, P.V. Quinn
and S. Luding investigated the Brazil nut problem and the reverse Brazil nut
problem at fixed temperature. A new condensation versus percolation driven
segregation mechanism was put forward, which has attracted much attention in
the press. The proposed mechanism is incorrect.
