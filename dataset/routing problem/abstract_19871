Recent observations of variability in the ``atmospheric neutrino'' rate place
constraints on possible explanations of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly. Many
proposed solutions to the problem are static and can not be adapted to the
temporal dependence observed. Nonatmospheric sources may be needed to explain
the variations.
