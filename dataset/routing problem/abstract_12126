We consider the following NP-hard problem: in a weighted graph, find a
minimum cost set of vertices whose removal leaves a graph in which no two
cycles share an edge. We obtain a constant-factor approximation algorithm,
based on the primal-dual method. Moreover, we show that the integrality gap of
the natural LP relaxation of the problem is \Theta(\log n), where n denotes the
number of vertices in the graph.
