Computing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a given Hermitian matrix is
arguably one of the most well-studied computational problems. In this study we
propose to add a new perspective on this problem that draws from the theory of
quasi-random sequences - a theory which has, to the best of our knowledge, been
unconnected to linear-algebra problems thus far. Following this perspective, we
design a new algorithm for computing all eigenvectors / eigenvalues of an n x n
Hermitian matrix, by Boolean circuits of size at most O(n^({\omega}+{\nu})) for
any {\nu} > 0. This closes the gap between the best known arithmetic
upper-bound on matrix diagonalization O(n^{\omega}), and the previously
best-known Boolean circuit size O(n^3). We believe this approach may improve
our knowledge of run-time, space-complexity and randomization complexity of all
major linear- algebraic computational problems.
