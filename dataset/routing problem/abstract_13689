This paper study the well--posedness of the entropy formulation given by
Plotnikov in [{Differential Equations}, 30 (1994), pp. 614--622] for
forward-backward parabolic problem obtained as singular limit of a proper
pseudoparabolic approximation. It was proved in [C. Mascia, A. Terracina, and
A. Tesei, {Arch.\ Ration.\ Mech.\ Anal.}, 194 (2009), pp. 887--925] that such
formulation gives uniqueness when the solution takes values in the stable
phases. Here we consider the situation in which unstable phase is taken in
account, proving that, in general, uniqueness does not hold.
