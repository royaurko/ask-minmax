The involvement of uncertainty of varying degrees when the total of the
membership degree exceeds one or less than one, then the newer mathematical
paradigm shift, Fuzzy Theory proves appropriate. For the past two or more
decades, Fuzzy Theory has become the potent tool to study and analyze
uncertainty involved in all problems. But, many real-world problems also abound
with the concept of indeterminacy. In this book, the new, powerful tool of
neutrosophy that deals with indeterminacy is utilized. Innovative neutrosophic
models are described. The theory of neutrosophic graphs is introduced and
applied to fuzzy and neutrosophic models. This book is organized into four
chapters. In Chapter One we introduce some of the basic neutrosophic algebraic
structures essential for the further development of the other chapters. Chapter
Two recalls basic graph theory definitions and results which has interested us
and for which we give the neutrosophic analogues. In this chapter we give the
application of graphs in fuzzy models. An entire section is devoted for this
purpose. Chapter Three introduces many new neutrosophic concepts in graphs and
applies it to the case of neutrosophic cognitive maps and neutrosophic
relational maps. The last section of this chapter clearly illustrates how the
neutrosophic graphs are utilized in the neutrosophic models. The final chapter
gives some problems about neutrosophic graphs which will make one understand
this new subject.
