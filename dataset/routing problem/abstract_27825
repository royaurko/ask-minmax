We study the problem of estimating a compact set $S\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ from
a trajectory of a reflected Brownian motion in $S$ with reflections on the
boundary of $S$. We establish consistency and rates of convergence for various
estimators of $S$ and its boundary. This problem has relevant applications in
ecology in estimating the home range of an animal based on tracking data. There
are a variety of studies on the habitat of animals that employ the notion of
home range. The most common technique is to determine the minimum convex
polygon (MCP), which is very restrictive regarding the shape of the habitat.
Our approach allows us to find more and more flexible regions close to reality,
as shown in some real data examples we provide.
