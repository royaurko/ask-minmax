We prove strong convergence of conforming finite element approximations to
the stationary Joule heating problem with mixed boundary conditions on
Lipschitz domains in three spatial dimensions. We show optimal global
regularity estimates on creased domains and prove a priori and a posteriori
bounds for shape regular meshes.
