We consider a weakly nonlinear solution of the Cauchy problem for the
regularised Boussinesq equation, which constitutes an extension of the
classical d'Alembert's formula for the linear wave equation. The solution is
given by a simple and explicit formula, expressed in terms of two special
functions solving the initial-value problems for two Korteweg-de Vries
equations. We test the formula by considering several examples with `exactly
solvable initial conditions' and their perturbations. Explicit analytical
solutions are compared with the results of direct numerical simulations.
