We prove that the model checking problem for the existential fragment of
first-order (FO) logic on partially ordered sets is fixed-parameter tractable
(FPT) with respect to the formula and the width of a poset (the maximum size of
an antichain). While there is a long line of research into FO model checking on
graphs, the study of this problem on posets has been initiated just recently by
Bova, Ganian and Szeider (CSL-LICS 2014), who proved that the existential
fragment of FO has an FPT algorithm for a poset of fixed width. We improve upon
their result in two ways: (1) the runtime of our algorithm is
$O(f(|{\phi}|,w)\cdot n^2)$ on n-element posets of width $w$, compared to
$O(g(|{\phi}|)\cdot n^{h(w)})$ of Bova et al., and (2) our proofs are simpler
and easier to follow. We complement this result by showing that, under a
certain complexity-theoretical assumption, the existential FO model checking
problem does not have a polynomial kernel.
