One of the puzzles of the Standard Model is why the mass parameter which
determines the scale of the Weak interactions is closer to the scale of QCD
than to the Grand Unification or Planck scales. We discuss a novel approach to
this problem which is possible in theories in which different regions of the
universe can have different values of the physical parameters. In such a
situation, we would naturally find ourselves in a region which has parameters
favorable for life. We explore the whole range of values of the mass parameter
in the Higgs potential, $\mu^2$, from $+M_P^2$ to $-M_P^2$ and find that there
is only a narrow window, overlapping with the observed value, in which life is
likely to be possible. The observed value of $\mu^2$ is fairly typical of the
values in this range. Thus multiple domain theories in which $\mu^2$ varies
among domains may give a promising approach to solving the fine tunign problem
and explaining the closeness of the QCD scale and the Weak scale.
