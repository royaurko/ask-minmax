The (non-initialized, non-deterministic) asynchronous systems (in the
input-output sense) are multi-valued functions from m-dimensional signals to
sets of n-dimensional signals, the concept being inspired by the modeling of
the asynchronous circuits. Our purpose is to state the problem of the their
stability.
