An anisotropic metallic phase dubbed electronic nematic phase bounded by two
consecutive metamagnetic transitions has been reported in the bilayer ruthenate
Sr3Ru2O7. It has also been shown that the nematic and the accompanying
metamagnetic transitions are driven by an effective momentum-dependent
quadrupole-type interaction. Here, we study the microscopic origin of such an
effective interaction. To elucidate the mechanism behind the spontaneous Fermi
surface distortion associated with the nematic, we identify a simple tight
binding model based on t2g orbitals, spin-orbit coupling and the rotation of
RuO6 octahedra as starting point, consistent with the Fermi surface obtained
from recent angle-resolved photoemission data. Within an extended Hubbard model
the nematic state, characterized by an anisotropy between the bands near $(\pm
\pi,0)$ and $(0,\pm \pi)$, then strongly competes with ferromagnetic order but
pre-empts it via a finite nearest neighbor interaction. We discuss experimental
means to confirm our proposal.
