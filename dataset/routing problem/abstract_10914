Recent measurements of the CR antiproton flux have been shown to pose a
problem for conventional propagation models. In particular, models consistent
with secondary/primary nuclei ratio in CR produce too few antiprotons, while
matching the ratio and the antiproton flux requires ad hoc assumptions. This
may indicate an additional local CR component or new phenomena in CR
propagation in the Galaxy. We discuss several possibilities which may cause
this problem.
