An induced matching $M$ in a graph $G$ is dominating if every edge not in $M$
shares exactly one vertex with an edge in $M$. The dominating induced matching
problem (also known as efficient edge domination) asks whether a graph $G$
contains a dominating induced matching. This problem is generally NP-complete,
but polynomial-time solvable for graphs with some special properties. In
particular, it is solvable in polynomial time for claw-free graphs. In the
present paper, we study this problem for graphs containing no long claw, i.e.
no induced subgraph obtained from the claw by subdividing each of its edges
exactly once. To solve the problem in this class, we reduce it to the following
question: given a graph $G$ and a subset of its vertices, does $G$ contain a
matching saturating all vertices of the subset? We show that this question can
be answered in polynomial time, thus providing a polynomial-time algorithm to
solve the dominating induced matching problem for graphs containing no long
claw.
