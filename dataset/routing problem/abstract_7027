We study the evolution of the interface given by two incompressible fluids
with different densities in the porous strip $\RR\times[-l,l]$. This problem is
known as the Muskat problem and is analogous to the two phase Hele-Shaw cell.
The main goal of this paper is to compare the qualitative properties between
the model when the fluids move without boundaries and the model when the fluids
are confined. We find that, in a precise sense, the boundaries decrease the
diffusion rate and the system becomes more singular.
