We introduce a notion of viscosity solutions for the two-phase Stefan
problem, which incorporates possible existence of a mushy region generated by
the initial data. We show that a comparison principle holds between viscosity
solutions, and investigate the coincidence of the viscosity solutions and the
weak solutions defined via integration by parts. In particular, in the absence
of initial mushy region, viscosity solution is the unique weak solution with
the same boundary data.
