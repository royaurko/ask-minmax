Interaction graphs provide an important qualitative modeling approach for
System Biology. This paper presents a novel approach for construction of
interaction graph with the help of Boolean function decomposition. Each
decomposition part (Consisting of 2-bits) of the Boolean functions has some
important significance. In the dynamics of a biological system, each variable
or node is nothing but gene or protein. Their regulation has been explored in
terms of interaction graphs which are generated by Boolean functions. In this
paper, different classes of Boolean functions with regards to Interaction Graph
with biologically significant properties have been adumbrated.
