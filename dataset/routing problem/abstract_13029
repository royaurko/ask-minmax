We consider the problem of strong existence and uniqueness of a Brownian
motion forced to stay in the quadrant by an electrostatic repulsion from the
sides that works obliquely. The results are reminiscent of the study of a
Brownian motion with oblique reflection in a wedge. Actually, the same skew
symmetry condition is involved when looking for a stationary distribution in
product form. the terms of the product are now gamma distributions in place of
exponential ones. An associate purely deterministic problem is also considered.
