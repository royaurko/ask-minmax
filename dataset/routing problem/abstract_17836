Mixed-symmetry arbitrary spin massive, massless, and self-dual massive fields
in AdS(5) are studied. Light-cone gauge actions for such fields leading to
decoupled equations of motion are constructed. Light-cone gauge formulation of
mixed-symmetry anomalous conformal currents and shadows in 4d flat space is
also developed. AdS/CFT correspondence for normalizable and non-normalizable
modes of mixed-symmetry AdS fields and the respective boundary mixed-symmetry
anomalous conformal currents and shadows is studied. We demonstrate that the
light-cone gauge action for massive mixed-symmetry AdS field evaluated on
solution of the Dirichlet problem amounts to the light-cone gauge 2-point
vertex of mixed-symmetry anomalous shadow. Also we show that UV divergence of
the action for mixed-symmetry massive AdS field with some particular value of
mass parameter evaluated on the Dirichlet problem amounts to the action of long
mixed-symmetry conformal field, while UV divergence of the action for
mixed-symmetry massless AdS field evaluated on the Dirichlet problem amounts to
the action of short mixed-symmetry conformal field. We speculate on string
theory interpretation of a model which involves short low-spin conformal fields
and long higher-spin conformal fields.
