In this work, we propose a mixed finite element method for solving elliptic
multiscale problems based on a localized orthogonal decomposition (LOD) of
Raviart-Thomas finite element spaces. It requires to solve local problems in
small patches around the elements of a coarse grid. These computations can be
perfectly parallelized and are cheap to perform. Using the results of these
patch problems, we construct a low dimensional multiscale mixed finite element
space with very high approximation properties. This space can be used for
solving the original saddle point problem in an efficient way. We prove
convergence of our approach, independent of structural assumptions or scale
separation. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our method by
presenting a variety of numerical experiments, including a comparison with an
MsFEM approach.
