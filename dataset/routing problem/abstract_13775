The idea of monotonicity (or positive-definiteness in the linear case) is
shown to be the central theme of the solution theories associated with problems
of mathematical physics. A "grand unified" setting is surveyed covering a
comprehensive class of such problems. We elaborate the applicability of our
scheme with a number examples. A brief discussion of stability and
homogenization issues is also provided.
