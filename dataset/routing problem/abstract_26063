Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture allows for sharp estimates on the rank
of certain abelian varieties defined over $ \Q$. in the case of the jacobian of
the modular curves, this problem is equivalent to the estimation of the order
of vanishing at 1/2 of $L$-functions of classical modular forms, and was
treated, without assuming the Riemann hypothesis, by Kowalski, Michel and
VanderKam. The purpose of this paper is to extend this approach in the case of
an arbitrary totally real field, which necessitates an appeal of
Jacquet-Langlands' theory and the adelization of the problem. To show that the
$L$-function (resp. its derivative) of a positive density of forms does not
vanish at 1/2, we follow Selberg's method of mollified moments (Iwaniec,
Sarnak, Kowalski, Michel and VanderKam among others applied it successfully in
the case of classical modular forms). We generalize the Petersson formula, and
use it to estimate the first two harmonic moments, this then allows us to match
the same unconditional densities as the ones proved over $\Q$ by Kowalski,
Michel and VanderKam. In this setting, there is an additional term, coming from
old forms, to control. Finally we convert our estimates for the harmonic
moments into ones for the natural moments.
