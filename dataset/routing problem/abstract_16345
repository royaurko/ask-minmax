Let $\psi$ be a given function defined on a Riemannian space. Under what
conditions does there exist a compact starshaped hypersurface $M$ for which
$\psi$, when evaluated on $M$, coincides with the $m-$th elementary symmetric
function of principal curvatures of $M$ for a given $m$? The corresponding
existence and uniqueness problems in Euclidean space have been investigated by
several contributors in the mid 1980's. Recently, conditions for existence were
established in elliptic space and, most recently, for hyperbolic space.
However, the uniqueness problem has remained open. In this paper we investigate
the problem of uniqueness in hyperbolic space and show that uniqueness (up to a
geometrically trivial transformation) holds under the same conditions under
which existence was established.
