It is well known that the Prandtl boundary layer equation is instable, and
the well-posedness in Sobolev space for the Cauchy problem is an open problem.
Recently, under the Oleinik's monotonicity assumption for the initial datum,
[1] have proved the local well-posedness of Cauchy problem in Sobolev space
(see also [21]). In this work, we study the Gevrey smoothing effects of the
local solution obtained in [1]. We prove that the Sobolev's class solution
belongs to some Gevrey class with respect to tangential variables at any
positive time.
