We consider the rigorous derivation of asymptotic formulas for
initial-boundary value problems using the nonlinear steepest descent method. We
give detailed derivations of the asymptotics in the similarity and self-similar
sectors for the mKdV equation in the quarter plane. Precise and uniform error
estimates are presented in detail.
