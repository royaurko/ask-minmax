The Painleve first equation can be represented as the equation of
isomonodromic deformation of a Schrodinger equation with a cubic potential. We
introduce a new algorithm for computing the direct monodromy problem for this
Schrodinger equation. The algorithm is based on the geometric theory of
Schrodinger equation due to Nevanlinna
