In this paper, we deal with a two-queue polling system attended by a single
server. The server visits the queues according to a Markovian routing mechnism.
There are two-class customers in the first queue. Customers of each queue are
served in the exhaustive discipline. For this model, we study the joint number
of customers, the cycle time and the waiting times. we are also devoted to
deriving the exact asymptotics for the scaled delay in the heavy-traffic
scenario. In addition, the scaled delays with large switch-over times are
discussed for the first time in the Markovian polling systems. Finally, we
provide some simulations to surpport the asymptotic results.
