We study the problem of bounding the number of cusps of a complex hyperbolic
manifold in terms of its volume. Applying algebro-geometric methods using
Mumford's work on toroidal compactifications and its generalization due to N.
Mok and W.-K. To, we get a bound which is considerably better than those
obtained previously by methods of geometric topology.
