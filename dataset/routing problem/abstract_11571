The well-studied local postage stamp problem (LPSP) is the following: given a
positive integer k, a set of postive integers 1 = a1 < a2 < ... < ak and an
integer h >= 1, what is the smallest positive integer which cannot be
represented as a linear combination x1 a1 + ... + xk ak where x1 + ... + xk <=
h and each xi is a non-negative integer? In this note we prove that LPSP is
NP-hard under Turing reductions, but can be solved in polynomial time if k is
fixed.
