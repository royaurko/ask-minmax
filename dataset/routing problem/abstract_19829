We discuss the hierarchy problem and the corresponding quadratic divergences
in the top mode Standard Model. Quadratic divergences appear at each order
1/N_c since fermionic and bosonic contributions are of different order 1/N_c.
It is shown that the full dynamical system to all orders in 1/N_c admits a
solution, where the sum of all quadratic divergent contributions disappears.
