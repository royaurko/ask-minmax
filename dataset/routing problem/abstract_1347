This article reviews several recently developed Lagrangian tools and shows
how their combined use succeeds in obtaining a detailed description of purely
advective transport events in general aperiodic flows. In particular, because
of the climate impact of ocean transport processes, we illustrate a 2D
application on altimeter data sets over the area of the Kuroshio Current,
although the proposed techniques are general and applicable to arbitrary time
dependent aperiodic flows. The first challenge for describing transport in
aperiodical time dependent flows is obtaining a representation of the phase
portrait where the most relevant dynamical features may be identified. This
representation is accomplished by using global Lagrangian descriptors that when
applied for instance to the altimeter data sets retrieve over the ocean surface
a phase portrait where the geometry of interconnected dynamical systems is
visible. The phase portrait picture is essential because it evinces which
transport routes are acting on the whole flow. Once these routes are roughly
recognised it is possible to complete a detailed description by the direct
computation of the finite time stable and unstable manifolds of special
hyperbolic trajectories that act as organising centres of the flow.
