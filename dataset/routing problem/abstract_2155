In the beginning stage, face verification is done using easy method of
geometric algorithm models, but the verification route has now developed into a
scientific progress of complicated geometric representation and identical
procedure. In recent years the technologies have boosted face recognition
system into the healthy focus. Researchers currently undergoing strong research
on finding face recognition system for wider area information taken under
hysterical elucidation dissimilarity. The proposed face recognition system
consists of a narrative expositionindiscreet preprocessing method, a hybrid
Fourier-based facial feature extraction and a score fusion scheme. We have
verified the face recognition in different lightening conditions (day or night)
and at different locations (indoor or outdoor). Preprocessing, Image detection,
Feature- extraction and Face recognition are the methods used for face
verification system. This paper focuses mainly on the issue of toughness to
lighting variations. The proposed system has obtained an average of 88.1%
verification rate on Two-Dimensional images under different lightening
conditions.
