Totally symmetric arbitrary spin massless and massive fields in AdS space are
studied. For such fields, we obtain Lagrangians which are invariant under
global BRST transformations. The Lagrangians are used for computation of
partition functions and effective actions. We demonstrate that BRST invariant
bulk action for massless field evaluated on the solution of Dirichlet problem
for gauge massless fields and Faddeev-Popov fields leads to BRST invariant
effective action for canonical shadow gauge fields and shadow Faddeev-Popov
fields, while the BRST invariant bulk action for massive field evaluated on the
solution of Dirichlet problem for gauge massive fields and Faddeev-Popov fields
leads to BRST invariant effective action for anomalous shadow gauge fields and
shadow Faddeev-Popov fields. The leading logarithmic divergence of the
regularized effective action for the canonical shadow field leads to simple
BRST invariant action of conformal field. We demonstrate that the
Nakanishi-Laudrup fields entering the BRST invariant Lagrangian of conformal
field can geometrically be interpreted as boundary values of massless AdS
fields.
