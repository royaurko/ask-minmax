We address the problem of reconstructing a multi-band signal from its
sub-Nyquist point-wise samples. To date, all reconstruction methods proposed
for this class of signals assumed knowledge of the band locations. In this
paper, we develop a non-linear blind perfect reconstruction scheme for
multi-band signals which does not require the band locations. Our approach
assumes an existing blind multi-coset sampling method. The sparse structure of
multi-band signals in the continuous frequency domain is used to replace the
continuous reconstruction with a single finite dimensional problem without the
need for discretization. The resulting problem can be formulated within the
framework of compressed sensing, and thus can be solved efficiently using known
tractable algorithms from this emerging area. We also develop a theoretical
lower bound on the average sampling rate required for blind signal
reconstruction, which is twice the minimal rate of known-spectrum recovery. Our
method ensures perfect reconstruction for a wide class of signals sampled at
the minimal rate. Numerical experiments are presented demonstrating blind
sampling and reconstruction with minimal sampling rate.
