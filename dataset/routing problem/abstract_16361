We review a minimum set of notions from our previous paper on structural
properties of SAT at arXiv:0802.1790 that will allow us to define and discuss
the "complete internal independence" of a decision problem. This property is
strictly stronger than the independence property that was called "strong
internal independence" in cited paper. We show that SAT exhibits this property.
We argue that this form of independence of a decision problem is the strongest
possible for a problem. By relying upon this maximally strong form of internal
independence, we reformulate in more strict terms the informal remarks on
possible exponentiality of SAT that concluded our previous paper. The net
result of that reformulation is a hint for a proof for SAT being exponential.
We conjecture that a complete proof of that proposition can be obtained by
strictly following the line of given hint of proof.
