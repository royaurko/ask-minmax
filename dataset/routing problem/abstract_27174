We study the complexity of algorithmic problems for matrices that are
represented by multi-terminal decision diagrams (MTDD). These are a variant of
ordered decision diagrams, where the terminal nodes are labeled with arbitrary
elements of a semiring (instead of 0 and 1). A simple example shows that the
product of two MTDD-represented matrices cannot be represented by an MTDD of
polynomial size. To overcome this deficiency, we extended MTDDs to MTDD_+ by
allowing componentwise symbolic addition of variables (of the same dimension)
in rules. It is shown that accessing an entry, equality checking, matrix
multiplication, and other basic matrix operations can be solved in polynomial
time for MTDD_+-represented matrices. On the other hand, testing whether the
determinant of a MTDD-represented matrix vanishes PSPACE$-complete, and the
same problem is NP-complete for MTDD_+-represented diagonal matrices. Computing
a specific entry in a product of MTDD-represented matrices is #P-complete.
