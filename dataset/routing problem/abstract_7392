Robot localization is a one of the most important problems in robotics. Most
of the existing approaches assume that the map of the environment is available
beforehand and focus on accurate metrical localization. In this paper, we
address the localization problem when the map of the environment is not present
beforehand, and the robot relies on a hand-drawn map from a non-expert user. We
addressed this problem by expressing the robot pose in the pixel coordinate and
simultaneously estimate a local deformation of the hand-drawn map. Experiments
show that we are able to localize the robot in the correct room with a
robustness up to 80%
