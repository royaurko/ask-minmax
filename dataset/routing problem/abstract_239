This paper introduces relevant statistics for the description of routes in
the internet, seen as a graph at the interface level. Based on the observed
properties, we propose and evaluate methods for generating artificial routes
suitable for simulation purposes. The work in this paper is based upon a study
of over seven million route traces produced by CAIDA's skitter infrastructure.
