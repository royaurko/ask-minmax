Analytic treatment of a non-equilibrium random system with large degrees of
freedoms is one of most important problems of physics. However, little research
has been done on this problem as far as we know. In this paper, we propose a
new mean field theory that can treat a general class of a non-equilibrium
random system. We apply the present theory to an analysis for an associative
memory with oscillatory elements, which is a well-known typical random system
with large degrees of freedoms.
