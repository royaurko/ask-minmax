We study the characterization of multipartite entanglement for the random
states of an $n$-qbit system. Unable to solve the problem exactly we generalize
it, changing complex numbers into real vectors with $N_c$ components (the
original problem is recovered for $N_c=2$). Studying the leading diagrams in
the large-$N_c$ approximation, we unearth the presence of a phase transition
and, in an explicit example, show that the so-called entanglement frustration
disappears in the large-$N_c$ limit.
