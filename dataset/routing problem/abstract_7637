Our aim is to study the Ulam's problem for Cauchy's functional equations.
First, we present some new results about the superstability and stability of
Cauchy exponential functional equation and its Pexiderized for class functions
on commutative semigroup to unitary complex Banach algebra. In connection with
the problem of Th. M. Rassias and our results, we generalize the theorem of
Baker and theorem of L. Sze'kelyhidi. Then the superstability of Cauchy
additive functional equation can be prove for complex valued functions on
commutative semigroup under some suitable conditions. This result is applied to
the study of a superstability result for the logarithmic functional equation,
and to give a partial affirmative answer to problem 18, in the thirty-first
ISFE. The hyperstability and asymptotic behaviors of Cauchy additive functional
equation and its Pexiderized can be study for functions on commutative
semigroup to a complex normed linear space under some suitable conditions. As
some consequences of our results, we give some generalizations of Skof's
theorem, S.-M. Joung's theorem, and another affirmative answer to problem 18,
in the thirty-first ISFE. Also we study the stability of Cauchy linear equation
in general form and in connection with the problem of G. L. Forti, in the 13th
ICFEI (2009), we consider some systems of homogeneous linear equations and our
aim is to establish some common Hyers-Ulam-Rassias stability for these systems
of functional equations and presenting some applications of these results.
