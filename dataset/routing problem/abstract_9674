This paper is concerned with the derivation of computable and guaranteed
upper bounds of the difference between the exact and the approximate solution
of an exterior domain boundary value problem for a linear elliptic equation.
Our analysis is based upon purely functional argumentation and does not attract
specific properties of an approximation method. Therefore, the estimates
derived in the paper at hand are applicable to any approximate solution that
belongs to the corresponding energy space. Such estimates (also called error
majorants of the functional type) have been derived earlier for problems in
bounded domains.
