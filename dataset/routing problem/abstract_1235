In rotor-router aggregation on the square lattice Z^2, particles starting at
the origin perform deterministic analogues of random walks until reaching an
unoccupied site. The limiting shape of the cluster of occupied sites is a disk.
We consider a small change to the routing mechanism for sites on the x- and
y-axes, resulting in a limiting shape which is a diamond instead of a disk. We
show that for a certain choice of initial rotors, the occupied cluster grows as
a perfect diamond.
