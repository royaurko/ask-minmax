We prove the existence of a principal eigenvalue associated to the
$\infty$-Laplacian plus lower order terms and the Neumann boundary condition in
a bounded smooth domain. As an application we get uniqueness and existence
results for the Neumann problem and a decay estimate for viscosity solutions of
the Neumann evolution problem.
