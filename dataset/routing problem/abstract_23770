We study the theory of scattering for a Schr"odinger equation in an external
time dependent magnetic field in the Coulomb gauge, in space dimension 3. The
magnetic vector potential is assumed to satisfy decay properties in time that
are typical of solutions of the free wave equation, and even in some cases to
be actually a solution of that equation. That problem appears as an
intermediate step in the theory of scattering for the Maxwell-Schr"odinger (MS)
system. We prove in particular the existence of wave operators and their
asymptotic completeness in spaces of relatively low regularity. We also prove
their existence or at least results going in that direction in spaces of higher
regularity. The latter results are relevant for the MS system. As a preliminary
step, we study the Cauchy problem for the original equation by energy methods,
using as far as possible time derivatives instead of spaces derivatives.
