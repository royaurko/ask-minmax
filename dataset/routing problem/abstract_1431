The process of stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) provides a
possible route for the generation of a coherent molecular Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) from an atomic BEC. We analyze this process in a
three-dimensional mean-field theory, including atom-atom interactions and
non-resonant intermediate levels. We find that the process is feasible, but at
larger Rabi frequencies than anticipated from a crude single-mode lossless
analysis, due to two-photon dephasing caused by the atomic interactions. We
then identify optimal strategies in STIRAP allowing one to maintain high
conversion efficiencies with smaller Rabi frequencies and under experimentally
less demanding conditions.
