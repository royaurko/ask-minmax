The principle underlying this paper is the basic observation that the problem
of simultaneously solving a large class of composite monotone inclusions and
their duals can be reduced to that of finding a zero of the sum of a maximally
monotone operator and a linear skew-adjoint operator. An algorithmic framework
is developed for solving this generic problem in a Hilbert space setting. New
primal-dual splitting algorithms are derived from this framework for inclusions
involving composite monotone operators, and convergence results are
established. These algorithms draw their simplicity and efficacy from the fact
that they operate in a fully decomposed fashion in the sense that the monotone
operators and the linear transformations involved are activated separately at
each iteration. Comparisons with existing methods are made and applications to
composite variational problems are demonstrated.
