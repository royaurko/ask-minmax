This article is dedicated to the centenary of the local CR equivalence
problem, formulated by Henri Poincar\'{e} in 1907. The first part gives an
account of Poincar\'{e}'s heuristic counting arguments, suggesting existence of
infinitely many local CR invariants. Then we sketch the beautiful completion of
Poincar\'{e}'s approach to the problem in the work of Chern and Moser on Levi
nondegenerate hypersurfaces. The last part is an overview of recent progress in
solving the problem on Levi degenerate manifolds.
