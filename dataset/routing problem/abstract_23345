An effective one-loop action built from the soliton field itself for the
two-dimensional (2D) problem of soliton pair creation is proposed. The action
consists of the usual mass term and a kinetic term in which the simple
derivative of the soliton field is replaced by a covariant derivative. In this
effective action the soliton charge is treated no longer as a topological
charge but as a Noether charge. Using this effective one-loop action, the
soliton-antisoliton pair production rate is calculated and one recovers Stone's
exponential factor and the prefactor of Kiselev, Selivanov and Voloshin. The
results are also valid straightforwardly to the problem of pair creation rate
of domain walls in dimensions greater than 2.
