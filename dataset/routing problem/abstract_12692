We provide a new method for treating free boundary problems in perfect
fluids, and prove local-in-time well-posedness in Sobolev spaces for the
free-surface incompressible 3D Euler equations with or without surface tension
for arbitrary initial data, and without any irrotationality assumption on the
fluid. This is a free boundary problem for the motion of an incompressible
perfect liquid in vacuum, wherein the motion of the fluid interacts with the
motion of the free-surface at highest-order.
