We report on the possibility to use dark matter particle's mass and its cross
section as a smoking gun signal of the existence of a Big Bounce at the early
stage in the evolution of our currently observed universe. A model independent
study of dark matter production in the pre-bounce contraction and the
post-bounce expansion epochs of the bounce universe reveals a new venue for
achieving the observed relic abundance of our present universe, in which a
significantly smaller amount of dark matter with a smaller cross section -- as
compared to the prediction of Standard Cosmology -- is produced and carries the
information about the bounce universe evolution. Once the values of dark matter
mass and cross section are obtained by direct detection in laboratories, this
alternative route becomes a signature of the bounce universe scenario.
