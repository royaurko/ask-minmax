In this paper, we propose a discretization for the (nonlinearized)
compressible Stokes problem with a linear equation of state $\rho=p$, based on
Crouzeix-Raviart elements. The approximation of the momentum balance is
obtained by usual finite element techniques. Since the pressure is piecewise
constant, the discrete mass balance takes the form of a finite volume scheme,
in which we introduce an upwinding of the density, together with two additional
stabilization terms. We prove {\em a priori} estimates for the discrete
solution, which yields its existence by a topological degree argument, and then
the convergence of the scheme to a solution of the continuous problem.
