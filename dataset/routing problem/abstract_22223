In this work we study the problem of rope sway dynamics control for elevator
systems. We choose to actuate the system with a semi-active damper mounted on
the top of the elevator car. We propose nonlinear controllers based on Lyapunov
theory, to actuate the semi-active damper and stabilize the rope sway dynamics.
We study the stability of the proposed controllers, and test their performances
on a numerical example.
