In supersymmetric grand unified theories, the gauge hierarchy achieved by a
fine-tuning in the superpotential can be violated in the presence of soft
breaking terms. We examine this problem in Einstein supergravity with
hidden-sector supersymmetry breaking. We show that the hierarchy is preserved
if couplings of the hidden sector to visible-sector fields in the
superpotential satisfy a certain requirement.
