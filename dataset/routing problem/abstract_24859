We study a stochastic game where one player tries to find a strategy such
that the state process reaches a target of controlled-loss-type, no matter
which action is chosen by the other player. We provide, in a general setup, a
relaxed geometric dynamic programming principle for this problem and derive,
for the case of a controlled SDE, the corresponding dynamic programming
equation in the sense of viscosity solutions. As an example, we consider a
problem of partial hedging under Knightian uncertainty.
