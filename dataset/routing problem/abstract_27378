A new method is proposed for variable screening, variable selection and
prediction in linear regression problems where the number of predictors can be
much larger than the number of observations. The method involves minimizing a
penalized Euclidean distance, where the penalty is the geometric mean of the
$\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms of the regression coefficients. This particular
formulation exhibits a grouping effect, which is useful for screening out
predictors in higher or ultra-high dimensional problems. Also, an important
result is a signal recovery theorem, which does not require an estimate of the
noise standard deviation. Practical performances of variable selection and
prediction are evaluated through simulation studies and the analysis of a
dataset of mass spectrometry scans from melanoma patients, where excellent
predictive performance is obtained.
