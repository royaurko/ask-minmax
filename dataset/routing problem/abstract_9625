In this paper we introduce an iterative Jacobi algorithm for solving
distributed model predictive control (DMPC) problems, with linear coupled
dynamics and convex coupled constraints. The algorithm guarantees stability and
persistent feasibility, and we provide a localized procedure for constructing
an initial feasible solution by constraint tightening. Moreover, we show that
the solution of the iterative process converges to the centralized MPC
solution. The proposed iterative approach involves solving local optimization
problems consisting of only few subsystems, depending on the choice of the
designer and the sparsity of dynamical and constraint couplings. The gain in
the overall computational load compared to the centralized problem is balanced
by the increased communication requirements. This makes our approach more
applicable to situations where the number of subsystems is large, the coupling
is sparse, and local communication is relatively fast and cheap. A numerical
example illustrates the effects of the local problem size, and the number of
iterations on convergence to the centralized solution.
