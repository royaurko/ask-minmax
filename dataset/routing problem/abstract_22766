The Periodic Anderson Model (PAM) can be studied in the infinite U limit by
employing the Hubbard X operators to project out the unwanted states. We have
already studied this problem employing the cumulant expansion with the
hybridization as perturbation, but the probability conservation of the local
states (completeness) is not usually satisfied when partial expansions like the
Chain Approximation (CHA) are employed. Here we treat the problem by a
technique inspired in the mean field approximation of Coleman's slave-bosons
method, and we obtain a description that avoids the unwanted phase transition
that appears in the mean-field slave-boson method both when the chemical
potential is greater than the localized level Ef at low temperatures (T) and
for all parameters at intermediate T.
