In practical data integration systems, it is common for the data sources
being integrated to provide conflicting information about the same entity.
Consequently, a major challenge for data integration is to derive the most
complete and accurate integrated records from diverse and sometimes conflicting
sources. We term this challenge the truth finding problem. We observe that some
sources are generally more reliable than others, and therefore a good model of
source quality is the key to solving the truth finding problem. In this work,
we propose a probabilistic graphical model that can automatically infer true
records and source quality without any supervision. In contrast to previous
methods, our principled approach leverages a generative process of two types of
errors (false positive and false negative) by modeling two different aspects of
source quality. In so doing, ours is also the first approach designed to merge
multi-valued attribute types. Our method is scalable, due to an efficient
sampling-based inference algorithm that needs very few iterations in practice
and enjoys linear time complexity, with an even faster incremental variant.
Experiments on two real world datasets show that our new method outperforms
existing state-of-the-art approaches to the truth finding problem.
