Customer care in technical domains is increasingly based on e-mail
communication, allowing for the reproduction of approved solutions. Identifying
the customer's problem is often time-consuming, as the problem space changes if
new products are launched. This paper describes a new approach to the
classification of e-mail requests based on shallow text processing and machine
learning techniques. It is implemented within an assistance system for call
center agents that is used in a commercial setting.
