The most challenging problem in the implementation of the so-called
\textit{unified transform} to the analysis of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equation on the half-line is the characterization of the unknown boundary value
in terms of the given initial and boundary conditions. For the so-called
\textit{linearizable} boundary conditions this problem can be solved
explicitly. Furthermore, for non-linearizable boundary conditions which decay
for large $t$, this problem can be largely bypassed in the sense that the
unified transform yields useful asymptotic information for the large $t$
behavior of the solution. However, for the physically important case of
periodic boundary conditions it is necessary to characterize the unknown
boundary value. Here, we first present a perturbative scheme which can be used
to compute explicitly the asymptotic form of the Neumann boundary value in
terms of the given $\tau$-periodic Dirichlet datum to any given order in a
perturbation expansion. We then discuss briefly an extension of the pioneering
results of Boutet de Monvel and co-contributors which suggests that if the Dirichlet
datum belongs to a large class of particular $\tau$-periodic functions, which
includes $\{a \exp(i \omega t) \, | \, a>0, \, \omega \geq a^2\}$, then the
large $t$ behavior of the Neumann value is given by a $\tau$-periodic function
which can be computed explicitly.
