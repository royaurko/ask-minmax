Given a graph G and integers b and w. The black-and-white coloring problem
asks if there exist disjoint sets of vertices B and W with |B|=b and |W|=w such
that no vertex in B is adjacent to any vertex in W. In this paper we show that
the problem is polynomial when restricted to cographs, distance-hereditary
graphs, interval graphs and strongly chordal graphs. We show that the problem
is NP-complete on splitgraphs.
