In this paper, a general algorithm is proposed for rate analysis and code
design of linear index coding problems. Specifically a solution for minimum
rank matrix completion problem over finite fields representing the linear index
coding problem is devised in order to find the optimum transmission rate given
vector length and size of the field. The new approach can be applied to both
scalar and vector linear index coding.
