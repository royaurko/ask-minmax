Adhoc networks are formed by intermediate nodes which agree to relay
traffic.The link between nodes is broken when a node rejects to relay traffic.
Various parameters like depreciation in the energy of a node, distance between
nodes and mobility of the nodes play a vital role in determining the nodes
rejection to relay traffic.The objective of this paper is to propose a novel
model that identifies the cooperative nodes forming stable routes at the route
discovery phase.The weight factor of the different parameters decides the
varied type of networks where the proposed model can be applied. Hence, an
Artificial Neural Network based nondeterministic generic predictive model is
proposed to identify the varied types of networks based on the weight
factor.This study has been substantiated by simulation using OMNET++ simulator.
We are sure that this paper will give a better solution to identify cooperative
nodes thereby improving the performance of the network.
