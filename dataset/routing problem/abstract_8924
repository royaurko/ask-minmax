We develop a framework to discuss stability of epigenetic states as first
exit problems in dynamical systems with noise. We consider in particular the
stability of the lysogenic state of the lambda prophage, which is known to
exhibit exceptionally large stability. The formalism defines a quantative
measure of robustness of inherited states.
  In contrast to Kramers' well-known problem of escape from a potential well,
the stability of inherited states in our formulation is not a numerically
trivial problem. The most likely exit path does not go along a steepest decent
of a potential -- there is no potential. Instead, such a path can be described
as a zero-energy trajectory between two equilibria in an auxiliary classical
mechanical system. Finding it is similar to e.g. computing heteroclinic orbits
in celestial mechanics. The overall lesson of this study is that an examination
of equilibria and their bifurcations with changing parameter values allow us to
quantify both the stability and the robustness of particular states of a
genetic control system.
