By using Moreau's decomposition theorem for projecting onto cones, the
problem of projecting onto a simplicial cone is reduced to finding the unique
solution of a nonsmooth system of equations. It is shown that Picard's method
applied to the system of equations associated to the problem of projecting onto
a simplicial cone generates a sequence that converges linearly to the solution
of the system. Numerical experiments are presented making the comparison
between Picard's and semi-smooth Newton's methods to solve the nonsmooth system
associated with the problem of projecting a point onto a simplicial cone.
