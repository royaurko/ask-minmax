In this paper with two equivalent representations of the information
contained by a SAT formula, the reason why string generated by succinct SAT
formula can be greatly compressed is firstly presented based on Kolmogorov
complexity theory. Then what strings can be greatly compressed were classified
and discussed. The equivalence of computation and information was clearly
stated in succession. In the last the entropy of SAT problem was computed based
on universal probability. The experiment results showed the information gained
by solving SAT problem was quite likely exponentially increased.
