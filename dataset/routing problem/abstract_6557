The Behrens-Fisher problem concerns testing the equality of the means of two
normal populations with possibly different variances. The null hypothesis in
this problem induces a statistical model for which the likelihood function may
have more than one local maximum. We show that such multimodality contradicts
the null hypothesis in the sense that if this hypothesis is true then the
probability of multimodality converges to zero when both sample sizes tend to
infinity. Additional results include a finite-sample bound on the probability
of multimodality under the null and asymptotics for the probability of
multimodality under the alternative.
