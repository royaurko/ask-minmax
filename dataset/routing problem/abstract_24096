Using the nonlinear constraint and Darboux transformation methods, the
(m_1,...,m_N) localized solitons of the hyperbolic su(N) AKNS system are
constructed. Here "hyperbolic su(N)" means that the first part of the Lax pair
is F_y=JF_x+U(x,y,t)F where J is constant real diagonal and U^*=-U. When
different solitons move in different velocities, each component U_{ij} of the
solution U has at most m_i m_j peaks as t tends to infinity. This corresponds
to the (M,N) solitons for the DSI equation. When all the solitons move in the
same velocity, U_{ij} still has at most m_i m_j peaks if the phase differences
are large enough.
