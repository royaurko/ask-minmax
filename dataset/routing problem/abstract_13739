Scattering theory has had a major roll in twentieth century mathematical
physics. Mathematical modeling and algorithms of direct,- and inverse
electromagnetic scattering formulation due to biological tissues are
investigated. The algorithms are used for a model based illustration technique
within the microwave range. A number of methods is given to solve the inverse
electromagnetic scattering problem in which the nonlinear and ill-posed nature
of the problem are acknowledged.
