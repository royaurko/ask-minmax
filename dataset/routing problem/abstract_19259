The Gale-Shapley algorithm for the Stable Marriage Problem is known to take
$\Theta(n^2)$ steps to find a stable marriage in the worst case, but only
$\Theta(n \log n)$ steps in the average case (with $n$ women and $n$ men). In
1976, Knuth asked whether the worst-case running time can be improved in a
model of computation that does not require sequential access to the whole
input. A partial negative answer was given by Ng and Hirschberg, who showed
that $\Theta(n^2)$ queries are required in a model that allows certain natural
random-access queries to the participants' preferences. A significantly more
general - albeit slightly weaker - lower bound follows from Segal's elaborate
analysis of communication complexity, namely that $\Omega(n^2)$ Boolean queries
are required in order to find a stable marriage, regardless of the set of
allowed Boolean queries.
  Using a reduction to the communication complexity of the disjointness
problem, we give a far simpler, yet significantly more powerful argument
showing that $\Omega(n^2)$ Boolean queries of any type are indeed required.
Notably, unlike Segal's lower bound, our lower bound generalizes also to (A)
randomized algorithms, (B) finding approximately-stable marriages (C) verifying
the stability (or the approximate stability) of a proposed marriage, (D)
allowing arbitrary separate preprocessing of the women's preferences profile
and of the men's preferences profile, and (E) several variants of the basic
problem, such as whether a given pair is married in every/some stable marriage.
