Let $\mathfrak g$ be a classical Lie superalgebra of type I or a Cartan-type
Lie superalgebra {\bf W}$(n)$. We study weight $\mathfrak g$-modules using a
method inspired by Mathieu's classification of the simple weight modules with
finite weight multiplicities over reductive Lie algebras, \cite{M}. Our
approach is based on the fact that every simple weight $\mathfrak g$-module
with finite weight multiplicities is obtained via a composition of a twist and
localization from a highest weight module. This allows us to transfer many
results for category ${\cal O}$ modules to the category of weight modules with
finite weight multiplicities. As a main application of the method we reduce the
problems of finding a ${\mathfrak g}_0$-composition series and a character
formula for all simple weight modules to the same problems for simple highest
weight modules. In this way, using results of Serganova we obtain a character
formula for all simple weight {\bf W}$(n)$-modules and all simple atypical
nonsingular ${\mathfrak s}{\mathfrak l} (m|1)$-modules. Some of our results are
new already in the case of a classical reductive Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$.
