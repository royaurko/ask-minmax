Consider a system of n polynomial equations and r polynomial inequations in n
indeterminates of degree bounded by d with coefficients in a polynomial ring of
s parameters with rational coefficients of bit-size at most $\sigma$. From the
real viewpoint, solving such a system often means describing some
semi-algebraic sets in the parameter space over which the number of real
solutions of the considered parametric system is constant. Following the works
of Lazard and Rouillier, this can be done by the computation of a discriminant
variety. In this report we focus on the case where for a generic specialization
of the parameters the system of equations generates a radical zero-dimensional
ideal, which is usual in the applications. In this case, we provide a
deterministic method computing the minimal discriminant variety reducing the
problem to a problem of elimination. Moreover, we prove that the degree of the
computed minimal discriminant variety is bounded by $D:=(n+r)d^{(n+1)}$ and
that the complexity of our method is $\sigma^{\mathcal{O}(1)}
D^{\mathcal{O}(n+s)}$ bit-operations on a deterministic Turing machine.
