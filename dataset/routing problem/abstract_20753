In this paper, following the way opened by a previous paper deposited on
arXiv, we give an upper bound to the number of states for a hyperbolic cellular
automaton in the pentagrid. Indeed, we prove that there is a hyperbolic
cellular automaton which is rotation invariant and whose halting problem is
undecidable and which has 9~states.
