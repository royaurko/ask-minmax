In this work, we give a general class of solutions of the spinning cosmic
string in Einstein's theory of gravity. After treating same problem in Einstein
Cartan (EC) theory of gravity, the exact solution satisfying both exterior and
interior space-times representing a spin fluid moving along the symmetry axis
is presented in the EC theory. The existence of closed timelike curves in this
spacetime are also examined.
