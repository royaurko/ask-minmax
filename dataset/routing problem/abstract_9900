We provide representations of solutions to terminal value problems of
inhomogeneous Black-Scholes equations and studied such general properties as
min-max estimates, gradient estimates, monotonicity and convexity of the
solutions with respect to the stock price variable, which are important for
financial security pricing. In particular, we focus on finding representation
of the gradient (with respect to the stock price variable) of solutions to the
terminal value problems with discontinuous terminal payoffs or inhomogeneous
terms. Such terminal value problems are often encountered in pricing problems
of compound-like options such as Bermudan options or defaultable bonds with
discrete default barrier, default intensity and endogenous default recovery.
Our results are applied in pricing defaultable discrete coupon bonds.
