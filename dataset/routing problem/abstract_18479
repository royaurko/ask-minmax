We consider the eigenstate problem for a Hamiltonian operator of the field
theory. Methods of construction the effective field theoretical Hamiltonians
for which the eigenstate problem may be solved are discussed. In particular, we
discuss the method of flow equations from a general perspective as well as in
application to the gauge field theories. Flow equations transform the
Hamiltonian to a block-diagonal form with the number of particles conserved in
each block and thus reduce the original bound state problem to a set of coupled
eigenstate equations with an effective Hamiltonian in each sector.
  Applications of flow equations to the Hamiltonians of QED and QCD in the
light-front gauge and the QCD Hamiltonian in the Coulomb gauge are considered.
Using flow equations, we derive the effective Hamiltonians as well as the
renormalized gap equations and the Bethe-Salpeter equations for the bound
states in these theories. We show that the obtained equations are finite in
both UV and IR regions and are completely renormalized in UV, i.e. the
corresponding solutions do not depend on the cut-off $\Lambda$.
  We calculate positronium spectrum, glueball masses, $\pi-\rho$ mass
splitting, gluon and chiral quark condensates and compare our results with the
covariant calculations and experimental results. Use of flow equations to
calculate the dynamical terms is critical to achive good agreement with
experimental results.
