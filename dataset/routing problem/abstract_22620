Binary supermassive black holes form naturally in galaxy mergers, but their
long-term evolution is uncertain. In spherical galaxies, N-body simulations
show that binary evolution stalls at separations much too large for significant
emission of gravitational waves (the "final parsec problem"). Here, we follow
the long-term evolution of a massive binary in more realistic, triaxial and
rotating galaxy models. We find that the binary does not stall. The binary
hardening rates that we observe are sufficient to allow complete coalescence of
binary SBHs in 10 Gyr or less, even in the absence of collisional loss-cone
refilling or gas-dynamical torques, thus providing a potential solution to the
final parsec problem.
