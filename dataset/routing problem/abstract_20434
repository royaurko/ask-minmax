An internal inconsistency with mutually exclusive Hamiltonians and the
corresponding mutually exclusive states HH and H-antiH suffices to doubt the
usefulness of ab initio calculations for H-antiH based on 1927 Heitler-London
theory. Removing this inconsistency in a generic way invalidates this theory
but the compensation is that problems with antihydrogen are removed.
