We study boundary value problems posed in a semistrip for the elliptic
sine-Gordon equation, which is the paradigm of an elliptic integrable PDE in
two variables. We use the method introduced by one of the contributors, which
provides a substantial generalization of the inverse scattering transform and
can be used for the analysis of boundary as opposed to initial-value problems.
We first express the solution in terms of a $2\times 2$ matrix Riemann-Hilbert
problem formulated in terms of both the Dirichlet and the Neumann boundary
values on the boundary of a semistrip. We then concentrate on the case that the
prescribed boundary conditions are zero along the unbounded sides of the
semistrip and constant along the bounded side; in this particular case we show
that the "jump matrices" of the above Riemann-Hilbert problem can be expressed
explicitly in terms of the width of the semistrip and the constant value of the
solution along the bounded side. This Riemann-Hilbert problem has a unique
solution.
