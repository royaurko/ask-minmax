We present a numerical scheme for determining hyperboloidal initial data sets
for the conformal field equations by using pseudo-spectral methods. This
problem is split into two parts. The first step is the determination of a
suitable conformal factor which transforms from an initial data set in physical
space-time to a hyperboloidal hypersurface in the ambient conformal manifold.
This is achieved by solving the Yamabe equation, a non-linear second order
equation. The second step is a division by the conformal factor of certain
fields which vanish on $\scri$, the zero set of the conformal factor. The
challenge there is to numerically obtain a smooth quotient. Both parts are
treated by pseudo-spectral methods. The non-linear equation is solved
iteratively while the division problem is treated by transforming the problem
to the coefficient space, solving it there by the QR-factorisation of a
suitable matrix, and then transforming back. These hyperboloidal initial data
can be used to generate general relativistic space-times by evolution with the
conformal field equations.
