Hyperspectral images can be represented either as a set of images or as a set
of spectra. Spectral classification and segmentation and data reduction are the
main problems in hyperspectral image analysis. In this paper we propose a
Bayesian estimation approach with an appropriate hiearchical model with hidden
markovian variables which gives the possibility to jointly do data reduction,
spectral classification and image segmentation. In the proposed model, the
desired independent components are piecewise homogeneous images which share the
same common hidden segmentation variable. Thus, the joint Bayesian estimation
of this hidden variable as well as the sources and the mixing matrix of the
source separation problem gives a solution for all the three problems of
dimensionality reduction, spectra classification and segmentation of
hyperspectral images. A few simulation results illustrate the performances of
the proposed method compared to other classical methods usually used in
hyperspectral image processing.
