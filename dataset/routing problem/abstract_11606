We study the Frobenius problem: given relatively prime positive integers
a_1,...,a_d, find the largest value of t (the Frobenius number g(a_1,...,a_d))
such that m_1 a_1 + ... m_d a_d = t has no solution in nonnegative integers
m_1,...,m_d. We introduce a method to compute upper bounds for g(a_1,a_2,a_3),
which seem to grow considerably slower than previously known bounds. Our
computations are based on a formula for the restricted partition function,
which involves Dedekind-Rademacher sums, and the reciprocity law for these
sums.
