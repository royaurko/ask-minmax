Globular clusters are valuable fossil records of the formation and evolution
of their host galaxies. The color distribution of elliptical galaxy globular
cluster systems indicates an episodic formation history, consistent with a
merger origin for these galaxies. Spectroscopic studies of globular cluster
systems are a promising route to further constrain models of elliptical galaxy
formation. They also provide a useful probe of the mass distribution of
ellipticals at large radii.
