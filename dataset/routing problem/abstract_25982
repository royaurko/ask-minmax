Neutrino fluxes at telescopes depend on both initial fluxes out of
astronomical bursts and flavor mixing during their travel to the earth.
However, since the information on the initial composition requires better
precision in mixing angles and vice versa, the neutrino detection at telescopes
for itself cannot provide solutions to the both problems. Thus, a probability
to be measured at long baseline oscillation is considered as a complement to
the telescope, and problems like source identification and parameter degeneracy
are examined under a few assumptions.
