We investigate two cosmological axion problems (isocurvature fluctuations and
domain-wall formation) in chaotic inflationary universe. It is believed that
these problems are solved if potential for the Peccei-Quinn scalar field is
very flat. However, we find that too many domain walls are produced through
parametric resonance decay of the Peccei-Quinn scalar field. Only the axion
model with N=1(N: QCD anomaly factor) is consistent with observations. We
also point out that the flat potential is naturally obtained in a
supersymmetric extension of the Peccei-Quinn model. If Peccei-Quinn breaking
scale $F_a$ is about 10^{12} GeV, this model predicts anisotropies of cosmic
microwave background radiation due to the axion isocurvature fluctuations which
may be detectable in future observations.
