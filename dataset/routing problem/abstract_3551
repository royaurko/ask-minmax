The quad-curl problem arises in the study of the electromagnetic interior
transmission problem and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In this paper, we study
the quad-curl eigenvalue problem and propose a mixed method using edge elements
for the computation of the eigenvalues. To the contributor's knowledge, it is the
first numerical treatment for the quad-curl eigenvalue problem. Under suitable
assumptions on the domain and mesh, we prove the optimal convergence. In
addition, we show that the divergence-free condition can be bypassed. Numerical
results are provided to show the viability of the method.
