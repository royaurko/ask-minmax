We investigate the mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary value problems for the
Laplace-Beltrami equation on a smooth hypersurface $\mathcal{C}$ with the
smooth boundary in non-classical setting in the Bessel potential spaces
$\mathbb{H}^1_p(\mathcal{C})$ for $1<p<\infty$. To the initial BVP we apply
quasilocalization and obtain model BVPs for the Laplacian. The model mixed BVP
on the half plane is investigated by potential method and is reduced to an
equivalent system of Mellin convolution equations in Bessel potential and Besov
spaces. The symbol of the obtained system is written explicitly, which provides
Fredholm properties and the index of the system. The unique solvability
criteria for the initial mixed BVP in the non-classical setting is derived.
