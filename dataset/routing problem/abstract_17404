This paper studies a problem of Bayesian parameter estimation for a sequence
of scaled counting processes whose weak limit is a Brownian motion with an
unknown drift. The main result of the paper is that the limit of the posterior
distribution processes is, in general, not equal to the posterior distribution
process of the mentioned Brownian motion with the unknown drift. Instead, it is
equal to the posterior distribution process associated with a Brownian motion
with the same unknown drift and a different standard deviation coefficient. The
difference between the two standard deviation coefficients can be arbitrarily
large. The characterization of the limit of the posterior distribution
processes is then applied to a family of stopping time problems. We show that
the proper way to find asymptotically optimal solutions to stopping time
problems w.r.t.~the scaled counting processes is by looking at the limit of the
posterior distribution processes rather than by the naive approach of looking
at the limit of the scaled counting processes themselves. The difference
between the performances can be arbitrarily large.
