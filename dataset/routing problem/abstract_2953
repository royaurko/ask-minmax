Separable nonlinear least squares (SNLS)problem is a special class of
nonlinear least squares (NLS)problems, whose objective function is a mixture of
linear and nonlinear functions. It has many applications in many different
areas, especially in Operations Research and Computer Sciences. They are
difficult to solve with the infinite-norm metric. In this paper, we give a
short note on the separable nonlinear least squares problem, unseparated scheme
for NLS, and propose an algorithm for solving mixed linear-nonlinear
minimization problem, method of which results in solving a series of least
squares separable problems.
