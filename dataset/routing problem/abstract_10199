We consider a nonatomic congestion game on a graph, with several classes of
players. Each player wants to go from its origin vertex to its destination
vertex at the minimum cost and all players of a given class share the same
characteristics: cost functions on each arc, and origin-destination pair. Under
some mild conditions, it is known that a Nash equilibrium exists, but the
computation of an equilibrium in the multiclass case is an open problem for
general functions. We consider the specific case where the cost functions are
affine. We show that this problem is polynomially solvable when the number of
vertices and the number of classes are fixed. In particular, it shows that the
parallel-link case with a fixed number of classes is polynomially solvable. On
a more practical side, we propose an extension of Lemke's algorithm able to
solve this problem.
