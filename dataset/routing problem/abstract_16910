We use the method of Maximum (relative) Entropy to process information in the
form of observed data and moment constraints. The generic "canonical" form of
the posterior distribution for the problem of simultaneous updating with data
and moments is obtained. We discuss the general problem of non-commuting
constraints, when they should be processed sequentially and when
simultaneously. As an illustration, the multinomial example of die tosses is
solved in detail for two superficially similar but actually very different
problems.
