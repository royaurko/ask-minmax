We present a program suite for the radiative transfer problem solution in
axi-symmetrical dusty galaxy disks, intended primarily for spectrophotometric
analysis of stellar populations by means of integrated and differential
photometry. The solution is obtained using a 2D ray-tracing algorithm at a
discrete wavelength set, emphasizing careful treatment of the effects of light
scattering by interstellar dust grains. The program has been thoroughly tested
and shows the performance and accuracy comparable to or better than other codes
currently in use for astrophysical radiative transfer. The program's source
code and example model files are available at http://www.astro.lt/~dima/gfe/ .
