Solving Fastest Distributed Consensus (FDC) averaging problem over sensor
networks with different topologies has received some attention recently and one
of the well known topologies in this issue is star-mesh hybrid topology. Here
in this work we present analytical solution for the problem of FDC algorithm by
means of stratification and semidefinite programming, for the Star-Mesh Hybrid
network with K-partite core (SMHK) which has rich symmetric properties. Also
the variations of asymptotic and per step convergence rate of SMHK network
versus its topological parameters have been studied numerically.
