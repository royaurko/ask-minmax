We investigate a class of non-linear partial differential equations with
discrete state-dependent delays. The existence and uniqueness of strong
solutions for initial functions from a Banach space are proved. To get the
well-posed initial value problem we restrict our study to a smaller metric
space, construct the dynamical system and prove the existence of a compact
global attractor.
