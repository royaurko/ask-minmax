We theoretically investigate the Fermi edge singularity in a spin incoherent
Luttinger liquid. Both cases of finite and infinite core hole mass are
explored, as well as the effect of a static external magnetic field of
arbitrary strength. For a finite mass core hole the absorption edge behaves as
$(\omega-\omega_{\rm th})^\alpha/ \sqrt{|\ln(\omega-\omega_{\rm th})|}$ for
frequencies $\omega$ just above the threshold frequency $\omega_{\rm th}$. The
exponent $\alpha$ depends on the interaction parameter $g$ of the interacting
one dimensional system, the electron-hole coupling, and is independent of the
magnetic field strength, the momentum, and the mass of the excited core hole
(in contrast to the spin coherent case). In the infinite mass limit, the spin
incoherent problem can be mapped onto an equivalent problem in a spinless
Luttinger liquid for which the logarithmic factor is absent, and backscattering
from the core hole leads to a universal contribution to the exponent $\alpha$.
