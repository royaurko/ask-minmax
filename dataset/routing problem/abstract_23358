We re-analyse spin-flavour precession solutions to the solar neutrino problem
in the light of the recent SNO CC result as well as the 1258--day
Super-Kamiokande data and the upper limit on solar anti-neutrinos. In a
self-consistent magneto-hydrodynamics approach the resulting scheme has only 3
effective parameters: $\Delta m^2$, $\mu B_\perp$ and the neutrino mixing angle
$\theta$. We show how a rates-only analysis for fixed $\mu B_\perp$ slightly
favours spin-flavour precession (SFP) solutions over oscillations (OSC). In
addition to the resonant solution (RSFP for short), there is a new non-resonant
solution (NRSFP) in the ``dark-side''. Both RSFP and NRSFP lead to flat recoil
energy spectra in excellent agreement with the latest SuperKamiokande data. We
also show that in the presence of a neutrino transition magnetic moment of
$10^{-11}$ Bohr magneton, a magnetic field of 80 KGauss eliminates all large
mixing solutions other than the so-called LMA solution.
