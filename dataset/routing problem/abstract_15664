Some implications of the proposal that flavor nondiagonal couplings of
neutrinos to gravity might resolve the solar neutrino problem are considered in
the context of three neutrino flavors. The two--flavor model is discussed as a
limiting case of the full three-generation mechanism, and the behavior of the
$\nue$ survival probability for various values of the three--flavor parameters
is studied. Overlapping allowed SNU regions are obtained for the neutrinos
which most likely contribute to the observed solar neutrino deficiency, and the
effects of the addition of a third flavor are discussed. The extension to a
three--generation framework is found to yield a greater allowed region of
parameter space, suggesting that gravitationally--induced neutrino oscillations
remain a viable explanation of the Solar Neutrino Problem.
