In this note I will review some of the recent results that have been obtained
in the probabilistic approach to the random satisfiability problem. At the
present moment the results are only heuristic. In the case of the random
3-satisfiability problem a phase transition from the satisfiable to the
unsatisfiable phase is found at $\alpha=4.267$. There are other values of
$\alpha$ that separates different regimes and they will be described in
details. In this context the properties of the survey decimation algorithm will
also be discussed.
