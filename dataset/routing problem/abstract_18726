One of the earliest and most well known problems in computational geometry is
the so-called art gallery problem. The goal is to compute the minimum possible
number guards placed on the vertices of a simple polygon in such a way that
they cover the interior of the polygon.
  In this paper we consider the problem of guarding an art gallery which is
modeled as a polygon with curvilinear walls. Our main focus is on polygons the
edges of which are convex arcs pointing towards the exterior or interior of the
polygon (but not both), named piecewise-convex and piecewise-concave polygons.
We prove that, in the case of piecewise-convex polygons, if we only allow
vertex guards, $\lfloor\frac{4n}{7}\rfloor-1$ guards are sometimes necessary,
and $\lfloor\frac{2n}{3}\rfloor$ guards are always sufficient. Moreover, an
$O(n\log{}n)$ time and O(n) space algorithm is described that produces a vertex
guarding set of size at most $\lfloor\frac{2n}{3}\rfloor$. When we allow point
guards the afore-mentioned lower bound drops down to
$\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$. In the special case of monotone piecewise-convex
polygons we can show that $\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ vertex guards are always
sufficient and sometimes necessary; these bounds remain valid even if we allow
point guards.
  In the case of piecewise-concave polygons, we show that $2n-4$ point guards
are always sufficient and sometimes necessary, whereas it might not be possible
to guard such polygons by vertex guards. We conclude with bounds for other
types of curvilinear polygons and future work.
