We discuss the preparation of thin icosahedral films (Al-Cu-Fe and Al-Pd-Re)
via the route of the amorphous (a-)phase which in some aspects is a precursor
to the icosahedral phase. A direct transition from the a- to the i-phase occurs
for Al-Cu-Fe films at 430 C on the time scale of minutes. The resulting films
are of good quality as shown by diffraction and electronic transport
properties. The surface of the resulting films is very smooth.
