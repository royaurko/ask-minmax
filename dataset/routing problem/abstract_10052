We consider the asymptotic method designed by F. Olver [Olver, 1974] for
linear differential equations of the second order containing a large
(asymptotic) parameter $\Lambda$: $x^my"-\Lambda^2y=g(x)y$, with
$m\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $g$ continuous. Olver studies in detail the cases $m\ne
2$, specially the cases $m=0,\pm 1$, giving the Poincar\'e-type asymptotic
expansion of two independent solutions of the equation. The case $m=2$ is
different, as the behavior of the solutions for large $\Lambda$ is not of
exponential type, but of power type. In this case, Olver's theory does not give
as many details as it gives in the cases $m\ne 2$. Then, we consider here the
special case $m=2$. We propose two different techniques to handle the problem:
(i) a modification of Olver's method that replaces the role of the exponential
approximations by power approximations and (ii) the transformation of the
differential problem into a fixed point problem from which we construct an
asymptotic sequence of functions that converges to the unique solution of the
problem. Moreover, we show that this second technique may also be applied to
nonlinear differential equations with a large parameter.
