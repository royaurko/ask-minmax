The eigenvalue problem of the Laplace-Beltrami operators on curved surfaces
plays an essential role in the convergence analysis of the numerical
simulations of some important geometric partial differential equations which
involve this operator. In this note we shall combine the local tangential
lifting (LTL) method with the configuration equation to develop a new effective
and convergent algorithm to solve the eigenvalue problems of the
Laplace-Beltrami operators acting on functions over discrete surfaces. The
convergence rates of our algorithms of discrete Laplace-Beltrami operators over
surfaces is $O(r^n)$, $n \geq 1$, where $r$ represents the size of the mesh of
discretization of the surface. The problem of high-order accuracies will also
be discussed and used to compute geometric invariants of the underlying
surfaces. Some convergence tests and eigenvalue computations on the sphere,
tori and a dumbbell are presented.
