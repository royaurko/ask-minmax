Gaussian process regression is a popular method to model data using a
non-parametric Bayesian approach. However, the hyperparameters encountered in
the Gaussian process prior are often unknown, but they can still have a great
influence on the posterior model. This work provides an off-the-shelf method
for numerical marginalization of the hyperparameters, thus significantly
alleviating the problem. Our method relies on the rigorous framework of
sequential Monte Carlo, and is well suited for online problems. We demonstrate
its ability to handle high-dimensional problems and compare it to other
sampling methods. It is also concluded that our new method is a competitive
alternative to the commonly used point estimates, empirical Bayes, both in
terms of computational load and its ability to handle multimodal posteriors.
