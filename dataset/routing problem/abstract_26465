From The late 90th, "Skin Detection" becomes one of the major problems in
image processing. If "Skin Detection" will be done in high accuracy, it can be
used in many cases as face recognition, Human Tracking and etc. Until now so
many methods were presented for solving this problem. In most of these methods,
color space was used to extract feature vector for classifying pixels, but the
most of them have not good accuracy in detecting types of skin. The proposed
approach in this paper is based on "Color based image retrieval" (CBIR)
technique. In this method, first by means of CBIR method and image tiling and
considering the relation between pixel and its neighbors, a feature vector
would be defined and then with using a training step, detecting the skin in the
test stage. The result shows that the presenting approach, in addition to its
high accuracy in detecting type of skin, has no sensitivity to illumination
intensity and moving face orientation.
