In this paper, we focus on nonlinear infinite-norm minimization problems that
have many applications, especially in computer science and operations research.
We set a reliable Lagrangian dual aproach for solving this kind of problems in
general, and based on this method, we propose an algorithm for the mixed linear
and nonlinear infinite-norm minimization cases with numerical results.
