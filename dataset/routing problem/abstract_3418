We investigate regular realizability (RR) problems, which are the problems of
verifying whether intersection of a regular language -- the input of the
problem -- and fixed language called filter is non-empty. In this paper we
focus on the case of context-free filters. Algorithmic complexity of the RR
problem is a very coarse measure of context-free languages complexity. This
characteristic is compatible with rational dominance. We present examples of
P-complete RR problems as well as examples of RR problems in the class NL. Also
we discuss RR problems with context-free filters that might have intermediate
complexity. Possible candidates are the languages with polynomially bounded
rational indices.
