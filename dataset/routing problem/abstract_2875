We construct group codes over two letters (i.e., bases of subgroups of a
two-generated free group) with special properties. Such group codes can be used
for reducing algorithmic problems over large alphabets to algorithmic problems
over a two-letter alphabet. Our group codes preserve aperiodicity of inverse
finite automata. As an application we show that the following problems are
PSpace-complete for two-letter alphabets (this was previously known for large
enough finite alphabets): The intersection-emptiness problem for inverse finite
automata, the aperiodicity problem for inverse finite automata, and the
closure-under-radical problem for finitely generated subgroups of a free group.
The membership problem for 3-generated inverse monoids is PSpace-complete.
