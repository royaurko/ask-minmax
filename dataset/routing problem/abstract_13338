The problem of a disc and a ball rolling on a horizontal plane without
slipping is considered. Differential constrained equations are shown to be
integrated when the trajectory of the point of contact is taken in a form of
the natural equation, i.e. when the dependence of the curvature of the
trajectory is explicitly expressed in terms of the distance passed by the
point.
