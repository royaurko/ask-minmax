In this paper, we study conformal invariants that arise from nodal sets and
negative eigenvalues of conformally covariant operators; more specifically, the
GJMS operators, which include the Yamabe and Paneitz operators. We give several
applications to curvature prescription problems. We establish a version in
conformal geometry of Courant's Nodal Domain Theorem. We also show that on any
manifold of dimension $n\geq 3$, there exist many metrics for which our
invariants are nontrivial. We prove that the Yamabe operator can have an
arbitrarily large number of negative eigenvalues on any manifold of dimension
$n\geq 3$. We obtain similar results for some higher order GJMS operators on
some Einstein and Heisenberg manifolds. We describe the invariants arising from
the Yamabe and Paneitz operators associated to left-invariant metrics on
Heisenberg manifolds. Finally, in the appendix, the 2nd named contributor and Andrea
Malchiodi study the $Q$-curvature prescription problems for non-critical
$Q$-curvatures.
