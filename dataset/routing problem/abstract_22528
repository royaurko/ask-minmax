The effects of Hall electromotive forces (HEMFs) on the linear stability of
protostellar disks are examined. Earlier work on this topic focused on axial
field and perturbation wavenumbers. Here we treat the problem more generally.
Both axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric cases are investigated. Though seldom
explicitly included in calculations, HEMFs appear to be important whenever
Ohmic dissipation is. They allow for the appearance of electron whistler waves,
and since these have right-handed polarization, a helicity factor is also
introduced into the stability problem. This factor is the product of the
components of the angular velocity and magnetic field along the perturbation
wavenumber, and it is destabilizing when negative. Unless the field and angular
velocity are exactly aligned, it is always possible to find destabilizing
wavenumbers. HEMFs can destabilize any differential rotation law, even those
with angular velocity increasing outward. Regardless of the sign of the angular
velocity gradient, the maximum growth rate is always given in magnitude by the
local Oort A value of the disk, as in the standard magnetorotational
instability. The role of Hall EMFs may prove crucial to understanding how
turbulence is maintained in the ``low state'' of eruptive disk systems.
