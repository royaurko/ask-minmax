Motivated by a mathematical model for the transport of morphogenes in
biological systems, we study existence and uniqueness of entropy solutions for
a mixed initial-boundary value problem associated with a nonlinear
flux--limited diffusion system. From a mathematical point of view the problem
behaves more as an hyperbolic system that a parabolic one.
