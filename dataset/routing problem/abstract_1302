Magnetism and transport are two key functional ingredients in modern
electronic devices. In oxide heterostructures, ferroelectricity can provide a
new route to control these two properties via electrical operations, which is
scientifically interesting and technologically important. In this Brief Review,
we will introduce recent progresses on this fast developing research field.
Several subtopics will be covered. First, the ferroelectric polarization tuning
of interfacial magnetism will be introduced, which includes the tuning of
magnetization, easy axis, magnetic phases, as well as exchange bias. Second,
the ferroelectric polarization tuning of transverse and tunneling transport
will be reviewed.
