In this paper, we discuss numerical approximation of the eigenvalues of the
one-dimensional radial Schr\"{o}dinger equation posed on a semi-infinite
interval. The original problem is first transformed to one defined on a finite
domain by applying suitable change of the independent variable. The eigenvalue
problem for the resulting differential operator is then approximated by a
generalized algebraic eigenvalue problem arising after discretization of the
analytical problem by the matrix method based on high order finite difference
schemes. Numerical experiments illustrate the performance of the approach.
