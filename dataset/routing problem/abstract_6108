The restricted three body problem is well-known and very important for
dynamics of binary, multiple stars and also planetary systems. We extend the
classical version of this problem to the situation that there are some external
forces from the belt. We find that both the equilibrium points and solution
curves become quite different from the classical case. We also determine the
values of Lyapunov Exponent for some important orbits.
