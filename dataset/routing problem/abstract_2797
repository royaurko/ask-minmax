We calculate the spatially resolved tunneling conductance of topological
superconductors (TSCs) based on ferromagnetic chains, measured by means of
spin-polarised scanning tunneling microscopy (SPSTM). Our analysis reveals
novel signatures of MFs arising from the interplay of their strongly
anisotropic spin-polarisation and the magnetisation content of the tip. We
focus on the deep Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) limit where only YSR bound states
localised in the vicinity of the adatoms govern the low-energy as also the
topological properties of the system. Under these conditions, we investigate
the occurence of zero/finite bias peaks (ZBPs/FBPs) for a single or two coupled
TSC chains forming a Josephson junction. Each TSC can host up to two Majorana
fermions (MFs) per edge if chiral symmetry is preserved. Here we retrieve the
conductance for all the accessible configurations of the MF number of each
chain. Our results illustrate innovative spin-polarisation-sensitive
experimental routes for arresting the MFs by either restoring or splitting the
ZBP in a predictable fashion via: i) weakly breaking chiral symmetry, e.g. by
the SPSTM tip itself or by an external Zeeman field and ii) tuning the
superconducting phase difference of the TSCs, which is encoded in the
4$\pi$-Josephson coupling of neighbouring MFs.
