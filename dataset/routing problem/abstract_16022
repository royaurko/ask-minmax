An important theorem in the theory of infinite dimensional Lie algebras
states that any affine Kac-Moody algebra can be realized (that is to say
constructed explicitly) using loop algebras. In this paper, we consider the
corresponding problem for a class of Lie algebras called extended affine Lie
algebras (EALAs) that generalize affine algebras. EALAs occur in families that
are constructed from centreless Lie tori, so the realization problem for EALAs
reduces to the realization problem for centreless Lie tori. We show that all
but one family of centreless Lie tori can be realized using multiloop algebras
(in place of loop algebras). We also obtain necessary and sufficient for two
centreless Lie tori realized in this way to be isotopic, a relation that
corresponds to isomorphism of the corresponding families of EALAs.
