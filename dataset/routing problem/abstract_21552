Two Poisson structures invariant with respect to discrete transformation of
the Maximal root in the case of arbitrary semi-simple algebras are presented in
explicit form. Thus the problem of construction of equations of n-wave
hierarchy in the case of arbitrary semi simple algebra is solved finally.
