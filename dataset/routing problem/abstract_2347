Multipath transport protocols like MPTCP transfer data across multiple routes
in parallel and deliver it in order at the receiver. When the delay on one or
more of the paths is variable, as is commonly the case, out of order arrivals
are frequent and head of line blocking leads to high latency. This is
exacerbated when packet loss, which is also common with wireless links, is
tackled using ARQ. This paper introduces Stochastic Earliest Delivery Path
First (S-EDPF), a resilient low delay packet scheduler for multipath transport
protocols. S-EDPF takes explicit account of the stochastic nature of paths and
uses this to minimise in-order delivery delay. S-EDPF also takes account of
FEC, jointly scheduling transmission of information and coded packets and in
this way allows lossy links to reduce delay and improve resiliency, rather than
degrading performance as usually occurs with existing multipath systems. We
implement S-EDPF as a multi-platform application that does not require
administration privileges nor modifications to the operating system and has
negligible impact on energy consumption. We present a thorough experimental
evaluation in both controlled environments and into the wild, revealing
dramatic gains in delay performance compared to existing approaches.
