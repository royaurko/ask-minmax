We have proposed a very attractive scenario of Grand Unified
 Theories (GUTs). It employs the supersymmetry (SUSY) and an anomalous U(1)
symmetry whose anomaly is canceled via the Green-Schwarz mechanism. In this
scenario, the doublet-triplet splitting problem is solved and the success of
the gauge coupling unification in the minimal SU(5) GUT is naturally explained
with sufficiently stable nucleon. Realistic fermion Yukawa matrices can also be
realized simultaneously. In addition, a horizontal symmetry helps to solve the
 SUSY-flavor problem.
