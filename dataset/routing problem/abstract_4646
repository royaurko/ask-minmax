Coordination of multi agent systems remains as a problem since there is no
prominent method to completely solve this problem. Metaheuristic agents are
specific implementations of multi-agent systems, which imposes working together
to solve optimisation problems with metaheuristic algorithms. The idea borrowed
from swarm intelligence seems working much better than those implementations
suggested before. This paper reports the performance of swarms of simulated
annealing agents collaborating with particle swarm optimization algorithm. The
proposed approach is implemented for multidimensional knapsack problem and has
resulted much better than some other works published before.
