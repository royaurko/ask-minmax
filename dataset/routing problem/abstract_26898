We study time-like hypersurfaces with vanishing mean curvature in the (3+1)
dimensional Minkowski space, which are the hyperbolic counterparts to minimal
embeddings of Riemannian manifolds. The catenoid is a stationary solution of
the associated Cauchy problem. This solution is linearly unstable, and we show
that this instability is the only obstruction to the global nonlinear stability
of the catenoid. More precisely, we prove in a certain symmetry class the
existence, in the neighborhood of the catenoid initial data, of a co-dimension
1 Lipschitz manifold transverse to the unstable mode consisting of initial data
whose solutions exist globally in time and converge asymptotically to the
catenoid.
