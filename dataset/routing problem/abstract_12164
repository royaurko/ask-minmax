In this chapter, we will first present the most standard computational
challenges met in Bayesian Statistics, focussing primarily on mixture
estimation and on model choice issues, and then relate these problems with
computational solutions. Of course, this chapter is only a terse introduction
to the problems and solutions related to Bayesian computations. For more
complete references, see Robert and Casella (2004, 2009), or Marin and Robert
(2007), among others. We also restrain from providing an introduction to
Bayesian Statistics per se and for comprehensive coverage, address the reader
to Robert (2007), (again) among others.
