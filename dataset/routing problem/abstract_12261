In this note, we study the non-linear evolution problem $dY_t = -A Y_t dt +
B(Y_t) dX_t$, where $X$ is a $\gamma$-H\"older continuous function of the time
parameter, with values in a distribution space, and $-A$ the generator of an
analytical semigroup. Then, we will give some sharp conditions on $X$ in order
to solve the above equation in a function space, first in the linear case (for
any value of $\gamma$ in $(0,1)$), and then when $B$ satisfies some Lipschitz
type conditions (for $\gamma>1/2$). The solution of the evolution problem will
be understood in the mild sense, and the integrals involved in that definition
will be of Young type.
