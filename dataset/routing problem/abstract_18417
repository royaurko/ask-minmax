Within the framework of the instanton approach we present analytical results
for the following model problems: (i) particle penetration through a parabolic
potential barrier, where the instanton solution practically coincides with the
exact (quantum) one; (ii) descriptions of highly excited states in two types of
anharmonic potentials: double-well $X^4$, and decay $X^3$. For the former case
the instanton method reproduces accurately not only single well and double-well
quantization but as well a crossover region (in the contrast with the standard
WKB approach which fails to describe the crossover behavior), and for the
latter case the instanton method allows to study resonance broadening and
collapse phenomena. We investigate also resonance tunneling, playing a relevant
role in many semiconducting devices. We show that in a broad region of energies
the instanton approach gives exact (quantum) results. Applications of the
method and of the results may concern the various systems in physics, chemistry
and biology exhibiting double level behavior and resonance tunneling.
