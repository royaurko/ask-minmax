By developing the d-bar approach to global "inverse scattering" at zero
energy we give a principal effectivization of the global reconstruction method
for the Gel'fand-Calderon inverse boundary value problem in three dimensions.
This work goes back to results published by the contributor in 1987, 1988 and
proceeds from recent progress in the d-bar approach to inverse scattering in 3D
published by the contributor in 2005, 2006.
