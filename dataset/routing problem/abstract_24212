The paper analyzes a Lagrangian system which is controlled by directly
assigning some of the coordinates as functions of time, by means of
frictionless constraints. In a natural system of coordinates, the equations of
motions contain terms which are linear or quadratic w.r.t.time derivatives of
the control functions. After reviewing the basic equations, we explain the
significance of the quadratic terms, related to geodesics orthogonal to a given
foliation. We then study the problem of stabilization of the system to a given
point, by means of oscillating controls. This problem is first reduced to the
weak stability for a related convex-valued differential inclusion, then studied
by Lyapunov functions methods. In the last sections, we illustrate the results
by means of various mechanical examples.
