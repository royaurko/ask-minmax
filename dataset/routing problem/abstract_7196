Identifying key genes involved in a particular disease is a very important
problem which is considered in biomedical research. GeneRank model is based on
the PageRank algorithm that preserves many of its mathematical properties. The
model brings together gene expression information with a network structure and
ranks genes based on the results of microarray experiments combined with gene
expression information, for example from gene annotations (GO). In the present
study, we present a new preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm to solve
GeneRank problem and study its properties. Some numerical experiments are given
to show the effectiveness of the suggested preconditioner.
