Stochastic shortest path (SSP) problems arise in a variety of discrete
stochastic control contexts. An optimal solutions to such a problem is
typically computed using the value function, which can be found by solving the
corresponding dynamic programming equations. In the deterministic case, these
equations can be often solved by the highly efficient label-setting methods
(such as Dijkstra's and Dial's algorithms). In this paper we define and study a
class of Multimode Stochastic Shortest Path problems and develop sufficient
conditions for the applicability of label-setting methods. We illustrate our
approach on a number of discrete stochastic control examples. We also discuss
the relationship of SSPs with discretizations of static Hamilton-Jacobi
equations and provide an alternative derivation for several fast
(non-iterative) numerical methods for these PDEs.
