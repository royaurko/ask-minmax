Band gap engineering in graphene may open the routes towards transistor
devices in which electric current can be switched off and on at will. One may,
however, ask if a semiconducting band gap alone is sufficient to quench the
current in graphene. In this paper we demonstrate that despite a bulk band gap
graphene can still have metallic conductance along the sample edges (provided
that they are shorter than the localization length). We find this for
single-layer graphene with a zigzag-type boundary which hosts gapless
propagating edge states even in the presence of a bulk band gap. By generating
inter-valley scattering, sample disorder reduces the edge conductance. However,
for weak scattering a metallic regime emerges with the diffusive conductance G
= (e^2/h)(l_KK' / L) per spin, where l_KK' is the transport mean-free path due
to the inter-valley scattering and L >> l_KK' is the edge length. We also take
intra-valley scattering by smooth disorder (e.g. by remote ionized impurities
in the substrate) into account. Albeit contributing to the elastic
quasiparticle life-time, the intra-valley scattering has no effect on G.
