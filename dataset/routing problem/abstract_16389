Inspired by Morrey's Problem (on rank-one convex functionals) and the
Burkholder integrals (of his martingale theory) we find that the Burkholder
functionals $B_p$, $p \ge 2$, are quasiconcave, when tested on deformations of
identity $f\in Id + C^\infty_0(\Omega)$ with $B_p(Df(x)) \ge 0$ pointwise, or
equivalently, deformations such that $|Df|^2 \leq \frac{p}{p-2} J_f$. In
particular, this holds in explicit neighbourhoods of the identity map. Among
the many immediate consequences, this gives the strongest possible $L^p$-
estimates for the gradient of a principal solution to the Beltrami equation
$\f_{\bar{z}} = \mu(z) f_z$, for any $p$ in the critical interval $2 \leq p
\leq 1+1/\|\mu_f\|_\infty$. Examples of local maxima lacking symmetry manifest
the intricate nature of the problem.
