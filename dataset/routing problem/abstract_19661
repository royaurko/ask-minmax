The problem of extracting consistent information from relational databases
violating integrity constraints on numerical data is addressed. In particular,
aggregate constraints defined as linear inequalities on aggregate-sum queries
on input data are considered. The notion of repair as consistent set of updates
at attribute-value level is exploited, and the characterization of several
complexity issues related to repairing data and computing consistent query
answers is provided.
