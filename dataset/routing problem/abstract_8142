The present paper deals with a free boundary problem modeling the growth
process of necrotic multi-layer tumors. We prove the existence of flat
stationary solutions and determine the linearization of our model at such an
equilibrium. Finally, we compute the solutions of the stationary linearized
problem and comment on bifurcation.
