We demonstrate second order optical nonlinearity in a silicon architecture
through heterogeneous integration of single-crystalline gallium nitride (GaN)
on silicon (100) substrates. By engineering GaN microrings for dual resonance
around 1560 nm and 780 nm, we achieve efficient, tunable second harmonic
generation at 780 nm. The \{chi}(2) nonlinear susceptibility is measured to be
as high as 16 plus minus 7 pm/V. Because GaN has a wideband transparency window
covering ultraviolet, visible and infrared wavelengths, our platform provides a
viable route for the on-chip generation of optical wavelengths in both the far
infrared and near-UV through a combination of \{chi}(2) enabled
sum-/difference-frequency processes.
