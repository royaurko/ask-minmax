We give a version of the Riesz-Haviland theorem for truncated moments
problems, characterizing the existence of the representing measures that are
absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. The existence of
such representing densities describes the dense interior of the convex cone of
all data having nonnegative Borel representing measures. A natural regularity
assumption on the support is required.
