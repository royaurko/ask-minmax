We present a solution to the $\mu$ problem in an SO(10) supersymmetric grand
unified (SUSY GUT) model with gauge mediated (GMSB) and D-term supersymmetry
breaking. A Peccei-Quinn ({\bf PQ}) symmetry is broken at the messenger scale
and enables the generation of the $\mu$ term. The invisible axion (Goldstone
boson of {\bf PQ} symmetry breaking) is a cold dark matter candidate. At low
energy, our model leads to a phenomenologically acceptable version of the
minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with novel particle phenomenology.
Either the gluino or the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle
(LSP). The phenomenological constraints on the model result in a Higgs with
mass $\sim 86 - 91$ GeV and $\tan\beta \sim 9 - 14$.
