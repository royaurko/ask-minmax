In general, for higher order elliptic equations and boundary value problems
like the biharmonic equation and the linear clamped plate boundary value
problem neither a maximum principle nor a comparison principle or --
equivalently -- a positivity preserving property is available. The problem is
rather involved since the clamped boundary conditions prevent the boundary
value problem {from} being reasonably written as a system of second order
boundary value problems.
  It is shown that, on the other hand, for bounded smooth domains $\Omega
\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, the negative part of the corresponding Green's function
is "small" when compared with its singular positive part, provided $n\ge 3$.
  Moreover, the biharmonic Green's function in balls $B\subset\mathbb{R}^n$
under Dirichlet (i.e. clamped) boundary conditions is known explicitly and is
positive. It has been known for some time that positivity is preserved under
small regular perturbations of the domain, if $n=2$. In the present paper, such
a stability result is proved for $n\ge 3$. Keywords: Biharmonic Green's
functions, positivity, almost positivity, blow-up procedure.
