Most finite element methods for solving time-harmonic wave-propagation
problems lead to a linear system with a non-normal coefficient matrix. The
non-normality is due to boundary conditions and losses. One way to solve these
systems is to use a preconditioned iterative method. Detailed mathematical
analysis of the convergence properties of these methods is important for
developing new and understanding old preconditioners. Due to non-normality,
there is currently very little existing literature in this direction. In this
paper, we study the convergence of GMRES for such systems by deriving inclusion
and exclusion regions for the pseudospectrum of the coefficient matrix. All
analysis is done a priori by relating the properties of the weak problem to the
coefficient matrix. The inclusion is derived from the stability properties of
the problem and the exclusion is established via field of values and
boundedness of the weak form. The derived tools are applied to estimate the
pseudospectrum of time-harmonic Helmholtz equation with first-order absorbing
boundary conditions, with and without a shifted-Laplace preconditioner.
