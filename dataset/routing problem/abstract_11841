The problem of representing a detector in a form which is accessible to a
variety of applications, allows retrieval of information in ways which are
natural to those applications, and is maintainable has been vexing physicists
for some time. Although invented to address an entirely different problem
domain, the document markup meta-language XML is well-suited to detector
description. This paper describes its use for a GLAST detector.
