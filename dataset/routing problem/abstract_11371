These lectures give an overview of the uses of effective field theories in
describing gravitational radiation sources for LIGO or LISA. The first lecture
reviews some of the standard ideas of effective field theory (decoupling,
matching, power counting) mostly in the context of a simple toy model. The
second lecture sets up the problem of calculating gravitational wave emission
from non-relativistic binary stars by constructing a tower of effective
theories that separately describe each scale in the problem: the internal size
of each binary constituent, the orbital separation, and the wavelength of
radiated gravitons.
