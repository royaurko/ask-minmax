This paper presents heuristic algorithms for interleaved pulse scheduling
problems on multi-target tracking in pulse Doppler phased array radars that can
process multiple simultaneous received beams. The interleaved pulse scheduling
problems for element and subarray level digital beamforming architectures are
formulated as the same integer program and the asymptotic time complexities of
the algorithms are analyzed.
