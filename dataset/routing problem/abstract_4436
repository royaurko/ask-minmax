We introduce a new approach for establishing fixed-parameter tractability of
problems parameterized above tight lower bounds. To illustrate the approach we
consider three problems of this type of unknown complexity that were introduced
by Mahajan, Raman and Sikdar (J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 75, 2009). We show that a
generalization of one of the problems and non-trivial special cases of the
other two are fixed-parameter tractable.
