In this research paper, state space representation of concurrent, linearly
coupled dynamical systems is discussed. It is reasoned that the Tensor State
Space Representation (TSSR) proposed in [Rama1] is directly applicable in such
a problem. Also some discussion on linearly coupled, concurrent systems
evolving on multiple time scales is included. Briefly new ideas related to
distributed signal processing in cyber physical systems are included.
