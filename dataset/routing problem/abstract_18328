We study two inverse problems on a globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold
$(M,g)$. We consider measurements done in a neighborhood $V$ of a time-like,
future directed geodesic $\mu$ that connects $p^-$ to $p^+$. The studied
problems are:
  1. Active measurements in spacetime: We consider inverse problems for
non-linear hyperbolic equations and develop a method that utilizes the
non-linearity as a benefit. The method is demonstrated for the non-linear wave
equation $\square_g u+au^2=F$. We consider the source-to-solution map $L_V:F\to
u|_V$ that maps the source $F$ supported on $V$ to the restriction of the
solution $u$ on $V$. When $M$ is 4-dimensional, we show that the set $V$, the
metric $g|_V$ on it, and the map $L_V$ determine the topological,
differentiable, and conformal structures of the spacetime in the maximal set
where waves can propagate from $\mu$ and return back to $\mu$.
  2. Passive observations in spacetime: We assume that we are given $V$,
$g|_V$, and the light observations sets $P_V(q)$ corresponding to all (or a
dense subset of) source points $q$ in $W\subset M$. The light observation set
$P_V(q)$ is the intersection of $V$ and the light-cone emanating from the point
$q$. When $W\subset M$ is a relatively compact, connected, open set which all
points are in the chronological past of the point $p^+$ but not in the past of
the point $p^-$, we show that the given data determine the conformal type of
$(W,g|_W)$. Under assumption that the space-time is Ricci-flat we can also
determine the whole metric tensor in $W$.
