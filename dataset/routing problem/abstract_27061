We consider the problem of Cyclic Interference Alignment (IA) on the 3-user
X-network and show that it is infeasible to exactly achieve the upper bound of
$\frac{K^2}{2K-1}=\frac{9}{5}$ degrees of freedom for the lower bound of n=5
signalling dimensions and K=3 user-pairs. This infeasibility goes beyond the
problem of common eigenvectors in invariant subspaces within spatial IA.
  In order to gain non-asymptotic feasibility with minimal intervention, we
first investigate an alignment strategy that enables IA by feedforwarding a
subset of messages with minimal rate. In a second step, we replace the proposed
feedforward strategy by an analogous Cyclic Interference Alignment and
Cancellation scheme with a backhaul network on the receiver side and also by a
dual Cyclic Interference Neutralization scheme with a backhaul network on the
transmitter side.
