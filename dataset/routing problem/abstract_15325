Studies have shown that multi-objective optimization problems are hard
problems. Such problems either require longer time to converge to an optimum
solution, or may not converge at all. Recently some researchers have claimed
that real culprit for increasing the hardness of multi-objective problems are
not the number of objectives themselves rather it is the increased size of
solution set, incompatibility of solutions, and high probability of finding
suboptimal solution due to increased number of local maxima. In this work, we
have setup a simple framework for the evaluation of hardness of multi-objective
genetic algorithms (MOGA). The algorithm is designed for a pray-predator game
where a player is to improve its lifespan, challenging level and usability of
the game arena through number of generations. A rigorous set of experiments are
performed for quantifying the hardness in terms of evolution for increasing
number of objective functions. In genetic algorithm, crossover and mutation
with equal probability are applied to create offspring in each generation.
First, each objective function is maximized individually by ranking the
competing players on the basis of the fitness (cost) function, and then a
multi-objective cost function (sum of individual cost functions) is maximized
with ranking, and also without ranking where dominated solutions are also
allowed to evolve.
