We cast the four-dimensional field equations of the Nonsymmetric
Gravitational Theory (NGT) into a form appropriate for numerical study. In
doing so, we have restricted ourselves to spherically symmetric spacetimes, and
we have kept only the Wyman sector of the theory. We investigate the
well-posedness of the initial-value problem of NGT for a particular data set
consisting of a pulse in the antisymmetric field on an asymptotically flat
space background. We include some analytic results on the solvability of the
initial-value problem which allow us to place limits on the regions of the
parameter space where the initial-value problem is solvable. These results are
confirmed by numerically solving the constraints.
