The electron shakeoff of $^{35}$Cl atoms resulting from the $\beta$$^+$ decay
of $^{35}$Ar$^+$ ions has been investigated using a Paul trap coupled to a
recoil-ion spectrometer. The charge-state distribution of the recoiling
daughter nuclei is compared to theoretical calculations accounting for shakeoff
and Auger processes. The calculations are in excellent agreement with the
experimental results and enable to identify the ionization reaction routes
leading to the formation of all charge states.
