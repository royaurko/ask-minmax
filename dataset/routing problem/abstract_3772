This paper studies the coordinated beamforming (CoBF) design in the
multiple-input single-output interference channel, assuming only channel
distribution information given a priori at the transmitters. The CoBF design is
formulated as an optimization problem that maximizes a predefined system
utility, e.g., the weighted sum rate or the weighted max-min-fairness (MMF)
rate, subject to constraints on the individual probability of rate outage and
power budget. While the problem is non-convex and appears difficult to handle
due to the intricate outage probability constraints, so far it is still unknown
if this outage constrained problem is computationally tractable. To answer
this, we conduct computational complexity analysis of the outage constrained
CoBF problem. Specifically, we show that the outage constrained CoBF problem
with the weighted sum rate utility is intrinsically difficult, i.e., NP-hard.
Moreover, the outage constrained CoBF problem with the weighted MMF rate
utility is also NP-hard except the case when all the transmitters are equipped
with single antenna. The presented analysis results confirm that efficient
approximation methods are indispensable to the outage constrained CoBF problem.
