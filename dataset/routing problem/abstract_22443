We prove results concerning the representation of a given distribution by
means of a given random quantity. The existence of a solution to this problem
is related to the notion of conglomerability, originally introduced by Dubins
to study finitely additive conditional probability. We show that this property
has many interesting applications in probability as well as in analysis.
