We study the complexity of computation in finitely generated free left, right
and two-sided adequate semigroups and monoids. We present polynomial time
(quadratic in the RAM model of computation) algorithms to solve the word
problem and compute normal forms in each of these, and hence also to test
whether any given identity holds in the classes of left, right and/or two-sided
adequate semigroups.
