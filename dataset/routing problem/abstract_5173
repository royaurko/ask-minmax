In a column-restricted covering integer program (CCIP), all the non-zero
entries of any column of the constraint matrix are equal. Such programs capture
capacitated versions of covering problems. In this paper, we study the
approximability of CCIPs, in particular, their relation to the integrality gaps
of the underlying 0,1-CIP.
  If the underlying 0,1-CIP has an integrality gap O(gamma), and assuming that
the integrality gap of the priority version of the 0,1-CIP is O(omega), we give
a factor O(gamma + omega) approximation algorithm for the CCIP. Priority
versions of 0,1-CIPs (PCIPs) naturally capture quality of service type
constraints in a covering problem.
  We investigate priority versions of the line (PLC) and the (rooted) tree
cover (PTC) problems. Apart from being natural objects to study, these problems
fall in a class of fundamental geometric covering problems. We bound the
integrality of certain classes of this PCIP by a constant. Algorithmically, we
give a polytime exact algorithm for PLC, show that the PTC problem is APX-hard,
and give a factor 2-approximation algorithm for it.
