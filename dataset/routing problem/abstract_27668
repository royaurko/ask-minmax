We use an isotropic harmonic map representation of Willmore surfaces to solve
the analogue of Bj\"orling's problem for such surfaces. Specifically, given a
real analytic curve $y_0$ in $S^3$, together with the prescription of the
values of the surface normal and the dual Willmore surface along the curve,
lifted to the light cone in Minkowski $5$-space $R^5_1$, we prove that there
exists a unique pair of dual Willmore surfaces $y$ and $\hat y$ satisfying the
given values along the curve. We give explicit formulae for the generalized
Weierstrass data for the surface pair. Similar results are derived for
S-Willmore surfaces in higher codimensions. For the three dimensional target,
we use the solution to explicitly describe the Weierstrass data, in terms of
geometric quantities, for all equivariant Willmore surfaces.
