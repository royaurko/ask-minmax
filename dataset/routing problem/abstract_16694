Sweeping is a powerful and versatile method of designing objects. Boundary of
volumes (henceforth envelope) obtained by sweeping solids have been extensively
investigated in the past, though, obtaining an accurate parametrization of the
envelope remained computationally hard. The present work reports our approach
to this problem as well as the important problem of identifying
self-intersections within the envelope. Parametrization of the envelope is, of
course, necessary for its use in most current CAD systems. We take the more
interesting case when the solid is composed of several faces meeting smoothly.
We show that the face structure of the envelope mimics locally that of the
solid. We adopt the procedural approach at defining the geometry in this work
which has the advantage of being accurate as well as computationally efficient.
The problem of detecting local self-intersections is central to a robust
implementation of the solid sweep. This has been addressed by computing a
subtle mathematical invariant which detects self-intersections, and which is
computationally benign and requires only point queries.
