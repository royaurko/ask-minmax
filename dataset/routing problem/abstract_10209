In this paper, we consider the tensor generalized eigenvalue complementarity
problem (TGEiCP), which is an interesting generalization of matrix eigenvalue
complementarity problem (EiCP). First, we given an affirmative result showing
that TGEiCP is solvable and has at least one solution under some reasonable
assumptions. Then, we introduce two optimization reformulations of TGEiCP,
thereby beneficially establishing an upper bound of cone eigenvalues of
tensors. Moreover, some new results concerning the bounds of number of
eigenvalues of TGEiCP further enrich the theory of TGEiCP. Last but not least,
an implementable projection algorithm for solving TGEiCP is also developed for
the problem under consideration. As an illustration of our theoretical results,
preliminary computational results are reported.
