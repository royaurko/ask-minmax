In this paper, we establish a unilateral global bifurcation result from
interval for a class of $p$-Laplacian problems. By applying the above result,
we study the spectrum of a class of half-quasilinear problems. Moreover, we
also investigate the existence of nodal solutions for a class of
half-quasilinear eigenvalue problems.
