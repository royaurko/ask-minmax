We describe the moduli spaces of meromorphic connections on trivial
holomorphic vector bundles over the Riemann sphere with at most one
(unramified) irregular singularity and arbitrary number of simple poles as
Nakajima's quiver varieties. This result enables us to solve partially the
additive irregular Deligne-Simpson problem.
