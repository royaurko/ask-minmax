We study the meson sector of 2+1 dimensional light-front QCD using a Bloch
effective Hamiltonian in the first non-trivial order. The resulting two
dimensional integral equation is converted into a matrix equation and solved
numerically. We investigate the efficiency of Gaussian quadrature in achieving
the cancellation of linear and logarithmic light-front infrared divergences.
The vanishing energy denominator problem which leads to severe infrared
divergences in 2+1 dimensions is investigated in detail. Our study indicates
that in the context of Fock space based effective Hamiltonian methods to tackle
gauge theories in 2+1 dimensions, approaches like similarity renormalization
method may be mandatory due to uncanceled infrared divergences caused by the
vanishing energy denominator problem. We define and study numerically a reduced
model which is relativistic, free from infrared divergences, and exhibits
logarithmic confinement. The manifestation and violation of rotational symmetry
as a function of the coupling are studied quantitatively.
