WO3-xFx (x < 0.45) perovskite-like oxyfluorides were prepared by a chemically
reducing fluorination route using the polymer polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon).
The symmetry of the crystal structures of WO3-xFx changes from monoclinic to
tetragonal to cubic as the fluorine content increases. Fluorine doping changes
insulating WO3 to a metallic conductor, and superconductivity (Tc = 0.4 K) was
discovered in the samples with fluorine contents of 0.41 < x < 0.45. This easy
fluorination method may be applicable to other systems and presents an
opportunity for finding new oxyfluoride superconductors.
