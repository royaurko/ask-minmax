We present a model of slow-roll inflation in the context of effective
Supergravities arising from string theories. The uplifting of the potential (to
generate dS or Minkowski vacua) is provided by the D-term associated to an
anomalous U(1), in a fully consistent and gauge invariant formulation. We
develop a minimal working model which incorporates eternal topological
inflation and complies with observational constraints, avoiding the usual
obstacles to implement successful inflation ("eta problem" and initial
condition problem among others).
