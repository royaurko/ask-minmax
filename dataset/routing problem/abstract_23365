We explore, in the context of the MSSM generalised to admit massive
neutrinos, an extension of the Anomaly Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking solution
for the soft scalar masses to incorporate Fayet-Iliopoulos D-terms. The slepton
mass problem characteristic of the scenario is resolved, and the fermion mass
hierarchy is explained via the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism. FCNC problems are
evaded by a combination of universal doublet charges and Yukawa textures which
are diagonalised by transforming the left-handed fields only.
