We extend the results of a work by L. H\"ormander in 1990 concerning the
resolution of the characteristic Cauchy problem for second order wave equations
with regular first order potentials. The geometrical background of this work
was a spatially compact spacetime with smooth metric. The initial data surface
was spacelike or null at each point and merely Lipschitz. We lower the
regularity hypotheses on the metric and potential and obtain similar results.
The Cauchy problem for a spacelike initial data surface is solved for a
Lipschitz metric and coefficients of the first order potential that are
$L^\infty_\mathrm{loc}$, with the same finite energy solution space as in the
smooth case. We also solve the fully characteristic Cauchy problem with very
slightly more regular metric and potential, namely a ${\cal C}^1$ metric and a
potential with continuous first order terms and locally $L^\infty$ coefficients
for the terms of order 0.
