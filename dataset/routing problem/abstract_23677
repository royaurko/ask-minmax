This paper surveys certain problems involving numerical characters for ideals
I(Z) defining fat points subschemes $Z=m_1p_1+...+m_np_n$ for general points
$p_i\in {\bf P}^2$. It also presents some new results, and includes a suite of
MACAULAY 2 scripts for computing actual or conjectured values of (or bounds on)
these characters. One such script, for example, is findres, which implements an
algorithm due to Fitchett, Harbourne and Holay for computing the syzygy modules
in a minimal free resolution of the ideal I(Z) for any such Z with n<=8; since
findres does not rely on a Gr\"obner basis calculation, it is very fast and can
handle very large multiplicities.
