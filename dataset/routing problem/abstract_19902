For the linear string baryon model with three material points (three quarks)
joined sequentially by the relativistic strings, the class of motions admitting
linearizable boundary conditions is investigated. These motions may be
represented as the Fourier series with eigenfunctions of some boundary-value
problem. The two types of rotational motions are found among the mentioned
class of solutions.
