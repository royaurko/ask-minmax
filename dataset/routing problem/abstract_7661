Path integral (PI) control problems are a restricted class of non-linear
control problems that can be solved formally as a Feyman-Kac path integral and
can be estimated using Monte Carlo sampling. In this contribution we review
path integral control theory in the finite horizon case.
  We subsequently focus on the problem how to compute and represent control
solutions. Within the PI theory, the question of how to compute becomes the
question of importance sampling. Efficient importance samplers are state
feedback controllers and the use of these requires an efficient representation.
Learning and representing effective state-feedback controllers for non-linear
stochastic control problems is a very challenging, and largely unsolved,
problem. We show how to learn and represent such controllers using ideas from
the cross entropy method. We derive a gradient descent method that allows to
learn feed-back controllers using an arbitrary parametrisation. We refer to
this method as the Path Integral Cross Entropy method or PICE. We illustrate
this method for some simple examples.
  The path integral control methods can be used to estimate the posterior
distribution in latent state models. In neuroscience these problems arise when
estimating connectivity from neural recording data using EM. We demonstrate the
path integral control method as an accurate alternative to particle filtering.
