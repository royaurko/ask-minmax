Well-posedness of a free boundary problem for electrostatic
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) is investigated when nonlinear bending
effects are taken into account. The model describes the evolution of the
deflection of an electrically conductive elastic membrane suspended above a
fixed ground plate together with the electrostatic potential in the free domain
between the membrane and the fixed ground plate. The electrostatic potential is
harmonic in that domain and its values are held fixed along the membrane and
the ground plate. The equation for the membrane deflection is a parabolic
quasilinear fourth-order equation, which is coupled to the gradient trace of
the electrostatic potential on the membrane.
