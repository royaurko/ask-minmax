Observations show that 1612 MHz masers of OH/IR stars can fade on a timescale
of a decade. This fading is probably associated with the switch from rapid mass
loss, which is ultimately linked with an internal He-shell flash, to the much
slower mass loss supported by more quiescent conditions. We study the observed
maser decay with a composite computational model, comprising a time-dependent
chemical model of the envelope, and a radiation transfer model which provides
the maser pumping. Our combined model is able to reproduce the rapid decay of
maser intensity, following a sudden drop in the stellar mass-loss rate. The
explanation for the rapid fall in maser emission is not a fall in the OH number
density, or the kinetic temperature in the inverted layers, but the loss of a
radiative pump route which carries population from level 1 to level 4 via
levels 16, 15 and 11. The loss of these pump routes is a result, in turn, of a
greatly reduced energy density of 53 micron radiation.
