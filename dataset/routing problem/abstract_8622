In the paper we study the shape of the fundamental sloshing mode of a liquid
in a container. Our approach is based on a mathematical model which is an
appropriate Steklov eigenvalue problem. We present numerical results, a
physical experiment, photos of a surface of oscillating liquid and also
rigorous mathematical results. We describe the relation of the above problem
with the celebrated hot spots conjecture.
