In evolutionary algorithms a critical parameter that must be tuned is that of
selection pressure. If it is set too low then the rate of convergence towards
the optimum is likely to be slow. Alternatively if the selection pressure is
set too high the system is likely to become stuck in a local optimum due to a
loss of diversity in the population. The recent Fitness Uniform Selection
Scheme (FUSS) is a conceptually simple but somewhat radical approach to
addressing this problem - rather than biasing the selection towards higher
fitness, FUSS biases selection towards sparsely populated fitness levels. In
this paper we compare the relative performance of FUSS with the well known
tournament selection scheme on a range of problems.
