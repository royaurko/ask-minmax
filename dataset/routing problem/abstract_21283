We use classical invariant theory to solve the biholomorphic equivalence
problem for two families of plane curve singularities previously considered in
the literature. Our calculations motivate an intriguing conjecture that
proposes a way of extracting a complete set of invariants of homogeneous plane
curve singularities from their moduli algebras.
