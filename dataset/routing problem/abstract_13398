In this paper we examine spectral properties of a family of periodic singular
Sturm-Liouville problems which are highly non-self-adjoint but have purely real
spectrum. The problem originated from the study of the lubrication
approximation of a viscous fluid film in the inner surface of a rotating
cylinder and has received a substantial amount of attention in recent years.
Our main focus will be the determination of Schatten class inclusions for the
resolvent operator and regularity properties of the associated evolution
equation.
