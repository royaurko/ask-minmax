This essay, originally published in the Sept 1990 Notices of the AMS,
discusses problems of our mathematical education system that often stem from
widespread misconceptions by well-meaning people of the process of learning
mathematics. The essay also discusses ideas for fixing some of the problems.
Most of what I wrote in 1990 remains equally applicable today.
