A rigorous homogenization theory of metamaterials -- artificial periodic
structures judiciously designed to control the propagation of electromagnetic
waves -- is developed. All coarse-grained fields are unambiguously defined and
effective parameters are then derived without any heuristic assumptions. The
theory is an amalgamation of two concepts: Smith & Pendry's physical insight
into field averaging and the mathematical framework of
Whitney-Nedelec-Bossavit-Kotiuga interpolation. All coarse-grained fields are
defined via Whitney forms and satisfy Maxwell's equations exactly. The new
approach is illustrated with several analytical and numerical examples and
agrees well with the established results (e.g. the Maxwell-Garnett formula and
the zero cell-size limit) within the range of applicability of the latter. The
sources of approximation error and the respective suitable error indicators are
clearly identified, along with systematic routes for improving the accuracy
further. The proposed approach should be applicable in areas beyond
metamaterials and electromagnetic waves -- e.g. in acoustics and elasticity.
