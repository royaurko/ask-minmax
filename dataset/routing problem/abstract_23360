We give a pedagogical review of the theory of CP violation with emphasis on
the implications of recent experimental results. The review includes: (i) A
detailed description of how CP violation arises in the Standard Model and in
its extension that allows for neutrino masses; (ii) The formalism of CP
violation in meson decays and its application to various K decays (\epsilon_K,
\epsilon^\prime and K\to\pi\nu\nu), D decays (D\to K\pi and D\to KK) and B
decays (B\to\ell\nu X, B\to\psi K_S and B\to\pi\pi, including a discussion of
the `penguin pollution' problem); (iii) Supersymmetry: the CP problems and the
use of CP violation as a probe of the mechanism of dynamical supersymmetry
breaking.
