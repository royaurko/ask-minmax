We tackle the Riemann-Hilbert problem on the Riemann sphere as stalk-wise
logarithmic modifications of the classical R\"ohrl-Deligne vector bundle. We
show that the solutions of the Riemann-Hilbert problem are in bijection with
some families of local filtrations which are stable under the prescribed
monodromy maps. We introduce the notion of Birkhoff-Grothendieck
trivialisation, and show that its computation corresponds to geodesic paths in
some local affine Bruhat-Tits building. We use this to compute how the type of
a bundle changes under stalk modifications, and give several corresponding
algorithmic procedures.
