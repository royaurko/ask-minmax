This is a work in two parts devoted to solutions of the so-called {\em four
Landau's problems} in Number Theory, listed by Edmund Landau at the 1912
International Congress of Mathematics. In Part I the {\em Goldbach's
conjecture} is proved. (This is the first Landau's problems.) In Part II the
other three Landau's problems are considered and solved too.
