Little Higgs theories are a fascinating new idea to solve the little
hierarchy problem by stabilizing the Higgs mass against one-loop quadratically
divergent radiative corrections. In this talk I give a brief overview of the
idea, focusing mainly on the littlest Higgs model, and present a sampling of
the electroweak precision constraints.
