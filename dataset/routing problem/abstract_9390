We discuss the relic problem of string gas cosmology (SGC) using gravitinos
and magnetic monopoles as examples. Since SGC operates near or at the Hagedorn
temperature, relics are produced copiously; in the absence of dilution, their
abundances are too large. A subsequent phase of reheating can solve the
gravitino problem, but fails to dilute monopoles sufficiently. We propose a
subsequent phase of inflation as the most natural solution to the monopole
problem; unfortunately, inflation marginalizes almost all potential
achievements of SGC, with the exception of a possible explanation of the
dichotomy of space (why did only three dimensions inflate?).
