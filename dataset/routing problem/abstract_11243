I review the strategies which have been developped in recent years to solve
the non-perturbative renormalization problem in lattice field theories.
Although the techniques are general, the focus will be on applications to
lattice QCD. I discuss the momentum subtraction and finite volume schemes, and
their application to scale dependent renormalizations. The problem of finite
renormalizations is illustrated with the example of explicit chiral symmetry
breaking, and I give a short status report concerning Symanzik's improvement
programme to O($a$).
