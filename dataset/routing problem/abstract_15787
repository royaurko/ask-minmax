The asymptotically optimal hypothesis testing problem with the general
sources as the null and alternative hypotheses is studied under
exponential-type error constraints on the first kind of error probability. Our
fundamental philosophy in doing so is first to convert all of the hypothesis
testing problems completely to the pertinent computation problems in the large
deviation-probability theory. It turns out that this kind of methodologically
new approach enables us to establish quite compact general formulas of the
optimal exponents of the second kind of error and correct testing
probabbilities for the general sources including all nonstationary and/or
nonergodic sources with arbitrary abstract alphabet (countable or uncountable).
Such general formulas are presented from the information-spectrum point of
view.
