We revisit the problem of determining dielectric parameters in layered
nematic liquid crystals from polarimetric measurements originally introduced by
Lionheart & Newton. After a detailed analysis of the model, of the scales
involved, and of natural obstacles to the reconstruction of more than one
dielectric parameters, we produce two simple one-dimensional inverse problems
which can be studied without any expertise in liquid crystals. We then confirm
that very little can be recovered about the internal configuration of smooth
dielectric parameters from these measurements, and give a uniqueness result for
one of the two problem, when the unknown parameter satisfies a monotonicity
property. In that case, the available data can be expressed in terms of Laplace
and Hankel transforms.
