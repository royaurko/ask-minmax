Systems driven out of equilibrium can often exhibit behaviour not seen in
systems in thermal equilibrium- for example phase transitions in
one-dimensional systems. In this talk I will review several `condensation'
transitions that occur when a conserved quantity is driven through the system.
Although the condensation is spatial, i.e. a finite fraction of the conserved
quantity condenses into a small spatial region, useful comparison can be made
with usual Bose-Einstein condensation. Amongst some one-dimensional examples I
will discuss the `Bus Route Model' where the condensation corresponds to the
clustering together of buses moving along a bus-route.
