We apply Cartan's method of equivalence to construct invariants of a given
null hypersurface in a Lorentzian space-time. This enables us to fully classify
the internal geometry of such surfaces and hence solve the local equivalence
problem for null hypersurface structures in 4-dimensional Lorentzian
space-times.
