Recent indications of the 125GeV Higgs at the LHC can be explained in a
relatively high-scale SUSY scenario where the sparticle masses are multi-TeV as
is realized in the focus-point region. However, it suffers from the notorious
cosmological Polonyi problem. We argue that the Polonyi problem is solved and
thermal or non-thermal leptogenesis scenario works successfully, if a certain
Polonyi coupling to the inflaton is enhanced by a factor of 10-100.
