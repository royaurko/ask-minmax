In a 1985 commentary to his collected works, Kolmogorov remarked that his
1932 paper "was written in hope that with time, the logic of solution of
problems [i.e., intuitionistic logic] will become a permanent part of a
[standard] course of logic. Creation of a unified logical apparatus dealing
with objects of two types - propositions and problems - was intended." We
construct such a formal system QHC, which is a conservative extension of both
the intuitionistic predicate calculus QH and the classical predicate calculus
QC.
  The only new connectives ? and ! of QHC induce a Galois connection (i.e., a
pair of adjoint functors) between the Lindenbaum algebras of QH and QC.
Kolmogorov's double negation translation of propositions into problems extends
to a retraction of QHC onto QH; whereas Goedel's provability translation of
problems into modal propositions extends to a retraction of QHC onto its
QC+(?!) fragment, identified with the modal logic QS4. The QH+(!?) fragment is
an intuitionistic modal logic whose modality !? is a strict lax modality in the
sense of Aczel - and thus resembles the squash/bracket operation in
intuitionistic type theories.
