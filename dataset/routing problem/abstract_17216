The main purpose of this paper is to show that the multiplication of a
Schubert polynomial of finite type $A$ by a Schur function, which we refer to
as Schubert vs. Schur problem, can be understood from the multiplication in the
space of dual $k$-Schur functions. Using earlier work by the second contributor, we
encode both problems by means of quasisymmetric functions. On the Schubert vs.
Schur side, we study the poset given by the Bergeron-Sottile's $r$-Bruhat
order, along with certain operators associated to this order. On the other
side, we connect this poset with a graph on dual $k$-Schur functions given by
studying the affine grassmannian order of Lam-Lapointe-Morse-Shimozono. Also,
we define operators associated to the graph on dual $k$-Schur functions which
are analogous to the ones given for the Schubert vs. Schur problem.
