Two topics are presented: synchronization games and synchronization costs. In
a synchronization game on a deterministic finite automaton, there are two
players, Alice and Bob, whose moves alternate. Alice wants to synchronize the
given automaton, while Bob aims to make her task as hard as possible. We answer
a few natural questions related to such games. Speaking about synchronization
costs, we consider deterministic automata in which each transition has a
certain price. The problem is whether or not a given automaton can be
synchronized within a given budget. We determine the complexity of this
problem. We also formulate a few open questions.
