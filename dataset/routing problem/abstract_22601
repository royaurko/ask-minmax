The problem of the efficiency of particle acceleration for parabolic poloidal
magnetic field is considered within the approach of steady axisymmetric MHD
flow. For the large Michel magnetization parameter it is possible to linearize
the stream equation near the force-free solution and to solve the problem
self-consistently as was done by Beskin, Kuznetsova and Rafikov (1998) for
monopole magnetic field. It is shown that on the fast magnetosonic surface the
particle Lorentz factor does not exceed the standard value. On the other hand,
in the supersonic region the Lorentz factor grows linearly with the distance
from the rotational axis, reaching almost its maximal value. This corresponds
to almost the full conversion of the Poynting energy flux into the particle
kinetic one.
