In the area of network performance and discovery, network tomography focuses
on reconstructing network properties using only end-to-end measurements at the
application layer. One challenging problem in network tomography is
reconstructing available bandwidth along all links during multiple
source/multiple destination transmissions. The traditional measurement
procedures used for bandwidth tomography are extremely time consuming. We
propose a novel solution to this problem. Our method counts the fragments
exchanged during a BitTorrent broadcast. While this measurement has a high
level of randomness, it can be obtained very efficiently, and aggregated into a
reliable metric. This data is then analyzed with state-of-the-art algorithms,
which reliably reconstruct logical clusters of nodes inter-connected by high
bandwidth, as well as bottlenecks between these logical clusters. Our
experiments demonstrate that the proposed two-phase approach efficiently solves
the presented problem for a number of settings on a complex grid
infrastructure.
