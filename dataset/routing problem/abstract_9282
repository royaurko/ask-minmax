The paper gives a detailed survey of recent results on elliptic problems in
Hilbert spaces of generalized smoothness. The latter are the isotropic
H\"ormander spaces $H^{s,\varphi}:=B_{2,\mu}$, with
$\mu(\xi)=<\xi>^{s}\varphi(<\xi>)$ for $\xi\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$. They are
parametrized by both the real number $s$ and the positive function $\varphi$
varying slowly at $+\infty$ in the Karamata sense. These spaces form the
refined Sobolev scale, which is much finer than the Sobolev scale
${H^{s}}\equiv{H^{s,1}}$ and is closed with respect to the interpolation with a
function parameter. The Fredholm property of elliptic operators and elliptic
boundary-value problems is preserved for this new scale. Theorems of various
type about a solvability of elliptic problems are given. A local refined
smoothness is investigated for solutions to elliptic equations. New sufficient
conditions for the solutions to have continuous derivatives are found. Some
applications to the spectral theory of elliptic operators are given.
