We consider an elastic system containing a small region where the density is
very much higher then elsewhere. Such system possesses two types of
eigenvibrations, which are local and global vibrations. Complete asymptotic
expansions of global eigenvibrations for ordinary differential operator of the
fourth order are constructed using WKB--technique.
