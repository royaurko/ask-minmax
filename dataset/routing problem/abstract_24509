We solve the relativistic Riemann problem in viscous matter using the
relativistic Boltzmann equation and the relativistic causal dissipative
fluid-dynamical approach of Israel and Stewart. Comparisons between these two
approaches clarify and point out the regime of validity of second-order fluid
dynamics in relativistic shock phenomena. The transition from ideal to viscous
shocks is demonstrated by varying the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio
$\eta/s$. We also find that a good agreement between these two approaches
requires a Knudsen number $Kn < 1/2$.
