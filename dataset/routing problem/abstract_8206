The $f(R)$ gravity models formulated in Einstein conformal frame are
equivalent to Einstein gravity together with a minimally coupled scalar field.
The scalar field couples with the matter sector and the coupling term is given
by the conformal factor. We use this interacting model to derive a necessary
condition for alleviating the coincidence problem.
