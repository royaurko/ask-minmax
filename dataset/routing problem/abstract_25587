Consider a dataset of vector-valued observations that consists of noisy
inliers, which are explained well by a low-dimensional subspace, along with
some number of outliers. This work describes a convex optimization problem,
called REAPER, that can reliably fit a low-dimensional model to this type of
data. This approach parameterizes linear subspaces using orthogonal projectors,
and it uses a relaxation of the set of orthogonal projectors to reach the
convex formulation. The paper provides an efficient algorithm for solving the
REAPER problem, and it documents numerical experiments which confirm that
REAPER can dependably find linear structure in synthetic and natural data. In
addition, when the inliers lie near a low-dimensional subspace, there is a
rigorous theory that describes when REAPER can approximate this subspace.
