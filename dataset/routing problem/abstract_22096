We present a paradigm for characterization of artifacts in limited data
tomography problems. In particular, we use this paradigm to characterize
artifacts that are generated in reconstructions from limited angle data with
generalized Radon transforms and general filtered backprojection type
operators. In order to find when visible singularities are imaged, we calculate
the symbol of our reconstruction operator as a pseudodifferential operator.
