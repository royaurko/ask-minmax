The 3-anyon problem is studied using a set of variables recently proposed in
an anyon gauge analysis by Mashkevich, Myrheim, Olaussen, and Rietman (MMOR).
Boundary conditions to be satisfied by the wave functions in order to render
the Hamiltonian self-adjoint are derived, and it is found that the boundary
conditions adopted by MMOR are one of the ways to satisfy these general
self-adjointness requirements. The possibility of scale-dependent boundary
conditions is also investigated, in analogy with the corresponding analyses of
the 2-anyon case. The structure of the known solutions of the 3-anyon in
harmonic potential problem is discussed in terms of the MMOR variables. Within
a series expansion in a boson gauge framework the problem of finding any anyon
wavefunction is reduced to a (possibly infinite) set of algebraic equations,
whose numerical analysis is proposed as an efficient way to study anyon
physics.
