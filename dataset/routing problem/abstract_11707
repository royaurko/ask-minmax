The paper is devoted to classification problem of finite dimensional complex
none Lie filiform Leibniz algebras. The motivation to write this paper is an
unpublished yet result of J.R.Gomez, B.A.Omirov on necessary and sufficient
conditions for two finite dimensional complex filiform Leibniz algebras to be
isomorphic. We suggest another approach to this problem. The approach that we
use for classification is in terms of invariants. In fact, utilizing this
method for any given low dimensional case all filiform Leibniz algebras can be
classified. Moreover, the results can be used for geometrical classification of
orbits of such algebras.
