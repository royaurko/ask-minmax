We have studied folding mechanisms of three small globular proteins: crambin
(CRN), chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) and the fyn Src Homology 3 domain (SH3)
which are modelled by a Go-like Hamiltonian with the Lennard-Jones
interactions. It is shown that folding is dominated by a well-defined
sequencing of events as determined by establishment of particular contacts. The
order of events depends primarily on the geometry of the native state.
Variations in temperature, coupling strengths and viscosity affect the
sequencing scenarios to a rather small extent. The sequencing is strongly
correlated with the distance of the contacting aminoacids along the sequence.
Thus $\alpha$-helices get established first. Crambin is found to behave like a
single-route folder, whereas in CI2 and SH3 the folding trajectories are more
diversified. The folding scenarios for CI2 and SH3 are consistent with
experimental studies of their transition states.
