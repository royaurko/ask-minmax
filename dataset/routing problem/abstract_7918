The aim of this paper is to investigate, as precisely as possible, a boundary
value problem involving a third order ordinary differential equation. Its
solutions are the similarity solutions of a problem arising in the study of the
phenomenon of high frequency excitation of liquid metal systems in an
antisymmetric magnetic field within the framework of boundary layer
approximation.
