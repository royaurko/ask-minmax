Inflation, as currently understood, requires the presence of fields with very
flat potentials. Supersymmetric models in which supersymmetry breaking is
communicated by supergravity naturally yield such fields, but the scales are
typically not suitable for obtaining both sufficient inflation and a suitable
fluctuation spectrum. In the context of recent ideas about gauge mediation,
there are new candidates for the inflaton. We present a simple model for
slow-rollover inflation where the vacuum energy driving inflation is related to
the same F-term responsible for the spectrum of supersymmetric particles in
gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking models. The inflaton is identified with
field responsible for the generation of the $\mu$-term\. This opens the
possibility of getting some knowledge about the low-energy supersymmetric
theory from measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation.
Gravitinos do not pose a cosmological problem, while the moduli problem is
ameliorated.
