We study the problem of adsorption and collapse transition of a linear
polymer chain situated in a fractal container represented by a 4-simplex
lattice and interacting with a surface adsorbed linear polymer chain. The
adsorbed chain monomers act as pinning sites for the polymer chain. This
problem has been solved exactly using real space renormalization group
transformation. The resulting phase diagram and critical exponents are given.
