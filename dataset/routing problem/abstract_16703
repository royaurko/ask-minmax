Most sparse linear representation-based trackers need to solve a
computationally expensive L1-regularized optimization problem. To address this
problem, we propose a visual tracker based on non-sparse linear
representations, which admit an efficient closed-form solution without
sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, in order to capture the correlation information
between different feature dimensions, we learn a Mahalanobis distance metric in
an online fashion and incorporate the learned metric into the optimization
problem for obtaining the linear representation. We show that online metric
learning using proximity comparison significantly improves the robustness of
the tracking, especially on those sequences exhibiting drastic appearance
changes. Furthermore, in order to prevent the unbounded growth in the number of
training samples for the metric learning, we design a time-weighted reservoir
sampling method to maintain and update limited-sized foreground and background
sample buffers for balancing sample diversity and adaptability. Experimental
results on challenging videos demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of
the proposed tracker.
