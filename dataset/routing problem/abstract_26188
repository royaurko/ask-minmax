In the insurance industry, spreadsheets have emerged as an invaluable tool to
for product pricing, because it is relatively straightforward to create and
maintain complex pricing models using Excel. In fact, Excel is often preferred
to "hard-code" whenever there are frequent changes to the calculations and
business logic which under-pin the pricing of an insurance product. However,
problems arise as soon as spreadsheets are deployed to end-users: version
control, security of intellectual property, and ensuring correct usage are
obvious issues; frequently, integration with other systems is also a
requirement. Zurich Financial Services Group is a leading financial services
provider; several possible solutions to these problems have been evaluated, and
EASA has been selected as the preferred technology. Other spreadsheet
collaboration approaches which were considered include Excel Services, and/or
custom-built software; however, EASA has provided clear benefits over these
strategies.
