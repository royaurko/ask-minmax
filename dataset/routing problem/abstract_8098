In 1996 Y. Kifer obtained a variational formula for the Hausdorff dimension
of the set of points for which the frequencies of the digits in the Cantor
series expansion is given. In this note we present a slightly different
approach to this problem that allow us to solve the variational problem of
Kifer's formula.
