We consider a task of scheduling a crawler to retrieve content from several
sites with ephemeral content. A user typically loses interest in ephemeral
content, like news or posts at social network groups, after several days or
hours. Thus, development of timely crawling policy for such ephemeral
information sources is very important. We first formulate this problem as an
optimal control problem with average reward. The reward can be measured in the
number of clicks or relevant search requests. The problem in its initial
formulation suffers from the curse of dimensionality and quickly becomes
intractable even with moderate number of information sources. Fortunately, this
problem admits a Whittle index, which leads to problem decomposition and to a
very simple and efficient crawling policy. We derive the Whittle index and
provide its theoretical justification.
