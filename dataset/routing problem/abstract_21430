A local behavior of solutions of the Schlesinger equation is studied. We
obtain expansions for this solutions, which converge in some neighborhood of a
singular point. As a corollary the similar result for the sixth Painlev\'e
equation was obtained. In our analysis, we use the isomonodromic approach to
solve this problem.
