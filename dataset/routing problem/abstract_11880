We adapt continuous time random walk (CTRW) formalism to describe asset price
evolution and discuss some of the problems that can be treated using this
approach. We basically focus on two aspects: (i) the derivation of the price
distribution from high-frequency data, and (ii) the inverse problem, obtaining
information on the market microstructure as reflected by high-frequency data
knowing only the daily volatility. We apply the formalism to financial data to
show that the CTRW offers alternative tools to deal with several complex issues
of financial markets.
