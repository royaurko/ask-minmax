Answering a problem raised by Lazarsfeld, Hwang and Mok proved that a
surjective holomorphic map from a rational homogeneous space of Picard number 1
onto projective manifold different from projective space must be a
biholomorphism. THe aim of this paper is to generalized this result to
irreducible rational homogeneous space of higher Picard number.
