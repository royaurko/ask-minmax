We explore the relationship between the Evans function, transmission
coefficient and Fredholm determinant for systems of first order linear
differential operators on the real line. The applications we have in mind
include linear stability problems associated with travelling wave solutions to
nonlinear partial differential equations, for example reaction-diffusion or
solitary wave equations. The Evans function and transmission coefficient, which
are both finite determinants, are natural tools for both analytic and numerical
determination of eigenvalues of such linear operators. However, inverting the
eigenvalue problem by the free state operator generates a natural linear
integral eigenvalue problem whose solvability is determined through the
corresponding infinite Fredholm determinant. The relationship between all three
determinants has received a lot of recent attention. We focus on the case when
the underlying Fredholm operator is a trace class perturbation of the identity.
Our new results include: (i) clarification of the sense in which the Evans
function and transmission coefficient are equivalent; and (ii) proof of the
equivalence of the transmission coefficient and Fredholm determinant, in
particular in the case of distinct far fields.
