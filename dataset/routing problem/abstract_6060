We study the minimum connected sensor cover problem (\mincsc) and the
budgeted connected sensor cover (\bcsc) problem, both motivated by important
applications in wireless sensor networks. In both problems, we are given a set
of sensors and a set of target points in the Euclidean plane. In \mincsc, our
goal is to find a set of sensors of minimum cardinality, such that all target
points are covered, and all sensors can communicate with each other (i.e., the
communication graph is connected). We obtain a constant factor approximation
algorithm, assuming that the ratio between the sensor radius and communication
radius is bounded. In \bcsc\ problem, our goal is to choose a set of $B$
sensors, such that the number of targets covered by the chosen sensors is
maximized and the communication graph is connected. We also obtain a constant
approximation under the same assumption.
