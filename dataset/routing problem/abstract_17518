We investigate two systems of fully proportional representation suggested by
Chamberlin Courant and Monroe. Both systems assign a representative to each
voter so that the "sum of misrepresentations" is minimized. The winner
determination problem for both systems is known to be NP-hard, hence this work
aims at investigating whether there are variants of the proposed rules and/or
specific electorates for which these problems can be solved efficiently. As a
variation of these rules, instead of minimizing the sum of misrepresentations,
we considered minimizing the maximal misrepresentation introducing effectively
two new rules. In the general case these "minimax" versions of classical rules
appeared to be still NP-hard. We investigated the parameterized complexity of
winner determination of the two classical and two new rules with respect to
several parameters. Here we have a mixture of positive and negative results:
e.g., we proved fixed-parameter tractability for the parameter the number of
candidates but fixed-parameter intractability for the number of winners. For
single-peaked electorates our results are overwhelmingly positive: we provide
polynomial-time algorithms for most of the considered problems. The only rule
that remains NP-hard for single-peaked electorates is the classical Monroe
rule.
