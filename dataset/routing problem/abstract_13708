In this paper we investigate a problem proposed by Marco Buratti, Peter Horak
and Alex Rosa (denoted by BHR-problem) concerning Hamiltonian paths in the
complete graph with prescribed edge-lengths. In particular we solve
BHR({1^a,2^b,t^c}) for any even integer t>=4, provided that a+b>=t-1.
Furthermore, for t=4,6,8 we present a complete solution of BHR({1^a,2^b,t^c})
for any positive integer a,b,c.
