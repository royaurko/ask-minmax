Due to their extraordinary physical and chemical properties carbon nanotubes
reveal a promising potential as biomedical agents for heating, temperature
sensoring and drug delivery on the cellular level. Filling carbon nanotubes
with tailored materials realises nanoscaled containers in which the active
content is encapsulated by a protecting carbon shell. We describe different
synthesis routes and show the structural and magnetic properties of carbon
nanotubes. In particular, the filling with magnetic materials offers the
potential for hyperthermia applications while the insertion of NMR active
substances allows the usage as markers and sensors. The potential of carbon
nanotubes for biomedical applications is highlighted by hyperthermia studies
which prove their applicability for local in-situ heating. In addition we have
shown that a non-invasive temperature control by virtue of a carbon-wrapped
nanoscaled thermometer and filling with anti-cancer drugs is possible.
