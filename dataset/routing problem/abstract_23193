We develop a consistent approach to Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory, using
the maximal-tree gauge. The various constraints are discussed and implemented.
An independent and complete set of variables for the colourless sector is
determined. A general scheme to construct the eigenstates of the electric
energy operator using a symbolic method is described. It is shown how the
one-plaquette problem can be mapped onto a N-fermion problem. Explicit
solutions for U(1), SU(2), SU(3), SU(4), and SU(5) lattice gauge theory are
shown.
