The theory of p-adic strings is reviewed along with some of their
applications, foremost among them to the tachyon condensation problem in string
theory. Some open problems are discussed, in particular that of the superstring
in 10 dimensions as the end-stage of the 26-dimensional closed bosonic string's
tachyon condensation.
