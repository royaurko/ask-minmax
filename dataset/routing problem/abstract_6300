We present a variational algorithm for solving the classical inverse
Sturm-Liouville problem in one dimension when two spectra are given. All
critical points of the least squares functional are at global minima, which
which suggests minimization by a (conjugate) gradient descent algorithm.
Numerical examples show that the resulting algorithm works quite reliable
without tuning for particular cases, even in the presence of noise. With the
right choice of parameters the minimization procedure converges very quickly.
