One can reduce the problem of proving that a polynomial is nonnegative, or
more generally of proving that a system of polynomial inequalities has no
solutions, to finding polynomials that are sums of squares of polynomials and
satisfy some linear equality (Positivstellensatz). This produces a witness for
the desired property, from which it is reasonably easy to obtain a formal proof
of the property suitable for a proof assistant such as Coq. The problem of
finding a witness reduces to a feasibility problem in semidefinite programming,
for which there exist numerical solvers. Unfortunately, this problem is in
general not strictly feasible, meaning the solution can be a convex set with
empty interior, in which case the numerical optimization method fails.
Previously published methods thus assumed strict feasibility; we propose a
workaround for this difficulty. We implemented our method and illustrate its
use with examples, including extractions of proofs to Coq.
