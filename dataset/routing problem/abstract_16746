Given a coloring of the edges of a multi-hypergraph, a rainbow t-matching is
a collection of t disjoint edges, each having a different color. In this note
we study the problem of finding a rainbow $t$-matching in an r-partite
r-uniform multi-hypergraph whose edges are colored with f colors such that
every color class is a matching of size t. This problem was posed by Aharoni
and Berger, who asked to determine the minimum number of colors which
guarantees a rainbow matching. We improve on the known upper bounds for this
problem for all values of the parameters. In particular for every fixed r, we
give an upper bound which is polynomial in t, improving the superexponential
estimate of Alon. Our proof also works in the setting not requiring the
hypergraph to be r-partite.
