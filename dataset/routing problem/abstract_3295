In this paper we present several examples of solving algorithmic problems
from the Google Code Jam programming contest with Picat programming language
using declarative techniques: constraint logic programming and tabled logic
programming. In some cases the use of Picat simplifies the implementation
compared to conventional imperative programming languages, while in others it
allows to directly convert the problem statement into an efficiently solvable
declarative problem specification without inventing an imperative algorithm.
