The celebrated problem of a non-homogeneous sphere rolling over a horizontal
plane was proved to be integrable and was reduced to quadratures by Chaplygin.
Applying the formalism of variational integrators (discrete Lagrangian systems)
with nonholonomic constraints and introducing suitable discrete constraints, we
construct a discretization of the n-dimensional generalization of the Chaplygin
sphere problem, which preserves the same first integrals as the continuous
model, except the energy. We then study the discretization of the classical
3-dimensional problem for a class of special initial conditions, when an analog
of the energy integral does exist and the corresponding map is given by an
addition law on elliptic curves. The existence of the invariant measure in this
case is also discussed.
