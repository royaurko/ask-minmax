In the analysis of complex, nonlinear time series, scientists in a variety of
disciplines have relied on a time delayed embedding of their data, i.e.
attractor reconstruction. The process has focused primarily on heuristic and
empirical arguments for selection of the key embedding parameters, delay and
embedding dimension. This approach has left several long-standing, but common
problems unresolved in which the standard approaches produce inferior results
or give no guidance at all. We view the current reconstruction process as
unnecessarily broken into separate problems. We propose an alternative approach
that views the problem of choosing all embedding parameters as being one and
the same problem addressable using a single statistical test formulated
directly from the reconstruction theorems. This allows for varying time delays
appropriate to the data and simultaneously helps decide on embedding dimension.
A second new statistic, undersampling, acts as a check against overly long time
delays and overly large embedding dimension. Our approach is more flexible than
those currently used, but is more directly connected with the mathematical
requirements of embedding. In addition, the statistics developed guide the user
by allowing optimization and warning when embedding parameters are chosen
beyond what the data can support. We demonstrate our approach on uni- and
multivariate data, data possessing multiple time scales, and chaotic data. This
unified approach resolves all the main issues in attractor reconstruction.
