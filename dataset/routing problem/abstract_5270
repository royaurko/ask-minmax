Embedded boundary methods alleviate many computational challenges, including
those associated with meshing complex geometries and solving problems with
evolving domains and interfaces. Developing model reduction methods for
computational frameworks based on such methods seems however to be challenging.
Indeed, most popular model reduction techniques are projection-based, and rely
on basis functions obtained from the compression of simulation snapshots. In a
traditional interface-fitted computational framework, the computation of such
basis functions is straightforward, primarily because the computational domain
does not contain in this case a fictitious region. This is not the case however
for an embedded computational framework because the computational domain
typically contains in this case both real and ghost regions whose definitions
complicate the collection and compression of simulation snapshots. The problem
is exacerbated when the interface separating both regions evolves in time. This
paper addresses this issue by formulating the snapshot compression problem as a
weighted low-rank approximation problem where the binary weighting identifies
the evolving component of the individual simulation snapshots. The proposed
approach is application independent and therefore comprehensive. It is
successfully demonstrated for the model reduction of several two-dimensional,
vortex-dominated, fluid-structure interaction problems.
