We study the quantization problem for certain types of jump processes. The
probabilities for the number of jumps are assumed to be bounded by Poisson
weights. Otherwise, jump positions and increments can be rather generally
distributed and correlated. We show in particular that in many cases entropy
coding error and quantization error have distinct rates. Finally, we
investigate the quantization problem for the special case of
$\mathbb{R}^d$-valued compound Poisson processes.
