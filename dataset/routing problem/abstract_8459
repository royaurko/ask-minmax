We consider the solid angle that a planar compact subset subtends at a point
in a level set of height h and study two extremal problems for the solid angle.
One of the variables is a point in such a plane, that is, we study the
properties of the solid angle maximizer. The other is the pair of a planar
compact subset and a point.
