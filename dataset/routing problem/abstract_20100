This manuscript is an introduction to the theory of holomorphic foliations on
the complex projective plane. Historically the subject has emerged from the
theory of ODEs in the complex domain and various attempts to solve Hilbert's
16th Problem, but with the introduction of complex algebraic geometry,
foliation theory and dynamical systems, it has now become an interesting
subject of its own.
