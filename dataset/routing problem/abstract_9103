During the MaxEnt 2002 workshop in Moscow, Idaho, Tony Vignaux asked again a
few simple questions about using Maximum Entropy or Bayesian approaches for the
famous Dice problems which have been analyzed many times through this workshop
and also in other places. Here, there is another analysis of these problems. I
hope that, this paper will answer a few questions of Tony and other
participants of the workshop on the situations where we can use Maximum Entropy
or Bayesian approaches or even the cases where we can actually use both of
them.
  Keywords: Dice problems and probability theory, Maximum Likelihood, Bayesian
inference, Maximum A Posteriori, Entropy, Maximum entropy, Maximum entropy in
the mean.
