In this expository paper, which covers material presented at the NATO
Advanced Study Institute "Nonlinear Analysis, Differential Equations, and
Control" (Montreal, Jul/Aug 1998), we deal with several questions related to
stability and stabilization of nonlinear finite-dimensional continuous-time
systems.
  We review the basic problem of feedback stabilization, placing an emphasis
upon relatively new areas of research which concern stability with respect to
"noise" (such as errors introduced by actuators or sensors).
  The table of contents is as follows:
  Review of Stability and Asymptotic Controllability
  The Problem of Stabilization
  Obstructions to Continuous Stabilization
  Control-Lyapunov Functions and Artstein's Theorem
  Discontinuous Feedback
  Nonsmooth CLF's
  Insensitivity to Small Measurement and Actuator Errors
  Effect of Large Disturbances: Input-to-State Stability
