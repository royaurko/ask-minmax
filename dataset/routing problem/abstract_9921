The main purpose of this work is to address the question of the utility of
"effective constitutive relations" for problems in dynamics. This is done in
the context of longitudinal shear waves in an elastic medium that is
periodically laminated, with attention restricted to plane waves propagating in
the direction normal to the interfaces. The properties of such waves can be
found by employing Floquet theory, implemented via a "transfer matrix"
formulation. Problems occur at frequencies beyond those that define the first
pass band, associated in part with the difficulty of assigning a unique
wavenumber to the wave. This problem is examined, paying careful attention to
the requirements of causality and passivity. The transmission of waves into a
half-space is discussed by studying the impedance of the half-space, both
directly and in the "effective medium" approximation, and an alternative way of
looking at this problem, based on construction of the Green's function, is
developed.
