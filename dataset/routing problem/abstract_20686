A model where a Dirac fermion is coupled to background dilaton field is
considered to study s-wave scattering of fermion by a background dilaton black
hole. It is found that the anomaly plays a dual role on information loss
scenario. Some time it protects the fermion from the dangerous information loss
problem and some times it itself through it up towards that danger.
