We consider in this note the Hamilton-Jacobi equation H(x, dx u) = c, where c
\geq 0, of the classical N-body problem in an Euclidean space E of dimension k
\geq 2. The fixed points of the Lax-Oleinik semigroup are global viscosity
solutions for the critical value of the constant (c = 0) also called weak KAM
solutions. We show that all these solutions are invariant under the action of E
by translations on the space of configurations. We deduce the existence of
non-invariant solutions for the super-critical equations (c > 0).
