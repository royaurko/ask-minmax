Despite of the importance of access to computers and to the Internet for the
development of people and their inclusion in society, there are people that
still suffer with digital divide and social exclusion.
Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) can help the digital/social
inclusion of these people as it allows opportunistic and asynchronous
communication, which does not depend upon networking infrastructure. We
introduce SocialDTN, an implementation of the DTN architecture for Android
devices that operates over Bluetooth, taking advantages of the social daily
routines of users. As we want to exploit the social proximity and interactions
existing among users, SocialDTN includes a social-aware opportunistic routing
proposal, dLife, instead of the well-known (but social-oblivious) PROPHET.
Simulations show the potential of dLife for our needs. Additionally, some
preliminary results from field experimentations are presented.
