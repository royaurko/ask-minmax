To handle with inverse problems, two probabilistic approaches have been
proposed: the maximum entropy on the mean (MEM) and the Bayesian estimation
(BAYES). The main object of this presentation is to compare these two
approaches which are in fact two different inference procedures to define the
solution of an inverse problem as the optimizer of a compound criterion.
