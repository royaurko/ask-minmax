This paper unravels the problem of an idealised pile-up of n infinite,
equi-spaced walls of edge dislocations at equilibrium. We define a
dimensionless parameter that depends on the geometric, constitutive and loading
parameters of the problem, and we identify five different scaling regimes
corresponding to different values of that parameter for large n. For each of
the cases we perform a rigorous micro-to-meso upscaling, and we obtain five
expressions for the mesoscopic (continuum) internal stress. We recover some
expressions for the internal stress that are already in use in the mechanical
community, as well as some new models. The results in this paper offer a
unifying approach to such models, since they can be viewed as the outcome of
the same discrete dislocation setup, for different values of the dimensionless
parameter (i.e., for different local dislocations arrangements). In addition,
the rigorous nature of the upscaling removes the need for ad hoc assumptions.
