Among the suggested solutions to the cosmological constant problem, we find
the idea of a dynamic vacuum, with an energy density decaying with the universe
expansion. We investigate the possibility of a variation in the gravitational
constant as well, induced, at the cosmological scale, by the vacuum decay. We
consider an effective Brans-Dicke theory in the spatially flat FLRW spacetime,
finding late time solutions characterized by a constant ratio between the
matter and vacuum energy densities. By using the observed limits for the
universe age, we fix the only free parameter of our solutions, obtaining a
relative matter density in the range 0.25-0.4. In particular, for Ht = 1 we
obtain a relative matter density equals to 1/3. This constitutes a possible
explanation for another problem related to the cosmological term, the cosmic
coincidence problem.
