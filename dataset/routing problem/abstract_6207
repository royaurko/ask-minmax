I discuss the recent controversy over the semileptonic branching ratio of the
$B$ meson, pointing out that it is only the combination of this quantity with
the reported charm multiplicity in $B$ decays which is in serious conflict with
theoretical calculations. I consider possible solutions to the problem.

Problems in Particle Theory, Florence, Italy, August 31--September 2, 1994.)
