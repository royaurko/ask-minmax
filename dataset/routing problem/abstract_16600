In this work we present an introduction to Supersymmetry in the context of
1-dimensional Quantum Mechanics. For that purpose we develop the concept of
hamiltonians factorization using the simple harmonic oscillator as an example,
we introduce the supersymmetric oscilator and, next, we generalize these
concepts to introduce the fundamentals of Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics. We
also discuss useful tools to solve problems in Quantum Mechanics which are
intrinsecally related to Supersymmetry as hierarchy of hamiltonians and shape
invariance. We present two approximation methods which will be specially
useful: the well known Variational Method and the Logarithmic Perturbation
Theory, the latter being closely related to the concepts of superpotentials and
hierarchy of hamiltonians. Finally, we present problems related to
superpotentials which are monomials in even powers of the x coordinate
multiplied by the sign function epsilon(x), which seems to be a new class of
problems in Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics.
