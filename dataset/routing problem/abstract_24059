We study the laser cooling of one atom in an harmonic trap beyond the
Lamb-Dicke regime. By using sequences of laser pulses of different detunings we
show that the atom can be confined into just one state of the trap, either the
ground state or an excited state of the harmonic potential. The last can be
achieved because under certain conditions an excited state becomes a dark
state. We study the problem in one and two dimensions. For the latter case a
new cooling mechanism is possible, based on the destructive interference
between the effects of laser fields in different directions, which allows the
creation of variety of dark states. For both, one and two dimensional cases,
Monte Carlo simulations of the cooling dynamics are presented.
