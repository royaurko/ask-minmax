In this paper, we strengthen the competitive analysis results obtained for a
fundamental online streaming problem, the Frequent Items Problem. Additionally,
we contribute with a more detailed analysis of this problem, using alternative
performance measures, supplementing the insight gained from competitive
analysis. The results also contribute to the general study of performance
measures for online algorithms. It has long been known that competitive
analysis suffers from drawbacks in certain situations, and many alternative
measures have been proposed. However, more systematic comparative studies of
performance measures have been initiated recently, and we continue this work,
using competitive analysis, relative interval analysis, and relative worst
order analysis on the Frequent Items Problem.
