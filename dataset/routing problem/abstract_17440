We deal with the existence of quantitative estimates for solutions of mixed
problems to an elliptic second order equation in divergence form with
discontinuous coefficient. Our concern is to estimate the solutions with
explicit constants, for domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$ ($n\geq 2$) of class
$C^{0,1}$. The existence of $L^\infty$ and $W^{1,q}$-estimates is assured for
$q=2$ and any $q<n/(n-1)$ (depending on the data), whenever the coefficient is
only measurable and bounded. The proof method of the quantitative
$L^\infty$-estimates is based on the DeGiorgi technique developed by
Stampacchia. By using the potential theory, we derive $W^{1,p}$-estimates for
different ranges of the exponent $p$ depending on that the coefficient is
either Dini-continuous or only measurable and bounded. In this process, we
establish new existences of Green functions on such domains. The last but not
least concern is to unify (whenever possible) the proofs of the estimates to
the extreme Dirichlet and Neumann cases of the mixed problem.
