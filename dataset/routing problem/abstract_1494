We consider possible routes to superconductivity in hydrated cobaltates
Na_xCoO_2.yH_2O on the basis of the t-J-V model plus phonons on the triangular
lattice. We studied the stability conditions for the homogeneous Fermi liquid
(HFL) phase against different broken symmetry phases. Besides the
sqrt(3)xsqrt(3)-CDW phase, triggered by the nearest-neighbour Coulomb
interaction V, we have found that the HFL is unstable, at very low doping,
against a bond-ordered phase due to J. We also discuss the occurrence of phase
separation at low doping and V. The interplay between the electron-phonon
interaction and correlations near the sqrt(3)xsqrt(3)-CDW leads to
superconductivity in the unconventional next-nearest neighbour f-wave (NNN-f)
channel with a dome shape for Tc around x ~ 0.35, and with values of a few
Kelvin as seen in experiments. Near the bond-ordered phase at low doping we
found tendencies to superconductivity with d-wave symmetry for finite J and
x<0.15. Contact with experiments is given along the paper.
