Multi-objective optimisation is regarded as one of the most promising ways
for dealing with constrained optimisation problems in evolutionary
optimisation. This paper presents a theoretical investigation of a
multi-objective optimisation evolutionary algorithm for solving the 0-1
knapsack problem. Two initialisation methods are considered in the algorithm:
local search initialisation and greedy search initialisation. Then the solution
quality of the algorithm is analysed in terms of the approximation ratio.
