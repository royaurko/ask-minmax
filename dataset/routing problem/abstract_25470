We initiate the study of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) in the
presence of counting quantifiers, which may be seen as variants of CSPs in the
mould of quantified CSPs (QCSPs). We show that a single counting quantifier
strictly between exists^1:=exists and exists^n:=forall (the domain being of
size n) already affords the maximal possible complexity of QCSPs (which have
both exists and forall), being Pspace-complete for a suitably chosen template.
Next, we focus on the complexity of subsets of counting quantifiers on clique
and cycle templates. For cycles we give a full trichotomy -- all such problems
are in L, NP-complete or Pspace-complete. For cliques we come close to a
similar trichotomy, but one case remains outstanding. Afterwards, we consider
the generalisation of CSPs in which we augment the extant quantifier
exists^1:=exists with the quantifier exists^j (j not 1). Such a CSP is already
NP-hard on non-bipartite graph templates. We explore the situation of this
generalised CSP on bipartite templates, giving various conditions for both
tractability and hardness -- culminating in a classification theorem for
general graphs. Finally, we use counting quantifiers to solve the complexity of
a concrete QCSP whose complexity was previously open.
