We are going back to the roots of the original solar neutrino problem:
analysis of data from solar neutrino experiments. The application of standard
deviation analysis (SDA) and diffusion entropy analysis (DEA) to the
SuperKamiokande I and II data reveals that they represent a non-Gaussian
signal. The Hurst exponent is different from the scaling exponent of the
probability density function and both Hurst exponent and scaling exponent of
the probability density function of the SuperKamiokande data deviate
considerably from the value of 0.5 which indicates that the statistics of the
underlying phenomenon is anomalous. To develop a road to the possible
interpretation of this finding we utilize Mathai's pathway model and consider
fractional reaction and fractional diffusion as possible explanations of the
non-Gaussian content of the SuperKamiokande data.
