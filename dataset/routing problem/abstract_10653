Let $A$ be a sequence of $n \geq 0$ real numbers. A subsequence of $A$ is a
sequence of contiguous elements of $A$. A \emph{maximum scoring subsequence} of
$A$ is a subsequence with largest sum of its elements, which can be found in
O(n) time by Kadane's dynamic programming algorithm. We consider in this paper
two problems involving maximal scoring subsequences of a sequence. Both of
these problems arise in the context of buffer memory minimization in computer
networks. The first one, which is called {\sc Insertion in a Sequence with
Scores (ISS)}, consists in inserting a given real number $x$ in $A$ in such a
way to minimize the sum of a maximum scoring subsequence of the resulting
sequence, which can be easily done in $O(n^2)$ time by successively applying
Kadane's algorithm to compute the maximum scoring subsequence of the resulting
sequence corresponding to each possible insertion position for $x$. We show in
this paper that the ISS problem can be solved in linear time and space with a
more specialized algorithm. The second problem we consider in this paper is the
{\sc Sorting a Sequence by Scores (SSS)} one, stated as follows: find a
permutation $A'$ of $A$ that minimizes the sum of a maximum scoring
subsequence. We show that the SSS problem is strongly NP-Hard and give a
2-approximation algorithm for it.
