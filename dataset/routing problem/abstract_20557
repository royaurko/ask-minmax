We study the smoothness of the density of a semilinear heat equation with
multiplicative spacetime white noise. Using Malliavin calculus, we reduce the
problem to a question of negative moments of solutions of a linear heat
equation with multiplicative white noise. Then we settle this question by
proving that solutions to the linear equation have negative moments of all
orders.
