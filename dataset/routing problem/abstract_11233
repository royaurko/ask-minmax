We present an application of the standard Langevin dynamics to the problem of
weak coupling perturbative expansions for Lattice QCD. This method can be
applied to the computation of the most general observables. In this preliminary
work we will concentrate in particular on the computation of the perturbative
terms of the $1\times 1$ Wilson loop, up to fourth order. It is shown that a
stochastic gauge fixing is a possible solution to the problem of divergent
fluctuations which affect higher order coefficients.
