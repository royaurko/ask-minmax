We show that the Kth largest subset problem and the Kth largest m-tuple
problem are in PP and hard for PP under polynomial-time Turing reductions.
Several problems from the literature were previously shown NP-hard via
reductions from those two problems, and by our main result they become PP-hard
as well. We also provide complementary PP-upper bounds for some of them.
