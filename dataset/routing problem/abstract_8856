The use of quadratic forms of the empirical process for the two-sample
problem in the context of functional data is considered. The convergence of the
family of statistics proposed to a Gaussian limit is established under metric
entropy conditions for smooth functional data. The applicability of the
proposed methodology is evaluated in examples.
