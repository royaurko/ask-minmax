This paper provides a quantitative version of the recent result of Kn\"upfer
and Muratov ({\it Commun. Pure Appl. Math.} {\bf 66} (2013), 1129--1162)
concerning the solutions of an extension of the classical isoperimetric problem
in which a non-local repulsive term involving Riesz potential is present. There
it was shown that in two space dimensions the minimizer of the considered
problem is either a ball or does not exist, depending on whether or not the
volume constraint lies in an explicit interval around zero, provided that the
Riesz kernel decays sufficiently slowly. Here we give an explicit estimate for
the exponents of the Riesz kernel for which the result holds.
