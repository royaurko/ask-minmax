We define a cellular automaton where a resting cell excites if number of its
excited neighbours belong to some specified interval and boundaries of the
interval change depending on ratio of excited and refractory neighbours in the
cell's neighbourhood. We calculate excitability of a cell as a number of
possible neighbourhood configurations that excite the resting cell. We call
cells with maximal values of excitability conductive. In exhaustive search of
functions of excitation interval updates we select functions which lead to
formation of connected configurations of conductive cells. The functions
discovered are used to design conductive, wire-like, pathways in initially
non-conductive arrays of cells. We demonstrate that by positioning seeds of
growing conductive pathways it is possible to implement a wide range of routing
operations, including reflection of wires, stopping wires, formation of
conductive bridges and generation of new wires in the result of collision. The
findings presented may be applied in designing conductive circuits in excitable
non-linear media, reaction-diffusion chemical systems, neural tissue and
assembles of conductive polymers.
