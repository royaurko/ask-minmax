A Backlund transformation(BT) and a recurrence formula are derived by the
homogeneous balance(HB) method. A initial problem of Burgers equations is
reduced to a initial problem of heat equation by the BT, the initial problem of
heat equation is resolved by the Fourier transformation method, substituting
various solutions of the initial problem of the heat equation will yield
solutions of the initial problem of the Burgers equations.
