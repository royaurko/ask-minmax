A coupled map lattice for convection is proposed, which consists of Eulerian
and Lagrangian procedures. Simulations of the model not only reproduce a
wide-range of phenomena in Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection experiments but also
lead to several prediction of novel phenomena there: For small aspect ratios,
the formation of convective rolls, their oscillation, many routes to chaos, and
chaotic itinerancy are found, with the increase of the Rayleigh number. For
large aspect ratios, the collective oscillation of convective rolls, travelling
waves, coherent chaos, and spatiotemporal intermittency are observed. At high
Rayleigh numbers, the transition from soft to hard turbulence is confirmed, as
is characterized by the change of the temperature distribution from Gaussian to
exponential. Roll formation in three-dimensional convection is also simulated,
and found to reproduce experiments well.
