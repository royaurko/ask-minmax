Technicolor achieves electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) in an elegant and
natural way, while it suffers from severe model building difficulties. I
propose to abandon its secondary goal to eliminate scalar bosons in exchange of
solving numerous problems using supersymmetry. It helps to understand walking
dynamics much better with certain exact results. In the particular model
presented here, there is no light elementary Higgs boson and the EWSB is fully
dynamical, hence explaining the hierarchy; There is no alignment problem and no
light pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons exist; The fermion masses are generated by
a ultraviolet-complete renormalizable extended technicolor sector with
techni-GIM mechanism and hence the sector is safe from
flavor-changing-neutral-current constraints; The "e+ e-'' production of
techni-states in the superconformal window is calculable; The electroweak
precision observables are (un)fortunately not calculable.
