This work answers the question what coverings over a topological torus can be
induced from a covering over a space of dimension $k$. The answer to this
question is then applied in algebro-geometric context to present obstructions
to transforming an algebraic equation depending on several parameters to an
equation depending on less parameters by means of a rational transformation.
