A key challenge in modern computing is to develop systems that address
complex, dynamic problems in a scalable and efficient way, because the
increasing complexity of software makes designing and maintaining efficient and
flexible systems increasingly difficult. Biological systems are thought to
possess robust, scalable processing paradigms that can automatically manage
complex, dynamic problem spaces, possessing several properties that may be
useful in computer systems. The biological properties of self-organisation,
self-replication, self-management, and scalability are addressed in an
interesting way by autopoiesis, a descriptive theory of the cell founded on the
concept of a system's circular organisation to define its boundary with its
environment. In this paper, therefore, we review the main concepts of
autopoiesis and then discuss how they could be related to fundamental concepts
and theories of computation. The paper is conceptual in nature and the emphasis
is on the review of other people's work in this area as part of a longer-term
strategy to develop a formal theory of autopoietic computing.
