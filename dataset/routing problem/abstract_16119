After recalling the Dirichlet problem at infinity on a Cartan-Hadamard
manifold, we discuss what is known and the difference between the
two-dimensional and higher-dimensional cases. Turning our attention to the
two-dimensional case, we prove that the Dirichlet problem at infinity on a
two-dimensional Cartan-Hadamard manifold is solvable under the curvature
condition $K\leq (1+\epsilon)/(r^2 \log r)$, outside of a compact set, for some
$\epsilon>0$ in polar coordinates around some pole. This condition on the
curvature is sharp, and improves upon the previously known case of quadratic
curvature decay. Finally, we briefly discuss the issues which arise in trying
to extend this method to higher dimensions.
