We present a randomized distributed approximation algorithm for the metric
uncapacitated facility location problem. The algorithm is executed on a
bipartite graph in the Congest model yielding a (1.861 + epsilon) approximation
factor, where epsilon is an arbitrary small positive constant. It needs
O(n^{3/4}log_{1+epsilon}^2(n) communication rounds with high probability (n
denoting the number of facilities and clients). To the best of our knowledge,
our algorithm currently has the best approximation factor for the facility
location problem in a distributed setting. It is based on a greedy sequential
approximation algorithm by Jain et al. (J. ACM 50(6), pages: 795-824, 2003).
The main difficulty in executing this sequential algorithm lies in dealing with
situations, where multiple facilities are eligible for opening, but (in order
to preserve the approximation factor of the sequential algorithm) only a subset
of them can actually be opened. Note that while the presented runtime bound of
our algorithm is "with high probability", the approximation factor is not "in
expectation" but always guaranteed to be (1.861 + epsilon). Thus, our main
contribution is a sublinear time selection mechanism that, while increasing the
approximation factor by an arbitrary small additive term, allows us to decide
which of the eligible facilities to open.
