The case of the planar circular restricted three-body problem where one of
the two primaries is an oblate spheroid is investigated. We conduct a thorough
numerical analysis on the phase space mixing by classifying initial conditions
of orbits and distinguishing between three types of motion: (i) bounded, (ii)
escape and (iii) collisional. The presented outcomes reveal the high complexity
of this dynamical system. Furthermore, our numerical analysis shows a strong
dependence of the properties of the considered escape basins with the total
orbital energy, with a remarkable presence of fractal basin boundaries along
all the escape regimes. Interpreting the collisional motion as leaking in the
phase space we related our results to both chaotic scattering and the theory of
leaking Hamiltonian systems. We also determined the escape and collisional
basins and computed the corresponding escape/crash times. The highly fractal
basin boundaries observed are related with high sensitivity to initial
conditions thus implying an uncertainty between escape solutions which evolve
to different regions of the phase space. We hope our contribution to be useful
for a further understanding of the escape and crash mechanism of orbits in this
version of the restricted three-body problem.
