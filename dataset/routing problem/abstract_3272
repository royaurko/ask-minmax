We here investigate the efficient implementation of the energy-conserving
methods named Hamiltonian Boundary Value Methods (HBVMs) recently introduced
for the numerical solution of Hamiltonian problems. In this note, we describe
an iterative procedure, based on a triangular splitting, for solving the
generated discrete problems, when the problem at hand is separable.
