We consider divergence form elliptic equations $Lu:=\nabla\cdot(A\nabla u)=0$
in the half space $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}_+ :=\{(x,t)\in
\mathbb{R}^n\times(0,\infty)\}$, whose coefficient matrix $A$ is complex
elliptic, bounded and measurable. In addition, we suppose that $A$ satisfies
some additional regularity in the direction transverse to the boundary, namely
that the discrepancy $A(x,t) -A(x,0)$ satisfies a Carleson measure condition of
Fefferman-Kenig-Pipher type, with small Carleson norm. Under these conditions,
we establish a full range of boundedness results for double and single layer
potentials in $L^p$, Hardy, Sobolev, BMO and H\"older spaces. Furthermore, we
prove solvability of the Dirichlet problem for $L$, with data in
$L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$, $BMO(\mathbb{R}^n)$, and $C^\alpha(\mathbb{R}^n)$, and
solvability of the Neumann and Regularity problems, with data in the spaces
$L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)/H^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and
$L^p_1(\mathbb{R}^n)/H^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ respectively, with the appropriate
restrictions on indices, assuming invertibility of layer potentials in for the
$t$-independent operator $L_0:= -\nabla\cdot(A(\cdot,0)\nabla)$.
