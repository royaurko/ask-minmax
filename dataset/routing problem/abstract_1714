Consider a static wireless network that has two tiers with different
priorities: a primary tier vs. a secondary tier. The primary tier consists of
randomly distributed legacy nodes of density $n$, which have an absolute
priority to access the spectrum. The secondary tier consists of randomly
distributed cognitive nodes of density $m=n^\beta$ with $\beta\geq 2$, which
can only access the spectrum opportunistically to limit the interference to the
primary tier. By allowing the secondary tier to route the packets for the
primary tier, we show that the primary tier can achieve a throughput scaling of
$\lambda_p(n)=\Theta(1/\log n)$ per node and a delay-throughput tradeoff of
$D_p(n)=\Theta(\sqrt{n^\beta\log n}\lambda_p(n))$ for $\lambda_p(n)=O(1/\log
n)$, while the secondary tier still achieves the same optimal delay-throughput
tradeoff as a stand-alone network.
