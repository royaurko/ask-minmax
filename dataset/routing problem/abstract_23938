We introduce new times in the monodromy preserving equations. While the usual
times related to the moduli of complex structures of Riemann curves such as
coordinates of marked points, we consider the moduli of generalized complex
structures ($W$-structures) as the new times. We consider linear differential
matrix equations depending on $W$-structures on an arbitrary Riemann curve. The
monodromy preserving equations have a Hamiltonian form. They are derived via
the symplectic reduction procedure from a free gauge theory as well as the
associate linear problems. The quasi-classical limit of isomonodromy problem
leads to integrable hierarchies of the Hitchin type. In this way the
generalized complex structures parametrized the moduli of these hierarchies.
