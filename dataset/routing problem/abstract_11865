Bound states and collisions of atoms with two-channel two-body interactions
in harmonic waveguides are analyzed. The closed-channel contributions to
two-atom bound states become dominant in the case of a weak resonance. At low
energies and values of the non-resonant scattering length the problem can be
approximated by a one-dimensional resonant model. Three-body problem becomes
nonintegrable and the properties of triatomic molecules become different from
those predicted by the integrable Lieb-Liniger-McGuire model.
