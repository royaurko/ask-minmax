This work aims to make it easier for a specialist in one field to find and
explore ideas from another field which may be useful in solving a new problem
arising in his practice. It presents a methodology which serves to represent
the relationships that exist between concepts, problems, and solution patterns
from different fields of human activity in the form of a graph. Our approach is
based upon generalization and specialization relationships and problem solving.
It is simple enough to be understood quite easily, and general enough to enable
coherent integration of concepts and problems from virtually any field. We have
built an implementation which uses the World Wide Web as a support to allow
navigation between graph nodes and collaborative development of the graph.
