The magnetic force microscopy inverse problem for the case of horizontal
scanning of a tip on a linear magnetic film is introduced. We show the
possibility to recover the magnetic permeability of the material from the
experimental data by using the Hankel (Fourier-Bessel) transform inverse method
(HIM). This method is applied to the case of a layered slab film as well. The
inverse problem related to the ac MFM is introduced.
