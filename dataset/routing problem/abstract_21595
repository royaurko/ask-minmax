The real minimum skew rank of a simple graph G is the smallest possible rank
among all real skew symmetric matrices, whose (i,j)-entry (for i not equal to
j) is nonzero whenever {i, j} is an edge in G and is zero otherwise. In this
paper we study the problem of real minimum skew rank of powers and strict
powers of paths.
