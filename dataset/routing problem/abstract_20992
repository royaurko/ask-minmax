We prove a linear and a nonlinear generalization of the Lax-Milgram theorem.
In particular we give sufficient conditions for a real-valued function defined
on the product of a reflexive Banach space and a normed space to represent all
bounded linear functionals of the latter. We also give two applications to
singular differential equations.
