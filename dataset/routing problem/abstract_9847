The model under consideration is based on approximate analytical solution of
two dimensional stationary Navier-Stokes and Fourier-Kirchhoff equations.
Approximations are based on the typical for natural convection assumptions: the
fluid noncompressibility and Bousinesq approximation. We also assume that
ortogonal to the plate component (x) of velocity is neglectible small. The
solution of the boundary problem is represented as a Taylor Series in $x$
coordinate for velocity and temperature which introduces functions of vertical
coordinate (y), as coefficients of the expansion. The correspondent boundary
problem formulation depends on parameters specific for the problem: Grashoff
number, the plate height (L) and gravity constant. The main result of the paper
is the set of equations for the coefficient functions for example choice of
expansion terms number. The nonzero velocity at the starting point of a flow
appears in such approach as a development of convecntional boundary layer
theory formulation.
