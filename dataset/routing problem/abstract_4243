In the present paper we introduce a Virtual Element Method (VEM) for the
approximate solution of general linear second order elliptic problems in mixed
form, allowing for variable coefficients. We derive a theoretical convergence
analysis of the method and develop a set of numerical tests on a benchmark
problem with known solution.
