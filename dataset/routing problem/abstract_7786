I review some work done in the past four years concerning the transition of
Yang-Mills theories from 1+3 to 1+1 dimensions. The problem is considered both
in a perturbative context and in exact solutions when available. Several
interesting features are discussed, mainly in relation to the phenomenon of
confinement, and some controversial issues are clarified.
