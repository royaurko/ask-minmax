The problem of finding out the global minimum of a multiextremal functional
is discussed. One frequently faces with such a functional in various
applications. We propose a procedure, which depends on the dimensionality of
the problem polynomially. In our approach we use the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the connection matrix.
