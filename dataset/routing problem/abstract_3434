The convergence of polyhomogeneous expansions of zero-rest-mass fields in
asymptotically flat spacetimes is discussed. An existence proof for the
asymptotic characteristic initial value problem for a zero-rest-mass field with
polyhomogeneous initial data is given. It is shown how this non-regular problem
can be properly recast as a set of regular initial value problems for some
auxiliary fields. The standard techniques of symmetric hyperbolic systems can
be applied to these new auxiliary problems, thus yielding a positive answer to
the question of existence in the original problem.
