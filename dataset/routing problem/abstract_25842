We consider the problem of motion of a rigid body about a fixed point under
the action of an axisymmetric combination of potential and gyroscopic forces.
We introduce a new integrable case, valid on zero level of the cyclic integral,
that generalizes the known case of motion of a body in liquid due to Chaplygin
and its subsequent generalization by Yehia. Apart from certain singular
potential terms, the new case involves finite potential and gyroscopic forces,
which admit physical interpretation as resulting from interaction of mass,
magnetized parts and electric charges on the body with gravitational, electric
and magnetic fields.
