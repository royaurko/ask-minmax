We say that a list of real numbers is "symmetrically realisable" if it is the
spectrum of some (entrywise) nonnegative symmetric matrix. The Symmetric
Nonnegative Inverse Eigenvalue Problem (SNIEP) is the problem of characterising
all symmetrically realisable lists.
  In this paper, we present a recursive method for constructing symmetrically
realisable lists. The properties of the realisable family we obtain allow us to
make several novel connections between a number of sufficient conditions
developed over forty years, starting with the work of Fiedler in 1974. We show
that essentially all previously known sufficient conditions are either
contained in or equivalent to the family we are introducing.
