We study the problem of separating audio sources from a single linear
mixture. The goal is to find a decomposition of the single channel spectrogram
into a sum of individual contributions associated to a certain number of
sources. In this paper, we consider an informed source separation problem in
which the input spectrogram is partly annotated. We propose a convex
formulation that relies on a nuclear norm penalty to induce low rank for the
contributions. We show experimentally that solving this model with a simple
subgradient method outperforms a previously introduced nonnegative matrix
factorization (NMF) technique, both in terms of source separation quality and
computation time.
