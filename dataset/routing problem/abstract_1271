These lecture notes present an overview of equilibrium statistical mechanics
of classical fluids, with special applications to the structural and
thermodynamic properties of systems made of particles interacting via the
hard-sphere potential or closely related model potentials. The exact
statistical-mechanical properties of one-dimensional systems, the issue of
thermodynamic (in)consistency among different routes in the context of several
approximate theories, and the construction of analytical or semi-analytical
approximations for the structural properties are also addressed.
