The purpose of this work is the study of solution techniques for problems
involving fractional powers of symmetric coercive elliptic operators in a
bounded domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. These operators can be
realized as the Dirichlet to Neumann map for a degenerate/singular elliptic
problem posed on a semi-infinite cylinder, which we analyze in the framework of
weighted Sobolev spaces. Motivated by the rapid decay of the solution of this
problem, we propose a truncation that is suitable for numerical approximation.
We discretize this truncation using first degree tensor product finite
elements. We derive a priori error estimates in weighted Sobolev spaces. The
estimates exhibit optimal regularity but suboptimal order for quasi-uniform
meshes. For anisotropic meshes, instead, they are quasi-optimal in both order
and regularity. We present numerical experiments to illustrate the method's
performance.
