In the field of empirical modeling using Genetic Programming (GP), it is
important to evolve solution with good generalization ability. Generalization
ability of GP solutions get affected by two important issues: bloat and
over-fitting. Bloat is uncontrolled growth of code without any gain in fitness
and important issue in GP. We surveyed and classified existing literature
related to different techniques used by GP research community to deal with the
issue of bloat. Moreover, the classifications of different bloat control
approaches and measures for bloat are discussed. Next, we tested four bloat
control methods: Tarpeian, double tournament, lexicographic parsimony pressure
with direct bucketing and ratio bucketing on six different problems and
identified where each bloat control method performs well on per problem basis.
Based on the analysis of each method, we combined two methods: double
tournament (selection method) and Tarpeian method (works before evaluation) to
avoid bloated solutions and compared with the results obtained from individual
performance of double tournament method. It was found that the results were
improved with this combination of two methods.
