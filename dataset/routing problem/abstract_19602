We investigate the distribution of single molecule line shape cumulants,
$\kappa_1,\kappa_2,...$, in low temperature glasses based on the sudden jump,
standard tunneling model. We find that the cumulants are described by L\'evy
stable laws, thus generalized central limit theorem is applicable for this
problem.
