We investigate a possibility that the rough gauge problem, which have
appeared to be a main reason for failures of lattice chiral gauge theories, is
cured by an asymptotic-free dynamics. Taking the domain-wall model in 2(+1)
dimensions with SU(2) gauge group, we carry out the quenched simulation of
gauge fields in the extra dimension. By studying fermion spectra in several
volumes, we show that the chiral zero modes exist on the wall without having
the spontaneous symmetry breaking thanks to the asymptotic-free dynamics. This
result suggests that the rough gauge problem is solved in some class of lattice
chiral fermions as well as in 4 dimensions if an asymptotic-free dynamics is
incorporated.
