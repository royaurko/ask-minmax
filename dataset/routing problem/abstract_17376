Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the family of compact convex subsets $S$ of the
hemisphere in $\rn$ with the property that $S$ contains its dual $S^*;$ let
$u\in S^*$, and let $ \Phi(S,u)=\frac{2}{\omega_n}\int_{S}\ < \theta, u \ >
\,\, d\sigma(\theta). $ The problem to study $ \inf \big\{\Phi(S,u),
  S \in \mathcal{C}, \, u\in S^* \big\} $ is considered. It is proved that the
minima of $ \Phi $ are sets of constant width $ \pi/2 $ with $ u $ on their
boundary. More can be said for $n=3$: the minimum set is a Reuleaux triangle on
the sphere. The previous problem is related to the one to find the maximal
length of steepest descent curves for quasi convex functions, satisfying
suitable constraints. For $ n=2 $ let us refer to \cite{Manselli-Pucci}. Here
quite different results are obtained for $ n\geq 3$.
