An anthropic principle has made it possible to answer the difficult question
of why the observable value of cosmological constant ($\Lambda\sim 10^{-47}$
GeV${}^4$) is so disconcertingly tiny compared to predicted value of vacuum
energy density $\rho_{SUSY}\sim 10^{12}$ GeV${}^4$. Unfortunately, there is a
darker side to this argument, as it consequently leads to another absurd
prediction: that the probability to observe the value $\Lambda=0$ for randomly
selected observer exactly equals to 1. We'll call this controversy an infrared
divergence problem. It is shown that the IRD prediction can be avoided with the
help of a Linde-Vanchurin {\em singular runaway measure} coupled with the
calculation of relative Bayesian probabilities by the means of the {\em
doomsday argument}. Moreover, it is shown that while the IRD problem occurs for
the {\em prediction stage} of value of $\Lambda$, it disappears at the {\em
explanatory stage} when $\Lambda$ has already been measured by the observer.
