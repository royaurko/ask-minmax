This paper concerns cheaply computable formulas and bounds for the condition
number of the TLS problem. For a TLS problem with data $A$, $b$, two formulas
are derived that are simpler and more compact than the known results in the
literature. One is derived by exploiting the properties of Kronecker products
of matrices. The other is obtained by making use of the singular value
decomposition (SVD) of $[A \,\,b]$, which allows us to compute the condition
number cheaply and accurately. We present lower and upper bounds for the
condition number that involve the singular values of $[A \,\, b]$ and the last
entries of the right singular vectors of $[A \,\, b]$. We prove that they are
always sharp and can estimate the condition number accurately by no more than
four times. Furthermore, we establish a few other lower and upper bounds that
involve only a few singular values of $A$ and $[A \,\, b]$. We discuss how
tight the bounds are. These bounds are particularly useful for large scale TLS
problems since for them any formulas and bounds for the condition number
involving all the singular values of $A$ and/or $[A \ b]$ are too costly to be
computed. Numerical experiments illustrate that our bounds are sharper than a
known approximate condition number in the literature.
