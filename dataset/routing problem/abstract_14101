Black hole solutions of supergravity theories form families that realizing
the deep nonlinear "duality" symmetries of these theories. They form orbits
under the action of these symmetry groups, with extremal (i.e. BPS) solutions
at the limits of such orbits. An important technique in the analysis of such
solution families employs timelike dimensional reduction and exchanges the
stationary black-hole problem for a nonlinear sigma-model problem. Families of
extremal or BPS solutions are characterized by nilpotent orbits under the
duality symmetries, based upon a tri-graded or penta-graded decomposition of
the corresponding duality-group algebra.
