We summarize some combinatoric problems solved by the higher Catalan numbers.
These problems are generalizations of the combinatoric problems solved by the
Catalan numbers. The generating function of the higher Catalan numbers appeared
recently as an auxiliary function in enumerating maps and explicit computations
of the asymptotic expansion of the partition function of random matrices in the
unitary ensemble case. We give combinatoric proofs of the formulas for the
number of genus 0 and genus 1 maps.
