We report a new collective dynamical state, namely the {\it mixed mode
oscillation suppression} state where different set of variables of a system of
coupled oscillators show different types of oscillation suppression states. We
identify two variants of it: The first one is a {\it mixed mode death} (MMD)
state where a set of variables of a system of coupled oscillators show an
oscillation death (OD) state, while the rest are in an amplitude death (AD)
state under the identical parametric condition. In the second mixed death state
(we refer it as the MNAD state) a nontrivial bistable AD and a monostable AD
state appear simultaneously to different set of variables of a same system. We
find these states in paradigmatic chaotic Lorenz system and Lorenz-like system
under generic coupling schemes. We identify that while the reflection symmetry
breaking is responsible for the MNAD state, the breaking of both the reflection
and translational symmetries result in the MMD state. Using a rigorous
bifurcation analysis we establish the occurrence of the MMD and MNAD states,
and map their transition routes in parameter space. Moreover, we report the
{\it first} experimental observation of the MMD and MNAD states that supports
our theoretical results. We believe that this study will broaden our
understanding of oscillation suppression states, subsequently, it may have
applications in many real physical systems, such as laser and geomagnetic
systems, whose mathematical models mimic the Lorenz system.
