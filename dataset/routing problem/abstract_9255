The Multidimensional Assignment Problem (MAP or s-AP in the case of s
dimensions) is an extension of the well-known assignment problem. The most
studied case of MAP is 3-AP, though the problems with larger values of s have
also a number of applications. In this paper we propose a memetic algorithm for
MAP that is a combination of a genetic algorithm with a local search procedure.
The main contribution of the paper is an idea of dynamically adjusted
generation size, that yields an outstanding flexibility of the algorithm to
perform well for both small and large fixed running times. The results of
computational experiments for several instance families show that the proposed
algorithm produces solutions of very high quality in a reasonable time and
outperforms the state-of-the art 3-AP memetic algorithm.
