An analytical solution for light propagation in the post-post-Newtonian
approximation is given for the Schwarzschild metric in harmonic gauge augmented
by PPN and post-linear parameters $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\epsilon$. The
solutions of both Cauchy and boundary problem are given. The Cauchy problem is
posed using the initial position of the photon $\ve{x}_0 = \ve{x}(t_0)$ and its
propagation direction \ve{\sigma} at minus infinity: $\ve{\sigma} = {1\over c}
\lim\limits_{t \to -\infty}\dot{\ve{x}}(t)$. An analytical expression for the
total light deflection is given. The solutions for $t - t_0$ and $\ve{\sigma}$
are given in terms of boundary conditions $\ve{x}_0 = \ve{x} (t_0)$ and $\ve{x}
= \ve{x}(t)$.
