The Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation is widely used in everywhere of
natural science. Various nonlinear excitations of the NLS equation have been
found by many methods. However, except for the soliton-soliton interactions, it
is very difficult to find interaction solutions between different types of
nonlinear excitations. In this paper, three very simple and powerful methods,
the symmetry reduction method, the truncated Painlev\'e analysis and the
generalized tanh function expansion approach, are further developed to find
interaction solutions between solitons and other types of NLS waves.
Especially, the soliton-cnoidal wave interaction solutions are explicitly
studied in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions and the third type of
incomplete elliptic integrals. In addition to the new method and new solutions
of the NLS equation, the results can unearth some new physics. The solitons may
be decelerated/accelerated through the interactions of soliton with background
waves which may be utilized to study tsunami waves and fiber soliton
communications; the static/moving optical lattices may be automatically excited
in all mediums described by the NLS systems; solitons elastically interact with
non-soliton background waves, and the elastic interaction property with only
phase shifts provides a new mechanism to produce a controllable routing switch
that is applicable in optical information and optical communications.
