We investigate the properties of a two-dimensional quasicrystal in the
presence of a uniform magnetic field. In this configuration, the density of
states (DOS) displays a Hofstadter butterfly-like structure when it is
represented as a function of the magnetic flux per tile. We show that the
low-DOS regions of the energy spectrum are associated with chiral edge states,
in direct analogy with the Chern insulators realized with periodic lattices. We
establish the topological nature of the edge states by computing the
topological Chern number associated with the bulk of the quasicrystal. This
topological characterization of the non-periodic lattice is achieved through a
local (real-space) topological marker. This work opens a route for the
exploration of topological insulating materials in a wide range of non-periodic
lattice systems, including photonic crystals and cold atoms in optical
lattices.
