In this article, the problem of the charged harmonic plus an inverse harmonic
oscillator with time-dependent mass and frequency in a time-dependent
electromagnetic field is investigated. It is reduced to the problem of the
inverse harmonic oscillator with time-independent parameters and the exact wave
function is obtained.
