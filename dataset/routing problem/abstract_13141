In this paper, we propose an extension of our Mining for SAT framework to
Constraint satisfaction Problem (CSP). We consider n-ary extensional
constraints (table constraints). Our approach aims to reduce the size of the
CSP by exploiting the structure of the constraints graph and of its associated
microstructure. More precisely, we apply itemset mining techniques to search
for closed frequent itemsets on these two representation. Using Tseitin
extension, we rewrite the whole CSP to another compressed CSP equivalent with
respect to satisfiability. Our approach contrast with previous proposed
approach by Katsirelos and Walsh, as we do not change the structure of the
constraints.
