Graphene is an emerging class of two-dimensional (2D) material with unique
electrical properties and a wide range of potential practical applications. In
addition, graphene hybrid structures combined with other 2D materials, metal
microstructures, silicon photonic crystal cavities, and waveguides have more
extensive applications in van der Waals heterostructures, hybrid graphene
plasmonics, hybrid optoelectronic devices, and optical modulators. Based on
well-developed transfer methods, graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) is currently used in most of the graphene hybrid applications. Although
mechanical exfoliation of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite provides the
highest-quality graphene, the transfer of the desired microcleaving graphene
(MG) to the structure at a specific position is a critical challenge, that
limits the combination of MG with other structures. Herein, we report a new
technique for the selective transfer of MG patterns and devices onto chosen
targets using a bilayer-polymer structure and femtosecond laser
microfabrication. This selective transfer technique, which exactly transfers
the patterned graphene onto a chosen target, leaving the other flakes on the
original substrate, provides an efficient route for the fabrication of MG-based
microdevices. This method will facilitate the preparation of van der Waals
heterostructures and enable the optimization of the performance of graphene
hybrid devices.
