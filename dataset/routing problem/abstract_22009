The leader-following consensus problem of multi-agent systems over finite
fields ${\mathbb F}_p$ is considered in this paper. Dynamics of each agent is
governed by a linear equation over ${\mathbb F}_p$, where a distributed control
protocol is utilized by the followers.Sufficient and/or necessary conditions on
system matrices and graph weights in ${\mathbb F}_p$ are provided for the
followers to track the leader.
