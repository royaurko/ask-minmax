Wireless ad hoc networks are power constrained since nodes operate with
limited battery energy. Thus, energy consumption is crucial in the design of
new ad hoc routing protocols. In order to maximize the lifetime of ad hoc
networks, traffic should be sent via a route that can be avoid nodes with low
energy. In addition, considering that the nodes of ad hoc networks are mobile,
it is possible that a created path is broken because of nodes mobility and
establishment of a new path would be done again. This is because of sending
additional control packets, accordingly, energy consumption increases. Also, it
should avoid nodes which have more buffered packets. Maybe, because of long
queue, some of these packets are dropped and transmitted again. This is the
reason for wasting of energy. In this paper we propose a new energy efficient
algorithm, that uses a new cost function and avoid nodes with characteristics
which mentioned above. We show that this algorithm improves the network energy
consumption by using this new cost function.
