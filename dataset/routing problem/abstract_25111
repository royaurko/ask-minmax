We present a study on connection errors in networks of linear features and
methods of error detection. We model networks with special connection
specifications as networks with hierarchically connected features and define
errors considering the spatial relationships and the functionality of the
network elements. A general definition of the problem of the detection of
connection errors which takes into account the functionality of the network
elements is discussed. Then a series of spatial algorithms that solve different
aspects of the problem is presented. We also define and analyze the notion of
geometrical reduction as a method of achieving efficient performance. In the
last section the undecidability of algorithmic error correction is discussed.
