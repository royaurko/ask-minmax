Speedup learning seeks to improve the computational efficiency of problem
solving with experience. In this paper, we develop a formal framework for
learning efficient problem solving from random problems and their solutions. We
apply this framework to two different representations of learned knowledge,
namely control rules and macro-operators, and prove theorems that identify
sufficient conditions for learning in each representation. Our proofs are
constructive in that they are accompanied with learning algorithms. Our
framework captures both empirical and explanation-based speedup learning in a
unified fashion. We illustrate our framework with implementations in two
domains: symbolic integration and Eight Puzzle. This work integrates many
strands of experimental and theoretical work in machine learning, including
empirical learning of control rules, macro-operator learning, Explanation-Based
Learning (EBL), and Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Learning.
