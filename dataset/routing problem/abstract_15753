The interacting and holographic dark energy models involve two important
quantities. One is the characteristic size of the holographic bound and the
other is the coupling term of the interaction between dark energy and dark
matter. Rather than fixing either of them, we present a detailed study of
theoretical relationships among these quantities and cosmological parameters as
well as observational constraints in a very general formalism. In particular,
we argue that the ratio of dark matter to dark energy density depends on the
choice of these two quantities, thus providing a mechanism to change the
evolution history of the ratio from that in standard cosmology such that the
coincidence problem may be solved. We investigate this problem in detail and
construct explicit models to demonstrate that it may be alleviated provided
that the interacting term and the characteristic size of holographic bound are
appropriately specified. Furthermore, these models are well fitted with the
current observation at least in the low red-shift region.
