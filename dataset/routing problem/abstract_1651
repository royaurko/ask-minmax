A GLObal Smart Space (GLOSS) provides support for interaction amongst people,
artefacts and places while taking account of both context and movement on a
global scale. Crucial to the definition of a GLOSS is the provision of a set of
location-aware services that detect, convey, store and exploit location
information. We use one of these services, hearsay, to illustrate the
implementation dimensions of a GLOSS. The focus of the paper is on both local
and global software architecture to support the implementation of such
services. The local architecture is based on XML pipe-lines and is used to
construct location-aware components. The global architecture is based on a
hybrid peer-to-peer routing scheme and provides the local architectures with
the means to communicate in the global context.
