We construct a perfectly matched absorbing layer for stationary Schrodinger
equation with analytic slowly decaying potential in a periodic structure. We
prove the unique solvability of the problem with perfectly matched layer of
finite length and show that solution to this problem approximates a solution to
the original problem with an error that exponentially tends to zero as the
length of perfectly matched layer tends to infinity.
