We pose and solve the equivalence problem for subspaces of ${\mathcal P}_n$,
the $(n+1)$ dimensional vector space of univariate polynomials of degree $\leq
n$. The group of interest is ${\rm SL}_2$ acting by projective transformations
on the Grassmannian variety ${\mathcal G}_k{\mathcal P}_n$ of $k$-dimensional
subspaces. We establish the equivariance of the Wronski map and use this map to
reduce the subspace equivalence problem to the equivalence problem for binary
forms.
