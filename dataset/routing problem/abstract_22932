We provide a simple translation of the satisfiability problem for regular
grammar logics with converse into GF2, which is the intersection of the guarded
fragment and the 2-variable fragment of first-order logic. This translation is
theoretically interesting because it translates modal logics with certain frame
conditions into first-order logic, without explicitly expressing the frame
conditions.
  A consequence of the translation is that the general satisfiability problem
for regular grammar logics with converse is in EXPTIME. This extends a previous
result of the first contributor for grammar logics without converse. Using the same
method, we show how some other modal logics can be naturally translated into
GF2, including nominal tense logics and intuitionistic logic.
  In our view, the results in this paper show that the natural first-order
fragment corresponding to regular grammar logics is simply GF2 without extra
machinery such as fixed point-operators.
