The classical problem of quickest change detection is studied with an
additional constraint on the cost of observations used in the detection
process. The change point is modeled as an unknown constant, and minimax
formulations are proposed for the problem. The objective in these formulations
is to find a stopping time and an on-off observation control policy for the
observation sequence, to minimize a version of the worst possible average
delay, subject to constraints on the false alarm rate and the fraction of time
observations are taken before change. An algorithm called DE-CuSum is proposed
and is shown to be asymptotically optimal for the proposed formulations, as the
false alarm rate goes to zero. Numerical results are used to show that the
DE-CuSum algorithm has good trade-off curves and performs significantly better
than the approach of fractional sampling, in which the observations are skipped
using the outcome of a sequence of coin tosses, independent of the observation
process. This work is guided by the insights gained from an earlier study of a
Bayesian version of this problem.
