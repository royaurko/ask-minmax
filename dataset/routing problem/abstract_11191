This article is a guide to the literature on existence theorems for the
Einstein equations which also draws attention to open problems in the field.
The local in time Cauchy problem, which is relatively well understood, is
treated first. Next global results for solutions with symmetry are discussed. A
selection of results from Newtonian theory and special relativity which offer
useful comparisons is presented. This is followed by a survey of global results
in the case of small data and results on constructing spacetimes with given
singularity structure. The article ends with some miscellaneous topics
connected with the main theme.
