Software evolves. After many revisions and improvements software gets retired
and replaced. When replacement takes place, one needs to migrate the data from
the old database into the new database, so the new application can replace the
old application. Student administration application (SAA) currently used by
European University (EURM) has been outgrown by the university, and needs
replacement. iKnow application developed as part of the iKnow Tempus project is
scheduled to replace the existing Student Administration application at EURM.
This paper describes the problems that were encountered while migrating the
data from the old databases of SAA to the new database designed for the iKnow
application. The problems were resolved using the well-known solutions typical
for an ETL process, since data migration can be considered as a type of ETL
process. In this paper we describe the solutions for the problems that we
encountered while migrating the data.
