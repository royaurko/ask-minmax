We formalize a simple but natural subclass of service domains for relational
planning problems with object-centered, independent exogenous events and
additive rewards capturing, for example, problems in inventory control.
Focusing on this subclass, we present a new symbolic planning algorithm which
is the first algorithm that has explicit performance guarantees for relational
MDPs with exogenous events. In particular, under some technical conditions, our
planning algorithm provides a monotonic lower bound on the optimal value
function. To support this algorithm we present novel evaluation and reduction
techniques for generalized first order decision diagrams, a knowledge
representation for real-valued functions over relational world states. Our
planning algorithm uses a set of focus states, which serves as a training set,
to simplify and approximate the symbolic solution, and can thus be seen to
perform learning for planning. A preliminary experimental evaluation
demonstrates the validity of our approach.
