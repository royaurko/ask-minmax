We study expansions near the boundary of solutions to the Dirichlet problem
for minimal graphs in the hyperbolic space and characterize the remainders of
the expansion by multiple integrals. With such a characterization, we establish
optimal asymptotic expansions of solutions with boundary values of finite
regularity and demonstrate a slight loss of regularity for nonlocal
coefficients.
