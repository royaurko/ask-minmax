We consider the 2D quasi-periodic scattering problem in optics, which has
been modelled by a boundary value problem governed by Helmholtz equation with
transparent boundary conditions. A spectral collocation method and a tensor
product spectral method are proposed to numerically solve the problem on
rectangles. The discretization parameters can be adaptively chosen so that the
numerical solution approximates the exact solution to a high accuracy. Our
methods also apply to solve general partial differential equations in two space
dimensions, one of which is periodic. Numerical examples are presented to
illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of our methods.
