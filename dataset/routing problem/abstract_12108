We propose a new integer programming formulation for the problem of finding a
maximum stable set of a graph based on representatives of stable sets. In
addition, we investigate exact solutions provided by a Lagrangian decomposition
of this formulation in which only one constraint is relaxed. Some computational
experiments were carried out with an effective multi-threaded implementation of
our algorithm in a multi-core system, and their results are presented.
