The geometric measure of entanglement is investigated for permutation
symmetric pure states of multipartite qubit systems, in particular the question
of maximum entanglement. This is done with the help of the Majorana
representation, which maps an n qubit symmetric state to n points on the unit
sphere. It is shown how symmetries of the point distribution can be exploited
to simplify the calculation of entanglement and also help find the maximally
entangled symmetric state. Using a combination of analytical and numerical
results, the most entangled symmetric states for up to 12 qubits are explored
and discussed. The optimization problem on the sphere presented here is then
compared with two classical optimization problems on the S^2 sphere, namely
Toth's problem and Thomson's problem, and it is observed that, in general, they
are different problems.
