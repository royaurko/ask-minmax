Spectral problem for a family of periodic Sturm--Liouville problems \[
u''+\lambda^2(a(x)-a)u=0 \] depending on the parameter (a\in\mathbb R) is
considered. An interpolation formula describing the behaviour of the branches
of the spectrum in the transition from a definite problem to indefinite one is
obtained.
