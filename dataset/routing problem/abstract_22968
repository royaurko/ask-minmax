The problem of time synchronization in dense wireless networks is considered.
Well established synchronization techniques suffer from an inherent scalability
problem in that synchronization errors grow with an increasing number of hops
across the network. In this work, a model for communication in wireless
networks is first developed, and then the model is used to define a new time
synchronization mechanism. A salient feature of the proposed method is that, in
the regime of asymptotically dense networks, it can average out all random
errors and maintain global synchronization in the sense that all nodes in the
multi-hop network can see identical timing signals. This is irrespective of the
distance separating any two nodes.
