Opportunistic routing is a multi-hop routing scheme which allows for
selection of the best immediately available relay. In blind opportunistic
routing protocols, where transmitters blindly broadcast without knowledge of
the surrounding nodes, two fundamental design parameters are the node
transmission probability and the transmission spectral efficiency. In this
paper these parameters are selected to maximize end-to-end performance,
characterized by the product of transmitter density, hop distance and rate. Due
to the intractability of the problem as stated, an approximation function is
examined which proves reasonably accurate. Our results show how the above
design parameters should be selected based on inherent system parameters such
as the path loss exponent and the noise level.
