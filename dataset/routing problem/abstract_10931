The behaviour of an electron in a potential that resembles that of a
bidimensional solid with a perpendicular magnetic field applied is studied from
a classical point of view. This problem presents the standard features of chaos
and some interesting new patterns. A new chaos indicator, called random walk
indicator, is presented to describe som of these new patterns
