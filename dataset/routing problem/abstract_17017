Sparse learning has recently received increasing attention in many areas
including machine learning, statistics, and applied mathematics. The mixed-norm
regularization based on the L1/Lq norm with q > 1 is attractive in many
applications of regression and classification in that it facilitates group
sparsity in the model. The resulting optimization problem is, however,
challenging to solve due to the structure of the L1/Lq -regularization.
Existing work deals with special cases including q = 2,infinity, and they
cannot be easily extended to the general case. In this paper, we propose an
efficient algorithm based on the accelerated gradient method for solving the
L1/Lq -regularized problem, which is applicable for all values of q larger than
1, thus significantly extending existing work. One key building block of the
proposed algorithm is the L1/Lq -regularized Euclidean projection (EP1q). Our
theoretical analysis reveals the key properties of EP1q and illustrates why
EP1q for the general q is significantly more challenging to solve than the
special cases. Based on our theoretical analysis, we develop an efficient
algorithm for EP1q by solving two zero finding problems. Experimental results
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
