Adiabatic modeling of solar-like oscillations cannot exceed a certain level
of precision for fitting individual frequencies. This is known as the problem
of near surface effects on the mode physics. We present a theoretical study
which addresses the problem of frequency precision in non-adiabatic models
using a time-dependent convection treatment. We find that the number of
acceptable model solutions is significantly reduced and more precise
constraints can be imposed on the models. Results obtained for a specific star
(beta Hydri) lead to very good agreement with both global and local seismic
observables. This indicates that the accuracy of model fitting to seismic data
is greatly improved when a more complete description of the interaction between
convection and pulsation is taken into account.
