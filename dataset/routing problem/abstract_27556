This survey discusses recent developments in the context of spherical designs
and minimal energy point configurations on spheres. The recent solution of the
long standing problem of the existence of spherical $t$-designs on
$\mathbb{S}^d$ with $\mathcal{O}(t^d)$ number of points by A. Bondarenko, D.
Radchenko, and M. Viazovska attracted new interest to this subject. Secondly,
D. P. Hardin and E. B. Saff proved that point sets minimising the discrete
Riesz energy on $\mathbb{S}^d$ in the hypersingular case are asymptotically
uniformly distributed. Both results are of great relevance to the problem of
describing the quality of point distributions on $\mathbb{S}^d$, as well as
finding point sets, which exhibit good distribution behaviour with respect to
various quality measures.
