Kullback Leibler (KL) control problems allow for efficient computation of
optimal control by solving a principal eigenvector problem. However, direct
applicability of such framework to continuous state-action systems is limited.
In this paper, we propose to embed a KL control problem in a probabilistic
graphical model where observed variables correspond to the continuous (possibly
high-dimensional) state of the system and latent variables correspond to a
discrete (low-dimensional) representation of the state amenable for KL control
computation. We present two examples of this approach. The first one uses
standard hidden Markov models (HMMs) and computes exact optimal control, but is
only applicable to low-dimensional systems. The second one uses factorial HMMs,
it is scalable to higher dimensional problems, but control computation is
approximate. We illustrate both examples in several robot motor control tasks.
