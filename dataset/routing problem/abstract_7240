Stochastic variational inequalities (SVI) model a large class of equilibrium
problems subject to data uncertainty, and are closely related to stochastic
optimization problems. The SVI solution is usually estimated by a solution to a
sample average approximation (SAA) problem. This paper considers the normal map
formulation of an SVI, and proposes a method to build asymptotically exact
confidence regions and confidence intervals for the solution of the normal map
formulation, based on the asymptotic distribution of SAA solutions. The
confidence regions are single ellipsoids with high probability. We also discuss
the computation of simultaneous and individual confidence intervals.
