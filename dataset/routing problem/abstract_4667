We analyze the initial value problem for semilinear wave equations on
asymptotically anti-de Sitter spaces using energy methods adapted to the
geometry of the problem at infinity. The key feature is that the coefficients
become strongly singular at infinity, which leads to considering nontrivial
data on the conformal boundary of the manifold. This question arises in Physics
as the holographic prescription problem in string theory.
