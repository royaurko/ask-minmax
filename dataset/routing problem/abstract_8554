Nested regular expressions (NREs) have been proposed as a powerful formalism
for querying RDFS graphs, but research in a more general graph database context
has been scarce, and static analysis results are currently lacking. In this
paper we investigate the problem of containment of NREs, and show that it can
be solved in PSPACE, i.e., the same complexity as the problem of containment of
regular expressions or regular path queries (RPQs).
