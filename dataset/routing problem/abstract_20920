We study the problem of online regression. We prove a theoretical bound on
the square loss of Ridge Regression. We do not make any assumptions about input
vectors or outcomes. We also show that Bayesian Ridge Regression can be thought
of as an online algorithm competing with all the Gaussian linear experts.
