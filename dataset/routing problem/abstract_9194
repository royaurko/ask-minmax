A general framework for solving image inverse problems is introduced in this
paper. The approach is based on Gaussian mixture models, estimated via a
computationally efficient MAP-EM algorithm. A dual mathematical interpretation
of the proposed framework with structured sparse estimation is described, which
shows that the resulting piecewise linear estimate stabilizes the estimation
when compared to traditional sparse inverse problem techniques. This
interpretation also suggests an effective dictionary motivated initialization
for the MAP-EM algorithm. We demonstrate that in a number of image inverse
problems, including inpainting, zooming, and deblurring, the same algorithm
produces either equal, often significantly better, or very small margin worse
results than the best published ones, at a lower computational cost.
