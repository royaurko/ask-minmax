In the present paper, we consider the problem when the toric ring arising
from an integral cyclic polytope is Cohen-Macaulay by discussing Serre's
condition and we give a complete characterization when that is Gorenstein.
Moreover, we study the normality of the other semigroup ring arising from an
integral cyclic polytope but generated only with its vertices.
