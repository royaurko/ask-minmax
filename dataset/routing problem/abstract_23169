The classical and relativistic Hamilton-Jacobi approach is applied to the
one-dimensional homogeneous potential, $V(q)=\alpha q^n$, where $\alpha$ and
$n$ are continuously varying parameters. In the non-relativistic case, the
exact analytical solution is determined in terms of $\alpha$, $n$ and the total
energy $E$. It is also shown that the non-linear equation of motion can be
linearized by constructing a hypergeometric differential equation for the
inverse problem $t(q)$. A variable transformation reducing the general problem
to that one of a particle subjected to a linear force is also established. For
any value of $n$, it leads to a simple harmonic oscillator if $E>0$, an
"anti-oscillator" if $E<0$, or a free particle if E=0. However, such a
reduction is not possible in the relativistic case. For a bounded relativistic
motion, the first order correction to the period is determined for any value of
$n$. For $n >> 1$, it is found that the correction is just twice that one
deduced for the simple harmonic oscillator ($n=2$), and does not depend on the
specific value of $n$.
