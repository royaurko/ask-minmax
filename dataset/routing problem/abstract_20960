High energy infers high velocity and high velocity is a concept of special
relativity. The Maxwellian velocity distribution is corrected to be consistent
with special relativity. The corrected distribution reduces to the Maxwellian
distribution for small velocities, contains a relatively depleted high-energy
tail and vanishes at the velocity of light. This corrected distribution will
lower solar neutrino fluxes and change solar neutrino energy spectra but keep
solar sound speeds.
