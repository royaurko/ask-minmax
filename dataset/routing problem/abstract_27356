We study programs with integer data, procedure calls and arbitrary call
graphs. We show that, whenever the guards and updates are given by octagonal
relations, the reachability problem along control flow paths within some
language w1* ... wd* over program statements is decidable in Nexptime. To
achieve this upper bound, we combine a program transformation into the same
class of programs but without procedures, with an Np-completeness result for
the reachability problem of procedure-less programs. Besides the program, the
expression w1* ... wd* is also mapped onto an expression of a similar form but
this time over the transformed program statements. Several arguments involving
context-free grammars and their generative process enable us to give tight
bounds on the size of the resulting expression. The currently existing gap
between Np-hard and Nexptime can be closed to Np-complete when a certain
parameter of the analysis is assumed to be constant.
