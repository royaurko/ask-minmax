Let $\Lambda$ be a non-elementary convex co-compact fuchsian group which is a
subgroup of an arithmetic fuchsian group. We prove that the Laplace operator of
the hyperbolic surface $X=\Lambda \backslash\H$ has infinitely many resonances
in an effective strip depending on the dimension of the limit set $\delta$.
Applications to lower bounds for the hyperbolic lattice point counting problem
are derived.
