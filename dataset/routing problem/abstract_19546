Quintessence -- the energy density of a slowly evolving scalar field -- may
constitute a dynamical form of the homogeneous dark energy in the universe. We
review the basic idea in the light of the cosmological constant problem.
Cosmological observations or a time variation of fundamental `constants' can
distinguish quintessence from a cosmological constant.
