In this article we develop a new method to deal with maximal Cohen-Macaulay
modules over non-isolated surface singularities. In particular, we give a
negative answer on an old question of Schreyer about surface singularities with
only countably many indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules. Next, we
prove that the degenerate cusp singularities have tame Cohen-Macaulay
representation type. Our approach is illustrated on the case of $k\llbracket
x,y,z\rrbracket/(xyz)$ as well as several other rings. This study of maximal
Cohen-Macaulay modules over non-isolated singularities leads to a new class of
problems of linear algebra, which we call representations of decorated bunches
of chains. We prove that these matrix problems have tame representation type
and describe the underlying canonical forms.
