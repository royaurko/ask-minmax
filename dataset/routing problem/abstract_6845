In the present paper we consider the problem of local equivalence of second
order ODEs which are cubic in second derivative under the action of the
pseudogroup of contact transformations. We concentrate on the case when the
associated equation is linearizable and reduce the problem to the equivalence
problem of 2-parametric families of curves in $R^3$ under the action of the
group $SL_3$.
