We prove the control and stabilization of the Benjamin-Ono equation in
$L^2(\T)$, the lowest regularity where the initial value problem is well-posed.
This problem was already initiated in \cite{LinaresRosierBO} where a stronger
stabilization term was used (that makes the equation of parabolic type in the
control zone). Here we employ a more natural stabilization term related to the
$L^2$ norm. Moreover, by proving a theorem of controllability in $L^2$, we
manage to prove the global controllability in large time. Our analysis relies
strongly on the bilinear estimates proved in \cite{MolinetPilodBO} and some new
extension of these estimates established here.
