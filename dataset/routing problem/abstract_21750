Usual techniques to solve WCSP are based on cost transfer operations coupled
with a branch and bound algorithm. In this paper, we focus on an approach
integrating extraction and relaxation of Minimal Unsatisfiable Cores in order
to solve this problem. We decline our approach in two ways: an incomplete,
greedy, algorithm and a complete one.
