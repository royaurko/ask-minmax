We generalize Meeks and Yau's embeddedness result on the solutions of the
Plateau problem to the constant mean curvature disks. We show that any
minimizing H-disk in an H_0-convex domain is embedded for any H in [0,H_0). In
particular, for the unit ball B in R^3, this implies that for any H in [0,1],
any Jordan curve in the unit sphere bounds an embedded H-disk in B.
