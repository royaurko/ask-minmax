In this article, we study the maximal cross number of long zero-sumfree
sequences in a finite Abelian group. Regarding this inverse-type problem, we
formulate a general conjecture and prove, among other results, that this
conjecture holds true for finite cyclic groups, finite Abelian p-groups and for
finite Abelian groups of rank two. Also, the results obtained here enable us to
improve, via the resolution of a linear integer program, a result of W. Gao and
A. Geroldinger concerning the minimal number of elements with maximal order in
a long zero-sumfree sequence of a finite Abelian group of rank two.
