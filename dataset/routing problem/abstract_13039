In this paper, we investigate the application of radial basis functions
(RBFs) for the approximation with collocation of the Stokes problem. The
approximate solution is constructed in a multi-level fashion, each level using
compactly supported radial basis functions with decreasing scaling factors. We
use symmetric collocation and give sufficient conditions for convergence and
stability analysis is also presented. Numerical experiments support the
theoretical results.
