A method is suggested for treating those complicated physical problems for
which exact solutions are not known but a few approximation terms of a
calculational algorithm can be derived. The method permits one to answer the
following rather delicate questions: What can be said about the convergence of
the calculational procedure when only a few its terms are available and how to
decide which of the initial approximations of the perturbative algorithm is
better, when several such initial approximations are possible? Definite answers
to these important questions become possible by employing the self-similar
perturbation theory. The novelty of this paper is in developing the stability
analysis based on the method of multipliers and in illustrating the efficiency
of this analysis by different quantum-mechanical problems.
