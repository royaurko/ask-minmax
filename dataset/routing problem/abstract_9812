We address the problem of downlink beamformer design for
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) balancing in a multiuser
multicell environment with imperfectly estimated channels at base stations
(BSs). We first present a semidefinite program (SDP) based approximate solution
to the problem. Then, as our main contribution, by exploiting some properties
of the robust counterpart of the optimization problem, we arrive at a
second-order cone program (SOCP) based approximation of the balancing problem.
The advantages of the proposed SOCP-based design are twofold. First, it greatly
reduces the computational complexity compared to the SDP-based method. Second,
it applies to a wide range of uncertainty models. As a case study, we
investigate the performance of proposed formulations when the base station is
equipped with a massive antenna array. Numerical experiments are carried out to
confirm that the proposed robust designs achieve favorable results in scenarios
of practical interest.
