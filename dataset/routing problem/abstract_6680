A representation of an arbitrary system of strict linear inequalities in R^n
as a system of points is proposed. The representation is obtained by using a
so-called polarity. Based on this representation an algorithm for constructing
a committee solution of an inconsistent plane system of linear inequalities is
given. A solution of two problems on minimal committee of a plane system is
proposed. The obtained solutions to these problems can be found by means of the
proposed algorithm.
