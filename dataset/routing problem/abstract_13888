We study some type of mappings with finite distortion $f:D\rightarrow
D^{\prime},$ $D, D^{\prime}\subset{\Bbb R}^n,$ $n\ge 2,$ which admit branch
points. It is proved some inequality playing essential role at investigation of
some problems of plane and space mappings. As application, it is investigated a
problem of removable singularities for open discrete mappings with finite
length distortion.
