In a fractional Cauchy problem, the usual first order time derivative is
replaced by a fractional derivative. This problem was first considered by
\citet{nigmatullin}, and \citet{zaslavsky} in $\mathbb R^d$ for modeling some
physical phenomena.
  The fractional derivative models time delays in a diffusion process. We will
give a survey of the recent results on the fractional Cauchy problem and its
generalizations on bounded domains $D\subset \rd$ obtained in \citet{m-n-v-aop,
mnv-2}. We also study the solutions of fractional Cauchy problem where the
first time derivative is replaced with an infinite sum of fractional
derivatives. We point out a connection to eigenvalue problems for the
fractional time operators considered. The solutions to the eigenvalue problems
are expressed by Mittag-Leffler functions and its generalized versions. The
stochastic solution of the eigenvalue problems for the fractional derivatives
are given by inverse subordinators.
