We propose a cellular version of dynamical-mean field theory which gives a
natural generalization of its original single-site construction and is
formulated in different sets of variables. We show how non-orthogonality of the
tight-binding basis sets enters the problem and prove that the resulting
equations lead to manifestly causal self energies.
