A geometric generalization of the discrete-time linear deadbeat control
problem is studied. The proposed method to generate a deadbeat tracker for a
given nonlinear system is constructive and makes use of sets that can be
computed iteratively. For demonstration, derivations of deadbeat feedback law
and tracker dynamics are provided for various example systems. Based on the
method, a simple algorithm that computes the deadbeat gain for a linear system
with scalar input is given.
