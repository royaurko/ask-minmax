In two recent papers, an isometric conformal transformation has been
introduced that eliminates potential interaction terms from the Schr\"odinger
equation for central potential problems. The method has been demonstrated for
both the hydrogen atom and three-dimensional harmonic oscillator. Here, it is
shown that the same transformation technique can also be applied to central
potential problems formulated using the Klein-Gordon equation.
