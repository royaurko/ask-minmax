It is shown that exact solutions may be found for the energy eigenvalue
problem generated by the class of semirelativistic Hamiltonians of the form H =
sqrt{m^2+p^2} + hat{V}, where hat{V} is a non-local potential with a separable
kernel of the form V(r,r') = - sum_{i=1}^n v_i f_i(r)g_i(r'). Explicit examples
in one and three dimensions are discussed, including the Yamaguchi and Gauss
potentials. The results are used to obtain lower bounds for the energy of the
corresponding N-boson problem, with upper bounds provided by the use of a
Gaussian trial function.
