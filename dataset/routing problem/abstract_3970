Cooper problem for interacting fermions is solved in a lattice. It is found
that the binding energy of the Cooper problem can behave qualitatively
differently from the gap parameter of the BCS theory and that pairs of non-zero
center of mass momentum are favored in systems with unequal Fermi energies.
