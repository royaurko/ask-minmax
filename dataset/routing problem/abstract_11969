Detecting deadlocks in MPI synchronization communication programs is very
difficult and need building program models. All complex models are based on
sequential models. The sequential model is mapped into a set of character
strings and its deadlock detection problem is translated into an equivalent
multi-queue string matching problem. An algorithm is devised and implemented to
statically detect deadlocks in sequential models of MPI synchronization
communication programs. The time and space complexity of the algorithm is O(n)
where n is the amount of message in model. The algorithm is better than usual
circle-detection methods and can adapt well to dynamic message stream.
