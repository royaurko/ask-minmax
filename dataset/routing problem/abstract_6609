We use a characterization of the fractional Laplacian as a Dirichlet to
Neumann operator for an appropriate differential equation to study its obstacle
problem. We write an equivalent characterization as a thin obstacle problem. In
this way we are able to apply local type arguments to obtain sharp regularity
estimates for the solution and study the regularity of the free boundary.
