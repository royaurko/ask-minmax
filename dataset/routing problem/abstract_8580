Submanifolds of finite type were introduced by the contributor during the late
1970s. The first results on this subject had been collected in contributor's book
[Total mean curvature and sub manifolds of finite type, World Scientific, NJ,
1984]. A list of ten open problems and three conjectures on submanifolds of
finite type was published in 1981. The main purpose of this article is to
provide some updated information on the three conjectures.
