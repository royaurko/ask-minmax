We provide a new method to prove and improve the Chemin-Masmoudi criterion
for viscoelastic systems of Oldroyd type in \cite{CM} in two space dimensions.
Our method is much easier than the one based on the well-known \textit{losing a
priori estimate} and is expected to be easily adopted to other problems
involving the losing \textit{a priori} estimate.
