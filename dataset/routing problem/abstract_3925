We study the matrix factorization problem associated with an SO(2) spinning
top by using the algebro-geometric approach. We derive the explicit expressions
in terms of Riemann theta functions and discus some related problems including
a non-compact extension and the case when the Lax matrix contains higher-order
powers of the spectral parameter.
