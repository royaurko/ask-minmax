We aim to use the concept of sheaf to establish a link between certain
aspects of the set of positive integers numbers, a topic corresponding to the
elementary mathematics, and some fundamental ideas of contemporary mathematics.
We hope that this type of approach helps the school students to restate some
problems of elementary mathematics in an environment deeper and suitable for
its study.
