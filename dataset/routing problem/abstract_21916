The cyclicity of the exterior period annulus of the asymmetrically perturbed
Duffing oscillator is a well known problem extensively studied in the
literature. In the present paper we provide a complete bifurcation diagram for
the number of the zeros of the associated Melnikov function in a suitable
complex domain.
