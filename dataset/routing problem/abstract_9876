The Hospitals / Residents problem with Couples (HRC) is a generalisation of
the classical Hospitals / Resident problem (HR) that is important in practical
applications because it models the case where couples submit joint preference
lists over pairs of (typically geographically close) hospitals. In this paper
we give a new NP-completeness result for the problem of deciding whether a
stable matching exists, in highly restricted instances of HRC. Further, we
present an Integer Programming (IP) model for HRC and extend it the case where
preference lists can include ties. Also, we describe an empirical study of an
IP model or HRC and its extension to the case where preference lists can
include ties. This model was applied to randomly generated instances and also
real-world instances arising from previous matching runs of the Scottish
Foundation Allocation Scheme, used to allocate junior doctors to hospitals in
Scotland.
