We consider the problem of calculating the Gaussian curvature of a conical
2-dimensional space by using concepts and techniques of distribution theory. We
apply the results obtained to calculate the Riemannian curvature of the
4-dimensional conical space-time. We show that the method can be extended for
calculating the curvature of a special class of more general space-times with
conical singularity.
