Probablistic solutions of the so called Schr\"{o}dinger boundary data problem
provide for a unique Markovian interpolation between any two strictly positive
probability densities designed to form the input-output statistics data for a
certain dynamical process taking place in a finite-time interval. The key
problem is to select the jointly continuous in all variables positive semigroup
kernel, appropriate for the phenomenological (physical) situation.
