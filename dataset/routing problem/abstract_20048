These lectures give an introduction to the problem of finding a realistic and
natural extension of the standard model based on spontaneously broken
supersymmetry. Topics discussed at some length include the effective field
theory paradigm, coupling constants as superfield spurions, gauge mediated
supersymmetry breaking, and anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking, including
an extensive introduction to supergravity relevant for phenomenology.
