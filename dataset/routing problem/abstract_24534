This Ph.D. thesis concerns the version of the classical coupon collector's
problem, when a collector samples with replacement a set of $n\ge 2$ distinct
coupons so that at each time any one of the $n$ coupons is drawn with the same
probability $1/n$. For a fixed integer $m\in\{0,1,...,n-1\}$, the coupon
collector's waiting time $W_{n,m}$ is the random number of draws the collector
performs until he acquires $n-m$ distinct coupons for the first time. The basic
goal of the thesis is to approximate the distribution of the coupon collector's
appropriately centered and normalized waiting time with well-known measures
with high accuracy, and in many cases prove asymptotic expansions for the
related probability distribution functions and mass functions. The
approximating measures are chosen from five different measure families. Three
of them -- the Poisson distributions, the normal distributions and the
Gumbel-like distributions -- are probability measure families whose members
occur as limiting laws in the limit theorems concerning $W_{n,m}$. The other
two approximating measure families are certain compound Poisson distributions
and Poisson--Charlier signed measures.
