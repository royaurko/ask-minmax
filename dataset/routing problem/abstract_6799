We study a mean value of the shifted convolution problem over the Hecke
eigenvalues of a fixed non-holomorphic cusp form. We attain a result also for a
weighted case. Furthermore, we point out that the proof yields analogous upper
bounds for the shifted convolution problem over the Fourier coefficients of a
fixed holomorphic cusp form in mean.
