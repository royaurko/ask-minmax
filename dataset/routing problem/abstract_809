Two classical, damped and driven spin oscillators with an isotropic exchange
interaction are considered. They represent a nontrivial physical system whose
equations of motion are shown to allow for an analytic treatment of local
codimension 1 and 2 bifurcations. In addition, numerical results are presented
which exhibit a Feigenbaum route to chaos.
