The aim of the present work is to reduce the secular solution around the
triangular equilibrium points to periodic solution in the frame work of the
generalized restricted thee-body problem. This model is generalized in sense
that both the primaries are oblate and radiating as well as the gravitational
potential from a belt. We show that the linearized equation of motion of the
infinitesimal body around the triangular equilibrium points has a secular
solution when the value of mass ratio equals the critical mass value. Moreover,
we reduce this solution to periodic solution, as well as some numerical and
graphical investigations for the effects of the perturbed forces are
introduced. This model can be used to examine the existence of a dust particle
near the triangular points of an oblate and radiating binary stars system
surrounded by a belt.
