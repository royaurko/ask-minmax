The homology groups of a manifold are important topological invariants that
provide an algebraic summary of the manifold. These groups contain rich
topological information, for instance, about the connected components, holes,
tunnels and sometimes the dimension of the manifold. In earlier work, we have
considered the statistical problem of estimating the homology of a manifold
from noiseless samples and from noisy samples under several different noise
models. We derived upper and lower bounds on the minimax risk for this problem.
In this note we revisit the noiseless case. In previous work we used Le Cam's
lemma to establish a lower bound that differed from the upper bound of Niyogi,
Smale and Weinberger by a polynomial factor in the condition number.
  In this note we use a different construction based on the direct analysis of
the likelihood ratio test to show that the upper bound of Niyogi, Smale and
Weinberger is in fact tight, thus establishing rate optimal asymptotic minimax
bounds for the problem. The techniques we use here extend in a straightforward
way to the noisy settings considered in our earlier work.
