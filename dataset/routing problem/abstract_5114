The compressed word problem for a finitely generated monoid M asks whether
two given compressed words over the generators of M represent the same element
of M. For string compression, straight-line programs, i.e., context-free
grammars that generate a single string, are used in this paper. It is shown
that the compressed word problem for a free inverse monoid of finite rank at
least two is complete for Pi^p_2 (second universal level of the polynomial time
hierarchy). Moreover, it is shown that there exists a fixed finite idempotent
presentation (i.e., a finite set of relations involving idempotents of a free
inverse monoid), for which the corresponding quotient monoid has a
PSPACE-complete compressed word problem. It was shown previously that the
ordinary uncompressed word problem for such a quotient can be solved in
logspace. Finally, a PSPACE-algorithm that checks whether a given element of a
free inverse monoid belongs to a given rational subset is presented. This
problem is also shown to be PSPACE-complete (even for a fixed finitely
generated submonoid instead of a variable rational subset).
