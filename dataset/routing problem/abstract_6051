Discovering a concise schema from given XML documents is an important problem
in XML applications. In this paper, we focus on the problem of learning an
unordered schema from a given set of XML examples, which is actually a problem
of learning a restricted regular expression with interleaving using positive
example strings. Schemas with interleaving could present meaningful knowledge
that cannot be disclosed by previous inference techniques. Moreover, inference
of the minimal schema with interleaving is challenging. The problem of finding
a minimal schema with interleaving is shown to be NP-hard. Therefore, we
develop an approximation algorithm and a heuristic solution to tackle the
problem using techniques different from known inference algorithms. We do
experiments on real-world data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approaches. Our heuristic algorithm is shown to produce results that are very
close to optimal.
