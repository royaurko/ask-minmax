We report on the evolution of the magnetic structure of BiFeO3 thin films
grown on SrTiO3 substrates as a function of Sm doping. We determined the
magnetic structure using neutron diffraction. We found that as Sm increases,
the magnetic structure evolves from a cycloid to a G-type antiferromagnet at
the morphotropic phase boundary, where there is a large piezoelectric response
due to an electric-field induced structural transition. The occurrence of the
magnetic structural transition at the morphotropic phase boundary offers
another route towards room temperature multiferroic devices.
