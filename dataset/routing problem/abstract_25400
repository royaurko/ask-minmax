We present a cosmic string on a warped five dimensional space time in
Einstein-Yang-Mills theory. Four-dimensional cosmic strings show some serious
problems concerning the mechanism of string smoothing related to the string
mass per unit length, $G\mu \approx 10^{-6}$. A warped cosmic string could
overcome this problem and also the superstring requirement that $G\mu$ must be
of order 1, which is far above observational bounds. Also the absence of
observational evidence of axially symmetric lensing effect caused by cosmic
strings could be explained by the warped cosmic string model we present: the
angle deficit of the string is warped down to unobservable value in the brane,
compared to its value in the bulk. It turns out that only for negative
cosmological constant, a consistent numerical solution of the model is
possible.
