Reconstruction of the \beta-function for \phi^4 theory, attempted previously
by summation of perturbation series, leads to asymptotics \beta(g)=\beta_\infty
g^\alpha at g\to\infty, where \alpha\approx 1 for space dimensions d=2,3,4. The
natural hypothesis arises, that asymptotic behavior is \beta(g) \sim g for all
d. Consideration of the zero-dimensional case confirms the hypothesis and
reveals the origin of this result: it is related with a zero of a certain
functional integral. Consideration can be generalized to the arbitrary space
dimensionality, confirming the linear asymptotics of \beta(g) for all d.
Asymptotical behavior for other renormalization group functions (anomalous
dimensions) is found to be constant. Relation to the "zero charge" problem is
discussed.
