By virtue of Rayleigh-Benard convection, we illustrate the advantages of
combining a hydrodynamic pattern forming instability with a thermodynamic
critical point. This has already lead to many novel unexpected observations and
is further shown to possess opportunities for the study of exciting fundamental
problems in nonequilibrium systems.
