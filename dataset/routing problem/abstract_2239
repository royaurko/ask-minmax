We provide theoretical and numerical tools to quantitatively study the impact
of nonlocality arising from free electrons in metals on the optical properties
of metallo-dielectric multilayers. Though effects due to nonlocality are in
general quite small, they nevertheless can be important for very thin
(typically below 10 nm) metallic layers - as are used in structures
characterized by relatively flat dispersion curves. Such structures include
those with negative refractive index; hyperbolic metamaterials; and materials
with index near zero. We find in all cases that the inclusion of nonlocal
effects through application of the hydrodynamic model to the electron response
leads to a higher transmission through the considered medium. Finally, we
examine the excitation of gap-plasmon resonances, where nonlocality plays a
much greater role, and suggest possible routes for experimental investigation.
