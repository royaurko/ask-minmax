We consider a dynamical system subjected to weak but adiabatically slow
fluctuations of external origin. Based on the ``adiabatic following''
approximation we carry out an expansion in \alpha/|\mu|, where \alpha is the
strength of fluctuations and 1/|\mu| refers to the time scale of evolution of
the unperturbed system to obtain a linear differential equation for the average
solution. The theory is applied to the problems of a damped harmonic oscillator
and diffusion in a turbulent fluid. The result is the realization of
`renormalized' diffusion constant or damping constant for the respective
problems. The applicability of the method has been critically analyzed.
