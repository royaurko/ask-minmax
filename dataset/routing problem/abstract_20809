Minimax solutions are weak solutions to Cauchy problems involving
Hamilton--Jacobi equations, constructed from generating families quadratic at
infinity of their geometric solutions. We give a complete description of
minimax solutions and we classify their generic singularities of codimension
not greater than 2.
