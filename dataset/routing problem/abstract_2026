The clustering algorithm are considered as a kind of key technique used to
reduce energy consumption. It can help in increasing the stability period and
network life time. Routing protocol for efficient energy utilization should be
designed for heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). We purpose
Hybrid-DEEC (H-DEEC), a chain and cluster based (hybrid) distributed scheme for
efficient energy utilization in WSNs. In H-DEEC,elected Cluster Heads (CHs)
communicate the Base Station (BS) through beta elected nodes, by using
multi-hopping. We logically divide the network into two parts, on the basis of
the residual energy of nodes. The normal nodes with high initial and residual
energy will behighlyprobable to be CHs than the nodes with lesser energy. To
overcome the deficiencies of H-DEEC, we propose Multi-Edged Hybrid-DEEC
(MH-DEEC). In MH-DEEC the criteria of chain construction is modified. Finally,
the comparison in simulation results with other heterogeneous protocols show
that, MH-DEEC and H-DEEC achieves longer stability time and network life time
due to efficient energy utilization.
