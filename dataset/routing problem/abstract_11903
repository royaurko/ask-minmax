Photodetachment in ultrastrong laser field in two spatial dimensions is
investigated numerically. The problem of an adiabatic stabilization is
discussed, in particular it is shown that a quick drift in the direction of the
electric field and a magnetic drift cannot be avoided simultaneously. A
qualitative behavior of the packet for a short-range binding potential is
contrasted with that for a soft-core potential, in particular dynamical effects
due to a rescattering of the fragments separated from the main packet are
demonstrated.
