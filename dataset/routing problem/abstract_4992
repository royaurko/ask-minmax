NP-complete problems should be hard on some instances but those may be
extremely rare. On generic instances many such problems, especially related to
random graphs, have been proven easy. We show the intractability of random
instances of a graph coloring problem: this graph problem is hard on average
unless all NP problem under all samplable (i.e., generatable in polynomial
time) distributions are easy. Worst case reductions use special gadgets and
typically map instances into a negligible fraction of possible outputs. Ours
must output nearly random graphs and avoid any super-polynomial distortion of
probabilities. This poses significant technical difficulty.
