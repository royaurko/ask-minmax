In earlier published work, it was proposed that light speed was larger in the
early universe by 30 orders of magnitude compared to its presently observed
value. This change in the speed of light is associated with a spontaneous
breaking of local Lorentz invariance in the early Universe, associated with a
first order phase transition at a critical time $t=t_c$. This solves the
horizon problem, leads to a mechanism of monopole suppression in cosmology and
can resolve the flatness problem. it also offers the potential of solving the
cosmological constant problem. After the critical time $t_c$, local Lorentz
invariance is restored and light travels at its presently measured speed. We
investigate the field equations in the spontaneously broken phase and study
further the flatness problem and the cosmological constant problem. The entropy
is shown to undergo a large increase as the light velocity goes through a phase
transition. A scale invariant prediction for microwave background fluctuations
originating at the time of the phase transition is discussed.
