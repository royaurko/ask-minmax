We study two extremal problems of geometric function theory introduced by A.
A. Goldberg in 1973. For one problem we find the exact solution, and for the
second one we obtain partial results. In the process we study the lengths of
hyperbolic geodesics in the twice punctured plane, prove several results about
them and make a conjecture. Goldberg's problems have important applications to
control theory.
