The contributors recently proposed a MIMO radar system that is implemented by a
small wireless network. By applying compressive sensing (CS) at the receive
nodes, the MIMO radar super-resolution can be achieved with far fewer
observations than conventional approaches. This previous work considered the
estimation of direction of arrival and Doppler. Since the targets are sparse in
the angle-velocity space, target information can be extracted by solving an l1
minimization problem. In this paper, the range information is exploited by
introducing step frequency to MIMO radar with CS. The proposed approach is able
to achieve high range resolution and also improve the ambiguous velocity.
However, joint angle-Doppler-range estimation requires discretization of the
angle-Doppler-range space which causes a sharp rise in the computational burden
of the l1 minimization problem. To maintain an acceptable complexity, a
technique is proposed to successively estimate angle, Doppler and range in a
decoupled fashion. The proposed approach can significantly reduce the
complexity without sacrificing performance.
