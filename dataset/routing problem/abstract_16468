We propose a simple and reliable method to study the translational relaxation
of 'hot' H atoms following their production by chemical mechanisms. The problem
is relevant to PDR's, shocks, photospheres, atmospheric entry problems. We show
that the thermalization of H atoms can be conveniently studied by a simple
method and set the basis for further investigations. The method adopted is
Monte Carlo method including the thermal distribution of background molecules.
The transport cross section is determined by the inversion of transport data.
Plots of the collisions density of H atoms in H$_{2}$ gas are calculated and
discussed also in the context of simple theories. The application of the
results to astrophysical problems is outlined including numerical results for
the reaction H + H$_{2}$O $\rightarrow$ H$_{2}$ + OH.
