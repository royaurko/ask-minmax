The backpressure routing policy is known to be a throughput optimal policy
that supports any feasible traffic demand in data networks, but may have poor
delay performance when packets traverse loops in the network. In this paper, we
study loop-free backpressure routing policies that forward packets along
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to avoid the looping problem. These policies use
link reversal algorithms to improve the DAGs in order to support any achievable
traffic demand.
  For a network with a single commodity, we show that a DAG that supports a
given traffic demand can be found after a finite number of iterations of the
link-reversal process. We use this to develop a joint link-reversal and
backpressure routing policy, called the loop free backpressure (LFBP)
algorithm. This algorithm forwards packets on the DAG, while the DAG is
dynamically updated based on the growth of the queue backlogs. We show by
simulations that such a DAG-based policy improves the delay over the classical
backpressure routing policy. We also propose a multicommodity version of the
LFBP algorithm, and via simulation we show that its delay performance is better
than that of backpressure.
