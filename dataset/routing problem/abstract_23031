The discrete logarithm problem in Jacobians of curves of high genus $g$ over
finite fields $\FF_q$ is known to be computable with subexponential complexity
$L_{q^g}(1/2, O(1))$. We present an algorithm for a family of plane curves
whose degrees in $X$ and $Y$ are low with respect to the curve genus, and
suitably unbalanced. The finite base fields are arbitrary, but their sizes
should not grow too fast compared to the genus. For this family, the group
structure can be computed in subexponential time of $L_{q^g}(1/3, O(1))$, and a
discrete logarithm computation takes subexponential time of
$L_{q^g}(1/3+\epsilon, o(1))$ for any positive $\epsilon$. These runtime bounds
rely on heuristics similar to the ones used in the number field sieve or the
function field sieve algorithms.
