The influence of background states with increasing level of complexity on the
strength distribution of the isoscalar and isovector giant quadrupole resonance
in $^{40}$Ca is studied. It is found that the background characteristics,
typical for chaotic systems, strongly affects the fluctuation properties of the
strength distribution. In particular, the small components of the wave function
obey a scaling law analogous to self-organized systems at the critical state.
This appears to be consistent with the Porter-Thomas distribution of the
transition strength.
