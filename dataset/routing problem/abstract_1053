During the last 3 years, our group has investigated extensively the
complexation mechanism between neutral-polyelectrolyte block copolymers with
oppositely charged species. These species are surfactant micelles, multivalent
counterions and inorganic nanoparticles. In the three cases, we have
established the thermodynamical phase diagram of these systems, and found broad
regions where supramolecular aggregates spontaneously form via electrostatic
self-assembly. From earlier works, it was suspected that these mixed colloids
exhibit a core-shell structure. However, their inner structure was unveiled by
us only recently, using a combination of light, neutron and x-ray scattering
experiments.
