In the present work we investigate uniqueness of solution of the
inverse-source problem with non-local conditions for mixed parabolic-hyperbolic
type equation with Caputo fractional derivative. Using spectral expansion
method we prove the uniqueness of the formulated problem. Solution of the
problem we represent as bi-orthogonal series with respect to space variable and
will get fractional order ODEs with respect to time-variable. Using boundary
and gluing conditions, we deduce system of algebraic equations regarding
unknown constants and imposing condition to the determinant of this system we
prove the uniqueness of formulated problem. Moreover, we write some non-trivial
solutions of the problem, when imposed conditions are not fulfilled.
