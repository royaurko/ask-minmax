In [1], we introduced the weakly synchronizing languages for probabilistic
automata. In this report, we show that the emptiness problem of weakly
synchronizing languages for probabilistic automata is undecidable. This implies
that the decidability result of [1-3] for the emptiness problem of weakly
synchronizing language is incorrect.
