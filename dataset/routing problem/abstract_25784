The hard-disk problem, the statics and the dynamics of equal two-dimensional
hard spheres in a periodic box, has had a profound influence on statistical and
computational physics. Markov-chain Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics were
first discussed for this model. Here we reformulate hard-disk Monte Carlo
algorithms in terms of another classic problem, namely the sampling from a
polytope. Local Markov-chain Monte Carlo, as proposed by Metropolis et al. in
1953, appears as a sequence of random walks in high-dimensional polytopes,
while the moves of the more powerful event-chain algorithm correspond to
molecular dynamics evolution. We determine the convergence properties of Monte
Carlo methods in a special invariant polytope associated with hard-disk
configurations, and the implications for convergence of hard-disk sampling.
Finally, we discuss parallelization strategies for event-chain Monte Carlo and
present results for a multicore implementation.
