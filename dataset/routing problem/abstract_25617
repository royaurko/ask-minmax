The primary concern in area of computational grid is security and resources.
Most of the existing grids address this problem by authenticating the users,
hosts and their interactions in an appropriate manner. A secured system is
compulsory for the efficient utilization of grid services. The high degree of
strangeness has been identified as the problem factors in the secured selection
of grid. Without the assurance of a higher degree of trust relationship,
competent resource selection and utilization cannot be achieved. In this paper
we proposed an approach which is providing reliability and reputation aware
security for resource selection in grid environment. In this approach, the
self-protection capability and reputation weightage is utilized to obtain the
Reliability Factor (RF) value. Therefore jobs are allocated to the resources
that posses higher RF values. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that as
higher trust and reliable nodes are selected the chances of failure decreased
drastically.
