We discuss global gauge fixing on the lattice, specifically to the lattice
Landau gauge, with the goal of understanding the question of why the process
becomes extremely slow for large lattices. We construct an artificial
"gauge-fixing" problem which has the essential features encountered in
actuality. In the limit in which the size of the system to be gauge fixed
becomes infinite, the problem becomes equivalent to finding a series expansion
in functions which are related to the Jacobi polynomials. The series converges
slowly, as expected. It also converges non-uniformly, which is an observed
characteristic of gauge fixing. In the limiting example, the non-uniformity
arises through the Gibbs phenomenon.
