Let $k$ be a number field and $B$ be a central simple algebra over $k$ of
dimension $p^2$ where $p$ is prime. In the case that $p=2$ we assume that $B$
is not totally definite. In this paper we study sets of pairwise nonisomorphic
maximal orders of $B$ with the property that a $\mathcal{O}_k$-order of rank
$p$ embeds into either every maximal order in the set or into none at all. Such
a set is called nonselective. We prove upper and lower bounds for the
cardinality of a maximal nonselective set. This problem is motivated by the
inverse spectral problem in differential geometry. In particular we use our
results to clarify a theorem of Vign{\'e}ras on the construction of isospectral
nonisometric hyperbolic surfaces and $3$-manifolds from orders in quaternion
algebras. We conclude by giving an example of isospectral nonisometric
hyperbolic surfaces which arise from a quaternion algebra exhibiting
selectivity.
