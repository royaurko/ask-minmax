We have developed the techniques necessary for a numerical simulation of d=3
SU(2) Lattice Gauge theories in the dual formulation as originally developed by
Anishetty et al . These include updating techniques that preserve the
constrained configuration space, efficient evaluation of 6-j symbols and a
certain problem associated with the positive indefiniteness of the weight
factors.
