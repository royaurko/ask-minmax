Determining if a point is in a polygon or not is used by a lot of
applications in computer graphics, computer games and geoinformatics.
Implementing this check is error-prone since there are many special cases to be
considered. In this paper we present a simple even-odd algorithm to solve this
problem for complex polygons in linear time.
