The aim of this paper is to investigate extremum problems with pay-off being
the total variational distance metric defined on the space of probability
measures, subject to linear functional constraints on the space of probability
measures, and vice-versa; that is, with the roles of total variational metric
and linear functional interchanged. Utilizing concepts from signed measures,
the extremum probability measures of such problems are obtained in closed form,
by identifying the partition of the support set and the mass of these extremum
measures on the partition. The results are derived for abstract spaces;
specifically, complete separable metric spaces known as Polish spaces, while
the high level ideas are also discussed for denumerable spaces endowed with the
discrete topology. These extremum problems often arise in many areas, such as,
approximating a family of probability distributions by a given probability
distribution, maximizing or minimizing entropy subject to total variational
distance metric constraints, quantifying uncertainty of probability
distributions by total variational distance metric, stochastic minimax control,
and in many problems of information, decision theory, and minimax theory.
