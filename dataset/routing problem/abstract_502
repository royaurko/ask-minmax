Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is a infrastructure less network in which two
or more devices have wireless communication which can communicate with each
other and exchange information without need of any centralized administrator.
Each node in the ad hoc network acts as a router, forwarding data packets for
other nodes. The main issue is to compare the existing routing protocol and
finding the best one. The scope of this study is to test routing performance of
three different routing protocols (AODV, OLSR and DSDV) with respect to various
mobility models using NS2 simulator. In this paper the parameters used for
comparison are packet delivery fraction (PDF), average end to end delay (AEED),
normalized routing load (NRL) and throughput.
