The exactly and quasi-exactly solvable problems for spin one-half in one
dimension on the basis of a hidden dynamical symmetry algebra of Hamiltonian
are discussed. We take the supergroup, $OSP(2|1)$, as such a symmetry. A number
of exactly solvable examples are considered and their spectrum are evaluated
explicitly. Also, a class of quasi-exactly solvable problems on the basis of
such a symmetry has been obtained.
