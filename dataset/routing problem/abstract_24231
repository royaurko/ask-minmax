It is well known that modal satisfiability is PSPACE-complete (Ladner 1977).
However, the complexity may decrease if we restrict the set of propositional
operators used. Note that there exist an infinite number of propositional
operators, since a propositional operator is simply a Boolean function. We
completely classify the complexity of modal satisfiability for every finite set
of propositional operators, i.e., in contrast to previous work, we classify an
infinite number of problems. We show that, depending on the set of
propositional operators, modal satisfiability is PSPACE-complete,
coNP-complete, or in P. We obtain this trichotomy not only for modal formulas,
but also for their more succinct representation using modal circuits. We
consider both the uni-modal and the multi-modal case, and study the dual
problem of validity as well.
