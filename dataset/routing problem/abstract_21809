We continue studying robustness of solving algebraic systems of Prony type
(also known as the exponential fitting systems), which appear prominently in
many areas of mathematics, in particular modern "sub-Nyquist" sampling
theories. We show that by considering these systems at arithmetic progressions
(or "decimating" them), one can achieve better performance in the presence of
noise. We also show that the corresponding lower bounds are closely related to
well-known estimates, obtained for similar problems but in different contexts.
