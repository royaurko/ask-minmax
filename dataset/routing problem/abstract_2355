Superradiance typically requires preparation of atoms in highly entangled
multi-particle states, the so-called Dicke states. In this paper we discuss an
alternative route where we prepare such states from initially uncorrelated
atoms by a measurement process. By measuring higher order intensity intensity
correlations we demonstrate that we can simulate the emission characteristics
of Dicke superradiance by starting with atoms in the fully excited state. We
describe the essence of the scheme by first investigating two excited atoms.
Here we demonstrate how via Hanbury Brown and Twiss type of measurements we can
produce Dicke superradiance and subradiance displayed commonly with two atoms
in the single excited symmetric and antisymmetric Dicke state, respectively. We
thereafter generalize the scheme to arbitrary numbers of atoms and detectors,
and explain in detail the mechanism which leads to this result. The approach
shows that Hanbury Brown and Twiss type intensity interference and the
phenomenon of Dicke superradiance can be regarded as two sides of the same
coin. We also present a compact result for the characteristic functional which
generates all order intensity intensity correlations.
