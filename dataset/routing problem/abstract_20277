We present some recent existence results for the variational model of crack
growth in brittle materials proposed by Francfort and Marigo in 1998. These
results, obtained in collaboration with Francfort and Toader, cover the case of
arbitrary space dimension with a general quasiconvex bulk energy and with
prescribed boundary deformations and applied loads.
