In this work, we consider boundary value problems involving Caputo and
Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives of order $\alpha\in(1,2)$ on the unit
interval $(0,1)$. These fractional derivatives lead to non-symmetric boundary
value problems, which are investigated from a variational point of view. The
variational problem for the Riemann-Liouville case is coercive on the space
$H_0^{\alpha/2}(0,1)$ but the solutions are less regular, whereas that for the
Caputo case involves different test and trial spaces. The numerical analysis of
these problems requires the so-called shift theorems which show that the
solutions of the variational problem are more regular. The regularity pickup
enables one to establish convergence rates of the finite element
approximations. Finally, numerical results are presented to illustrate the
error estimates.
