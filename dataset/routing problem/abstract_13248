We consider regularly stable parabolic symplectic and orthogonal bundles over
an irreducible smooth projective curve over an algebraically closed field of
characteristic zero. The morphism from the moduli stack of such bundles to its
coarse moduli space is a $\mu_2$-gerbe. We study the period and index of this
gerbe, and solve the corresponding period-index problem.
