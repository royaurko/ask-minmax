A novel numerical method for solving inverse scattering problem with
fixed-energy data is proposed. The method contains a new important concept: the
stability index of the inversion problem. This is a number, computed from the
data, which shows how stable the inversion is. If this index is small, then the
inversion provides a set of potentials which differ so little, that practically
one can represent this set by one potential. If this index is larger than some
threshold, then practically one concludes that with the given data the
inversion is unstable and the potential cannot be identified uniquely from the
data. Inversion of the fixed-energy phase shifts for several model potentials
is considered. The results show practical efficiency of the proposed method.
The method is of general nature and is applicable to a very wide variety of the
inverse problems.
