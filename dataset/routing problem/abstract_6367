By an extension of Harnad's and Dubrovin's `duality' constructions, the
general isomonodromy problem studied by Jimbo, Miwa, and Ueno is equivalent to
one in which the linear system of differential equations has a regular
singularity at the origin and an irregular singularity at infinity (both
resonant). The paper looks at this dual formulation of the problem from two
points of view: the symplectic geometry of spaces associated with the loop
group of the general linear group, and a generalization of the self-dual
Yang-Mills equations.
