In this work we introduce the obstacle-mass constraint problem for a
multidimensional scalar hyperbolic conservation law. We prove existence of an
entropy solution to this problem by a penalization/viscosity method. The mass
constraint introduces a nonlocal Lagrange multiplier in the penalized equation,
giving rise to a nonlocal parabolic problem. We determine conditions on the
initial data and on the obstacle function which ensure global in time existence
of solution. These are not smoothness conditions, but relate to the propagation
of the support of the initial data.
