We study smoothness of generalized solutions of nonlocal elliptic problems in
plane bounded domains with piecewise smooth boundary. The case where the
support of nonlocal terms can intersect the boundary is considered. We announce
conditions that are necessary and sufficient for any generalized solution to
possess an appropriate smoothness (in terms of Sobolev spaces). The proofs are
given in the forthcoming paper.
