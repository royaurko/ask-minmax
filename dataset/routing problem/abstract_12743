Despite the nice features of the Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati (DGP) model to
explain the late-time acceleration of the universe, it suffers from some
theoretical problems like the ghost issue. We present a way to self-accelerate
the normal DGP branch, which is known to be free of the ghost problem, by means
of an f(R) term on the brane action. We obtain the de Sitter self-accelerating
solutions of the model and study their stability under homogeneous
perturbations.
