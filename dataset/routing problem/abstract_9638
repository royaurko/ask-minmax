In the matroid buyback problem, an algorithm observes a sequence of bids and
must decide whether to accept each bid at the moment it arrives, subject to a
matroid constraint on the set of accepted bids. Decisions to reject bids are
irrevocable, whereas decisions to accept bids may be canceled at a cost which
is a fixed fraction of the bid value. We present a new randomized algorithm for
this problem, and we prove matching upper and lower bounds to establish that
the competitive ratio of this algorithm, against an oblivious adversary, is the
best possible. We also observe that when the adversary is adaptive, no
randomized algorithm can improve the competitive ratio of the optimal
deterministic algorithm. Thus, our work completely resolves the question of
what competitive ratios can be achieved by randomized algorithms for the
matroid buyback problem.
