We investigate the relationship between photoluminescence (PL) intensity and
environmental sensitivity of surfactant-wrapped single walled carbon nanotubes
(SWNTs). SWNTs were studied under a variety of conditions in suspension as well
as encapsulated in silica nanocomposites, which were prepared by an efficient
chemical vapor into liquids (CViL) sol-gel process. The dramatically improved
silica encapsulation process described here has several advantages, including
fast preparation and high SWNT loading concentration, over other encapsulation
methods used to prepare fluorescent SWNT/silica nanocomposites. Further,
addition of glycerol to SWNT suspensions prior to performing the CViL sol-gel
process allows for the preparation of freestanding fluorescent silica xerogels,
which to the best of our knowledge is the first report of such nanocomposites.
Our spectroscopic data on SWNTs suspended in aqueous surfactants or
encapsulated in silica show that achieving maximum PL intensity results in
decreased sensitivity of SWNT emission response to changes imparted by the
local environment. In addition, silica encapsulation can be used to "lock-in" a
surfactant micelle structure surrounding SWNTs to minimize interactions between
SWNTs and ions/small molecules. Ultimately, our work demonstrates that one
should consider a balance between maximum PL intensity and the ability to sense
environmental changes when designing new SWNT systems for future sensing
applications.
