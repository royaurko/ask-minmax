In this work we consider a problem related to the equilibrium statistical
mechanics of spin glasses, namely the study of the Gibbs measure of the random
energy model. For solving this problem, new results of independent interest on
sums of spacings for i.i.d. Gaussian random variables are presented.
  Then we give a precise description of the support of the Gibbs measure below
the critical temperature.
