We study invariant functions on the reductions mod p^n of p-divisible groups.
The proof of the main result, which applies to one-dimensional groups, combines
results of Tate with van der Put's solution of his p-adic Corona problem. For
higher dimensional groups a generalization of the p-adic Corona problem would
have to be solved.
