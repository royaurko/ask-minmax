We study the problem of a magnetic polaron in an antiferromagnetic
semiconductor (ferron). We obtain an analytical solution for the distortion
produced in the magnetic structure of the d-spins due to the presence of a
charge carrier bound to an impurity. The region in which the charge carrier is
trapped is of the order of the lattice constant (small ferron) but the
distortion of the magnetic structure extends over much larger distance. It is
shown that the presence of this distortion makes the ferron more stable, and
introduces a new length scale in the problem.
