Motivated by recent proposals for the generation of Majorana fermions in
semiconducting hybrid structures, we examine possible experimental fingerprints
of such excitations. Whereas previous works mainly have focused on zero-energy
states in vortex cores in this context, we demonstrate analytically an
alternative route to detection of Majorana excitations in semiconducting hybrid
structures: interface-bound states that may be probed directly via conductance
spectroscopy or STM-measurements. We estimate the necessary experimental
parameters required for observation of our predictions.
