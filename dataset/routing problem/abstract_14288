We study the data complexity of model-checking for logics with team
semantics. For dependence and independence logic, we completely characterize
the tractability/intractability frontier of data complexity of both
quantifier-free and quantified formulas. For inclusion logic formulas, we
reduce the model-checking problem to the satisfiability problem of so-called
Dual-Horn propositional formulas. While interesting in its own right, this also
provides an alternative proof for the recent result of P. Galliani and L. Hella
in 2013 showing that the data complexity of inclusion logic is in PTIME. In the
last section we consider the data complexity of inclusion logic under so-called
strict semantics.
