Both unconstrained and constrained minimax single facility location problems
are considered in multidimensional space with Chebyshev distance. A new
solution approach is proposed within the framework of idempotent algebra to
reduce the problems to solving linear vector equations and minimizing
functionals defined on some idempotent semimodule. The approach offers a
solution in a closed form that actually involves performing matrix-vector
multiplications in terms of idempotent algebra for appropriate matrices and
vectors. To illustrate the solution procedures, numerical and graphical
examples of two-dimensional problems are given.
