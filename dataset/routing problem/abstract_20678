In this paper we study the problem of existence of orbifold Kaehler-Einstein
metrics on del Pezzo surfaces of degree 1 with Du Val singular points. Moreover
we compute global log canonical thresholds of del Pezzo surfaces of degree 1
with Du Val singularities and of del Pezzo surfaces of Picard rank 1 with Du
Val singularities.
