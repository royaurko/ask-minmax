Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$ be fixed, $Q>1$ be a real parameter and
$\mathcal{P}_n(Q)$ denote the set of polynomials over $\mathbb{Z}$ of degree
$n$ and height at most $Q$. In this paper we investigate the following counting
problems regarding polynomials with small discriminant $D(P)$ and pairs of
polynomials with small resultant $R(P_1,P_2)$:
  (i) given $0\le v\le n-1$ and a sufficiently large $Q$, estimate the number
of polynomials $P\in\mathcal{P}_n(Q)$ such that $$0<|D(P)|\le Q^{2n-2-2v};$$
(ii) given $0\le w\le n$ and a sufficiently large $Q$, estimate the number of
pairs of polynomials $P_1,P_2\in\mathcal{P}_n(Q)$ such that $$0<|R(P_1,P_2)|\le
Q^{2n-2w}.$$ Our main results provide lower bounds within the context of the
above problems. We believe that these bounds are best possible as they
correspond to the solutions of naturally arising linear optimisation problems.
Using a counting result for the number of rational points near planar curves
due to R.C.Vaughan and S.Velani we also obtain the complementary optimal upper
bound regarding the discriminants of quadratic polynomials.
