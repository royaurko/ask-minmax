We show that the case of two oscillators in a common heat bath cannot be
reduced to an effective one body problem. In addition, there is an interaction
between the oscillators, even at zero temperature, due to the fluctuations
caused in both oscillators by the zero-point oscillations of the
electromagnetic field.
