Map matching of GPS trajectories from a sequence of noisy observations serves
the purpose of recovering the original routes in a road network. In this work
in progress, we attempt to share our experience of feature construction in a
spatial database by reporting our ongoing experiment of feature extrac-tion in
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for map matching. Our preliminary results are
obtained from real-world taxi GPS trajectories.
