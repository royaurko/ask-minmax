A hidden database refers to a dataset that an organization makes accessible
on the web by allowing users to issue queries through a search interface. In
other words, data acquisition from such a source is not by following static
hyper-links. Instead, data are obtained by querying the interface, and reading
the result page dynamically generated. This, with other facts such as the
interface may answer a query only partially, has prevented hidden databases
from being crawled effectively by existing search engines. This paper remedies
the problem by giving algorithms to extract all the tuples from a hidden
database. Our algorithms are provably efficient, namely, they accomplish the
task by performing only a small number of queries, even in the worst case. We
also establish theoretical results indicating that these algorithms are
asymptotically optimal -- i.e., it is impossible to improve their efficiency by
more than a constant factor. The derivation of our upper and lower bound
results reveals significant insight into the characteristics of the underlying
problem. Extensive experiments confirm the proposed techniques work very well
on all the real datasets examined.
