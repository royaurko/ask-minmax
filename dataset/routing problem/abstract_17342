A strongly polynomial algorithm is given for the generalized flow
maximization problem. It uses a new variant of the scaling technique, called
continuous scaling. The main measure of progress is that within a strongly
polynomial number of steps, an arc can be identified that must be tight in
every dual optimal solution, and thus can be contracted. As a consequence of
the result, we also obtain a strongly polynomial algorithm for the linear
feasibility problem with at most two nonzero entries per column in the
constraint matrix.
