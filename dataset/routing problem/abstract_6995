In order to find out the limiting speed of solving a specific problem using
computer, this essay provides a method based on information entropy. The
relationship between the minimum computational complexity and information
entropy change is illustrated. A few examples are served as evidence of such
connection. Meanwhile some basic rules of modeling problems are established.
Finally, the nature of solving problems with computer programs is disclosed to
support this theory and a redefinition of information entropy in this filed is
proposed. This will develop a new field of science.
