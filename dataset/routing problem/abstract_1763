We have successfully synthesized FeSe films by the electrochemical deposition
in the electrolyte containing FeCl_{2}\cdot4H_{2}O, SeO_{2} and Na_{2}SO_{4}.
The composition ratio of Fe and Se was controlled by the synthesis voltage and
pH value. The FeSe film with the composition ratio of Fe : Se = 1 : 1 is
fabricated at a voltage of -0.9 V and pH 2.1 in our electrochemical deposition.
This sample has a highly crystalline tetragonal FeSe structure and exhibits a
superconducting transition at 8.1 K, comparable to FeSe synthesized by other
methods.
