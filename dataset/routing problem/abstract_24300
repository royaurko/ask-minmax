The Self-Adjoint Extension in the Schrodinger equation for potentials behaved
as an attractive inverse square at the origin is critically reviewed. Original
results are also presented. It is shown that the additional solutions must be
retained for definite interval of parameters, which requires performing of
Self-Adjoint Extension necessarily. The "Pragmatic approach" is used and some
of its consequences are considered for wide class of transitive potentials. The
problems of restriction of Self-Adjoint Extension parameter are also discussed.
Various relevant applications are presented as well.
