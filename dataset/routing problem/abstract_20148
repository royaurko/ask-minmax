In this review paper, we first discuss some open problems related to
two-dimensional self-avoiding paths and critical percolation. We then review
some closely related results (joint work with Greg Lawler and Oded Schramm) on
critical exponents for two-dimensional simple random walks, Brownian motions
and other conformally invariant random objects.
