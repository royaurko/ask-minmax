The 15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne reaction is one of two routes for breakout from the
hot CNO cycles into the rp process in accreting neutron stars. Its
astrophysical rate depends critically on the decay properties of excited states
in 19Ne lying just above the 15O + alpha threshold. We have measured the
alpha-decay branching ratios for these states using the p(21Ne,t)19Ne reaction
at 43 MeV/u. Combining our measurements with previous determinations of the
radiative widths of these states, we conclude that no significant breakout from
the hot CNO cycle into the rp process in novae is possible via
15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne, assuming current models accurately represent their
temperature and density conditions.
