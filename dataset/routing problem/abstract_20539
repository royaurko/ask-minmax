In this brief note, we reconsider the problem of finding Euclidean wormhole
solutions to maximal supergravity in d dimensions. We find that such solutions
exists for all d less than or equal to 9. However, we argue that, in
toroidally-compactified string theories, these saddle points never contribute
to the path integral because of a tension with U-duality.
