Recently, group recommendations have attracted considerable attention. Rather
than recommending items to individual users, group recommenders recommend items
to groups of users. In this position paper, we introduce the problem of forming
an appropriate group of users to recommend an item when constraints apply to
the members of the group. We present a formal model of the problem and an
algorithm for its solution. Finally, we identify several directions for future
work.
