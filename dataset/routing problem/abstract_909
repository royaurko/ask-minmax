Information-centric networking proposals attract much attention in the
ongoing search for a future communication paradigm of the Internet. Replacing
the host-to-host connectivity by a data-oriented publish/subscribe service
eases content distribution and authentication by concept, while eliminating
threats from unwanted traffic at an end host as are common in today's Internet.
However, current approaches to content routing heavily rely on data-driven
protocol events and thereby introduce a strong coupling of the control to the
data plane in the underlying routing infrastructure. In this paper, threats to
the stability and security of the content distribution system are analyzed in
theory and practical experiments. We derive relations between state resources
and the performance of routers and demonstrate how this coupling can be misused
in practice. We discuss new attack vectors present in its current state of
development, as well as possibilities and limitations to mitigate them.
