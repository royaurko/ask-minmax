We study the initial-boundary value problem for an Euler-Bernoulli beam model
with discontinuous bending stiffness laying on a viscoelastic foundation and
subjected to an axial force and an external load both of Dirac-type. The
corresponding model equation is fourth order partial differential equation and
involves discontinuous and distributional coefficients as well as a
distributional right-hand side. Moreover the viscoelastic foundation is of
Zener type and described by a fractional differential equation with respect to
time. We show how functional analytic methods for abstract variational problems
can be applied in combination with regularization techniques to prove existence
and uniqueness of generalized solutions.
