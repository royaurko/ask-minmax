Polar lattices, which are constructed from polar codes, have recently been
proved to be able to achieve the capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) channel. In this work, we show that polar lattices can also solve the
dual problem, i.e., achieving the rate-distortion bound of a memoryless
Gaussian source, which means that polar lattices can also be good for the lossy
compression of continuous sources. The structure of the proposed polar lattices
enables us to integrate the post-entropy coding process into the lattice
quantizer, which simplifies the quantization process. Moreover, the nesting
structure of polar lattices further provides solutions for some multi-terminal
coding problems. The Wyner-Ziv coding problem for a Gaussian source can be
solved by an AWGN capacity achieving polar lattice nested in a rate-distortion
bound achieving one, and the Gelfand-Pinsker problem can be solved in a
reversed manner.
