We study the solution to the Polonyi problem in the framework of no-scale
type supergravity. In such a model, Polonyi field can weigh as $O(10{\rm TeV})$
and decay just before the big-bang nucleosynthesis. It is shown that in spite
of a large entropy production by the decay of the Polonyi field, one can
naturally explain the present value of the baryon-to-entropy ratio, $n_B/s \sim
(10^{-10}-10^{-11})$ if the Affleck-Dine mechanism for baryogenesis works. It
is pointed out, however, that there is another cosmological problem related to
the abundance of the lightest superparticles produced by the decay of the
Polonyi field.
