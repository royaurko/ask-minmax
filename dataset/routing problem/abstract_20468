The question has been solved whether Bell's inequalities cover all possible
kinds of hidden-variable theories. It has been shown that the given nequalities
can be hardly derived when the changing space position of photon-pair source
together with the microscopic space structure of measuring devices are taken
into account; and when corresponding impact parameters (i.e., exact impact
points) of photons in individual measuring devices (polarizers) influence
measured values, in addition to usually considered characteristics.
