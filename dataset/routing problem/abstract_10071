In this paper we propose a general method to derive an upper bound for the
concentration rate of the posterior distribution for linear inverse problems.
We propose a general theorem that allows us to derive concentration rates for
the inverse problems from concentration rates of the related direct problem. An
interesting aspect of this approach is that it allows us to derive
concentration rates for prior that are not related to the singular value
decomposition of the operator. We apply this result to several examples, both
in the white noise and the regression setting, using priors based on the
singular value decomposition of the operator, location-mixture priors and
splines prior, and recover the minimax adaptive concentration rate.
