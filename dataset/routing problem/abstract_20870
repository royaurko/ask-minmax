A description of many constituent (particle) systems with fuzzy initial
conditions is proposed with the help of the field language. In this language
correlation functions are defined and equations for them are derived in the
free Fock space. Additional conditions for their solutions are postulated. The
closure problem for polynomial, rational, local and nonlocal interactions is
considered with exploitation of left or right invertibility of used operators.
Some general remarks concerning symmetry and multi-scale descriptions are
given.
