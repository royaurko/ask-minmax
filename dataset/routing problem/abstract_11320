I discuss quarkonium suppression in equilibriated strongly interacting
matter. After a brief review of basic features of quarkonium production I
discuss the application of recent lattice data on the heavy quark potential to
the problem of quarkonium dissociation as well as the problem of direct lattice
determination of quarkonium properties in finite temperature lattice QCD.
