We review some motivation behind the introduction of chiral random matrix
models in QCD, with particular emphasis on the importance of the
Gell-Mann-Oakes (GOR) relation for these arguments. We show why the microscopic
limit is universal in power counting, and present arguments for why the
macroscopic limit is generic for a class of problems that defy power counting,
examples being the strong CP and U(1) problems. Some new results are discussed
in light of recent lattice simulations.
