Theory of diffusion-mediated reactions is already established for the target
problem in the dilute limit, where the immobile target is surrounded by many
quenchers. For lattice random walks in the crowded situation, each quencher is
surrounded by other quenchers differently. As a result, each quencher migrates
differently in the presence of site blocking effects. However, in the
conventional theory, such difference is ignored and quenchers are assumed to
move independently of each other. In this paper, theory of diffusion-mediated
reactions of target problem is developed by taking into account the site
blocking effects for quencher migration and the difference in the configuration
of quenchers around each quencher. Our result interpolates between those in
high and low limits of quencher concentrations and is a lower bound of the
survival probability. In the static limit, the exact result is reproduced for a
localized sink. In the presence of diffusion, the approximation is better when
intrinsic reaction rates are low.
