We consider a semilinear elliptic system which include the model system of
the $W-$strings in the cosmology as a special case. We prove existence of
multi-string solutions and obtain precise asymptotic decay estimates near
infinity for the solutions.
 As a special case of this result we solve an open problem posed in
