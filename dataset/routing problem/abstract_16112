This paper presents an overview of the radiative transfer problem of
calculating the spectral line intensity and polarization that emerges from a
(generally magnetized) astrophysical plasma composed of atoms and molecules
whose excitation state is significantly influenced by radiative transitions
produced by an anisotropic radiation field. The numerical solution of this
non-LTE problem of the 2nd kind is facilitating the physical understanding of
the second solar spectrum and the exploration of the complex magnetism of the
extended solar atmosphere, but much more could be learned if high-sensitivity
polarimeters were developed also for the present generation of night-time
telescopes. Interestingly, I find that the population ratio between the levels
of some resonance line transitions can be efficiently modulated by the
inclination of a weak magnetic field when the anisotropy of the incident
radiation is significant, something that could provide a new diagnostic tool in
astrophysics.
