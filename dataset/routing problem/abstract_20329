Solutions of a 1-D free-interface problem modeling solid combustion front
propagating in combustible mixture with periodically varying concentration of
reactant exhibit classical phenomenon of mode locking. Numerical simulation
shows a variety of locked periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic solutions.
