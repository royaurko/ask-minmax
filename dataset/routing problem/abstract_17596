The purpose of this paper is to close the remaining gaps in the understanding
of the role that the constrained generalized continuous algebraic Riccati
equation plays in singular linear-quadratic (LQ) optimal control. Indeed, in
spite of the vast literature on LQ problems, it is only in a recent paper that
a sufficient condition for the existence of a non-impulsive optimal control has
for the first time connected this equation with the singular LQ optimal control
problem. In this paper, we establish four equivalent conditions providing a
complete picture that connects the singular LQ problem with the generalized
continuous algebraic Riccati equation and with the geometric properties of the
underlying system.
