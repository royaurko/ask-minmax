In this paper the simplicial cone constrained convex quadratic programming
problem is studied. The optimality conditions of this problem consist in a
linear complementarity problem. This fact, under a suitable condition, leads to
an equivalence between the simplicial cone constrained convex quadratic
programming problem and the one of finding the unique solution of a nonsmooth
system of equations. It is shown that a semi-smooth Newton method applied to
this nonsmooth system of equations is always well defined and under a mild
assumption on the simplicial cone the method generates a sequence that
converges linearly to its solution. Besides, we also show that the generated
sequence is bounded for any starting point and a formula for any accumulation
point of this sequence is presented. The presented numerical results suggest
that this approach achieves accurate solutions to large problems in few
iterations.
