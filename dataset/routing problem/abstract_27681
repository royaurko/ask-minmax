Symplectic integration of autonomous Hamiltonian systems is a well-known
field of study in geometric numerical integration, but for non-autonomous
systems the situation is less clear, since symplectic structure requires an
even number of dimensions. We show that one possible extension of symplectic
methods in the autonomous setting to the non-autonomous setting is obtained by
using canonical transformations. Many existing methods fit into this framework.
We also perform experiments which indicate that for exponential integrators,
the canonical and symmetric properties are important for good long time
behaviour. In particular, the theoretical and numerical results support the
well documented fact from the literature that exponential integrators for
non-autonomous linear problems have superior accuracy compared to general ODE
schemes.
