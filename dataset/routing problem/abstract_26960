Computability logic (CoL) is a formal theory of interactive computation. It
understands computational problems as games played by two players: a machine
and its environment, uses logical formalism to describe valid principles of
computability and formulas to represent computational problems. Logic CL1 is a
deductive system for a fragment of CoL. The logical vocabulary contains all of
the operators of classical logic and choice operators, the atoms represent
elementary games i.e. predicates of classical logic. In this paper, we present
a program that takes a CL1-proof of an arbitrary formula $F$, and extract a
winning strategy for $F$ from that proof then play $F$ using that strategy. We
hope this paper would provide a starting point for further work in program
extraction of the CoL-based arithmetic and other CoL-based applied systems.
