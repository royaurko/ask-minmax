The problem of autonomous navigation is one of the basic problems for
robotics. Although, in general, it may be challenging when an autonomous
vehicle is placed into partially observable domain. In this paper we consider
simplistic environment model and introduce a navigation algorithm based on
Learning Classifier System.
