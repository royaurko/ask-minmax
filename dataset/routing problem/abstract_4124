This paper is devoted to the derivation of expansion a associated with a
discontinuous Sturm-Liouville problems defined on $[-\pi, 0)\cup(0,\pi]$. We
derive an eigenfunction expansion theorem for the Green's function of the
problem as well as a theorem of uniform convergence of a certain class of
functions.
