We propose a retrofitted gravity mediation model which alleviates the
gravitino overproduction from decays of an inflaton and a supersymmetry
breaking field. In the model, we introduce an approximate U(1) symmetry under
which the supersymmetry breaking field is charged, although it is broken by a
mass term of messenger fields to generate gaugino masses of order the weak
scale. In a low-scale inflation model, we find regions in which the gravitino
overproduction problem is avoided.
