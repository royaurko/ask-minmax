A new algorithm has been developed to compute low Mach Numbers supercritical
fluid flows. The algorithm is applied using a finite volume method based on the
SIMPLER algorithm. Its main advantages are to decrease significantly the CPU
time, and the possibility for supercritical fluid flow modelisation to use
other discretisation methods (such as spectral methods and/or finite
differences) and other algorithms such as PISO or projection. It makes it
possible to solve 3D problems within reasonable CPU time even when considering
complex equations of state. The algorithm is given after first a brief
description of the previously existing algorithm to solve for supercritical
fluids. The side and bottom heated near critical carbon dioxide filled cavity
problems are respectively solved and compared to the previously obtained
results.
