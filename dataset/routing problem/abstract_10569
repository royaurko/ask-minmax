We present a novel algorithm for deciding whether a given planar curve is an
image of a given spatial curve, obtained by a central or a parallel projection
with unknown parameters. A straightforward approach to this problem consists of
setting up a system of conditions on the projection parameters and then
checking whether or not this system has a solution. The main advantage of the
algorithm presented here, in comparison to algorithms based on the
straightforward approach, lies in a significant reduction of a number of real
parameters that need to be eliminated in order to establish existence or
non-existence of a projection that maps a given spatial curve to a given planar
curve. Our algorithm is based on projection criteria that reduce the projection
problem to a certain modification of the equivalence problem of planar curves
under affine and projective transformations. The latter problem is then solved
by differential signature construction based on Cartan's moving frame method. A
similar approach can be used to decide whether a given finite set of ordered
points on a plane is an image of a given finite set of ordered points in R^3.
The motivation comes from the problem of establishing a correspondence between
an object and an image, taken by a camera with unknown position and parameters.
