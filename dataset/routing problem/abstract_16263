In a previous paper [1], we investigated the Blind Source Separation (BSS)
problem, for the nonlinear mixing model that we introduced in that paper. We
proposed to solve this problem by using a maximum likelihood (ML) approach.
When applying the ML approach to BSS problems, one usually determines the
analytical expressions of the derivatives of the log-likelihood with respect to
the parameters of the considered mixing model. In the literature, these
calculations were mainly considered for linear mixtures up to now. They are
more complex for nonlinear mixtures, due to dependencies between the considered
quantities. Moreover, the notations commonly employed by the BSS community in
such calculations may become misleading when using them for nonlinear mixtures,
due to the above-mentioned dependencies. In this document, we therefore explain
this phenomenon, by showing the effect of indirect dependencies on the
application of the ML approach to the mixing model considered in [1]. This
yields the explicit expression of the complete derivative of the log-likelihood
associated to that mixing model.
