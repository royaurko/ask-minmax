An interacting dark energy model with interaction term $Q= \lambda_m
H\rho_m+\lambda_dH\rho_d$ is considered. By studying the model near the
transition time, in which the system crosses the w=-1 phantom-divide-line, the
conditions needed to overcome the coincidence problem is investigated. The
phantom model, as a candidate for dark energy, is considered and for two
specific examples, the quadratic and exponential phantom potentials, it is
shown that it is possible the system crosses the w=-1 line, meanwhile the
coincidence problem is alleviated, the two facts that have root in
observations.
