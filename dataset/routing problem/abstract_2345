Video streaming services are very popular today. Increasingly, users can now
access multimedia applications and video playback wirelessly on their mobile
devices. However, a significant challenge remains in ensuring smooth and
uninterrupted transmission of almost any size of video file over a 3G network,
and as quickly as possible in order to optimize bandwidth consumption. In this
paper, we propose to position our Billboard Manager to provide an optimal
transmission rate to enable smooth video playback to a mobile device user
connected to a 3G network. Our work focuses on serving user requests by mobile
operators from cached resource managed by Billboard Manager, and transmitting
the video files from this pool. The aim is to reduce the load placed on
bandwidth resources of a mobile operator by routing away as much user requests
away from the internet for having to search a video and, subsequently, if
located, have it transferred back to the user.
