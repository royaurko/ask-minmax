Ant algorithms are inspired in real ants and the main idea is to create
virtual ants that travel into the space of possible solution depositing virtual
pheromone proportional to how good a specific solution is. This creates a
autocatalytic (positive feedback) process that can be used to generate
automatic solutions to very difficult problems. In the present work we show
that these algorithms can be used coupled to tight-binding hamiltonians to
design conducting polymers with pre-specified properties. The methodology is
completely general and can be used for a large number of optimization problems
in materials science.
