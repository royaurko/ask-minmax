World-set algebra is a variable-free query language for uncertain databases.
It constitutes the core of the query language implemented in MayBMS, an
uncertain database system. This paper shows that world-set algebra captures
exactly second-order logic over finite structures, or equivalently, the
polynomial hierarchy. The proofs also imply that world-set algebra is closed
under composition, a previously open problem.
