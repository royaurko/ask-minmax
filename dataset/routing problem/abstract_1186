This paper revisits the nonlinear realization of spontaneously broken N=1
supersymmetry. It is shown that the constrained superfield formalism can be
reinterpreted in the language of standard realization of nonlinear
supersymmetry via a new and simpler route. Explicit formulas of actions are
presented for general renormalizable theories with or without gauge
interactions. The nonlinear Wess-Zumino gauge is discussed and relations are
pointed out for different definitions of gauge fields. In addition, a general
procedure is provided to deal with theories of arbitrary Kahler potentials.
