We consider the Cauchy problem posed in the whole space for the following
nonlocal heat equation: u_t = J * u - u, where J is a symmetric continuous
probability density. Depending on the tail of J, we give a rather complete
picture of the problem in optimal classes of data by: (i) estimating the
initial trace of (possibly unbounded) solutions; (ii) showing existence and
uniqueness results in a suitable class; (iii) giving explicit unbounded
polynomial solutions.
