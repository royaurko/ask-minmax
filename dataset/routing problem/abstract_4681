In this short article, we study different problems described as initial value
problems of discrete differential equations and develop a a transform method
called the sigma transform, a discrete version of the continuous Laplace
transform to generate solutions as rational functions of integers to these
initial value problems. Particularly we look how the method generates the
traditionally known numbers called Fibonacci sequence as a solution to an
initial value problem of a discrete differential equation.
