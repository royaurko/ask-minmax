We present a tutorial discussion of Monte Carlo methods for equilibrium and
nonequilibrium problems in interfacial electrochemistry. The discussion is
illustrated with results from simulations of three specific systems: bromine
adsorption on silver (100), underpotential deposition of copper on gold (111),
and electrodeposition of urea on platinum (100).
