We investigate the thermal production of gravitinos in the context of the
brane world cosmology. Since the expansion law is modified from the one in the
standard cosmology, the Boltzmann equation for the gravitino production is
altered. We find that the late-time gravitino abundance is proportional to the
``transition temperature'', at which the modified expansion law in the brane
world cosmology is connecting with the standard one, rather than the reheating
temperature after inflation as in the standard cosmology. This means that, even
though the reheating temperature is very high, we can avoid the overproduction
of gravitinos by taking the transition temperature low enough. Therefore, the
gravitino problem can be solved.
