Peakons are singular, soliton-like solutions to nonlinear wave equations
whose dynamics can be studied using ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The
Degasperis-Procesi equation (DP) is an important example of an integrable PDE
exhibiting wave breaking in the peakon sector thus affording an interpretation
of wave breaking as a mechanical collision of particles. In this paper we set
up a general formalism in which to study collisions of DP peakons and apply it,
as an illustration, to a detailed study of three colliding peakons. It is shown
that peakons can collide only in pairs, no triple collisions are allowed and at
the collision a shockpeakon is created. We also show that the initial
configuration of peakon-antipeakon pairs is nontrivially correlated with the
spectral properties of an accompanying non-selfadjoint boundary value problem.
In particular if peakons or antipeakons are bunched up on one side relative to
a remaining antipeakon or peakon then the spectrum is real and simple. Even
though the spectrum is in general complex the existence of a global solution in
either time direction dynamics is shown to imply the reality of the spectrum of
the boundary value problem.
