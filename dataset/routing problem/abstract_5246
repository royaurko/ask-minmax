In the network activation problem, each edge in a graph is associated with an
activation function, that decides whether the edge is activated from
node-weights assigned to its end-nodes. The feasible solutions of the problem
are the node-weights such that the activated edges form graphs of required
connectivity, and the objective is to find a feasible solution minimizing its
total weight. In this paper, we consider a prize-collecting version of the
network activation problem, and present first non- trivial approximation
algorithms. Our algorithms are based on a new LP relaxation of the problem.
They round optimal solutions for the relaxation by repeatedly computing
node-weights activating subgraphs called spiders, which are known to be useful
for approximating the network activation problem.
