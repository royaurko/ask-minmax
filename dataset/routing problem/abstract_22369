In this paper we obtain the Lebesgue and Hausdorff measure results for the
set of vectors satisfying infinitely many fully non-linear Diophantine
inequalities. The set is also associated with a class of linear inhomogeneous
partial differential equations whose solubility is related to a certain
Diophantine condition. The failure of the Diophantine condition guarantees the
existence of a smooth solution.
