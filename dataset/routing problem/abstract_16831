We consider the problem of phase retrieval, namely, recovery of a signal from
the magnitude of its Fourier transform, or of any other linear transform. Due
to the loss of the Fourier phase information, this problem is ill-posed.
Therefore, prior information on the signal is needed in order to enable its
recovery. In this work we consider the case in which the signal is known to be
sparse, i.e., it consists of a small number of nonzero elements in an
appropriate basis. We propose a fast local search method for recovering a
sparse signal from measurements of its Fourier transform (or other linear
transform) magnitude which we refer to as GESPAR: GrEedy Sparse PhAse
Retrieval. Our algorithm does not require matrix lifting, unlike previous
approaches, and therefore is potentially suitable for large scale problems such
as images. Simulation results indicate that GESPAR is fast and more accurate
than existing techniques in a variety of settings.
