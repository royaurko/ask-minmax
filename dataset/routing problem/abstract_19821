We use the linear $\sigma$ model to analyse the dynamics of a disoriented
chiral condensate. For idealized boundary conditions appropriate to high energy
collisions, the problem can be reduced to a one dimensional one. The evolution
of the chiral state is then that of a simple dynamical system and can be
studied analytically.
