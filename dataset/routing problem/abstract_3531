Problems of calculus of variations with variable endpoints cannot be solved
without transversality conditions. Here, we establish such type of conditions
for fractional variational problems with the Caputo derivative. We consider:
the Bolza-type fractional variational problem, the fractional variational
problem with a Lagrangian that may also depend on the unspecified end-point
$\varphi(b)$, where $x=\varphi(t)$ is a given curve, and the infinite horizon
fractional variational problem.
