Given L-qubit states with the fixed spectra of reduced one-qubit density
matrices, we find a formula for the minimal number of invariant polynomials
needed for solving local unitary (LU) equivalence problem, that is, problem of
deciding if two states can be connected by local unitary operations.
Interestingly, this number is not the same for every collection of the spectra.
Some spectra require less polynomials to solve LU equivalence problem than
others. The result is obtained using geometric methods, i.e. by calculating the
dimensions of reduced spaces, stemming from the symplectic reduction procedure.
