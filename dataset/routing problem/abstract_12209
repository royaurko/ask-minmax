Proving the chaoticity of some dynamical systems is equivalent to solving the
hardest problems in mathematics. Conversely, one argues that it is not
unconceivable that classical physical systems may "compute the hard or even the
incomputable" by measuring observables which correspond to computationally hard
or even incomputable problems.
