The paper concerns the discreteness of the eigenvalues and the solvability of
the interior transmission problem for anisotropic media. Conditions for the
ellipticity of the problem are written explicitly, and it is shown that they do
not guarantee the discreteness of the eigenvalues. Some simple sufficient
conditions for the discreteness and solvability are found. They are expressed
in terms of the values of the anisotropy matrix and the refraction index at the
boundary of the domain. The discreteness of the eigenvalues and the solvability
of the interior transmission problem are shown if a small perturbation is
applied to the refraction index.
