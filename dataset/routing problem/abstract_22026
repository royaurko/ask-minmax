The k-forcing number of a graph is a generalization of the zero forcing
number. In this note, we give a greedy algorithm to approximate the k-forcing
number of a graph. Using this dynamic approach, we give corollaries which
improve upon two theorems from a recent paper of Amos, Caro, Davila and Pepper
[2], while also answering an open problem posed by Meyer [9].
