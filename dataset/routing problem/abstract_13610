We show the existence of a real analytic isomorphism between a space of
impedance function $\rho$ of the Sturm-Liouville problem
  $- \rho^{-2}(\rho^2f')' + uf$ on $(0,1)$, where $u$ is a function of $\rho,
\rho', \rho''$, and that of potential $p$ of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation $-
y'' + py$ on $(0,1)$, keeping their boundary conditions and spectral data.
  This mapping is associated with the classical Liouville transformation $f \to
\rho f$, and yields a global isomorphism between solutions to inverse problems
for the Sturm-Liouville equations of the impedance form and those to the
Schr{\"o}dinger equations.
