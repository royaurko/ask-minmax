The string theory inspired Worldline Numerics approach to Casimir force
calculations has some favourable characteristics that might make it well suited
for geometric optimization problems as they arise e.g. in NEMS device
engineering. We explain this aspect in detail, developing some refinements of
the method along the way. Also, we comment on the problem of generalizing
Worldline Numerics from scalars to photons in the presence of conductors.
