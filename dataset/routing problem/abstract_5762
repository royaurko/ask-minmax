In the present paper, we deal with a fourth-order boundary value problem
problem with eigenparameter dependent boundary conditions and transmission
conditions at a interior point. A self-adjoint linear operator A is defined in
a suitable Hilbert space H such that the eigenvalues of such a problem coincide
with those of A. Following Mukhtarov and his students methods [2,4,6] we obtain
asymptotic formulae for its eigenvalues and fundamental solutions. Our
applications possess a number of interesting properties for studying in
boundary value problems which we state in this paper.
