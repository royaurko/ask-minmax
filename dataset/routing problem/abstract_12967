We propose an elemantary approach to Zudilin's q-question about Schmidt's
problem [Electron. J. Combin. 11 (2004), #R22], which has been solved in a
previous paper [Acta Arith. 127 (2007), 17--31]. The new approach is based on a
q-analogue of our recent result in [J. Number Theory 132 (2012), 1731--1740]
derived from q-Pfaff-Saalschutz identity.
