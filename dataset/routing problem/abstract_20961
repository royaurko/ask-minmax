I review the observational side of the present state of the debate about the
dark matter in galaxies, with emphasis on the core/cusp problem in low surface
brightness galaxies, and the question of maximum / sub-maximum disks in spiral
galaxies. Some remarks are made about the dwarf spheroidals around the Milky
Way, and about elliptical galaxies.
