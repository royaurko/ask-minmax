A new viewpoint for the gauge hierarchy problem is proposed: compactification
at a large scale, 1/R, leads to a low energy effective theory with
supersymmetry softly broken at a much lower scale, \alpha/R. The hierarchy is
induced by an extremely small angle \alpha which appears in the orbifold
compactification boundary conditions. The same orbifold boundary conditions
break Peccei-Quinn symmetry, leading to a new solution to the \mu problem.
Explicit 5d theories are constructed with gauge groups SU(3) \times SU(2)
\times U(1) and SU(5), with matter in the bulk or on the brane, which lead to
the (next-to) minimal supersymmetric standard model below the compactification
scale. In all cases the soft supersymmetry-breaking and \mu parameters
originate from bulk kinetic energy terms, and are highly constrained. The
supersymmetric flavor and CP problems are solved.
