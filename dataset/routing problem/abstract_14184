Bayes linear kinematics and Bayes linear Bayes graphical models provide an
extension of Bayes linear methods so that full conditional updates may be
combined with Bayes linear belief adjustment. In this paper we investigate the
application of this approach to a more complicated problem: namely survival
analysis with time-dependent covariate effects. We use a piecewise-constant
hazard function with a prior in which covariate effects are correlated over
time. The need for computationally intensive methods is avoided and the
relatively simple structure facilitates prior specification and posterior
interpretation. Our approach eliminates the problem of non-commutativity which
was observed in earlier work by Gamerman. We apply the technique to data on
survival times for leukemia patients.
