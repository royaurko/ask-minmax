We reconsider the theory of scattering for the Wave-Schr\"odinger system and
more precisely the local Cauchy problem with infinite initial time, which is
the main step in the construction of the wave operators. Using a method due to
Nakanishi, we eliminate a loss of regularity between the Schr\"odinger
asymptotic data and the Schr\"odinger solution in the treatment of that
problem, in the special case of vanishing asymptotic data for the wave field.
