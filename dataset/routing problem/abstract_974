Surface plasmon polariton (SPP) as a bounded mode on a metal/dielectric
interface intrinsically has a definite transverse magnetic (TM) polarization
that usually lacks further manipulations. However, the in-plane longitudinal
components of SPP field can produce versatile polarization states when two
orthogonal propagating SPP interfere with each other. Here, we demonstrated a
plasmonic polarization router by designing appropriate nanohole arrays that can
selectively scatter the interfered SPP fields to desired light beams. It is
well proved that our device is able to reconfigure a certain input polarization
to all kinds of states with respect to a scattered light. Accompanied with a
composite phase modulation by diffractions, multiple focusing beams with
different polarization states are simultaneously achieved, promising the
possibility in polarization multiplexing and related signal processing. Our
design offers a new route for achieving full control of the optical
polarizations as well as the optical spin-orbital interactions.
