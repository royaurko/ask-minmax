We prove an analog of Shilnikov Lemma for a normally hyperbolic symplectic
critical manifold $M\subset H^{-1}(0)$ of a Hamiltonian system. Using this
result, trajectories with small energy $H=\mu>0$ shadowing chains of homoclinic
orbits to $M$ are represented as extremals of a discrete variational problem,
and their existence is proved. This paper is motivated by applications to the
Poincar\'e second species solutions of the 3 body problem with 2 masses small
of order $\mu$. As $\mu\to 0$, double collisions of small bodies correspond to
a symplectic critical manifold of the regularized Hamiltonian system.
