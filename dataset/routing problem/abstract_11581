We consider a generic market model with a single stock and with random
volatility. We assume that there is a number of tradable options for that stock
with different strike prices. The paper states the problem of finding a pricing
rule that gives Black-Scholes price for at-money options and such that the
market is arbitrage free for any number of tradable options, even if there are
two Brownian motions only: one drives the stock price, the other drives the
volatility process. This problem is reduced to solving a parabolic equation.
