In this paper, we develop a new parameterized algorithm for the {\sc
Independent Feedback Vertex Set} (IFVS) problem. Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, the
goal of the problem is to determine whether there exists a vertex subset
$F\subseteq V$ such that $V-F$ induces a forest in $G$ and $F$ is an
independent set. We show that there exists a parameterized algorithm that can
determine whether a graph contains an IFVS of size $k$ or not in time
$O(4^kn^{2})$. To our best knowledge, this result improves the known upper
bound for this problem, which is $O^{*}(5^{k}n^{O(1)})$.
