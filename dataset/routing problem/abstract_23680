The set theory relations \in, \backslash, \Delta, \cap, and \cup have
corollaries in subspace relations. Geometric Algebra is introduced as the ideal
framework to explore these subspace operations. The relations \in, \backslash,
and \Delta are easily subsumed by Geometric Algebra for Euclidean metrics. A
short computation shows that the meet (\cap) and join (\cup) are resolved in a
projection operator representation with the aid of one additional product
beyond the standard Geometric Algebra products. The result is that the join can
be computed even when the subspaces have a common factor, and the meet can be
computed without knowing the join. All of the operations can be defined and
computed in any signature (including degenerate signatures) by transforming the
problem to an analogous problem in a different algebra through a transformation
induced by a linear invertible function (a LIFT to a different algebra). The
new results, as well as the techniques by which we reach them, add to the tools
available for subspace computations.
