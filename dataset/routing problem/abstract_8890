In this paper, we prove that the Morley element eigenvalues approximate the
exact ones from below on regular meshes, including adaptive local refined
meshes, for the fourth-order elliptic eigenvalue problems with the clamped
boundary condition in any dimension. And we implement the adaptive computation
to obtain lower bounds of the Morley element eigenvalues for the vibration
problem of clamped plate under tension.
