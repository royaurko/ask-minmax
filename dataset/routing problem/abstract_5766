In this paper, we study thetime-bounded reachability problem for rectangular
hybrid automata with non-negative rates (RHA+). This problem was recently shown
to be decidable [Brihaye et al, ICALP11] (even though the unbounded
reachability problem for even very simple classes of hybrid automata is
well-known to be undecidable). However, [Brihaye et al, ICALP11] does not
provide a precise characterisation of the complexity of the time-bounded
reachability problem. The contribution of the present paper is threefold.
First, we provide a new NExpTime algorithm to solve the timed-bounded
reachability problem on RHA+. This algorithm improves on the one of [Brihaye et
al, ICALP11] by at least one exponential. Second, we show that this new
algorithm is optimal, by establishing a matching lower bound: time-bounded
reachability for RHA+ is therefore NExpTime-complete. Third, we extend these
results in a practical direction, by showing that we can effectively compute
fixpoints that characterise the sets of states that are reachable (resp.
co-reachable) within T time units from a given starting state.
