The linearization problem of a second-order ordinary differential equation by
the generalized Sundman transformation was considered earlier by Duarte,
Moreira and Santos using the Laguerre form. The results obtained in the present
paper demonstrate that their solution of the linearization problem for a
second-order ordinary differential equation via the generalized Sundman
transformation is not complete. We also give examples which show that the
Laguerre form is not sufficient for the linearization problem via the
generalized Sundman transformation.
