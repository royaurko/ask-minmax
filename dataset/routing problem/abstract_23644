We consider a mechanical system with impact and n degrees of freedom, written
in generalized coordinates. The system is not necessarily Lagrangian. The
representative point of the system must remain inside a set of constraints K;
the boundary of K is three times differentiable.
  At impact, the tangential component of the impulsion is conserved, while its
normal coordinate is reflected and multiplied by a given coefficient of
restitution e between 0 and 1. The orthognality is taken with respect to the
natural metric in the space of impulsions.
  We define a numerical scheme which enables us to approximate the solutions of
the Cauchy problem: this is an ad hoc scheme which does not require a
systematic search for the times of impact. We prove the convergence of this
numerical scheme to a solution, which yields also an existence result.
  Without any a priori estimates, the convergence and the existence are local;
with some a priori estimates, the convergence and the existence are proved on
intervals depending exclusively on these estimates.
  This scheme has been implemented with a trivial and a non trivial mass
matrix.
