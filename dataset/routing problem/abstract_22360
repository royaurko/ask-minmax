Using an rotation of Yuan, we observe that the gradient graph of any
semiconvex function is a Liouville manifold, that is, does not admit bounded
harmonic functions. As a corollary, we find that any entire solution of the
fourth order Hamiltonian stationary equation with Lagrangian phase angle
uniformly larger than the critical angle must be a quadratic.
