We investigate {\em multidimensional covering mechanism-design} problems,
wherein there are $m$ items that need to be covered and $n$ agents who provide
covering objects, with each agent $i$ having a private cost for the covering
objects he provides. The goal is to select a set of covering objects of minimum
total cost that together cover all the items.
  We focus on two representative covering problems: uncapacitated facility
location (\ufl) and vertex cover (\vcp). For multidimensional \ufl, we give a
black-box method to transform any {\em Lagrangian-multiplier-preserving}
$\rho$-approximation algorithm for \ufl to a truthful-in-expectation,
$\rho$-approx. mechanism. This yields the first result for multidimensional
\ufl, namely a truthful-in-expectation 2-approximation mechanism.
  For multidimensional \vcp (\mvcp), we develop a {\em decomposition method}
that reduces the mechanism-design problem into the simpler task of constructing
{\em threshold mechanisms}, which are a restricted class of truthful
mechanisms, for simpler (in terms of graph structure or problem dimension)
instances of \mvcp. By suitably designing the decomposition and the threshold
mechanisms it uses as building blocks, we obtain truthful mechanisms with the
following approximation ratios ($n$ is the number of nodes): (1) $O(r^2\log n)$
for $r$-dimensional \vcp; and (2) $O(r\log n)$ for $r$-dimensional \vcp on any
proper minor-closed family of graphs (which improves to $O(\log n)$ if no two
neighbors of a node belong to the same player). These are the first truthful
mechanisms for \mvcp with non-trivial approximation guarantees.
