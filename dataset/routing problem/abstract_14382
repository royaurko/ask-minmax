We develop the new variational calculus introduced in 2011 by J. Cresson and
I. Greff, where the classical derivative is substituted by a new complex
operator called the scale derivative. In this paper we consider several
nondifferentiable variational problems with free terminal point: with and
without constraints, of first and higher-order type.
