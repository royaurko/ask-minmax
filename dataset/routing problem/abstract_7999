Following a conjecture of Feynman, we explore the possibility that only those
energy forms that are associated with (massive or massless) particles couple to
the gravitational field, but not others. We propose an experiment to deflect
electrons by a small charged sphere to determine if the standard general
relativity or this modified one corresponds to reality. The outcome of this
experiment may also solve the cosmological constant problem.
