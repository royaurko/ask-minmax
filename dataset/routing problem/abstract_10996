The problems of charge stripe formation, spin-charge separation, and
stability of the antiphase domain wall (ADW) associated with a stripe are
addressed using an analytical approach to the t-J_z model. We show that a
metallic stripe together with its ADW is the ground state of the problem in the
low doping regime. The stripe is described as a system of spinons and
magnetically confined holons strongly coupled to the two dimensional (2D) spin
environment with holon-spin-polaron elementary excitations filling a
one-dimensional band.
