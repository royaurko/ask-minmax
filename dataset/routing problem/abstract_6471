We prove some concavity properties connected to nonlinear Bernoulli type free
boundary problems. In particular, we prove a Brunn-Minkowski inequality and an
Urysohn's type inequality for the Bernoulli Constant and we study the behaviour
of the free boundary with respect to the given boundary data. Moreover we prove
a uniqueness result regarding the interior non-linear Bernoulli problem.
