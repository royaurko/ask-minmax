The Virtual Observatory (VO) provides access to both, data and theory.
Quality control is a general problem and the VO user needs partly some
experience to judge the reliability of the VO products. As far as spectral
analysis is concerned, many different areas are involved, from atomic data to
stellar model-atmosphere codes.
  Within the framework of the German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory (GAVO)
project, the service TheoSSA is developed. It allows the VO user an easy access
to synthetic spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We discuss quality control
problems and the reliability of SEDs provided by TheoSSA.
