Averaging linear functional on the space continuous functions of the group of
diffeomorphisms of interval is found. Amenability of several discrete subgroups
of the group of diffeomorphisms $\Diff^3([0,1])$ of interval is prove. In
particular, a solution of the problem of amenability of the Thompson's group
$F$ is given.
