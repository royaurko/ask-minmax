This paper proposes a new method for solving Bayesian decision problems. The
method consists of representing a Bayesian decision problem as a
valuation-based system and applying a fusion algorithm for solving it. The
fusion algorithm is a hybrid of local computational methods for computation of
marginals of joint probability distributions and the local computational
methods for discrete optimization problems.
