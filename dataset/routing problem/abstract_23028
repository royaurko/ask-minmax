This paper considers the minimization of transmit power in Gaussian parallel
interference channels, subject to a rate constraint for each user. To derive
decentralized solutions that do not require any cooperation among the users, we
formulate this power control problem as a (generalized) Nash equilibrium game.
We obtain sufficient conditions that guarantee the existence and nonemptiness
of the solution set to our problem. Then, to compute the solutions of the game,
we propose two distributed algorithms based on the single user waterfilling
solution: The \emph{sequential} and the \emph{simultaneous} iterative
waterfilling algorithms, wherein the users update their own strategies
sequentially and simultaneously, respectively. We derive a unified set of
sufficient conditions that guarantee the uniqueness of the solution and global
convergence of both algorithms. Our results are applicable to all practical
distributed multipoint-to-multipoint interference systems, either wired or
wireless, where a quality of service in terms of information rate must be
guaranteed for each link.
