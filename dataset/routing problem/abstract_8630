We introduce a hierarchy of fast-growing complexity classes and show its
suitability for completeness statements of many non elementary problems. This
hierarchy allows the classification of many decision problems with a
non-elementary complexity, which occur naturally in logic, combinatorics,
formal languages, verification, etc., with complexities ranging from simple
towers of exponentials to Ackermannian and beyond.
