This paper deals with the Nash problem, which consists in proving that the
number of families of arcs on a singular germ of a surface $S$ coincides with
the number of irreducible components of the exceptional divisor in the minimal
resolution of this singularity. We propose a program for an affirmative
solution of the Nash problem in the case of normal 2-dimensional hypersurface
singularities. We illustrate this program by giving an affirmative solution of
the Nash problem for the rational double point $\mathbf{E_6}$. We also prove
some results on the algebraic structure of the space of $k$-jets of an
arbitrary hypersurface singularity and apply them to the specific case of
$\mathbf{E_6}$.
