Energy efficiency in wireless networks has become an important field of
research due to ever increasing energy expenditure in battery supplied mobile
terminals. In this paper we present an energy efficient routing scheme for
multi-standard infrastructure wireless networks based on multi-hop cooperative
relaying. The aim of the proposed technique is to exploit short-range
cooperation to take benefit from mobile terminals having superior links thus
enable energy efficiency. Performance results show that higher data-rate
yielded by cooperation can compensate the expense of higher energy due to
multiple interfaces active on the same mobile terminal, making possible to
observe energy efficiency gain of the system. A maximum achievable energy
efficiency gain of up to 42 % was observed in our simulations when using the
cooperative short range routing technique.
