Flow past a line vortex in a simple perfect fluid or superfluid gives rise to
a transverse Magnus force that is given by the well known Joukowski lift
formula. The problem of generalising this to multiconstituent superfluid models
has been controversial since it was originally posed by the work of Iordanski
in the context of the Landau 2-constituent model for He-4 at finite
temperature. The present work deals not just with this particular case but with
the generic category of perfect multiconstituent models including the kind
proposed for a mixture of He-4 and He-3 by Andreev and Bashkin. It is shown
here (using a relativistic approach) that each constituent will provide a
contribution proportional to the product of the corresponding momentum
circulation integral with the associated asymptotic current density.
