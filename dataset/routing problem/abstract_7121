We give a short and elementary proof of an inverse Bernstein-type inequality
found by S. Khrushchev for the derivative of a polynomial having all its zeros
on the unit circle. The inequality is used to show that equally-spaced points
solve a min-max-min problem for the logarithmic potential of such polynomials.
Using techniques recently developed for polarization (Chebyshev-type) problems,
we show that this optimality also holds for a large class of potentials,
including the Riesz potentials $1/r^s$ with $s>0.$
