A scenario in which inflation, dark energy and dark matter can be unified
into a single scalar field, the inflaton field $\phi$, is studied. The inflaton
is identified with the sneutrino, the scalar partner of the heavy neutrino. We
determine the conditions needed for avoiding the gravitino problem and not
having negligible plasma effects and we obtain the allowed range for the
sneutrino coupling.
