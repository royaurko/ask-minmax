The problem of supercurrent in superconducting graphene is revisited and the
supercurrent is calculated within the mean-field model employing the
two-component wave functions on a honeycomb lattice with pairing between
different valleys in the Brillouin zone. We show that the supercurrent within
the linear approximation in the order-parameter-phase gradient is always finite
even if the doping level is exactly zero.
