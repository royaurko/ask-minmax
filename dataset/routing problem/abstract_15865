Several relaxation approximations to partial differential equations have been
recently proposed. Examples include conservation laws, Hamilton-Jacobi
equations, convection-diffusion problems, gas dynamics problems. The present
paper focuses onto diffusive relaxation schemes for the numerical approximation
of nonlinear parabolic equations. These schemes are based on suitable
semilinear hyperbolic system with relaxation terms. High order methods are
obtained by coupling ENO and WENO schemes for space discretization with IMEX
schemes for time integration. Error estimates and convergence analysis are
developed for semidiscrete schemes with numerical analysis for fully discrete
relaxed schemes. Various numerical results in one and two dimension illustrate
the high accuracy and good properties of the proposed numerical schemes. These
schemes can be easily implemented for parallel computer and applied to more
general system of nonlinear parabolic equations in two- and three-dimensional
cases.
