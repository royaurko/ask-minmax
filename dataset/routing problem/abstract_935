We present non-linear dynamical features of two-photon double-cavity optical
bistability exhibited by a three level ladder system in the mean field limit.
The system exhibits a hump like feature in the lower branch of the bistable
response, wherein a new region of instability develops. The system displays a
range of dynamical features varying from normal stable switching, periodic
self-pulsing to a period-doubling route to chaos. The inclusion of two
competing cooperative atom-field couplings leads to such rich nonlinear
dynamical behavior. We provide a domain map that clearly delineates the various
regions of stability that will aid the realization of any desired dynamics. We
also present bifurcation diagram and the associated supporting evidence that
clearly identifies the period-doubling route to chaos, which occurs at low
input light levels.
