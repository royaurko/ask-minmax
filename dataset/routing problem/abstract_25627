We present a formulation of naturalness made in the framework of Bayesian
statistics, which unravels the conceptual problems related to previous
approaches. Among other things, the relative interpretation of the measure of
naturalness turns out to be unambiguously established by Jeffreys' scale. Also,
the usual sensitivity formulation (so-called Barbieri-Giudice measure) appears
to be embedded in our formulation under an extended form. We derive the general
sensitivity formula applicable to an arbitrary number of observables. Several
consequences and developments are further discussed. As a final illustration,
we work out the map of combined fine-tuning associated to the gauge hierarchy
problem and neutralino dark matter in a classic supersymmetric model.
