We discuss the existence and uniqueness of discontinuous solutions to adjoint
problems associated with nonlinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. By
generalizing the Haar method for Glimm-type approximations to hyperbolic
systems, we establish that entropy solutions depend continuously upon their
initial data in the natural L1 norm.
