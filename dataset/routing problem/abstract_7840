We show the existence of some infinite families of periodic solutions of the
planar Newtonian n-body problem --with positive masses-- which are symmetric
with respect to suitable actions of finite groups (under a strong--force
assumption, or just numerically). The method is by minimizing a discretization
of the action functional under symmetry constraints.
