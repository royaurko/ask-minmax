We propose and evaluate antichain algorithms to solve the universality and
language inclusion problems for nondeterministic Buechi automata, and the
emptiness problem for alternating Buechi automata. To obtain those algorithms,
we establish the existence of simulation pre-orders that can be exploited to
efficiently evaluate fixed points on the automata defined during the
complementation step (that we keep implicit in our approach). We evaluate the
performance of the algorithm to check the universality of Buechi automata using
the random automaton model recently proposed by Tabakov and Vardi. We show that
on the difficult instances of this probabilistic model, our algorithm
outperforms the standard ones by several orders of magnitude.
