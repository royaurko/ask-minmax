In this article we consider the problem of giving a robust,
model-independent, lower bound on the price of a forward starting straddle with
payoff $|F_{T_1} - F_{T_0}|$ where $0<T_0<T_1$. Rather than assuming a model
for the underlying forward price $(F_t)_{t \geq 0}$, we assume that call prices
for maturities $T_0<T_1$ are given and hence that the marginal laws of the
underlying are known. The primal problem is to find the model which is
consistent with the observed call prices, and for which the price of the
forward starting straddle is minimised. The dual problem is to find the
cheapest semi-static subhedge.
  Under an assumption on the supports of the marginal laws, but no assumption
that the laws are atom-free or in any other way regular, we derive explicit
expressions for the coupling which minimises the price of the option, and the
form of the semi-static subhedge.
