In this paper we present an approach in which synchronization of chaos is
used to address identification problems. In particular, we are able to
identify: (i) the discontinuity points of systems described by piecewise
dynamical equations and (ii) the delays of systems described by delay
differential equations. Delays and discontinuities are widespread features of
the dynamics of both natural and manmade systems. The foremost goal of the
paper is to present a general and flexible methodology that can be used in a
broad variety of identification problems.
