We devise a method that reduces the problem of classifying systems of forms
and linear mappings to the problem of classifying systems of linear mappings.
Canonical matrices of
  (i) bilinear or sesquilinear forms,
  (ii) pairs of symmetric, skew-symmetric, or Hermitian forms,
  (iii) isometric or selfadjoint operators on a space with nonsingular
symmetric, or skew-symmetric, or Hermitian form are obtained over any field of
characteristic not 2 up to classification of Hermitian forms over its finite
extensions.
