This essay aims to propose construction theory, a new domain of theoretical
research on machine construction, and use it to shed light on a fundamental
relationship between living and computational systems. Specifically, we argue
that self-replication of von Neumann's universal constructors holds a close
similarity to circular computational processes of universal computers that
appear in Turing's original proof of the undecidability of the halting problem.
The result indicates the possibility of reinterpreting a self-replicating
biological organism as embodying an attempt to solve the halting problem for a
{\em diagonal} input in the context of construction. This attempt will never be
completed because of the indefinite cascade of self-computation/construction,
which accounts for the undecidability of the halting problem and also agrees
well with the fact that life has maintained its reproductive activity for an
indefinitely long period of time.
