In this paper we study the controllability of an artificial
advection-diffusion system through the boundary. Suitable Carleman estimates
give us the observability on the adjoint system in the one dimensional case. We
also study some basic properties of our problem such as backward uniqueness and
we get an intuitive result on the control cost for vanishing viscosity.
