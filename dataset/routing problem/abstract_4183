This paper is devoted to Riemann-Hilbert problems with singularities. As an
application, we study the existence and properties of analytic discs which
arise as solutions of such nonlinear problems. We then use such families of
analytic discs in order to study jet determination for CR diffeomorphisms
between pseudoconvex hypersurfaces of finite type.
