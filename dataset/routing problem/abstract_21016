We provide a new approach to stable ergodicity of systems with dominated
splittings, based on a geometrical analysis of global stable and unstable
manifolds of hyperbolic points. Our method suggests that the lack of uniform
size of Pesin's local stable and unstable manifolds - a notorious problem in
the theory of non-uniform hyperbolicity - is often less severe than it appeas
to be.
