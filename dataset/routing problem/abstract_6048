We introduce a circular restricted charged three-body problem on the plane.
In this model, the gravitational and Coulomb forces, due to the primary bodies,
act on a test particle; the net force exerted by some primary body on the test
particle can be attractive, repulsive or null. The restricted problem is
obtained by the general planar charged three-body problem considering one mass
of the three bodies going to zero. We obtain necessary restrictions for the
parameters that appear in the problem, in order to be well defined. Taking into
account such restriction, we study the existence and linear stability of the
triangular equilibrium solutions, as well as its location in the configuration
space. We also obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of
the collinear equilibrium solutions.
