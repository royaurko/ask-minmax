Roughness-insensitive and electrically controllable magnetization at the
(0001) surface of antiferromagnetic chromia is observed using magnetometry and
spin-resolved photoemission measurements and explained by the interplay of
surface termination and magnetic ordering. Further, this surface in placed in
proximity with a ferromagnetic Co/Pd multilayer film. Exchange coupling across
the interface between chromia and Co/Pd induces an electrically controllable
exchange bias in the Co/Pd film, which enables a reversible isothermal (at room
temperature) shift of the global magnetic hysteresis loop of the Co/Pd film
along the magnetic field axis between negative and positive values. These
results reveal the potential of magnetoelectric chromia for spintronic
applications requiring non-volatile electric control of magnetization.
