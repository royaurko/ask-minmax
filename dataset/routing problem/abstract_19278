It is well known that the conjugate gradient method and a quasi-Newton
method, using any well-defined update matrix from the one-parameter Broyden
family of updates, produce identical iterates on a quadratic problem with
positive-definite Hessian. This equivalence does not hold for any quasi-Newton
method. We define precisely the conditions on the update matrix in the
quasi-Newton method that give rise to this behavior. We show that the crucial
facts are, that the range of each update matrix lies in the last two dimensions
of the Krylov subspaces defined by the conjugate gradient method and that the
quasi-Newton condition is satisfied. In the framework based on a sufficient
condition to obtain mutually conjugate search directions, we show that the
one-parameter Broyden family is complete.
  A one-to-one correspondence between the Broyden parameter and the non-zero
scaling of the search direction obtained from the corresponding quasi-Newton
method compared to the one obtained in the conjugate gradient method is
derived. In addition, we show that the update matrices from the one-parameter
Broyden family are almost always well-defined on a quadratic problem with
positive-definite Hessian. The only exception is when the symmetric rank-one
update is used and the unit steplength is taken in the same iteration. In this
case it is the Broyden parameter that becomes undefined.
