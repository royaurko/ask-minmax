We show that singular sets of free boundaries arising in codimension one
anisotropic geometric variational problems are $\mathcal H ^{n-3}$-negligible,
where $n$ is the ambient space dimension. In particular our results apply to
capillarity type problems, and establish everywhere regularity in the
three-dimensional case.
