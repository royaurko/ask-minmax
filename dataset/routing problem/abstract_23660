The Donald--Flanigan problem for a finite group H and coefficient ring k asks
for a deformation of the group algebra kH to a separable algebra. It is solved
here for dihedral groups and for the classical Weyl groups (whose rational
group algebras are also computed), leaving but six finite reflection groups
with solutions unknown. We determine the structure of a wreath product of a
group with a sum of central separable algebras and show that if there is a
solution for H over k which is a sum of central separable algebras then there
is also a solution for the wreath product of H with any symmetric group,
abelian group, or dihedral group. The theorems suggested by the Donald-Flanigan
conjecture and subsequently proven follow, we also show, from a geometric
conjecture which although weaker for groups applies to a broader class of
algebras than group algebras.
