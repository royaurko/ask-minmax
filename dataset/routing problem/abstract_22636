Long duration Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) have eight luminosity relations where
observable burst properties can yield the burst luminosity and hence distance.
This turns GRBs into useful tools of cosmology. Recently, two tests have been
proposed (by Nakar & Piran and by Li) for which one of the eight relations is
claimed to have significant problems. In this paper, we generalize these tests
and apply them to all eight GRB luminosity relations. (a) All eight relations
pass the Nakar & Piran test after accounting for the uncertainties on the data
and the dispersions of the correlations. (b) All eight relations are good when
the GRB redshifts are known, for example for calibration of the relations and
for GRB Hubble diagram purposes. (c) We confirm the earlier results that the
E_gamma,iso - E_peak Amati relation must produce very large error bars whenever
an unknown redshift being sought is >1.4. (d) The E_gamma - E_peak relation of
Ghirlanda et al. must produce very large error bars whenever an unknown
redshift being sought is >3.4. (e) The other six relations have no problem at
all from the ambiguity test of Li.
