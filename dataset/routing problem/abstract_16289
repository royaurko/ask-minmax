We consider a problem of significant practical importance, namely, the
reconstruction of a low-rank data matrix from a small subset of its entries.
This problem appears in many areas such as collaborative filtering, computer
vision and wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we focus on the matrix
completion problem in the case when the observed samples are corrupted by
noise. We compare the performance of three state-of-the-art matrix completion
algorithms (OptSpace, ADMiRA and FPCA) on a single simulation platform and
present numerical results. We show that in practice these efficient algorithms
can be used to reconstruct real data matrices, as well as randomly generated
matrices, accurately.
