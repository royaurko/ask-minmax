We study a generalization of the classical Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund
inequalities. We relate this problem to the sampling sequences in the
Paley-Wiener space and by using this analogy we give sharp necessary and
sufficient computable conditions for a family of points to satisfy the
Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund inequalities.
