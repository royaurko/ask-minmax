The effects of substituting nonmagnetic Mg2+ and Zn2+ ions for the Mn2+ (S =
5/2) ions on the structural, magnetic and dielectric properties of the
multiferroic frustrated antiferromagnet MnWO4 were investigated.
Polycrystalline samples of Mn1-xMgxWO4 and Mn1-xZnxWO4 (0<x<0.3) solid
solutions were prepared by a solid-state route and characterized via X-ray and
neutron diffraction, magnetization, and dielectric permittivity measurements.
Mg and Zn substitutions give rise to very similar effects. The Neel temperature
TN, the AF3-to-AF2 magnetic phase transition temperature T2, and the critical
ferroelectric temperature Tc = T2 of MnWO4 are reduced upon the nonmagnetic
doping. At the lowest temperature (T = 1.5 K), the incommensurate magnetic
structure for x(Mg) = 0.15 and x(Zn) = 0.15 corresponds to either a sinusoidal
spin arrangement or an elliptical spin-spiral phase similar to the polar AF2
structure observed in MnWO4. These findings were discussed by considering the
effects of the Mg and Zn substitutions on the crystal lattice and on the spin
exchange network of MnWO4.
