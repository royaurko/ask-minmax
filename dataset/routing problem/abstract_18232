In this paper, we study the stability of the non symmetric version of the
Nitsche's method without penalty for domain decomposition. The Poisson problem
is considered as a model problem. The computational domain is divided into two
subdomain that can have different material parameters. In the first half of the
paper we are interested in nonconforming domain decomposition, each subdomain
is meshed independently of each other. In the second half, we study unfitted
domain decomposition, the computational domain has only one mesh and we allow
the interface to cut elements of the mesh. The fictitious domain method is used
to handle this specificity. We prove $H^1$-convergence and $L^2$-convergence of
the error in both cases. Some numerical results are provided to corroborate the
theoretical study.
