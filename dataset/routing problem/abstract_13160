Let $G$ be a group of permutations acting on an $n$-vertex set $V$, and $X$
and $Y$ be two simple graphs on $V$. We say that $X$ and $Y$ are $G$-isomorphic
if $Y$ belongs to the orbit of $X$ under the action of $G$. One can naturally
generalize the reconstruction problems so that when $G$ is $S_n$, the symmetric
group, we have the usual reconstruction problems. In this paper, we study
$G$-edge reconstructibility of graphs. We prove some old and new results on
edge reconstruction and reconstruction from end vertex deleted subgraphs.
