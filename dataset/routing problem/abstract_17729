Container terminals are facing a set of interrelated problems. Container
handling problems at container terminals are NP-hard problems. The docking time
of container ships at the port must be optimized. In this paper we have built a
simulation model that integrates all the activities of a container terminal.
The proposed approach is applied on a real case study data of container
terminal at El-Dekheilla port. The results show that the proposed approach
reduced the ship turnaround time in port where 51% reduction in ship service
time (loading/unloading) in port is achieved.
