We discuss the method recently proposed by S. Chubanov for the linear
feasibility problem. We present new, concise proofs and interpretations of some
of his results. We then show how our proofs can be used to find strongly
polynomial time algorithms for special classes of linear feasibility problems.
Under certain conditions, these results provide new proofs of classical results
obtained by Tardos, and Vavasis and Ye.
