The comprehensive investigation of the temporal evolution of the diocotron
instability of the plane electron strip on the linear stage of its development
is performed. By using the Kelvin's method of the shearing modes we elucidate
the role of the initial perturbations of the electron density, which is
connected with problem of the continuous spectrum. The linear non-modal
evolution process, detected by the solution of the initial value problem, leads
towards convergence to the phase-locking configuration of the mutually growing
normal modes.
