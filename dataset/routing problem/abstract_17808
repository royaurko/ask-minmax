Motivated by problems in contact mechanics, we propose a duality approach for
computing approximations and associated a posteriori error bounds to solutions
of variational inequalities of the first kind. The proposed approach improves
upon existing methods introduced in the context of the reduced basis method in
two ways. First, it provides sharp a posteriori error bounds which mimic the
rate of convergence of the RB approximation. Second, it enables a full
offline-online computational decomposition in which the online cost is
completely independent of the dimension of the original (high-dimensional)
problem. Numerical results comparing the performance of the proposed and
existing approaches illustrate the superiority of the duality approach in cases
where the dimension of the full problem is high.
