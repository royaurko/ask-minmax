We derive the consequences of the Myhrer-Thomas explanation of the proton
spin problem for the distribution of orbital angular momentum on the valence
and sea quarks. After QCD evolution these results are found to be in very good
agreement with both recent lattice QCD calculations and the experimental
constraints from Hermes and JLab.
