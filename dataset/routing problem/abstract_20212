In this work we describe the local cohomology of reflexive modules of rank
one over normal semigroup rings with respect to monomial ideals. Using our
description we show that the problem of classifying maximal Cohen-Macaulay
modules of rank one can be rephrased in terms of finding integral solutions to
certain sets of linear inequalities.
