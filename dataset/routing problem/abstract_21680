We introduced in [arXiv:1106.3204] a method to locate discontinuities of a
wave speed in dimension two from acoustic boundary measuments modelled by the
hyperbolic Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator. Here we extend the method for sound
hard obstacles in arbitrary dimension. We present numerical experiments with
simulated noisy data suggesting that the method is robust against measurement
noise.
