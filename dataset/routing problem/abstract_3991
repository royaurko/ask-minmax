This short note aims at proving that the isolation problem is undecidable for
probabilistic automata with only one probabilistic transition. This problem is
known to be undecidable for general probabilistic automata, without restriction
on the number of probabilistic transitions. In this note, we develop a
simulation technique that allows to simulate any probabilistic automaton with
one having only one probabilistic transition.
