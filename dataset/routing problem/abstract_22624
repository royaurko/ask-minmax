We discuss Monte-Carlo techniques for addressing the 3-dimensional
time-dependent radiative transfer problem in rapidly expanding supernova
atmospheres. The transfer code SEDONA has been developed to calculate the
lightcurves, spectra, and polarization of aspherical supernova models. From the
onset of free-expansion in the supernova ejecta, SEDONA solves the radiative
transfer problem self-consistently, including a detailed treatment of gamma-ray
transfer from radioactive decay and with a radiative equilibrium solution of
the temperature structure. Line fluorescence processes can also be treated
directly. No free parameters need be adjusted in the radiative transfer
calculation, providing a direct link between multi-dimensional hydrodynamical
explosion models and observations. We describe the computational techniques
applied in SEDONA, and verify the code by comparison to existing calculations.
We find that convergence of the Monte Carlo method is rapid and stable even for
complicated multi-dimensional configurations. We also investigate the accuracy
of a few commonly applied approximations in supernova transfer, namely the
stationarity approximation and the two-level atom expansion opacity formalism.
