In this paper we consider the problem of how to computationally test whether
a matrix inequality is positive semidefinite on a semialgebraic set. We propose
a family of sufficient conditions using the theory of matrix Positivstellensatz
refutations. When the semialgebraic set is a hypercube, we give bounds on the
degree of the required certificate polynomials.
