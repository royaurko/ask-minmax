Exactly solvable variable parametric Burgers type equations in one-dimension
are introduced, and two different approaches for solving the corresponding
initial value problems are given. The first one is using the relationship
between the variable parametric models and their standard counterparts. The
second approach is a direct linearization of the variable parametric Burgers
model to a variable parametric parabolic model via a generalized Cole-Hopf
transform. Eventually, the problem of finding analytic and exact solutions of
the variable parametric models reduces to that of solving a corresponding
second order linear ODE with time dependent coefficients. This makes our
results applicable to a wide class of exactly solvable Burgers type equations
related with the classical Sturm-Liouville problems for the orthogonal
polynomials.
