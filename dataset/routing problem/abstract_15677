The supersymmetric flavor problem may be solved if the first and second
generation scalars are heavy (with multi-TeV masses) and scalars with large
Higgs couplings are light (with sub-TeV masses). We show that such an inverted
spectrum may be generated radiatively; that is, from initial conditions where
all scalar masses are multi-TeV at some high scale, those with large Higgs
couplings may be driven asymptotically to the weak scale in the infra-red. The
lightness of third generation scalars is therefore a direct consequence of the
heaviness of third generation fermions, and fine-tuning is avoided even though
the fundamental scale of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters is
multi-TeV. We investigate this possibility in the framework of the usual Yukawa
quasi-fixed point solutions. The required high scale boundary conditions are
found to be simple and highly predictive. This scenario also alleviates the
supersymmetric CP and Polonyi problems.
