Applied into a various area of domains, the graph theory and its applications
allow the determination of the shortest route. The common algorithm to solve
this problem is Bellman-Kalaba, based on the matrix multiplying operation. If
the graph is very large (e.g., the dimension of the associated incidence matrix
is big) one of the main problems is to reduce the calculus time. This paper
presents a testing method able to analyze if an acceleration of the
Bellman-Kalaba is possible and able to determine the time efficiency.
