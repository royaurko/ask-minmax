We comment on the recent results of Refs. [1, 2] on the bipolaron problem
derived using an approximation of Gross - Tulub. It is proved that, contrary to
the claim made in Refs. [1, 2], the bipolaron ground state energy calculated
there in the strong-coupling approximation has not been shown to constitute a
variational upper bound.
