BGP is the de facto protocol used for inter-autonomous system routing in the
Internet. Generally speaking, BGP has been proven to be secure, efficient,
scalable, and robust. However, with the rapid evolving of the Internet in the
past few decades, there are increasing concerns about BGS's ability to meet the
needs of the Internet routing. There are two major limitations of BGP which are
its failure to address several key security issues, and some operational
related problems. The design and ubiquity of BGP have complicated past efforts
at securing inter-domain routing. This paper surveys the past work related to
BGP security and operational issues. We explore the limitations and advantages
of proposed solutions in these two limitations.
