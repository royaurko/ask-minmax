Mathematical models related to some Josephson junctions are pointed out and
attention is drawn to the solutions of certain initial boundary problems and to
some of their estimates. In addition, results of rigorous analysis of the
behaviour of these solutions when the time tends to infinity and when the small
parameter tends to zero are cited. These analyses lead us to mention some of
the open problems.
