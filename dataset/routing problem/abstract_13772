In this paper we study existence and spectral properties for weak solutions
of Neumann and Dirichlet problems associated to second order linear degenerate
elliptic partial differential operators $X$, with rough coefficients of the
form $$X=-\text{div}(P\nabla )+{\bf HR}+{\bf S^\prime G} +F$$ in a geometric
homogeneous space setting where the $n\times n$ matrix function $P=P(x)$ is
allowed to degenerate. We give a maximum principle for weak solutions of
$Xu\leq 0$ and follow this with a result describing a relationship between
compact projection of the degenerate Sobolev space $QH^{1,p}$ into $L^q$ and a
Poincar\'e inequality with gain adapted to $Q$.
