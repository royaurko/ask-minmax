At the 20-th Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics there was a plenary
talk devoted to the recent developments in classical Relativity. In that talk
the problems of gravitational collapse, collisions of black holes, and of black
holes as celestial bodies were discussed. But probably the problems of the
internal structure of black holes are a real great challenge. In my talk I want
to outline the recent achievements in our understanding of the nature of the
singularity (and beyond!) inside a realistic rotating black hole. This
presentation also addresses the following questions: Can we see what happens
inside a black hole? Can a falling observer cross the singularity without being
crushed? An answer to these questions is probably "yes".
