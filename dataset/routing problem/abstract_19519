We have examined the cosmological solutions with variable G and $\lambda$ and
bulk viscosity. It is found that these solutions are free from the cosmological
problems of the Standard Model. The proposed cosmology consists of two
arbitrary parameters which are well constrained. The inflationary solution does
not require $\Omega=1$ and arises with or without the cosmological constant.
