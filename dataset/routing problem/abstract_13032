In this paper we study the number of the boundary single peak solutions of
the problem {align*} {cases}
  -\varepsilon^2 \Delta u + u = u^p, &\text{in}\Omega u > 0, &\text{in}\Omega
\frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu} = 0,& \text{on}\partial \Omega {cases} {align*}
for $\varepsilon$ small and $p$ subcritical. Under some suitable assumptions on
the shape of the boundary near a critical point of the mean curvature, we are
able to prove exact multiplicity results. Note that the degeneracy of the
critical point is allowed.
