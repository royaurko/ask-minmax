Advances in experimental techniques and in theoretical models have improved
our understanding of protein crystallization. But they have also left open
questions regarding the protein phase behavior and self-assembly kinetics, such
as why (nearly) identical crystallization conditions sometimes result in the
formation of different crystal forms. Here, we develop a patchy particle model
with competing sets of patches that provides a microscopic explanation of this
phenomenon. We identify different regimes in which one or two crystal forms can
coexist with a low-density fluid. Using analytical approximations, we extend
our findings to different crystal phases, providing a general framework for
treating protein crystallization when multiple crystal forms compete. Our
results also suggest different experimental routes for targeting a specific
crystal form, and for reducing the dynamical competition between the two forms,
thus facilitating protein crystal assembly.
