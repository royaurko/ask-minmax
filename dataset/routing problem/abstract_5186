Applied problems of oil and gas recovery are studied numerically using the
mathematical models of multiphase fluid flows in porous media. The basic model
includes the continuity equations and the Darcy laws for each phase, as well as
the algebraic expression for the sum of saturations. Primary computational
algorithms are implemented for such problems using the pressure equation. In
this paper, we highlight the basic properties of the pressure problem and
discuss the necessity of their fulfillment at the discrete level. The resulting
elliptic problem for the pressure equation is characterized by a
non-selfadjoint operator. Possibilities of approximate solving the elliptic
problem are considered using the iterative methods. Special attention is given
to the numerical algorithms for calculating the pressure on parallel computers.
