We study an extension of the MSSM which includes both new SU(2) triplets with
hypercharge $\pm 1$ and a SM gauge singlet (a la NMSSM) which are coupled to
each other. We are motivated by the little hierarchy problem, as well as by the
$\mu$ problem of the MSSM. We show that the NMSSM and the triplet-extended MSSM
can successfully solve problems of one another: while triplets are responsible
for large correction to the lightest physical Higgs mass, the singlet's VEV
explains why the $\mu$ terms (for the Higgs doublets and the new triplets) are
naturally of order the electroweak (EW) scale. We also show that
singlet-triplet coupling significantly changes the RG evolution of the singlet
mass squared, helping to render this mass squared negative, as required for the
singlet to acquire a VEV. We analyze constrains on this scenario from EW
precision measurements and find that a relatively large region of the parameter
space of this model is viable, especially with the triplet fermions (including
doubly-charged) being light.
