We deal with initial-boundary value problems for systems of conservation laws
in one space dimension and we focus on the boundary Riemann problem. It is
known that, in general, different viscous approximations provide different
limits. In this paper, we establish sufficient conditions to conclude that two
different approximations lead to the same limit. As an application of this
result, we show that, under reasonable assumptions, the self-similar
second-order approximation and the classical viscous approximation provide the
same limit. Our analysis applies to both the characteristic and the non
characteristic case. We require neither genuine nonlinearity nor linear
degeneracy of the characteristic fields.
