We consider the inverse problem of the reconstruction of a Schr\"odinger
operator on a unknown Riemannian manifold or a domain of Euclidean space. The
data used is a part of the boundary $\Gamma$ and the eigenvalues corresponding
to a set of impedances in the Robin boundary condition which vary on $\Gamma$.
The proof is based on the analysis of the behaviour of the eigenfunctions on
the boundary as well as in perturbation theory of eigenvalues. This reduces the
problem to an inverse boundary spectral problem solved by the boundary control
method.
