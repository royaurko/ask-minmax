The aim of this study is to prove analytically that synchronization of a
piece-wise continuous class of systems of fractional order can be achieved.
Based on our knowledge, there are no numerical methods to integrate
differential equations with discontinuous right hand side of fractional order
which model these systems. Therefore, via Filippov's regularization [1] and
Cellina's Theorem [2,3], we prove that the initial value problem can be
converted into a continuous problem of fractional-order, to which numerical
methods for fractional orders apply. In this way, the synchronization problem
transforms into a standard problem for continuous systems of fractional order.
Three examples of fractional-order piece-wise systems are considered: Sprott
system, Chen and Shimizu-Morioka system.
