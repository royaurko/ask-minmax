The frequently discovered flooding structure on Mars and other planets has
long been an intriguing mystery remained un-disclosed so far. Considering that
on Earth, quite a few low melting point liquid metals or their alloy can be
candidates of fluid like matters, we proposed here that there might also exists
certain liquid metal instead of water or methane alone on Mars or the like
planets. Compared with water, such liquid metal would be much easier to stay at
the Mars surface because of its low melting point however extremely high
evaporation point. Along this theoretical route, quite a few observations on
the fluid like matters in former space explorations can be well interpreted.
Such hypothesis for the existence of liquid metal on Mars surface does not mean
refuting the possibility of water on Mars. This new point would be helpful for
planning further exploration of Mars in a sense according to the characters of
liquid metal. It at least identifies one more target fluid towards either
finding or denying life at outer space. Whether the planet could harbor life in
some form or it reaffirms Mars as an important future destination for human
exploration still needs serious but not just enthusiasm explorations.
