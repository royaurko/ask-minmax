Given a polygonal curve P, a pointset S, and an \epsilon > 0, we study the
problem of finding a polygonal curve Q whose vertices are from S and has a
Frechet distance less or equal to \epsilon to curve P. In this problem, Q must
visit every point in S and we are allowed to reuse points of pointset in
building Q. First, we show that this problem in NP-Complete. Then, we present a
polynomial time algorithm for a special cases of this problem, when P is a
convex polygon.
