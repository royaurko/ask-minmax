In spite of the phenomenological successes of the inflationary universe
scenario, the current realizations of inflation making use of scalar fields

theory may provide an avenue towards addressing these problems. One particular
approach to combining string theory and cosmology is String Gas Cosmology. The
basic principles of this approach are summarized.
