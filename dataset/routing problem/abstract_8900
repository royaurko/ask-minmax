The properties of the cosmic Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are briefly summarized.
A detailed bibliography is given with titles of the papers. Two fundamental
theoretical problems are pointed out: the problem of the energy source, and the
problem of compactness. I demonstrate some inconsistencies in the estimates of
the fireball optical thickness that are widely used in the discussion of the
latter problem. The possible connection of GRBs with the Dark Matter candidates
is mentioned. I argue that GRBs can be produced by collapses or mergers of
stars made of one probable Dark Matter candidate, namely the mirror particles.
I speculate on the impact that the parameters of the neutrino oscillations
might have on the observed properties of GRBs if the latter are the products of
mirror star deaths.
