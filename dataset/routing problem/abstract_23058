We study in this paper a new approach to the problem of relating solutions to
the Einstein field equations with Riemannian and Lorentzian signatures. The
procedure can be thought of as a "real Wick rotation". We give a modified
action for general relativity, depending on two real parameters, that can be
used to control the signature of the solutions to the field equations. We show
how this procedure works for the Schwarzschild metric and discuss some possible
applications of the formalism in the context of signature change, the problem
of time, black hole thermodynamics...
