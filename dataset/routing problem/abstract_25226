In a finite-connectivity spin-glass at the zero-temperature limit, long-range
correlations exist among the unfrozen vertices (whose spin values being
non-fixed). Such long-range frustrations are partially removed through the
first-step replica-symmetry-broken (1RSB) cavity theory, but residual
long-range frustrations may still persist in this mean-field solution. By way
of population dynamics, here we perform a perturbation-percolation analysis to
calculate the magnitude of long-range frustrations in the 1RSB solution of a
given spin-glass system. We study two well-studied model systems, the minimal
vertex-cover problem and the maximal 2-satisfiability problem. This work points
to a possible way of improving the zero-temperature 1RSB mean-field theory of
spin-glasses.
