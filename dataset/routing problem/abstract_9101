In the paper [B.M.Bolotovskii, S.N.Stoliarov, Uspekhi Fizicheskich Nauk,
v.162, No 3, p.195, 1992] the energy conservation law was applied to a problem
of radiation of a charged particle in an external electromagnetic field. The
contributors consecutively and mathematically strictly solved the problem but
received wrong result. They derived an expression which includes a change of
the energies of the electromagnetic fields accompanying the moving particle
corresponding to the initial and final velocity of the particle. The energy of
the field accompanying the particle is the energy of the particle of the
electromagnetic origin. It should not enter the solution of the problem. The
origin of the mistake made by the contributors is discussed in this comment.
