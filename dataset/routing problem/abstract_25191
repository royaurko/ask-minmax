A convergence theorem is proved for a class of Nystrom methods for weakly
singular integral equations on surfaces in three dimensions. Fredholm equations
of the second kind as arise in connection with linear elliptic boundary value
problems for scalar and vector fields are considered. In contrast to methods
based on product integration, coordinate transformations and singularity
subtraction, the family of Nystrom methods studied here is based on a local
polynomial correction determined by an auxiliary system of moment equations.
The polynomial correction is shown to remove the weak singularity in the
integral equation and provide control over the approximation error. Convergence
results for the family of methods are established under minimal regularity
assumptions consistent with classic potential theory. Rates of convergence are
shown to depend on the regularity of the problem, the degree of the polynomial
correction, and the order of the quadrature rule employed in the
discretization. As a corollary, a simple method based on singularity
subtraction which has been employed by many contributors is shown to be convergent.
