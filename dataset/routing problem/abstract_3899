We discuss a rational version of a conjecture of Matiyasevich, Davis, and
Putnam on the relative decidability of the finiteness problem for Diophantine
equations with respect to the existence problem. We formulate a suspicion that
for rational solutions, the finiteness problem should be relatively decidable
in contrast to the M-D-P conjecture for integer solutions.
