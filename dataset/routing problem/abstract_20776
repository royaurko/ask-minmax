This is a survey of results about permanental processes, real valued positive
processes which are a generalization of squares of Gaussian processes. In a
certain sense the symmetric positive definite function that determines a
Gaussian process is replaced by a function that is not necessarily symmetric
nor positive definite, but that nevertheless determines a stochastic process.
This is a new avenue of research with very many open problems.
