We consider the multidimensional inverse problem of determining the
conductivity coefficient of a hyperbolic equation in an infinite cylindrical
domain, from a single boundary observation of the solution. We prove H{\"o}lder
stability with the aid of a Carleman estimate specifically designed for
hyperbolic waveguides.
