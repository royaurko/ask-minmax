We discuss a possible solution to the strong CP problem which is based on
spontaneous CP violation and discrete symmetries. At the same time we predict
in a simple way the almost right-angled quark unitarity triangle angle ($\alpha
\simeq 90^\circ$) by making the entries of the quark mass matrices either real
or imaginary. To prove the viability of our strategy we present a toy flavour
model for the quark sector.
