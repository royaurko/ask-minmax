We present a symmetric LDPC code with constant rate and constant distance
(i.e. good LDPC code) that its constraint space is generated by the orbit of
one constant weight constraint under a group action. Our construction provides
the first symmetric LDPC good codes. This solves the main open problem raised
by Kaufman and Wigderson in [4].
