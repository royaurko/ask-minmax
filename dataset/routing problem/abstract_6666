We consider the 2D inviscid incompressible irrotational infinite depth water
wave problem neglecting surface tension. Given wave packet initial data, we
show that the modulation of the solution is a profile traveling at group
velocity and governed by a focusing cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation, with
rigorous error estimates in Sobolev spaces. As a consequence, we establish
existence of solutions of the water wave problem in Sobolev spaces for times in
the NLS regime provided the initial data is suitably close to a wave packet of
sufficiently small amplitude in Sobolev spaces.
