There has been a tremendous growth in multimedia applications over wireless
networks. Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks(WMSNs) have become the premier
choice in many research communities and industry. Many state-of-art
applications, such as surveillance, traffic monitoring, and remote heath care
are essentially video tracking and transmission in WMSNs. The transmission
speed is constrained by big size of video data and fixed bandwidth allocation
in constant routing path. In this paper, we present a CamShift based algorithm
to compress the tracking of videos. Then we propose a bandwidth balancing
strategy in which each sensor node is able to dynamically select the node for
next hop with the highest potential bandwidth capacity to resume communication.
Key to the strategy is that each node merely maintains two parameters that
contains its historical bandwidth varying trend and then predicts its near
future bandwidth capacity. Then forwarding node selects the next hop with the
highest potential bandwidth capacity. Simulations demonstrate that our approach
significantly increases the data received by sink node and decreases the delay
on video transmission in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network environment.
