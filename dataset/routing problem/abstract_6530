The vast majority of scientific community believes that P!=NP, with countless
supporting arguments. The number of people who believe otherwise probably
amounts to as few as those opposing the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics. But isn't
nature elegant enough, not to resource to brute-force search? In this article,
a novel concept of dimensionality is presented, which may lead to a more
efficient class of heuristic implementations to solve NP complete problems.
Thus, broadening the universe of man-machine tractable problems.
Dimensionality, as defined here, will be a closer analog of strain energy in
nature.
