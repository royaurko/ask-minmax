In this paper we report a simple one step and one-pot synthesis of stable
assembly of Au nanoparticles (diameter 8-10nm) into chains in an Ethylene
Glycol medium, using only a solid metallic Au target and a pulsed excimer laser
({\lambda}=248nm). The process reported does not use any precursor, reducing
agent or surfactant and thus can be described as chemistry free synthesis
route. The Au nanoparticle-ethylene glycol nanochains (with unbroken lengths
often more than few microns) formed in liquid medium are mechanically as well
as thermally stable and can be transferred unchanged into a solid substrate
which can span a large surface area. The nanochains show a broad optical
absorption covering almost the complete visible spectrum. A hybrid consisting
of Au nanochains and separated nanoparticles can be formed by the same method
using a proper choice of the laser fluence and Ethylene Glycol /DI water
concentration. The Au nanochain - Ethylene Glycol hybrid material formed by the
above method shows enhanced low frequency dielectric constant (one order more
than the Ethylene Glycol) and enhanced electrical conductivity even with low Au
fill fraction can show enhancement up to two orders. Based on 2D-NMR
experiments we suggest that the quasi-1D chain like structure forms due to the
formation of dimer and trimers of Ethylene Glycol molecules that attach to the
Au nanoparticles formed by the ablation process and facilitate the chain
formation.
