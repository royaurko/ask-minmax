This note is a response to one of problems posed by A.K. Kwasniewski in one
of his recent papers. Namely for the sequence of finite cobweb subposets, the
looked for explicit formulas for corresponding sequence of characteristic
polynomials are discovered and delivered here. The recurrence relation defining
arbitrary family of charactristic polynomials of finite cobweb posets is also
derived.
