In this paper, we consider the problem of recovering an unknown sparse matrix
X from the matrix sketch Y = AX B^T. The dimension of Y is less than that of X,
and A and B are known matrices. This problem can be solved using standard
compressive sensing (CS) theory after converting it to vector form using the
Kronecker operation. In this case, the measurement matrix assumes a Kronecker
product structure. However, as the matrix dimension increases the associated
computational complexity makes its use prohibitive. We extend two algorithms,
fast iterative shrinkage threshold algorithm (FISTA) and orthogonal matching
pursuit (OMP) to solve this problem in matrix form without employing the
Kronecker product. While both FISTA and OMP with matrix inputs are shown to be
equivalent in performance to their vector counterparts with the Kronecker
product, solving them in matrix form is shown to be computationally more
efficient. We show that the computational gain achieved by FISTA with matrix
inputs over its vector form is more significant compared to that achieved by
OMP.
