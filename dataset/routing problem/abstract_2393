This article provide new approach to solve P vs NP problem by using
cardinality of bases function. About NP-Complete problems, we can divide to
infinite disjunction of P-Complete problems. These P-Complete problems are
independent of each other in disjunction. That is, NP-Complete problem is in
infinite dimension function space that bases are P-Complete. The other hand,
any P-Complete problem have at most a finite number of P-Complete basis. The
reason is that each P problems have at most finite number of Least fixed point
operator. Therefore, we cannot describe NP-Complete problems in P. We can also
prove this result from incompleteness of P.
