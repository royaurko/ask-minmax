In this talk I will briefly outline work in progress in two different
contexts in astrophysical relativity, i.e. the study of rotating star
spacetimes and the problem of reliably extracting gravitational wave templates
in numerical relativity. In both cases the use of Weyl scalars and curvature
invariants helps to clarify important issues.
