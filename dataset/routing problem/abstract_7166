In this work, we consider fluid-structure interaction simulation with
nonlinear hyperelastic models in the solid part. We use a partitioned approach
to deal with the coupled nonlinear fluid-structure interaction problems. We
focus on handling the nonlinearity of the fluid and structure sub-problems, the
near-incompressibility of materials, the stabilization of employed finite
element discretization, and the robustness and efficiency of Krylov subspace
and algebraic multigrid methods for the linearized algebraic equations.
