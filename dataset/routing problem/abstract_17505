Branch-and-price algorithms combine a branch-and-bound search with an
exponentially-sized LP formulation that must be solved via column generation.
Unfortunately, the standard branching rules used in branch-and-bound for
integer programming interfere with the structure of the column generation
routine; therefore, most such algorithms employ alternate branching rules to
circumvent this difficulty. This paper shows how a zero-suppressed binary
decision diagram (ZDD) can be used to solve the pricing problem in a
branch-and-price algorithm for the graph coloring problem, even in the presence
of constraints imposed by branching decisions. This approach facilitates a much
more direct solution method, and can improve convergence of the column
generation subroutine.
