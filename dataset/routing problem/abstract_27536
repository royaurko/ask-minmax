For the physical vacuum free boundary problem with the sound speed being
$C^{{1}/{2}}$-H$\ddot{\rm o}$lder continuous near vacuum boundaries of the
one-dimensional compressible Euler equations with damping, the global existence
of the smooth solution is proved, which is shown to converge to the Barenblatt
self-similar solution for the the porous media equation with the same total
mass when the initial data is a small perturbation of the Barenblatt solution.
The pointwise convergence with a rate of density, the convergence rate of
velocity in supereme norm and the precise expanding rate of the physical vacuum
boundaries are also given. The proof is based on a construction of higher-order
weighted functionals with both space and time weights capturing the behavior of
solutions both near vacuum states and in large time, an introduction of a new
ansatz, higher-order nonlinear energy estimates and elliptic estimates.
