We discuss the observations leading to the Faint Blue Galaxy problem and the
uncertainties upon which faint galaxy models are based. Using deep Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) imaging with the Wide Field Planetary Camera (WFPC2), we show
how morphological information has been used to shed new light on the problem.
Initial results indicate that the giant galaxies (ellipticals and early-type
spirals), are well fit by {\it no-evolution} standard models down to $m_{I}
\sim 24.5$ ($z \sim 0.8$). The data also show that the faint blue galaxies have
late-type/irregular morphologies and cannot be adequately modelled until better
constraints are placed on the local space density for this class of galaxies.
