We reconsider the classical problem of representing a finite number of forms
of degree d in n+1 variables as sums of powers of linear forms. We define a
geometric construct called a `grove', which, in a number of cases allows us to
determine the dimension of the space of forms which can be so represented. We
also present two new `exceptional' examples, where this dimension is less than
what a naive parameter count would predict.
