We consider solution operators of linear ordinary boundary problems with "too
many" boundary conditions, which are not always solvable. These generalized
Green's operators are a certain kind of generalized inverses of differential
operators. We answer the question when the product of two generalized Green's
operators is again a generalized Green's operator for the product of the
corresponding differential operators and which boundary problem it solves.
Moreover, we show that---provided a factorization of the underlying
differential operator---a generalized boundary problem can be factored into
lower order problems corresponding to a factorization of the respective Green's
operators. We illustrate our results by examples using the Maple package
IntDiffOp, where the presented algorithms are implemented.
