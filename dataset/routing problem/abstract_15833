Given a system of equations in a "random" finitely generated subgroup of the
braid group, we show how to find a small ordered list of elements in the
subgroup, which contains a solution to the equations with a significant
probability. Moreover, with a significant probability, the solution will be the
first in the list. This gives a probabilistic solution to: The conjugacy
problem, the group membership problem, the shortest representation of an
element, and other combinatorial group-theoretic problems in random subgroups
of the braid group.
  We use a memory-based extension of the standard length-based approach, which
in principle can be applied to any group admitting an efficient, reasonably
behaving length function.
