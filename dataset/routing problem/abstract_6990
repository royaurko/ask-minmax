The functions satisfying the mean value property for an n-dimensional cube
are determined explicitly. This problem is related to invariant theory for a
finite reflection group, especially to a system of invariant differential
equations. Solving this problem is reduced to showing that a certain set of
invariant polynomials forms an invariant basis. After establishing a certain
summation formula over Young diagrams, the latter problem is settled by
considering a recursion formula involving Bernoulli numbers.
