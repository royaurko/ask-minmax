The Traveling Salesman Problem is one of the most studied problems in
computational complexity and its approximability has been a long standing open
question. Currently, the best known inapproximability threshold known is
220/219 due to Papadimitriou and Vempala. Here, using an essentially different
construction and also relying on the work of Berman and Karpinski on bounded
occurrence CSPs, we give an alternative and simpler inapproximability proof
which improves the bound to 185/184.
