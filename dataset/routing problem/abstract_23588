The problem of determining all consistent non-Abelian local interactions is
reviewed in flat space-time. The antifield-BRST formulation of the free theory
is an efficient tool to address this problem. Firstly, it allows to compute all
on-shell local Killing tensor fields, which are important because of their deep
relationship with higher-spin algebras. Secondly, under the sole assumptions of
locality and Poincare invariance, all non-trivial consistent deformations of a
sum of spin-three quadratic actions deforming the Abelian gauge algebra were
determined. They are compared with lower-spin cases.
