This report is the foreword of a series dedicated to stochastic deformations
of curves. Problems are set in terms of exclusion processes, the ultimate goal
being to derive hydrodynamic limits for these systems after proper scalings. In
this study, solely the basic \textsc{asep} system on the torus is analyzed. The
usual sequence of empirical measures, converges in probability to a
deterministic measure, which is the unique weak solution of a Cauchy problem.
The method presents some new features, letting hope for extensions to higher
dimension. It relies on the analysis of a family of parabolic differential
operators, involving variational calculus. Namely, the variables are the values
of functions at given points, their number being possibly infinite.
