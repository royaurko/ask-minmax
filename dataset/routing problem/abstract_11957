Some years ago we have proposed a thermal mount with electronically variable
thermal resistance [1]. In this earlier work the feasibility of such a
structure has been demonstrated. Now we intend to realize this mount in a
maturated form, suitable to the everyday use in the practice of package thermal
qualification and modeling. The design of such a device raises a number of new
questions and problems. The present paper is dealing with these problems and
the possible solutions.
