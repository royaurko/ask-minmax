We study equi-singular strata of plane curves with two singular points of
prescribed types. The method of the previous work [Kerner06] is generalized to
this case. In particular we consider the enumerative problem for plane curves
with two singular points of linear singularity types. First the problem for two
ordinary multiple points of fixed multiplicities is solved. Then the
enumeration for arbitrary linear types is reduced to the case of ordinary
multiple points and to the understanding of "merging" of singular points. Many
examples and numerical answers are given.
