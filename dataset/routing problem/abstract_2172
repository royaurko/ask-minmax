In this work we investigate the functional differentiability of the
time-dependent many-body wave function and of derived quantities with respect
to time-dependent potentials. For properly chosen Banach spaces of potentials
and wave functions Fr\'echet differentiability is proven. From this follows an
estimate for the difference of two solutions to the time-dependent
Schr\"odinger equation that evolve under the influence of different potentials.
Such results can be applied directly to the one-particle density and to bounded
operators, and present a rigorous formulation of non-equilibrium
linear-response theory where the usual Lehmann representation of the
linear-response kernel is not valid. Further, the Fr\'echet differentiability
of the wave function provides a new route towards proving basic properties of
time-dependent density-functional theory.
