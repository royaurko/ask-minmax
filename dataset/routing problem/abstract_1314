The handed down latitudinal data ascribed to Eratosthenes and Hipparchus are
composed and each tested for consistency by means of adjustment theory. For
detected inconsistencies new explanations are given concerning the origin of
the data. Several inconsistent data can be ascribed to Strabo. Differences in
Hipparchus' data can often be explained by the different types and precision of
the data. Gross errors in Eratosthenes' data are explained by their origination
from the lengths of sea routes. From Eratosthenes' data concerning Thule a
numerical value for Eratosthenes' obliquity of the ecliptic is deduced.
