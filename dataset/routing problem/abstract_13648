In this article we consider two problems: FIR (Finite Impulse Response)
approximation of IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) filters and inverse FIR
filtering of FIR or IIR filters. By means of Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP)
lemma and its generalization (GKYP), the problems are reduced to semidefinite
programming described in linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). MATLAB codes for
these design methods are given. An design example shows the effectiveness of
these methods.
