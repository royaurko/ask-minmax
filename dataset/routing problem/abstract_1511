Current interferometric gravitational wave detectors use test masses with
mirror coatings formed from multiple layers of dielectric materials, most
commonly alternating layers of SiO2 (silica) and Ta2O5 (tantala). However,
mechanical loss in the Ta2O5/SiO2 coatings may limit the design sensitivity for
advanced detectors. We have investigated sources of mechanical loss in the
Ta2O5/SiO2 coatings, including loss associated with the coating-substrate
interface, with the coating-layer interfaces, and with the bulk material. Our
results indicate that the loss is associated with the bulk coating materials
and that the loss of Ta2O5 is substantially larger than that of SiO2.
