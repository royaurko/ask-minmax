This paper presents an adaptation of the harmony search algorithm to solve
the storage allocation problem for inbound and outbound containers. This
problem is studied considering multiple container type (regular, open side,
open top, tank, empty and refrigerated) which lets the situation more
complicated, as various storage constraints appeared. The objective is to find
an optimal container arrangement which respects their departure dates, and
minimize the re-handle operations of containers. The performance of the
proposed approach is verified comparing to the results generated by genetic
algorithm and LIFO algorithm.
