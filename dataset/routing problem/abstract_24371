Navier-Stokes equations are known as hydrodynamic equations which take
account of effects of dissipations. There are, however, problems in the
relativistic Navier-Stokes equations, i.e. the equations violate causality.
Israel-Stewart equations, which evade the problems of Navier-Stokes equations
by introducing new parameters, such as the relaxation times, have recently been
used in describing the space-time evolution of the quark-gluon plasma produced
in high energy heavy ion collisions. The viscosities and the relaxation times
are related to each other by imposing entropy constraints on the system.
According to Boltzmann-Einstein principle, the probability distribution of the
fluctuation in the energy-momentum tensor is related to the entropy of the
system. Applying this principle to the entropy in Israel-Stewart theory, one
can obtain the ratios of the viscosities to the relaxation times. We evaluate
the ratios of the viscosities to the relaxation times in SU(3) lattice gauge
theory.
