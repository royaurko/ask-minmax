I previously derived the expression for the spin decoherence rate (for
orbital and spin motion in the horizontal plane) in a weak focusing
all-electric storage ring with a radial field (logarithmic potential, field
index $n=0$). Here I generalize the calculation to an arbitrary field index
$n\ge0$. I also solve the model for the relativistic Kepler problem (field
index $n=1$), where the solution for the orbit is known analytically, and I
verify that it confirms the solution from perturbation theory.
