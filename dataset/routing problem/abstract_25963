The nuclear suppression of high transverse momentum P_T hadrons is one of the
most striking findings in heavy-ion collision experiments. It has long been
recognized that the suppression can be theoretically described by folding the
primary parton spectrum with an energy loss probability distribution which is
suitably averaged over the collision geometry. However, an interesting problem
is to what degree the procedure can be inverted, i.e. given a measurement of
the suppression factor R_AA with arbitrary precision, can the probability
distribution of energy loss be extracted in a model-independent way? In this
note, we present a conceptual study of the inversion problem for LHC energies
and demonstrate that a measurement of R_AA alone is insufficient to determine
the distribution, other observables such as gamma-hadron correlations must be
taken into account.
