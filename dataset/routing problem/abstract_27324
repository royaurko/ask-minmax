Cylindrical algebraic decomposition(CAD) is a key tool in computational
algebraic geometry, particularly for quantifier elimination over real-closed
fields. When using CAD, there is often a choice for the ordering placed on the
variables. This can be important, with some problems infeasible with one
variable ordering but easy with another. Machine learning is the process of
fitting a computer model to a complex function based on properties learned from
measured data. In this paper we use machine learning (specifically a support
vector machine) to select between heuristics for choosing a variable ordering,
outperforming each of the separate heuristics.
