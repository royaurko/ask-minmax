This paper deals with the problem of classifying signals. The new method for
building so called local classifiers and local features is presented. The
method is a combination of the lifting scheme and the support vector machines.
Its main aim is to produce effective and yet comprehensible classifiers that
would help in understanding processes hidden behind classified signals. To
illustrate the method we present the results obtained on an artificial and a
real dataset.
