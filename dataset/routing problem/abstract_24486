We propose a simple extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model by
introducing a gauge singlet in addition to right-handed neutrinos. The model
resolves the strong CP problem by Pecci-Quinn symmetry, explains the origin of
left-handed neutrino masses as well as MSSM $\mu$-parameter. It also gives rise
to thermal inflation, baryogenesis and dark matter in a remarkably consistent
way. Interestingly, resolution of moduli problem by thermal inflation
constrains tightly axion coupling constant and flaton decay temperature to be
$f_a \sim 10^{12} \GeV$ and $T_\mathrm{d} \sim 100 \MeV$, respectively. Model
parameters in this case are likely to give right amount of baryon asymmetry and
dark matter at present. The main component of dark matter is expected to be the
axino whose mass is nearly fixed to be about $1 \GeV$.
