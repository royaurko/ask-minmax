We consider semilinear elliptic problems on two-dimensional hyperbolic space
involving critical growth. We first establish the Palais-Smale(P-S) condition
and using (P-S) condition we obtain existence of solutions. In addition, we
also explore existence of infinitely many sign changing solutions as well.
