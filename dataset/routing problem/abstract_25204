Deep holes play an important role in the decoding of generalized Reed-Solomon
codes. Recently, Wu and Hong \cite{WH} found a new class of deep holes for
standard Reed-Solomon codes. In the present paper, we give a concise method to
obtain a new class of deep holes for generalized Reed-Solomon codes. In
particular, for standard Reed-Solomon codes, we get the new class of deep holes
given in \cite{WH}.
  Li and Wan \cite{L.W1} studied deep holes of generalized Reed-Solomon codes
$GRS_{k}(\f,D)$ and characterized deep holes defined by polynomials of degree
$k+1$. They showed that this problem is reduced to be a subset sum problem in
finite fields. Using the method of Li and Wan, we obtain some new deep holes
for special Reed-Solomon codes over finite fields with even characteristic.
Furthermore, we study deep holes of the extended Reed-Solomon code, i.e.,
$D=\f$ and show polynomials of degree $k+2$ can not define deep holes.
