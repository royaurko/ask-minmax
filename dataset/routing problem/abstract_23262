The problem of determination of $\alpha_{s}$ and the condensates from the
moments of invariant mass distribution in the semileptonic tau decays is
considered. It is investigated how the extracted values of alpha_s(m^{2}_{tau})
and the condensates are affected by the the renormalization scheme dependence
of the next-to-next-to-leading order perturbative corrections to the spectral
moments. A simplified approach is used, in which the nonperturbative
contributions are approximated by the terms of dimension six in the SVZ
expansion, which arise from the four-quark condensates. \\
