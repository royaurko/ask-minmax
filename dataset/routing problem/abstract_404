These lecture notes were written with the aim to provide an accessible though
technically solid introduction to the logic of systematical analyses of
statistical data to undergraduate and to postgraduate students, in particular
in the Social Sciences and in Economics. They may also serve as a general
reference for the application of quantitative--empirical research methods. In
an attempt to encourage the adoption of an interdisciplinary perspective on
quantitative problems arising in practice, the notes cover the four broad
topics (i) descriptive statistical processing of raw data, (ii) elementary
probability theory, mainly as seen from a frequentist's viewpoint, (iii) the
operationalisation of one-dimensional latent statistical variables according to
Likert's widely used scaling approach, and (iv) the standard statistical tests
of hypotheses concerning (a) distributional differences of variables between
subgroups of a target population, and (b) statistical associations between two
variables. The lecture notes are fully hyperlinked, thus providing a direct
route to original scientific papers as well as to interesting biographical
information. They also list many commands for activating statistical functions
and data analysis routines in the software packages SPSS, R, EXCEL and
OpenOffice.
