Energy problems are important in the formal analysis of embedded or
autonomous systems. Using recent results on star-continuous Kleene
omega-algebras, we show here that energy problems can be solved by algebraic
manipulations on the transition matrix of energy automata. To this end, we
prove general results about certain classes of finitely additive functions on
complete lattices which should be of a more general interest.
