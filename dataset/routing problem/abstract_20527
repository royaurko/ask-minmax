Similarity symmetries of the factorization chains for one-dimensional
differential and finite-difference Schr\"odinger equations are discussed.
Properties of the potentials defined by self-similar reductions of these chains
are reviewed. In particular, their algebraic structure, relations to
$q$-special functions, infinite soliton systems, supersymmetry, coherent
states, orthogonal polynomials, one-dimensional Ising chains and random
matrices are outlined.
