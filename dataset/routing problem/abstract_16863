The relatively small fraction of the spin of the proton carried by its quarks
presents a major challenge to our understanding of the strong interaction.
Traditional efforts to explore this problem have involved new and imaginative
experiments and QCD based studies of the nucleon. We propose a new approach to
the problem which exploits recent advances in lattice QCD. In particular, we
extract values for the spin carried by the quarks in other members of the
baryon octet in order to see whether the suppression observed for the proton is
a general property or depends significantly on the baryon structure. We compare
these results with the values for the spin fractions calculated within a model
that includes the effects of confinement, relativity, gluon exchange currents
and the meson cloud required by chiral symmetry, finding a very satisfactory
level of agreement given the precision currently attainable.
