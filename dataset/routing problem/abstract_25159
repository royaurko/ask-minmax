A \emph{hull} of $A \subset [0,1]$ is a set $H$ containing $A$ such that
$\lambda^*(H)=\lambda^*(A)$. We investigate all four versions of the following
problem. Does there exist a monotone (wrt. inclusion) map that assigns a
Borel/$G_\delta$ hull to every negligible/measurable subset of $[0,1]$?
  Three versions turn out to be independent of ZFC (the usual Zermelo-Fraenkel
axioms with the Axiom of Choice), while in the fourth case we only prove that
the nonexistence of a monotone $G_\delta$ hull operation for all measurable
sets is consistent. It remains open whether existence here is also consistent.
We also answer a question of Z. Gyenes and D. P\'alv\"olgyi which asks if
monotone hulls can be defined for every chain (wrt. inclusion) of measurable
sets. We also comment on the problem of hulls of all subsets of $[0,1]$.
