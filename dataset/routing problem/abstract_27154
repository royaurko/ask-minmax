We address the discretization of optimization problems posed on the cone of
convex functions, motivated in particular by the principal agent problem in
economics, which models the impact of monopoly on product quality. Consider a
two dimensional domain, sampled on a grid of N points. We show that the cone of
restrictions to the grid of convex functions is in general characterized by N^2
linear inequalities; a direct computational use of this description therefore
has a prohibitive complexity. We thus introduce a hierarchy of sub-cones of
discrete convex functions, associated to stencils which can be adaptively,
locally, and anisotropically refined. Numerical experiments optimize the
accuracy/complexity tradeoff through the use of a-posteriori stencil refinement
strategies.
