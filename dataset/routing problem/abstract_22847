The reversible reactions like A+B <-> C in the many-component diffusive
system affect the diffusive properties of the constituents. The effective
conjugation of irreversible processes of different dimensionality takes place
due to the stationarity in the system and can lead to essential increase of the
resulting diffusive fluxes. The exact equations for the spatial concentration
profiles of the components are difficult to treat analytically. We solve
approximately the equations for the concentration profiles of the
reaction-diffusion components in the spherical geometry in the application to
the problem of the enhanced oxygen transfer through a biological membrane and
to the mathematically similar problem of surface diffusion in a solid body. In
the latter case the spherical geometry can be an adequate tool for describing
the surface of a real solid body which can be modeled as a fractal object
formed of sequences of spherical surfaces with different radii.
