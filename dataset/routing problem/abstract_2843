In this paper, I propose some problems, of topological nature, on the energy
functional associated to the Dirichlet problem -\Delta u = f(x,u) in Omega, u
restricted to the boundary of Omega is 0. Positive answers to these problems
would produce innovative multiplicity results on this Dirichlet problem.
