We propose an inverse approach for dealing with interval maps based on the
manner whereby their branches are related (folding property), instead of
addressing the map equations as a whole. As a main result, we provide a
symmetry-breaking framework for determining topological conjugacy of interval
maps, a well-known open problem in ergodic theory. Implications thereof for the
spectrum and eigenfunctions of the Perron-Frobenius operator are also
discussed.
