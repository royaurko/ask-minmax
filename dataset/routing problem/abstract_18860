Technology is the making, usage and knowledge of tools, techniques, crafts,
systems or methods of organization in order to solve a problem or serve some
purpose. This is true for humanitarian issues also. Such as the issue of
language and its primitive attraction for its native speakers which is visible
in the cases of the language spoken at home, outside home, in its choice of
newspapers, and TV channels. Everyone finds to accomplish its need by the same
way. Example includes the preference of using mobile phones in English. The
satisfactory answer to this tendency may be the lack of finding the
translations in native language---Bengali terms used in current mobile phones
are hard to understand by users. I have investigated various mobile phone
models available in Indian market which have lot of problems in Bengali
interpretation. I have sort out the root cause of this problem to be the
conventional accent understand ability. Depending on this I have created a set
of equivalent terms that I hope to be simpler in use. In this paper I have
performed experiments to compare the new terms to the available ones. Our
findings show that the newly derived terms do better in term of performance
than to current ones. It has also been seen that acceptance of Bengali terms in
mobile phones might grow if the parameter of simpler and conventional accent
understand ability are met while designing.
