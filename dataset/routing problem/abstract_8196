The paper is the last in the cycle devoted to the solution of Alexandrov's
problem for non-positively curved spaces. Here we study non-positively curved
spaces in the sense of Busemann. We prove that if $X$ is geodesically complete
connected at infinity proper Busemann space, then it has the following
characterization of isometries. For any bijection $f:X\to X$, if $f$ and
$f^{-1}$ preserve the distance 1, then $f$ is an isometry.
