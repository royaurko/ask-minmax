Multivariate Poisson random variables subject to linear integer constraints
arise in several application areas, such as queuing and biomolecular networks.
This note shows how to compute conditional statistics in this context, by
employing WF Theory and associated algorithms. A symbolic computation package
has been developed and is made freely available. A discussion of motivating
biomolecular problems is also provided.
