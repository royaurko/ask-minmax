A new Runge-Kutta-Nystr\"om method, with phase-lag of order infinity, for the
integration of second-order periodic initial-value problems is developed in
this paper. The new method is based on the Dormand and Prince
Runge-Kutta-Nystr\"om method of algebraic order four\cite{pa}. Numerical
illustrations indicate that the new method is much more efficient than the
classical one.
