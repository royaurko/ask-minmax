A general problem of optimal information acquisition for its use in decision
making problems is considered. This motivates the need for developing
quantitative measures of information sources' capabilities for supplying
accurate information depending on the particular content of the latter. In this
article, the notion of a real valued difficulty functional for questions
identified with partitions of problem parameter space is introduced and the
overall form of this functional is derived that satisfies a particular system
of reasonable postulates. It is found that, in an isotropic case, the resulting
difficulty functional depends on a single scalar function on the parameter
space that can be interpreted -- using parallels with classical thermodynamics
-- as a temperature-like quantity, with the question difficulty itself playing
the role of thermal energy. Quantitative relationships between difficulty
functionals of different questions are also explored.
