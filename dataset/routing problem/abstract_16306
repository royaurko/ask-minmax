In this paper, we specify a class of mathematical problems, which we refer to
as "Function Density Problems" (FDPs, in short), and point out novel
connections of FDPs to the following two cryptographic topics; theoretical
security evaluations of keyless hash functions (such as SHA-1), and
constructions of provably secure pseudorandom generators (PRGs) with some
enhanced security property introduced by Dubrov and Ishai [STOC 2006]. Our
argument aims at proposing new theoretical frameworks for these topics
(especially for the former) based on FDPs, rather than providing some concrete
and practical results on the topics. We also give some examples of mathematical
discussions on FDPs, which would be of independent interest from mathematical
viewpoints. Finally, we discuss possible directions of future research on other
cryptographic applications of FDPs and on mathematical studies on FDPs
themselves.
