The variant of quasiclassical (half-quantum) theory of gravity in strong
gravitational field is presented. The exact solution of the problem of the
renormalized energy-momentum tensor calculation is performed in terms of
non-local operator-signed function. The procedure of quasilocalization is
proposed, which leads to the equations of non-equilibrium thermodynamics for
temperature and curvature. The effects of induced particle creation and media
polarization are taking into account and used to solve the problem of
non-Einstein's branches damping. The problem of Universe creation from
"nothing" is also discussed.
