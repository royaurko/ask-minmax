Moment estimation is an important problem during circuit validation, in both
pre-Silicon and post-Silicon stages. From the estimated moments, the
probability of failure and parametric yield can be estimated at each circuit
configuration and corner, and these metrics are used for design optimization
and making product qualification decisions. The problem is especially difficult
if only a very small sample size is allowed for measurement or simulation, as
is the case for complex analog/mixed-signal circuits. In this paper, we propose
an efficient moment estimation method, called Multiple-Population Moment
Estimation (MPME), that significantly improves estimation accuracy under small
sample size. The key idea is to leverage the data collected under different
corners/configurations to improve the accuracy of moment estimation at each
individual corner/configuration. Mathematically, we employ the hierarchical
Bayesian framework to exploit the underlying correlation in the data. We apply
the proposed method to several datasets including post-silicon measurements of
a commercial high-speed I/O link, and demonstrate an average error reduction of
up to 2$\times$, which can be equivalently translated to significant reduction
of validation time and cost.
