We consider an optimal control problem for the three-dimensional non-linear
Primitive Equations of the ocean in a vertically bounded and horizontally
periodic domain. The observation operator maps a solution of the Primitive
Equations to the trajectory of a Lagrangian particle. This paper proves the
existence of an optimal control for the regularized problem. To do that, we
prove also new energy estimates for the Primitive Equations, thanks to
well-chosen functional spaces, which distinguish the vertical dimension from
the horizontal ones. We illustrate the result with a numerical experiment.
