Some inverse problems in high-energy physics, neutron diffraction and NMR
spectroscopy are discussed. To solve them, the Fourier integrated
transformation method and the Maximum Entropy Technique (MENT) were used. The
integrated images of experimental distributions are shown to be informative
when determining the space-time parameters of a particle generation zone and
when analysing blurred spectra. The efficiency of the above methods was checked
by comparing relevant results with the results obtained independently.
