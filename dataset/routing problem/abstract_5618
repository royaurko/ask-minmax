We discuss some mathematical aspects of the problem of inverting
gravitational field data to extract the underlying mass distribution. While the
forward problem of computing the gravity field from a given mass distribution
is mathematically straightforward, the inverse of this forward map has some
interesting features that make inversion a difficult problem. In particular,
the forward map has an infinite-dimensional kernel which makes the inversion
fundamentally non-unique. We characterize completely the kernels of two
gravitational forward maps, one mapping mass density to the Newtonian scalar
potential, and the other mapping mass density to the gravity gradient tensor,
which is the quantity most commonly measured in field observations. In
addition, we present some results on unique inversion under constrained
conditions, and comment on the roles the kernel of the forward map and
non-uniqueness play in discretized approaches to the continuum inverse problem.
