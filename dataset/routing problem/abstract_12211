We apply the Schr\"odinger factorization method to the radial second-order
equation for the relativistic Kepler-Coulomb problem. From these operators we
construct two sets of one-variable radial operators which are realizations for
the $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra. We use this algebraic structure to obtain the energy
spectrum and the supersymmetric ground state for this system.
