Some of the guiding problems in partially hyperbolic systems are the
following: (1) Examples, (2) Properties of invariant foliations, (3)
Accessibility, (4) Ergodicity, (5) Lyapunov exponents, (6) Integrability of
central foliations, (7) Transitivity and (8) Classification. Here we will
survey the state of the art on these subjects, and propose related problems.
