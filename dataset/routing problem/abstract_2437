MSr2Y1.5Ce0.5Cu2Oz (M-1222) compounds, with M = Fe and Co, have been
synthesized through a solid-state reaction route. Both compounds crystallize in
a tetragonal structure (space group I4/mmm). A Rietveld structural refinement
of room-temperature neutron diffraction data for Fe-1222 reveals that nearly
half the Fe remains at the M site, while the other half goes to the Cu site in
the CuO2 planes. Existence of Fe at two different lattice sites, is also
confirmed by 57Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy from which it is inferred that nearly
50% of the total Fe occupies the Cu site in the CuO2 planes as Fe3+, whereas
the other 50 % is located at the M site with nearly 40 % as Fe4+ and around 10%
as Fe3+. For the M = Co compound, nearly 84 % of Co remains at its designated
M site, while the rest occupies the Cu site in the CuO2 planes. The oxygen
content, z, based on oxygen occupancies refined from the neutron diffraction
data, comes close to 9.0 for both the samples The ZFC and FC magnetization
curves as a function of temperature show a complex behavior for both Fe-1222
and Co-1222 compounds.
