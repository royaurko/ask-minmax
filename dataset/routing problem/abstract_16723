In a previous work we investigated the existence of Hopf degenerate
bifurcation points for a differential delay equation modeling leukemia and we
actually found Hopf points of codimension two for the considered problem. If
around the parameters corresponding to such a point we vary two parameters (the
considered problem has five parameters), then a Bautin bifurcation should
occur. In this work we chose a Hopf point of codimension two for the considered
problem and perform numerical integration for parameters chosen in a
neighborhood of the bifurcation point parameters. The results show that,
indeed, we have a Bautin bifurcation in the chosen point.
