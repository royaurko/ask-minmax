Many universities place underperforming students on "Academic Probation"
(AP), granting them support and threatening suspension if performance does not
improve. In a study of the effect of AP on subsequent grade point averages
(GPAs), Lindo, et al. (2010) noted that AP follows a regression discontinuity
design (RDD): students whose first year GPAs (the "running variable") fall
below a cutoff are put on AP. However, the standard RDD procedure suffered in
their dataset from a number of problems, including a discrete running variable
and a McCrary test failure. This paper presents a new approach to modeling
RDDs, which solves these problems. Its idea is to disentangle the outcome from
the running variable, producing a transformed version of the outcome; to model
the transformed outcome as independent of treatment assignment; and to estimate
treatment effects using permutation inference. Whereas standard RDD analysis
relies on limits of outcomes' conditional expectation functions and assumes a
continuous running variable, we model the transformed data as if they emerged
from a randomized experiment. Our approach estimates effects for a specific
sample of subjects, is robust to small samples and discrete running variables,
and is amenable to solutions to a McCrary test failure.
