The process of multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) is of determining the
best choice among all of the probable alternatives. The problem of supplier
selection on which decision maker has usually vague and imprecise knowledge is
a typical example of multi criteria group decision-making problem. The
conventional crisp techniques has not much effective for solving MCDM problems
because of imprecise or fuzziness nature of the linguistic assessments. To find
the exact values for MCDM problems is both difficult and impossible in more
cases in real world. So, it is more reasonable to consider the values of
alternatives according to the criteria as single valued neutrosophic sets
(SVNS). This paper deal with the technique for order preference by similarity
to ideal solution (TOPSIS) approach and extend the TOPSIS method to MCDM
problem with single valued neutrosophic information. The value of each
alternative and the weight of each criterion are characterized by single valued
neutrosophic numbers. Here, the importance of criteria and alternatives is
identified by aggregating individual opinions of decision makers (DMs) via
single valued neutrosophic weighted averaging (IFWA) operator. The proposed
method is, easy use, precise and practical for solving MCDM problem with single
valued neutrosophic data. Finally, to show the applicability of the developed
method, a numerical experiment for supplier choice is given as an application
of single valued neutrosophic TOPSIS method at end of this paper.
