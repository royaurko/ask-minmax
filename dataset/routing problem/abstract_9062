A classical result of A.D. Alexandrov states that a connected compact smooth
$n-$dimensional manifold without boundary, embedded in $\Bbb R^{n+1}$, and such
that its mean curvature is constant, is a sphere. Here we study the problem of
symmetry of $M$ in a hyperplane $X_{n+1}=$constant in case $M$ satisfies: for
any two points $(X', X_{n+1})$, $(X', \hat X_{n+1})$ on $M$, with $X_{n+1}>\hat
X_{n+1}$, the mean curvature at the first is not greater than that at the
second. Symmetry need not always hold, but in this paper, we establish it under
some additional conditions. Some variations of the Hopf Lemma are also
presented. Several open problems are described. Part I dealt with corresponding
one dimensional problems.
