An algorithm is discussed for converting a class of recursive processes to a
parallel system. It is argued that this algorithm can be superior to certain
methods currently found in the literature for an important subset of problems.
The cases of homogeneous and non-homogenous two term recursion are treated.
Applications to three problems (finding the eigenvalues of a tri-diagonal
matrix, the solution of a radial wave equation and the solution of a
tri-diagonal matrix) are discussed.
