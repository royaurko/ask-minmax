By using the backward fractional Fokker-Planck equation we investigate the
barrier crossing event in the presence of Levy noise. After shortly review
recent results obtained with different approaches on the time characteristics
of the barrier crossing, we derive a general differential equation useful to
calculate the nonlinear relaxation time. We obtain analytically the nonlinear
relaxation time for free Levy flights and a closed expression in quadrature of
the same characteristics for cubic potential.
