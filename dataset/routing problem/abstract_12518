We suggest a new type of problem about distances in graphs and make several
conjectures. As a first step towards proving them, we show that for
sufficiently large values of n and k, a graph on n vertices that has no three
vertices at pairwise distance k has at most (n-k+1)^2/4 pairs of vertices at
distance k.
