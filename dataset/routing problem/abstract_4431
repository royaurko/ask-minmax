High dimensional data analysis is known to be as a challenging problem. In
this article, we give a theoretical analysis of high dimensional classification
of Gaussian data which relies on a geometrical analysis of the error measure.
It links a problem of classification with a problem of nonparametric
regression. We give an algorithm designed for high dimensional data which
appears straightforward in the light of our theoretical work, together with the
thresholding estimation theory. We finally attempt to give a general treatment
of the problem that can be extended to frameworks other than gaussian.
