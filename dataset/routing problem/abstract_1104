We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally a novel type of localized
beams supported by the combined effects of total internal and Bragg reflection
in nonlinear two-dimensional square periodic structures. Such localized states
exhibit strong anisotropy in their mobility properties, being highly mobile in
one direction and trapped in the other, making them promising candidates for
optical routing in nonlinear lattices.
