This paper aims to propose a new solution for failure recovery (dead-ends) in
Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communications through LTE-assisted Device-to-Device
communications (D2D). Based on the enhanced networking capabilities offered by
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) architecture, our solution can
efficiently assist V2V communications in failure recovery situations. We also
derive an analytical model to evaluate generic V2V routing recovery failures.
Moreover, the proposed hybrid model is simulated and compared to the generic
model under different constrains of worst and best cases of D2D discovery and
communication. According to our comparison and simulation results, the hybrid
model decreases the delay for alarm message propagation to the destination
(typically the Traffic Control Center TCC) through the Road Side Unit (RSU)
