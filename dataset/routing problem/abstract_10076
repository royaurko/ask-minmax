We consider polyhedral versions of Kannan and Lipton's Orbit Problem (STOC
'80 and JACM '86)---determining whether a target polyhedron V may be reached
from a starting point x under repeated applications of a linear transformation
A in an ambient vector space Q^m. In the context of program verification, very
similar reachability questions were also considered and left open by Lee and
Yannakakis in (STOC '92). We present what amounts to a complete
characterisation of the decidability landscape for the Polyhedron-Hitting
Problem, expressed as a function of the dimension m of the ambient space,
together with the dimension of the polyhedral target V: more precisely, for
each pair of dimensions, we either establish decidability, or show hardness for
longstanding number-theoretic open problems.
