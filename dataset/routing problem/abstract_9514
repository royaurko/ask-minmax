This paper presents a strategy for the computation of structures with
repeated patterns based on domain decomposition and block Krylov solvers. It
can be seen as a special variant of the FETI method. We propose using the
presence of repeated domains in the problem to compute the solution by
minimizing the interface error on several directions simultaneously. The method
not only drastically decreases the size of the problems to solve but also
accelerates the convergence of interface problem for nearly no additional
computational cost and minimizes expensive memory accesses. The numerical
performances are illustrated on some thermal and elastic academic problems.
