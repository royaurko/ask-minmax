Recently [quant-ph/0608250] again created a lot of interest to prove the
existence of bound entangled states with negative partial transpose (NPT) in
any $d \times d (d \geq 3)$ Hilbert space. However the proof in
quant-ph/0608250 is not complete but it shows some interesting properties of
the Schmidt rank two states. In this work we are trying to probe the problem in
a different angle considering the work by D\"{u}r et.al [Phys. Rev. A, 61,
062313(2000)]. We have assumed that the Schmidt rank two states should satisfy
some bounds. Under some assumptions with these bounds one could prove the
existence of NPT bound entangled states. We particularly discuss the case of
two copy undistillability of the conjectured family of NPT states. Obviously
the class of NPT bound entangled states belong to the class of conjectured to
be bound entangled states by Divincenzo et.al [Phys. Rev. A, 61, 062312(2000)]
and by D\"{u}r et.al [Phys. Rev. A, 61, 062313(2000)]. However the problem of
existence of NPT bound entangled states still remain open.
