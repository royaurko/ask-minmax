We prove non-existence of static, vacuum, appropriately regular,
asymptotically flat black hole space-times with degenerate (not necessarily
connected) components of the event horizon. This finishes the classification of
static, vacuum, asymptotically flat domains of outer communication in an
appropriate class of space-times, showing that the domains of outer
communication of the Schwarzschild black holes exhaust the space of
appropriately regular black hole exteriors.
