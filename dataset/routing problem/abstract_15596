We analyse the motion of a system of particles suspended in a fluid which has
a random velocity field. There are coagulating and non-coagulating phases. We
show that the phase transition is related to a Kramers problem, and use this to
determine the phase diagram, as a function of the dimensionless inertia of the
particles, epsilon, and a measure of the relative intensities of potential and
solenoidal components of the velocity field, Gamma. We find that the phase line
is described by a function which is non-analytic at epsilon=0, and which is
related to escape over a barrier in the Kramers problem. We discuss the
physical realisations of this phase transition.
