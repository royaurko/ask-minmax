Based on a unique waveform with strong exponential localization property, an
exact mathematical method for solving problems in signal analysis in
time-frequency domain is presented. An analogue of the Gabor frame exposes the
non-commutative geometry of the time-frequency plane. Signals are visualized
using graphical representation constructed.
