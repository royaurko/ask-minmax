We develop a new finite element method for solving planar elasticity problems
involving of heterogeneous materials with a mesh not necessarily aligning with
the interface of the materials. This method is based on the `broken'
Crouzeix-Raviart $P_1$-nonconforming finite element method for elliptic
interface problems \cite{Kwak-We-Ch}.
  To ensure the coercivity of the bilinear form arising from using the
nonconforming finite elements, we add stabilizing terms as in the discontinuous
Galerkin (DG) method \cite{Arnold-IP},\cite{Ar-B-Co-Ma},\cite{Wheeler}. The
novelty of our method is that we use meshes independent of the interface, so
that the interface may cut through the elements. Instead, we modify the basis
functions so that they satisfy the Laplace-Young condition along the interface
of each element. We prove optimal $H^1$ and divergence norm error estimates.
  Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the our method is
optimal for various Lam\`e parameters $\mu$ and $\lambda$ and locking free as
$\lambda\to\infty$.
