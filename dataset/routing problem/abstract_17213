In this study, calculations necessary to solve the large scale linear
programming problems in two operating systems, Linux and Windows 7 (Win), are
compared using two different methods. Relying on the interior-point methods,
linear-programming interior point solvers (LIPSOL) software was used for the
first method and relying on an augmented Lagrangian method-based algorithm, the
second method used the generalized derivative. The performed calculations for
various problems show the produced random in the Linux operating system (OS)
and Win OS indicate the efficiency of the performed calculations in the Linux
OS in terms of the accuracy and using of the optimum memory.
