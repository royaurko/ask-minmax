In this letter we derive exponent inequalities relating the dynamic exponent
$z$ to the steady state exponent $\Gamma$ for a general class of stochastically
driven dynamical systems. We begin by deriving a general exact inequality,
relating the response function and the correlation function, from which the
various exponent inequalities emanate. We then distinguish between two classes
of dynamical systems and obtain different and complementary inequalities
relating $z$ and $\Gamma$. The consequences of those inequalities for a wide
set of dynamical problems, including critical dynamics and
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang-like problems are discussed.
