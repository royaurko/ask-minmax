The dynamics of globally minimizing orbits of Lagrangian systems can be
studied using the Barrier function, as Mather first did, or using the pairs of
weak KAM solutions introduced by Fathi. The central observation of the present
paper is that Fathi weak KAM pairs are precisely the admissible pairs for the
Kantorovich problem dual to the Monge transportation problem with the Barrier
function as cost. We exploit this observation to recover several relations
between the Barrier functions and the set of weak KAM pairs in an axiomatic and
elementary way.
