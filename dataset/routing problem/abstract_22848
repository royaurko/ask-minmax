We study magnetic vortex-like excitations lying on a conic space background.
Two types of them are obtained. Their energies appear to be linearly dependent
on the conical aperture parameter, besides of being logarithmically divergent
with the sample size. In addition, we realize a geometrical-like pinning of the
vortex, say, it is energetically favorable for it to nucleate around the
conical apex. We also study the problem of two vortices on the cone and obtain
an interesting effect on such a geometry: excitations of the same charge, then
repealing each other, may nucleate around the apex for suitable cone apertures.
We also pay attention to the problem of the vortex pair and how its
dissociation temperature depends upon conical geometry.
