This work investigates a set of cosmological collisionless N-body simulations
with featured power spectra of initial perturbations in the context of the
core-cusp and satellites problems. On the studied power spectra some scales of
fluctuations were suppressed. Such spectral features can be caused by
multicomponent dark matter. The density profiles innermost resolved slopes
$\alpha\equiv d \log(\rho) /d \log(r) $ of the five largest haloes were
measured and its dependence on the parameters of the suppression was traced. In
a certain range of the parameters the slopes flatten from initial value of
about -1.2 to -0.6 or even to -0.2 in one of the cases. This qualitatively
demonstrates that (i) profiles shape depends on initial power spectrum and (ii)
this effect may be responsible for the solution of the core-cusp problem. The
suppression of some part of the initial power spectrum also leads to the
decrease of the number of massive subhaloes.
