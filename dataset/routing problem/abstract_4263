A generalized flux problem with Abelian and non-Abelian fluxes is considered.
In the Abelian case we shall show that the generalized flux problem for
tight-binding models of noninteracting electrons on either $2n$ or $2n+1$
dimensional lattice can always be reduced to a $n$ dimensional hopping problem.
A residual freedom in this reduction enables to identify equivalence classes of
hopping Hamiltonians which have the same spectrum. In the non-Abelian case the
reduction is not possible in general unless the flux tensor factorizes into an
Abelian one times an element of the corresponding algebra.
