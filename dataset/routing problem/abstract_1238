Spintronics relies on the ability to transport and utilize the spin
properties of an electron rather than its charge. We describe a spin rachet at
the single-electron level that produces spin currents with no net bias or
charge transport. Our device is based on the ground state energetics of a
single electron transistor comprising a superconducting island connected to
normal leads via tunnel barriers with different resistances that break spatial
symmetry. We demonstrate spin transport and quantify the spin ratchet
efficiency using ferromagnetic leads with known spin polarization. Our results
are modeled theoretically and provide a robust route to the generation and
manipulation of pure spin currents.
