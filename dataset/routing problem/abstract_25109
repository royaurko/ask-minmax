We consider supersymmetric models where anomaly and gravity mediation give
comparable contributions to the soft terms and discuss how this can be realized
in a five-dimensional brane world. The gaugino mass pattern of anomaly
mediation is preserved in such a hybrid setup. The flavorful gravity-mediated
contribution cures the tachyonic slepton problem of anomaly mediation. The
supersymmetric flavor puzzle is solved by alignment. We explicitly show how a
working flavor-tachyon link can be realized with Abelian flavor symmetries and
give the characteristic signatures of the framework, including O(1) slepton
mass splittings between different generations and between doublets and
singlets. This provides opportunities for same flavor dilepton edge
measurements with missing energy at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Rare
lepton decay rates could be close to their current experimental limit. Compared
to pure gravity mediation, the hybrid model is advantageous because it features
a heavy gravitino which can avoid the cosmological gravitino problem of
gravity-mediated models combined with leptogenesis.
