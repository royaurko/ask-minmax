This article is a continuation of the recent paper [Grohs, Intrinsic
localization of anisotropic frames, ACHA, 2013], where off-diagonal-decay
properties (often referred to as 'localization' in the literature) of
Moore-Penrose pseudoinverses of (bi-infinite) matrices are established,
whenever the latter possess similar off-diagonal-decay properties. This problem
is especially interesting if the matrix arises as a discretization of an
operator with respect to a frame or basis. Previous work on this problem has
been restricted to wavelet- or Gabor frames. In the previous work we extended
these results to frames of parabolic molecules, including curvelets or
shearlets as special cases. The present paper extends and unifies these results
by establishing analogous properties for frames of $\alpha$-molecules as
introduced in recent work [Grohs, Keiper, Kutyniok, Sch\"afer, Alpha molecules:
curvelets, shearlets, ridgelets, and beyond, Proc. SPIE. 8858, 2013]. Since
wavelets, curvelets, shearlets, ridgelets and hybrid shearlets all constitute
instances of $\alpha$-molecules, our results establish localization properties
for all these systems simultaneously.
