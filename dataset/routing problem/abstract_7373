We consider the sum of the incurred start-up costs of a single unit in a Unit
Commitment problem. Our major result is a correspondence between the facets of
its epigraph and some binary trees for concave start-up cost functions CU,
which is bijective if CU is strictly concave. We derive an exponential
H-representation of this epigraph, and provide an exact linear separation
algorithm. These results significantly reduce the integrality gap of the Mixed
Integer formulation of a Unit Commitment Problem compared to current
literature.
