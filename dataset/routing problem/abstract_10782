Part V of the second edition of Pierre R\'{e}mond de Montmort's Essay
d'analyse sur les jeux de hazard published in 1713 contains correspondence on
probability problems between Montmort and Nicolaus Bernoulli. This
correspondence begins in 1710. The last published letter, dated November 15,
1713, is from Montmort to Nicolaus Bernoulli. There is some discussion of the
strategy of play in the card game Le Her and a bit of news that Montmort's
friend Waldegrave in Paris was going to take care of the printing of the book.
From earlier correspondence between Bernoulli and Montmort, it is apparent that
Waldegrave had also analyzed Le Her and had come up with a mixed strategy as a
solution. He had also suggested working on the "problem of the pool," or what
is often called Waldegrave's problem. The Universit\"{a}tsbibliothek Basel
contains an additional forty-two letters between Bernoulli and Montmort written
after 1713, as well as two letters between Bernoulli and Waldegrave. The
letters are all in French, and here we provide translations of key passages.
The trio continued to discuss probability problems, particularly Le Her which
was still under discussion when the Essay d'analyse went to print. We describe
the probability content of this body of correspondence and put it in its
historical context. We also provide a proper identification of Waldegrave based
on manuscripts in the Archives nationales de France in Paris.
