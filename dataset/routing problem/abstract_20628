We argue that the Polonyi problem can be avoided when our
supersymmetry-breaking vacuum is surrounded by many supersymmetric vacua. We
construct a dynamical class of supersymmetry-breaking models to demonstrate our
point. These models naturally predict a small deviation from the standard
big-bang nucleosynthesis.
