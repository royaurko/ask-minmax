We investigate complexity issues related to pure Nash equilibria of strategic
games. We show that, even in very restrictive settings, determining whether a
game has a pure Nash Equilibrium is NP-hard, while deciding whether a game has
a strong Nash equilibrium is SigmaP2-complete. We then study practically
relevant restrictions that lower the complexity. In particular, we are
interested in quantitative and qualitative restrictions of the way each players
payoff depends on moves of other players. We say that a game has small
neighborhood if the utility function for each player depends only on (the
actions of) a logarithmically small number of other players. The dependency
structure of a game G can be expressed by a graph DG(G) or by a hypergraph
H(G). By relating Nash equilibrium problems to constraint satisfaction problems
(CSPs), we show that if G has small neighborhood and if H(G) has bounded
hypertree width (or if DG(G) has bounded treewidth), then finding pure Nash and
Pareto equilibria is feasible in polynomial time. If the game is graphical,
then these problems are LOGCFL-complete and thus in the class NC2 of highly
parallelizable problems.
