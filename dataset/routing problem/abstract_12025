A coding problem for correlated information sources is investigated. Messages
emitted from two correlated sources are jointly encoded, and delivered to two
decoders. Each decoder has access to one of the two messages to enable it to
reproduce the other message. The rate-distortion function for the coding
problem and its interesting properties are clarified.
