We propose an inertial Douglas-Rachford splitting algorithm for finding the
set of zeros of the sum of two maximally monotone operators in Hilbert spaces
and investigate its convergence properties. To this end we formulate first the
inertial version of the Krasnosel'ski\u{\i}--Mann algorithm for approximating
the set of fixed points of a nonexpansive operator, for which we also provide
an exhaustive convergence analysis. By using a product space approach we employ
these results to the solving of monotone inclusion problems involving linearly
composed and parallel-sum type operators and provide in this way iterative
schemes where each of the maximally monotone mappings is accessed separately
via its resolvent. We consider also the special instance of solving a
primal-dual pair of nonsmooth convex optimization problems and illustrate the
theoretical results via some numerical experiments in clustering and location
theory.
