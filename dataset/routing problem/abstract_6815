The purpose of this paper is to further exemplify an approach to evolutionary
problems originally developed in earlier works for a special case and later
extended to more general evolutionary problems. We are here concerned with the
$(1+1)$ -dimensional evolutionary case, which in a particular case results in a
hyperbolic partial differential equation with a Sturm-Liouville type spatial
operator constrained by an impedance type boundary condition.
