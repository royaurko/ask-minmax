We report Eu L3-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) investigation
of the electronic structure of EuB6. We observe that the RIXS spectral weight
around 1.1 eV increases dramatically when the system is cooled below the
ferromagnetic ordering temperature and follows the magnetic order parameter.
This spectral feature is attributed to the inter-site excitation from the local
4f orbital to the spin-split 5d orbital on the neighboring site, illustrating
the essential role of exchange splitting of the conducting electrons. Based on
our density functional theory calculations, the RIXS data suggest that EuB6 at
low temperature can be consistently described with a semi-metallic electronic
structure with incomplete spin-polarization. We propose routes to achieve
half-metallicity in EuB6, which utilize the strong tunability of the electronic
structure against gate voltage, strain, and magnetic field.
