This paper is concerned with the global smooth non-vacuum solutions with
large data to the Cauchy problem of the one-dimensional compressible
Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate temperature dependent transport
coefficients which satisfy conditions from the consideration in kinetic theory.
A Nishida-Smoller type result is obtained.
