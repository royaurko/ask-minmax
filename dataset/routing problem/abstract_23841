It is well known that the repeated square and multiply algorithm is an
efficient way of modular exponentiation. The obvious question to ask is if this
algorithm has an inverse which would calculate the discrete logarithm
efficiently. The technical hitch is in fixing the right sign of the square root
and this is the heart of the discrete logarithm problem over finite fields of
characteristic not equal to 2. In this paper a couple of probabilistic
algorithms to compute the discrete logarithm over finite fields are given by
bypassing this difficulty. One of the algorithms was inspired by the famous
3x+1 problem.
