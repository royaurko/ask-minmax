Without involving bounce events, a Poincar\'e section associated with the
axes is found to give a map on the annulus for the diamagnetic Kepler problem.
Symbolic dynamics is then established based on the lift of the annulus map. The
correspondence between the coding derived from this axis Poincar\'e section is
compared with the coding based on bounces. Symmetry is used to reduce the
symbolic dynamics. By means of symbolic dynamics the admissibility of periodic
orbits is analyzed, and the symmetry of orbits discussed.
