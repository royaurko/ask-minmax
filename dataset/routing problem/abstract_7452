We consider several subgroup-related algorithmic questions in groups, modeled
after the classic computational lattice problems, and study their computational
complexity. We find polynomial time solutions to problems like finding a
subgroup element closest to a given group element, or finding a shortest
non-trivial element of a subgroup in the case of nilpotent groups, and a large
class of surface groups and Coxeter groups. We also provide polynomial time
algorithm to compute geodesics in given generators of a subgroup of a free
group.
