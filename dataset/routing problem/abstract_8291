We study the problem of resolving a perhaps misspelled address of a location
into geographic coordinates of latitude and longitude. Our data structure
solves this problem within a few milliseconds even for misspelled and
fragmentary queries. Compared to major geographic search engines such as Google
or Bing we achieve results of significantly better quality.
