A semilinear parabolic problem of second order with an unknown
time-convolution kernel is considered. The missing kernel is recovered from an
additional integral measurement. The existence, uniqueness and regularity of a
weak solution is addressed. We design a numerical algorithm based on Rothe's
method, derive a priori estimates and prove convergence of iterates towards the
exact solution.
