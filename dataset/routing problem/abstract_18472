The $SU(N_f)_L \otimes SU(N_f)_R$ chiral symmetry of QCD is of central
importance for the nonperturbative low-energy dynamics of light quarks and
gluons. Lattice field theory provides a theoretical framework in which these
dynamics can be studied from first principles. The implementation of chiral
symmetry on the lattice is a nontrivial issue. In particular, local lattice
fermion actions with the chiral symmetry of the continuum theory suffer from
the fermion doubling problem. The Ginsparg-Wilson relation implies L\"uscher's
lattice variant of chiral symmetry which agrees with the usual one in the
continuum limit. Local lattice fermion actions that obey the Ginsparg-Wilson
relation have an exact chiral symmetry, the correct axial anomaly, they obey a
lattice version of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, and still they do not
suffer from the notorious doubling problem. The Ginsparg-Wilson relation is
satisfied exactly by Neuberger's overlap fermions which are a limit of Kaplan's
domain wall fermions, as well as by Hasenfratz and Niedermayer's classically
perfect lattice fermion actions. When chiral symmetry is nonlinearly realized
in effective field theories on the lattice, the doubling problem again does not
arise. This review provides an introduction to chiral symmetry on the lattice
with an emphasis on the basic theoretical framework.
