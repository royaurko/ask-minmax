We establish an optimal, linear rate of convergence for the stochastic
homogenization of discrete linear elliptic equations. We consider the model
problem of independent and identically distributed coefficients on a
discretized unit torus. We show that the difference between the solution to the
random problem on the discretized torus and the first two terms of the
two-scale asymptotic expansion has the same scaling as in the periodic case. In
particular the $L^2$-norm in probability of the \mbox{$H^1$-norm} in space of
this error scales like $\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is the discretization
parameter of the unit torus. The proof makes extensive use of previous results
by the contributors, and of recent annealed estimates on the Green's function by
Marahrens and the third contributor.
