In this paper we address the deadlock detection problem in the context of
SCOOP - an OO-programming model for concurrency, recently formalized in Maude.
We present the integration of a deadlock detection mechanism on top of the
aforementioned formalization and analyze how an abstract semantics of SCOOP
based on a notion of "may alias expressions" can contribute to improving the
deadlock detection procedure.
