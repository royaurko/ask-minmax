We determine the cup-length of some oriented Grassmann manifolds by finding a
Groebner basis associated with a certain subring of the cohomology of them. As
its applications, we provide not only a lower but also an upper bound for the
LS-category of some oriented Grassmann manifolds. We also study the immersion
problem of them.
