A generalisation of Waring's problem, considered first by Arkhipov and
Karatsuba, is the question of representing not an integer, but a given
polynomial, as a sum of powers of linear polynomials. We investigate a related
problem and prove a Hasse principle for the number of identical representations
of a set of given forms by homogeneous polynomials of general shape. The result
leads to sizeable improvements for estimates of the number of linear spaces on
the intersection of hypersurfaces.
