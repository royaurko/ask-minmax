Combined with other CMB experiments, the WMAP survey provides an accurate
estimate of the baryon density of the Universe. In the framework of the
standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), such a baryon density leads to
predictions for the primordial abundances of $^{4}$He and D in good agreement
with observations. However, it also leads to a significant discrepancy between
the predicted and observed primordial abundance of $^{7}$Li. Such a discrepancy
is often termed as 'the lithium problem'. In this paper, we analyze this
problem in the framework of scalar-tensor theories of gravity. It is shown that
an expansion of the Universe slightly slower than in General Relativity before
BBN, but faster during BBN, solves the lithium problem and leads to $^4$He and
D primordial abundances consistent with the observational constraints. This
kind of behavior is obtained in numerous scalar-tensor models, both with and
without a self-interaction potential for the scalar field. In models with a
self-interacting scalar field, the convergence towards General Relativity is
ensured without any condition, thanks to an attraction mechanism which starts
to work during the radiation-dominated epoch.
