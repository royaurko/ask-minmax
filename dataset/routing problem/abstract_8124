This paper presents a novel and straight formulation, and gives a complete
insight towards the understanding of the complexity of the problems of the so
called NP-Class. In particular, this paper focuses in the Searching of the
Optimal Geometrical Structures and the Travelling Salesman Problems. The main
results are the polynomial reduction procedure and the solution to the Noted
Conjecture of the NP-Class.
