The classical approach to diffusion processes is based on Fick's law that the
flux is proportional to the concentration gradient. Various phenomena occurring
during propagation of penetrating liquids in polymers show that this type of
diffusion exhibits anomalous behavior and contradicts the just mentioned law.
However, they can be explained in the framework of non-Fickian diffusion
theories based on viscoelasticity of polymers. Initial-boundary value problems
for viscoelastic diffusion equations have been studied by several contributors. Most
of the studies are devoted to the Dirichlet BVP (the concentration is given on
the boundary of the domain). In this chapter we study the second BVP, i.e. when
the normal component of the concentration flux is prescribed on the boundary,
which is more realistic in many physical situations. We establish existence of
weak solutions to this problem. We suggest some conditions on the coefficients
and boundary data under which all the solutions tend to the homogeneous state
as time goes to infinity.
