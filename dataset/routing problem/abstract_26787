In 1994, M. M. Popov [On integrability in F-spaces, Studia Math. no 3,
205-220] showed that the fundamental theorem of calculus fails, in general, for
functions mapping from a compact interval of the real line into the lp-spaces
for 0<p<1, and the question arose whether such a significant result might hold
in some non-Banach spaces. In this article we completely settle the problem by
proving that the fundamental theorem of calculus breaks down in the context of
any non-locally convex quasi-Banach space. Our approach introduces the tool of
Riemann-integral averages of continuous functions, and uses it to bring out to
light the differences in behavior of their approximates in the lack of local
convexity. As a by-product of our work we solve a problem raised in [F. Albiac
and J.L. Ansorena, Lipschitz maps and primitives for continuous functions in
quasi-Banach space, Nonlinear Anal. 75 (2012), no. 16, 6108-6119] on the
different types of spaces of differentiable functions with values on a
quasi-Banach space.
