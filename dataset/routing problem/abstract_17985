We consider N-body problems with homogeneous potential $1/r^{2\kappa}$ where
$\kappa\in(0,1)$, including the Newtonian case ($\kappa=1/2$). Given $R>0$ and
$T>0$, we find a uniform upper bound for the minimal action of paths binding in
time $T$ any two configurations which are contained in some ball of radius $R$.
Using cluster partitions, we obtain from these estimates H\"{o}lder regularity
of the critical action potential (i.e. of the minimal action of paths binding
in free time two configurations). As an application, we establish the weak KAM
theorem for these N-body problems, i.e. we prove the existence of fixed points
of the Lax-Oleinik semigroup and we show that they are global viscosity
solutions of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We also prove that
there are invariant solutions for the action of isometries on the configuration
space.
