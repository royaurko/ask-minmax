We investigate the various routes to spatiotemporal chaos in Kerr optical
frequency combs obtained through pumping an ultra-high quality
whispering-gallery mode resonator with a continuous-wave laser. The
Lugiato-Lefever model is used to build bifurcation diagrams with regards to the
parameters that are externally controllable, namely, the frequency and the
power of the pumping laser. We show that the spatiotemporal chaos emerging from
Turing patterns and solitons display distinctive dynamical features.
Experimental spectra of chaotic Kerr combs are also presented for both cases,
in excellent agreement with theoretical spectra.
