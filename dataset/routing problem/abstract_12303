Previous work has shown that the classification of indecomposable off-shell
representations of N-supersymmetry, depicted as Adinkras, may be factored into
specifying the topologies available to Adinkras, and then the
height-assignments for each topological type. The latter problem being solved
by a recursive mechanism that generates all height-assignments within a
topology, it remains to classify the former. Herein we show that this problem
is equivalent to classifying certain (1) graphs and (2) error-correcting codes.
