A technique using vector Slepian harmonics and multipole fields is presented
for a general treatment of the inverse problem of high numerical aperture
focusing. A prescribed intensity distribution or electric field distribution in
the focal volume is approximated using numerical optimization and the
corresponding illuminating field at the entrance pupil is constructed. Three
examples from the recent literature have been chosen to illustrate the method.
