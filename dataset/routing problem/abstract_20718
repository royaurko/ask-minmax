We summarize the main known results involving subword reversing, a method of
semigroup theory for constructing van Kampen diagrams by referring to a
preferred direction. In good cases, the method provides a powerful tool for
investigating presented (semi)groups. In particular, it leads to cancellativity
and embeddability criteria for monoids and to efficient solutions for the word
problem of monoids and groups of fractions.
