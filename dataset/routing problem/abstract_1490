We predict the stability of a new extended two-dimensional hydrocarbon on the
basis of first-principles total energy calculations. The compound that we call
graphane is a fully saturated hydrocarbon derived from a single graphene sheet
with formula CH. All of the carbon atoms are in sp3 hybridization forming a
hexagonal network and the hydrogen atoms are bonded to carbon on both sides of
the plane in an alternating manner. Graphane is predicted to be stable with a
binding energy comparable to other hydrocarbons such as benzene, cyclohexane,
and polyethylene. We discuss possible routes for synthesizing graphane and
potential applications as a hydrogen storage material and in two dimensional
electronics.
