The paper concerns nonlocal time-periodic boundary value problems for
first-order Volterra integro-differential hyperbolic systems with boundary
inputs. The systems are subjected to integral boundary conditions. Under
natural regularity assumptions on the data it is shown that the problems
display completely non-resonant behaviour and satisfy the Fredholm alternative
in the spaces of continuous and time-periodic functions.
