We consider the detection and initial guess problems for the LISA
gravitational wave detector. The detection problem is the problem of how to
determine if there is a signal present in instrumental data and how to identify
it. Because of the Doppler and plane-precession spreading of the spectral power
of the LISA signal, the usual power spectrum approach to detection will have
difficulty identifying sources. A better method must be found. The initial
guess problem involves how to generate {\it a priori} values for the parameters
of a parameter-estimation problem that are close enough to the final values for
a linear least-squares estimator to converge to the correct result. A useful
approach to simultaneously solving the detection and initial guess problems for
LISA is to divide the sky into many pixels and to demodulate the Doppler
spreading for each set of pixel coordinates. The demodulated power spectra may
then be searched for spectral features. We demonstrate that the procedure works
well as a first step in the search for gravitational waves from monochromatic
binaries.
