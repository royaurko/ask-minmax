We study an Achlioptas-process version of the random k-SAT process: a bounded
number of k-clauses are drawn uniformly at random at each step, and exactly one
added to the growing formula according to a particular rule. We prove the
existence of a rule that shifts the satisfiability threshold. This extends a
well-studied area of probabilistic combinatorics (Achlioptas processes) to
random CSP's. In particular, while a rule to delay the 2-SAT threshold was
known previously, this is the first proof of a rule to shift the threshold of
k-SAT for k >= 3.
  We then propose a gap decision problem based upon this semi-random model. The
aim of the problem is to investigate the hardness of the random k-SAT decision
problem, as opposed to the problem of finding an assignment or certificate of
unsatisfiability. Finally, we discuss connections to the study of Achlioptas
random graph processes.
