A promising way to reconcile naturalness with a decoupling solution to the
SUSY flavor and CP problems is suggested by models with a radiatively driven
inverted mass hierarchy (RIMH). The RIMH models arise naturally within the
context of SUSY SO(10) grand unified theories. In their original form, RIMH
models suffer from two problems: 1.) obtaining the radiative breakdown of
electroweak symmetry, and 2.) generating the correct masses for third
generation fermions. The first problem can be solved by the introduction of
SO(10) D-term contributions to scalar masses. We show that correct fermion
masses can indeed be obtained, but at the cost of limiting the magnitude of the
hierarchy that can be generated. We go on to compute predictions for the
neutralino relic density as well as for the rate for the decay $b\to s\gamma$,
and show that these yield significant constraints on model parameter space. We
show that only a tiny corner of model parameter space is accessible to Fermilab
Tevatron searches, assuming an integrated luminosity of 25~$fb^{-1}$. We also
quantify the reach of the CERN LHC collider for this class of models, and find
values of $m_{\tg}\sim 1600$ GeV to be accessible assuming just 10 fb$^{-1}$ of
integrated luminosity. In an Appendix, we list the two loop renormalization
group equations for the MSSM plus right handed neutrino model that we have used
in our analysis.
