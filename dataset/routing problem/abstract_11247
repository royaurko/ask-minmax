We review arguments for center dominance in center gauges where vortex
locations are correctly identified. We introduce an appealing interpretation of
the maximal center gauge, discuss problems with Gribov copies, and a cure to
the problems through the direct Laplacian center gauge. We study correlations
between direct and indirect Laplacian center gauges.
