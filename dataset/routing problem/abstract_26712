We reconsider the variational derivation of symplectic partitioned
Runge-Kutta schemes. Such type of variational integrators are of great
importance since they integrate mechanical systems with high order accuracy
while preserving the structural properties of these systems, like the
symplectic form, the evolution of the momentum maps or the energy behaviour.
Also they are easily applicable to optimal control problems based on mechanical
systems as proposed in Ober-Bl\"obaum et al. [2011].
  Following the same approach, we develop a family of variational integrators
to which we refer as symplectic Galerkin schemes in contrast to symplectic
partitioned Runge-Kutta. These two families of integrators are, in principle
and by construction, different one from the other. Furthermore, the symplectic
Galerkin family can as easily be applied in optimal control problems, for which
Campos et al. [2012b] is a particular case.
