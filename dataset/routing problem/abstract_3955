The so-called type problem or forcing problem is considered as a way to
generalize Sharkovskii's theorem. In this paper, by focusing on certain types
of orbits, we obtain a solution of the type problem, which gives a refinement
of Sharkovskii's theorem on orbit types characterized by two parameters.
