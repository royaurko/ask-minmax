We present Integer Linear Programming (ILP) Modulo Theories (IMT). An IMT
instance is an Integer Linear Programming instance, where some symbols have
interpretations in background theories. In previous work, the IMT approach has
been applied to industrial synthesis and design problems with real-time
constraints arising in the development of the Boeing 787. Many other problems
ranging from operations research to software verification routinely involve
linear constraints and optimization. Thus, a general ILP Modulo Theories
framework has the potential to be widely applicable. The logical next step in
the development of IMT and the main goal of this paper is to provide
theoretical underpinnings. This is accomplished by means of BC(T), the Branch
and Cut Modulo T abstract transition system. We show that BC(T) provides a
sound and complete optimization procedure for the ILP Modulo T problem, as long
as T is a decidable, stably-infinite theory. We compare a prototype of BC(T)
against leading SMT solvers.
