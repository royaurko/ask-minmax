We show how the static magnetic field of a finite source can be transferred
and routed to arbitrary long distances. This is achieved by using
transformation optics, which results in a device made of a material with a
highly anisotropic magnetic permeability. We show that a simplified version of
the device, made by a superconducting-ferromagnet hybrid, also leads to an
excellent transfer of the magnetic field. The latter is demonstrated with a
proof-of-principle experiment where a ferromagnet tube coated with a
superconductor improves the transfer of static magnetic fields with respect to
conventional methods by a 400\% factor over distances of 14cm.
