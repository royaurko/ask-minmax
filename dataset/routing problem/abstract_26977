We investigate a two scalar fields split braneworld model which leads to a
possible approach to the hierarchy problem within the thick brane scenario. The
model exhibits a resulting asymmetric warp factor suitable for this purpose.
The solution is obtained by means of the orbit equation approach for a specific
value of one of the parameters. Besides, we analyze the model qualitative
behaviour for arbitrary parameters by inspecting the underlying dynamical
system defined by the equations which give rise to the braneworld model. We
finalize commenting on the metric fluctuation and stability issues.
