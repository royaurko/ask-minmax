The problem of stationary robust L_infinity-induced deconvolution filtering
for the uncertain continuous-time linear stochastic systems is addressed. The
state space model of the system contains state- and input-dependent noise and
deterministic parameter uncertainties residing in a given polytope. In the
presence of input-dependent noise, we extend the derived lemma in Berman and
Shaked (2010) characterizing the induced L_infinity norm by linear matrix
inequalities (LMIs), according to which we solve the deconvolution problem in
the quadratic framework. By decoupling product terms between the Lyapunov
matrix and system matrices, an improved version of the proposed
L_infinity-induced norm bound lemma for continuous-time stochastic systems is
obtained, which allows us to realize exploit parameter-dependent stability idea
in the deconvolution filter design. The theories presented are utilized for
sensor fault reconstruction in uncertain linear stochastic systems. The
effectiveness and advantages of the proposed design methods are shown via two
numerical examples.
