In this paper, we present a new smoothing approach to solve general nonlinear
complementarity problems. Under the $P_0$ condition on the original problems,
we prove some existence and convergence results . We also present an error
estimate under a new and general monotonicity condition. The numerical tests
confirm the efficiency of our proposed methods.
