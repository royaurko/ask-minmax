This paper surveys some recent results about Fourier--Mukai functors. In
particular, given an exact functor between the bounded derived categories of
coherent sheaves on two smooth projective varieties, we deal with the question
whether this functor is of Fourier--Mukai type. Several related questions are
answered and many open problems are stated.
