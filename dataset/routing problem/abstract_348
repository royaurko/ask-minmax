We study the admission control problem in general networks. Communication
requests arrive over time, and the online algorithm accepts or rejects each
request while maintaining the capacity limitations of the network. The
admission control problem has been usually analyzed as a benefit problem, where
the goal is to devise an online algorithm that accepts the maximum number of
requests possible. The problem with this objective function is that even
algorithms with optimal competitive ratios may reject almost all of the
requests, when it would have been possible to reject only a few. This could be
inappropriate for settings in which rejections are intended to be rare events.
  In this paper, we consider preemptive online algorithms whose goal is to
minimize the number of rejected requests. Each request arrives together with
the path it should be routed on. We show an $O(\log^2 (mc))$-competitive
randomized algorithm for the weighted case, where $m$ is the number of edges in
the graph and $c$ is the maximum edge capacity. For the unweighted case, we
give an $O(\log m \log c)$-competitive randomized algorithm. This settles an
open question of Blum, Kalai and Kleinberg raised in \cite{BlKaKl01}. We note
that allowing preemption and handling requests with given paths are essential
for avoiding trivial lower bounds.
