In this text, I will suggest an electroencephalogram (EEG) experiment with
which it will be possible to see whether there is biological evidence for the
frequently made distinction between insight and noninsight problems. What is
meant with insight here is the 'aha'-experience, the sudden discovery of how a
problem works. First, I will give a summary of the research done by Auke Pols
in his thesis 'Insight in problem solving' (Pols, 2002), an introductory text
on insight. This part of this text consists of an overview of the questions
Pols asks himself, the answers to these questions, and the methods he uses to
find them. Secondly, I will formulate my own research question, and propose the
methods with which I want to answer this question.
