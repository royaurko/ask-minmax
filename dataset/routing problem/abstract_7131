We present an efficient algorithm for simultaneously training sparse
generalized linear models across many related problems, which may arise from
bootstrapping, cross-validation and nonparametric permutation testing. Our
approach leverages the redundancies across problems to obtain significant
computational improvements relative to solving the problems sequentially by a
conventional algorithm. We demonstrate our fast simultaneous training of
generalized linear models (FaSTGLZ) algorithm on a number of real-world
datasets, and we run otherwise computationally intensive bootstrapping and
permutation test analyses that are typically necessary for obtaining
statistically rigorous classification results and meaningful interpretation.
