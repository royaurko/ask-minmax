In this paper we investigate the relationship between stabilized and enriched
finite element formulations for the Stokes problem. We also present a new
stabilized mixed formulation for which the stability parameter is derived
purely by the method of weighted residuals. This new formulation allows equal
order interpolation for the velocity and pressure fields. Finally, we show by
counterexample that a direct equivalence between subgrid-based stabilized
finite element methods and Galerkin methods enriched by bubble functions cannot
be constructed for quadrilateral and hexahedral elements using standard bubble
functions.
