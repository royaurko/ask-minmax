We obtain strong and uniform asymptotics in every domain of the complex plane
for the scaled polynomials $a (3nz)$, $b (3nz)$, and $c (3nz)$ where $a$, $b$,
and $c$ are the type II Hermite-Pad\'e approximants to the exponential function
of respective degrees $2n+2$, $2n$ and $2n$, defined by $a (z)e^{-z}-b (z)=\O
(z^{3n+2})$ and $a (z)e^{z}-c (z)={\O}(z^{3n+2})$ as $z\to 0$. Our analysis
relies on a characterization of these polynomials in terms of a $3\times 3$
matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem which, as a consequence of the famous Mahler
relations, corresponds by a simple transformation to a similar Riemann-Hilbert
problem for type I Hermite-Pad\'e approximants. Due to this relation, the study
that was performed in previous work, based on the Deift-Zhou steepest descent
method for Riemann-Hilbert problems, can be reused to establish our present
results.
