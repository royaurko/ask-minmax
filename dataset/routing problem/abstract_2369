We unveil novel spin textures in an itinerant fermion model on a frustrated
triangular lattice in the limit of low electronic density. Using hybrid Monte
Carlo simulations on finite clusters we identify two type of nanoscale spin
textures in the background of 120 degree order : (i) a planar ferromagnetic
cluster, and (ii) and a non-coplanar cluster with spins oriented perpendicular
to the 120 degree plane. Both these textures lead to localization of the
electronic wavefunctions and are in-turn stabilized by the concomitant charge
modulations. The non-coplanar spin texture is accompanied by an unusual scalar
chirality pattern. A well defined electric charge and magnetic moment
associated with these textures allow for their easy manipulation by external
electric and magnetic fields - a desirable feature for data storage. We
identify a localization-delocalization behavior for electronic wavefunctions
which is unique to frustrated magnets, and propose a general framework for
stabilizing similar spin textures in spin-charge coupled systems.
