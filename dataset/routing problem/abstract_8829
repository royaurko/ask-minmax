By introducing a new point of view in Algebraic Topology relating elliptic
curves in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and suitable bordism groups, the congruent number
problem is solved showing that the Tunnell's theorem is also sufficient. This
could be considered also an indirect proof that the Birch Swinnerton-Dyer
conjecture is true.
