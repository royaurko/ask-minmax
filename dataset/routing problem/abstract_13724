It is well known that, given a Yang-Baxter map, there is a hierarchy of
commuting transfer maps, which arise out of the consideration of initial value
problems. In this paper, we show that one can construct invariants of the
transfer maps corresponding to the $n$-periodic initial value problem on the
two-dimensional lattice, using the same generating function that is used to
produce invariants of the Yang-Baxter map itself. Moreover, we discuss the
Liouville integrability of these transfer maps. Finally, we consider
four-dimensional Yang-Baxter maps corresponding to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger
(NLS) equation and the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger (DNLS) equation which
have recently appeared. We show that the associated transfer maps are
completely integrable.
