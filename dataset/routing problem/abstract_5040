We note that the same mathematical results apply to problems involving
quasispin and isospin, but the problems per se are different. In the quasispin
case, one deals with a system of identical fermions (e.g. neutrons) and address
the problem of how many seniority conserving interactions there are. In the
isospin case, one deals with a system of both neutrons and protons and the
problem in question is the number of neutron-proton pairs with a given total
angular momentum. Other companion problems are also discussed.
