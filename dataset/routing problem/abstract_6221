We have reexamined the possibility of explaining the solar neutrino problem
through long-wavelength neutrino oscillations induced by a tiny breakdown of
the weak equivalence principle of general relativity. We found that such
gravitationally induce oscillations can provide a viable solution to the solar
neutrino problem.
