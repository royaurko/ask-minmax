Computing the similarity between two protein structures is a crucial task in
molecular biology, and has been extensively investigated. Many protein
structure comparison methods can be modeled as maximum clique problems in
specific k-partite graphs, referred here as alignment graphs. In this paper, we
propose a new protein structure comparison method based on internal distances
(DAST) which is posed as a maximum clique problem in an alignment graph. We
also design an algorithm (ACF) for solving such maximum clique problems. ACF is
first applied in the context of VAST, a software largely used in the National
Center for Biotechnology Information, and then in the context of DAST. The
obtained results on real protein alignment instances show that our algorithm is
more than 37000 times faster than the original VAST clique solver which is
based on Bron & Kerbosch algorithm. We furthermore compare ACF with one of the
fastest clique finder, recently conceived by Ostergard. On a popular benchmark
(the Skolnick set) we observe that ACF is about 20 times faster in average than
the Ostergard's algorithm.
