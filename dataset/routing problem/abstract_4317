A group is called capable if it is a central factor group. We consider the
capability of finite groups of class two and exponent $p$, $p$ an odd prime. We
restate the problem of capability as a problem about linear transformations,
which may be checked explicitly for any specific instance of the problem. We
use this restatement to derive some known results, and prove new ones. Among
them, we reduce the general problem to an oft-considered special case, and
prove that a 3-generated group of class 2 and exponent $p$ is either cyclic or
capable.
