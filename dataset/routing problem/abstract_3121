In this paper we prove the universality of covariance matrices of the form
$H_{N\times N}={X}^{\dagger}X$ where $X$ is an ${M\times N}$ rectangular matrix
with independent real valued entries $x_{ij}$ satisfying $\mathbb{E}x_{ij}=0$
and $\mathbb{E}x^2_{ij}={\frac{1}{M}}$, $N$, $M\to \infty$. Furthermore it is
assumed that these entries have sub-exponential tails or sufficiently high
number of moments. We will study the asymptotics in the regime
$N/M=d_N\in(0,\infty),\lim_{N\to\infty}d_N\neq0,\infty$. Our main result is the
edge universality of the sample covariance matrix at both edges of the
spectrum. In the case $\lim_{N\to\infty}d_N=1$, we only focus on the largest
eigenvalue. Our proof is based on a novel version of the Green function
comparison theorem for data matrices with dependent entries. En route to
proving edge universality, we establish that the Stieltjes transform of the
empirical eigenvalue distribution of $H$ is given by the Marcenko-Pastur law
uniformly up to the edges of the spectrum with an error of order $(N\eta)^{-1}$
where $\eta$ is the imaginary part of the spectral parameter in the Stieltjes
transform. Combining these results with existing techniques we also show bulk
universality of covariance matrices. All our results hold for both real and
complex valued entries.
