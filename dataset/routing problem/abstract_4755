In this paper, we consider an NP-hard problem of scheduling a set of jobs of
equal processing time on two machines, given a partial precedence order on the
set of jobs, with an objective to minimize the makespan. An approximation
algorithm is proposed for this problem with a tight approximation bound.
Polynomial solvability of the problem is proved in the case when each job on
the first machine is in precedence relation with two jobs on the second
machine.
