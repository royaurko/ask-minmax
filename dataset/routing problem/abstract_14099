A model of a multilayer device with non-trivial geometrical and material
structure and its working process is suggested. The thermal behavior of the
device as one principle characteristic is simulated. The algorithm for solving
the non-stationary heat conduction problem with a time-dependent periodical
heating source is suggested. The algorithm is based on finite difference
explicit-implicit method. The OpenCL realization of the algorithm is discussed.
The results show that the chosen characteristics of the device configuration
are suitable for the working requirements for application.
