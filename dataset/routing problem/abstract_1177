We introduce a novel hybrid metal-dielectric nanoantenna composed of
dielectric (crystalline silicon) and metal (silver) nanoparticles. A
high-permittivity dielectric nanoparticle allows to achieve effective light
harvesting, and nonlinearity of a metal nanoparticle controls the radiation
direction. We show that the radiation pattern of such a nanoantenna can be
switched between the forward and backward directions by varying only the light
intensity around the level of 11 MW/cm$^2$, with the characteristic switching
time of 260 fs.
