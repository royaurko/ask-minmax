We investigate the influence of aperiodic perturbations on the critical
behaviour at a second order phase transition. The bond and site problems are
compared for layered systems and aperiodic sequences generated through
substitution. In the bond problem, the interactions between the layers are
distributed according to an aperiodic sequence whereas in the site problem, the
layers themselves follow the sequence. A relevance-irrelevance criterion
introduced by Luck for the bond problem is extended to discuss the site
problem. It involves a wandering exponent for pairs, which can be larger than
the one considered before in the bond problem. The surface magnetization of the
layered two-dimensional Ising model is obtained, in the extreme anisotropic
limit, for the period-doubling and Thue-Morse sequences.
