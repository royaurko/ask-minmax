Wireless network virtualization enables multiple virtual wireless networks to
coexist on shared physical infrastructure. However, one of the main challenges
is the problem of assigning the physical resources to virtual networks in an
efficient manner. Although some work has been done on solving the embedding
problem for wireless networks, few solutions are applicable to dynamic networks
with changing traffic patterns. In this paper we propose a dynamic greedy
embedding algorithm for wireless virtualization. Virtual networks can be
re-embedded dynamically using this algorithm, enabling increased resource usage
and lower rejection rates. We compare the dynamic greedy algorithm to a static
embedding algorithm and also to its dynamic version. We show that the dynamic
algorithms provide increased performance to previous methods using simulated
traffic. In addition we formulate the embedding problem with multiple priority
levels for the static and dynamic case.
