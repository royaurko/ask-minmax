One of the solutions to the cosmological Polonyi problem is to introduce a
large coupling between the Polonyi field and the inflaton so that the Polonyi
field adiabatically tracks the temporal minimum of the potential. We study
general conditions for the adiabatic suppression mechanism to work, and find
that a non-negligible amount of the Polonyi field is induced in the form of
coherent oscillations at the end of inflation. In the case of low reheating
temperature, this contribution is so small that it does not cause cosmological
problems. On the other hand, this contribution may be significant for a
relatively high reheating temperature and we still need some amount of tuning
in order to avoid the Polonyi problem. We also point out that Polonyi particles
produced from thermal plasma pose a severe constraint on the reheating
temperature. Furthermore, we extend the original framework to include enhanced
couplings of the Polonyi field with the visible particles as well as with
itself, and derive upper bounds on the reheating temperature after inflation.
We also investigate the adiabatic solution to the cosmological moduli problem
in gauge and anomaly mediation.
