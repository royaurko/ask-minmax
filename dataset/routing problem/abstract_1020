As a by-product of a finite-size Bethe Ansatz calculation in statistical
mechanics, Doochul Kim has established, by an indirect route, three
mathematical identities rather similar to the conjugate modulus relations
satisfied by the elliptic theta constants. However, they contain factors like
$1 - q^{\sqrt{n}}$ and $1 - q^{n^2}$, instead of $1 - q^n$. We show here that
there is a fourth relation that naturally completes the set, in much the same
way that there are four relations for the four elliptic theta functions. We
derive all of them directly by proving and using a specialization of
Weierstrass' factorization theorem in complex variable theory.
