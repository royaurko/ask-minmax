An efficient method has been developed for solving the inverse problem of
Doppler-Zeeman mapping of magnetic, chemically peculiar stars. A regularized
iteration method is used to simultaneously solve the integral equations for the
Stokes I, V, Q and U parameters. The validity of analytical fits to the local
profiles of the Stokes parameters is substantiated. The algorithm had been
tested on models and makes it possible to obtain simultaneously, from the
observed Stokes profiles, a map of the distribution of a chemical element and
the parameters of an arbitrarily shifted magnetic dipole.
