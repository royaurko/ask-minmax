The Shortest Path Reconfiguration problem has as input a graph G (with unit
edge lengths) with vertices s and t, and two shortest st-paths P and Q. The
question is whether there exists a sequence of shortest st-paths that starts
with P and ends with Q, such that subsequent paths differ in only one vertex.
This is called a rerouting sequence.
  This problem is shown to be PSPACE-complete. For claw-free graphs and chordal
graphs, it is shown that the problem can be solved in polynomial time, and that
shortest rerouting sequences have linear length. For these classes, it is also
shown that deciding whether a rerouting sequence exists between all pairs of
shortest st-paths can be done in polynomial time. Finally, a polynomial time
algorithm for counting the number of isolated paths is given.
