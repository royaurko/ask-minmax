We consider a problem of identification of point sources in time dependent
advection-diffusion systems with a non-linear reaction term. The linear
counterpart of the problem in question can be reduced to solving a system of
non-linear algebraic equations via the use of adjoint equations. We extend this
approach by constructing an algorithm that solves the problem iteratively to
account for the non-linearity of the reaction term. We study the question of
improving the quality of source identification by adding more measurements
adaptively using the solution obtained previously with a smaller number of
measurements.
