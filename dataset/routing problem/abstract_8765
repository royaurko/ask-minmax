We consider phaseless inverse scattering for the Schr\"odinger equation with
compactly supported potential in dimension $d\ge 2$. We give explicit formulas
for solving this problem from appropriate data at high energies. As a
corollary, we give also a global uniqueness result for this problem with
appropriate data on a fixed energy neighborhood.
