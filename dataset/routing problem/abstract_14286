We study the inverse problems for the second order hyperbolic equations of
general form with time-dependent coefficients assuming that the boundary data
are given on a part of the boundary. The approach of this paper is a variant of
the Boundary Control (BC) method developed in [E1], [E2]. We extend the results
and simplify the proofs of contributor's earlier works [E1], [E2], [E3], [E4] to the
general case of arbitrary Lorentzian time-dependent metrics.
