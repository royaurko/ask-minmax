The problem of errors, arising due to finite BPM resolution, in the
difference orbit parameters, which are found as a least squares fit to the BPM
data, is one of the standard and important problems of accelerator physics.
Even so for the case of transversely uncoupled motion the covariance matrix of
reconstruction errors can be calculated "by hand", the direct usage of obtained
solution, as a tool for designing of a "good measurement system", does not look
to be fairly straightforward. It seems that a better understanding of the
nature of the problem is still desirable. We make a step in this direction
introducing dynamic into this problem, which at the first glance seems to be
static. We consider a virtual beam consisting of virtual particles obtained as
a result of application of reconstruction procedure to "all possible values" of
BPM reading errors. This beam propagates along the beam line according to the
same rules as any real beam and has all beam dynamical characteristics, such as
emittances, energy spread, dispersions, betatron functions and etc. All these
values become the properties of the BPM measurement system. One can compare two
BPM systems comparing their error emittances and rms error energy spreads, or,
for a given measurement system, one can achieve needed balance between
coordinate and momentum reconstruction errors by matching the error betatron
functions in the point of interest to the desired values.
