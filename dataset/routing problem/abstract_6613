I present a motivation of several areas where the Multigrid techniques can be
employed. I present typical areas where the multigrid solver might be employed.
I give an introduction to smoothers and how one might choose a preconditionor
as well as an introduction of the Multigrid technique used. Then I do a study
of the Multigrid technique while adjusting the environment conditions of the
solver and the problem such as anisotropies, the grid-levels used, the
preconditionor smoothing steps, the coordinate system and the start vector. The
problem solved here was a simple Poisson problem. The Multigrid program used an
F-cycle in this paper. I include performance study sections displaying results
of the solver behavior under the different conditions.
