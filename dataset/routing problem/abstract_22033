We elucidate consistency of the so-called corner equations which are
elementary building blocks of Euler-Lagrange equations for two-dimensional
pluri-Lagrangian problems. We show that their consistency can be derived from
the existence of two independent octahedron relations. We give explicit
formulas for octahedron relations in terms of corner equations.
