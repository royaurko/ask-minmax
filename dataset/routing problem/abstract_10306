We consider the online machine minimization problem in which jobs with hard
deadlines arrive online over time at their release dates. The task is to
determine a feasible schedule on a minimum number of machines. Our main result
is a general O(m^2 log m)-competitive algorithm for the preemptive online
problem, where m is the optimal number of machines used in an offline solution.
This is the first improvement on an O(log (p_max/p_min))-competitive algorithm
by Phillips et al. (STOC 1997), which was to date the best known algorithm even
when m=2. Our algorithm is O(1)-competitive for any m that is bounded by a
constant. To develop the algorithm, we investigate two complementary special
cases of the problem, namely, laminar instances and agreeable instances, for
which we provide an O(log m)-competitive and an O(1)-competitive algorithm,
respectively. Our O(1)-competitive algorithm for agreeable instances actually
produces a non-preemptive schedule, which is of its own interest as there
exists a strong lower bound of n, the number of jobs, for the general
non-preemptive online machine minimization problem by Saha (FSTTCS 2013), which
even holds for laminar instances.
