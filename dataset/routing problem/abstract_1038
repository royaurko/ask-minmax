Iron perovskites CaFeO_3 and La_{0.33}Sr_{0.67}FeO_3 show charge
disproportionation, resulting in charge-ordered states with Fe^{3+}:Fe^{5+}
=1:1 and =2:1, respectively. We have made photoemission and unrestricted
Hartree-Fock band-structure calculation of CaFeO_3 and compared it with
La_{0.33}Sr_{0.67}FeO_3. With decreasing temperature, a gradual decrease of the
spectral weight near the Fermi level occurred in CaFeO_3 as in
La_{0.33}Sr_{0.67}FeO_3 although lattice distortion occurs only in CaFeO_3.
Hartree-Fock calculations have indicated that both the breathing and tilting
distortions are necessary to induce the charge disproportionation in CaFeO_3,
while no lattice distortion is necessary for the charge disproportionation in
La_{0.33}Sr_{0.67}FeO_3.
