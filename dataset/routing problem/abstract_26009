Given a polynomial $x \in {\mathbb R}^n \mapsto p(x)$ in $n=2$ variables, a
symbolic-numerical algorithm is first described for detecting whether the
connected component of the plane sublevel set ${\mathcal P} = \{x : p(x) \geq
0\}$ containing the origin is rigidly convex, or equivalently, whether it has a
linear matrix inequality (LMI) representation, or equivalently, if polynomial
$p(x)$ is hyperbolic with respect to the origin. The problem boils down to
checking whether a univariate polynomial matrix is positive semidefinite, an
optimization problem that can be solved with eigenvalue decomposition. When the
variety ${\mathcal C} = \{x : p(x) = 0\}$ is an algebraic curve of genus zero,
a second algorithm based on B\'ezoutians is proposed to detect whether
$\mathcal P$ has an LMI representation and to build such a representation from
a rational parametrization of $\mathcal C$. Finally, some extensions to
positive genus curves and to the case $n>2$ are mentioned.
