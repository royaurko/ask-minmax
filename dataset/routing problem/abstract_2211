In recent years, mobility models have been reconsidered based on findings by
analyzing some big datasets collected by GPS sensors, cellphone call records,
and Geotagging. To understand the fundamental statistical properties of the
frequency of serendipitous human encounters, we conducted experiments to
collect long-term data on human contact using short-range wireless
communication devices which many people frequently carry in daily life. By
analyzing the data we showed that the majority of human encounters occur
once-in-an-experimental-period: they are Ichi-go Ichi-e. We also found that the
remaining more frequent encounters obey a power-law distribution: they are
scale-free. To theoretically find the origin of these properties, we introduced
as a minimal human mobility model, Homesick L\'evy walk, where the walker
stochastically selects moving long distances as well as L\'evy walk or
returning back home. Using numerical simulations and a simple mean-field
theory, we offer a theoretical explanation for the properties to validate the
mobility model. The proposed model is helpful for evaluating long-term
performance of routing protocols in delay tolerant networks and mobile
opportunistic networks better since some utility-based protocols select nodes
with frequent encounters for message transfer.
