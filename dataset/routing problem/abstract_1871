The Fermi velocity is one of the key concepts in the study of a material, as
it bears information on a variety of fundamental properties. Upon increasing
demand on the device applications, graphene is viewed as a prototypical system
for engineering Fermi velocity. Indeed, several efforts have succeeded in
modifying Fermi velocity by varying charge carrier concentration. Here we
present a powerful but simple new way to engineer Fermi velocity while holding
the charge carrier concentration constant. We find that when the environment
embedding graphene is modified, the Fermi velocity of graphene is (i) inversely
proportional to its dielectric constant, reaching ~2.5$\times10^6$ m/s, the
highest value for graphene on any substrate studied so far and (ii) clearly
distinguished from an ordinary Fermi liquid. The method demonstrated here
provides a new route toward Fermi velocity engineering in a variety of
two-dimensional electron systems including topological insulators.
