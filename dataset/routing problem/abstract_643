Deployment of multimedia applications warrants provisioning of Quality of
Service (QoS) in MANET. However, limited battery power, other resource
constraints and mobility of nodes make QoS provisioning difficult to achieve in
MANET. This difficulty can be overcome by using a cross-layer approach for
routing. In [1] Patil et al., proposed a cross-layer routing protocol named
Cost Based Power Aware Cross Layer - AODV (CPACL-AODV) which overcomes the
limitation of battery power of nodes. Though many similar energy efficient and
cross-layer routing protocols have been proposed for MANET, none of them
handles QoS. A novel MANET routing protocol, Type of Service, Power and
Bandwidth Aware AODV (TSPBA-AODV), which overcomes resource constraints and
simultaneously provides QoS guarantees using a cross-layer approach, is
proposed in this paper. In addition the effect of variation in nodes' mobility
on performance of TSPBA-AODV is compared with that of CPACL-AODV [1] for two
different types of network traffic. As shown by the results of simulations
performed, TSPBA-AODV performs better than CPACL-AODV for MANET in which nodes
move with small speeds (speeds up to 40 Km/hr approx.). In addition the effect
of variation in data sending rate of nodes on performance of the protocols is
also studied. As shown by the results of simulations performed, TSPBA-AODV
performs better than CPACL-AODV for all variations in data sending rate of
nodes.
