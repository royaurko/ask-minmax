Parity violation in a chiral, four-atom molecule is discussed. Given the
geometrical positions of the four atoms, we calculate the anapole moment of it.
This problem was first discussed by Khriplovich and Pospelov. We give a
detailed derivation for it so that it can be more accessible to wider range of
scientists. We also correct errors in their results.
