Although Quantum field theory has been very successful in explaining
experiment, there are two aspects of the theory that remain quite troubling.
One is the no-interaction result proved in Haag's theorem. The other is the
existence of infinite perturbation expansion terms that need to be absorbed
into theoretically unknown but experimentally measurable quantities like charge
and mass -- i.e. renormalization. Here it will be shown that the two problems
may be related. A "natural" method of eliminating the renormalization problem
also sidesteps Haag's theorem automatically. Existing renormalization schemes
can at best be considered a temporary fix as perturbation theory assumes
expansion terms to be "small" -- and infinite terms are definitely not so (even
if they are renormalized away). String theories may be expected to help the
situation because the infinities can be traced to the point-nature of
particles. However, string theories have their own problems arising from the
extra space dimensions required. Here a more directly physical remedy is
suggested. Particles are modeled as extended objects (like strings). But,
unlike strings, they are composites of a finite number of constituents each of
which resides in the normal 4-dimensional space-time. The constituents are
bound together by a manifestly covariant confining potential. This approach no
longer requires infinite renormalizations. At the same time it sidesteps the
no-interaction result proved in Haag's theorem.
