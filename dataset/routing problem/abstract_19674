We report the consequences of a destabilization process on a simulated
General Purpose Analog Computer. This new technology overcomes problems linked
with serial ambiguity, and provides an analog bias to encode algorithms whose
complexity is over polynomial. We also implicitly demonstrate how
countermesures of the Stochastic Aperture Degeneracy could efficiently reach
higher computational classes, and would open a road towards Analog Reverse Time
Computation.
