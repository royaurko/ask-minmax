We report a strategy based on introduction of point defects for improving the
thermoelectric properties of FeSb2, a promising candidate for low temperature
applications. Introduction of Sb deficiency to the tune of 20% leads to
enhancement in the values of electrical conductivity ({\sigma}) and Seebeck
coefficient (S) accompanied with a concomitant suppression in lattice thermal
conductivity (\k{appa}lat) values in samples prepared using conventional solid
state reaction route. These observations in polycrystalline FeSb2-x provides
ample motivation for a dedicated exploration of thermoelectric behavior of the
corresponding single crystalline as well as hot-pressed polycrystalline
counterparts.
