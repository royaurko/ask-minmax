Sensitivity conjecture is a longstanding and fundamental open problem in the
area of complexity measures of Boolean functions and decision tree complexity.
The conjecture postulates that the maximum sensitivity of a Boolean function is
polynomially related to other major complexity measures. Despite much attention
to the problem and major advances in analysis of Boolean functions in the past
decade, the problem remains wide open with no positive result toward the
conjecture since the work of Kenyon and Kutin from 2004.
  In this work, we present new upper bounds for various complexity measures in
terms of sensitivity improving the bounds provided by Kenyon and Kutin.
Specifically, we show that deg(f)^{1-o(1)}=O(2^{s(f)}) and C(f) < 2^{s(f)-1}
s(f); these in turn imply various corollaries regarding the relation between
sensitivity and other complexity measures, such as block sensitivity, via known
results. The gap between sensitivity and other complexity measures remains
exponential but these results are the first improvement for this difficult
problem that has been achieved in a decade.
