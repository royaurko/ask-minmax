We obtain a large deviation principle describing the small time asymptotics
of the solution of a stochastic evolution equation with multiplicative noise.
Our assumptions are a condition on the linear drift operator that is satisfied
by generators of analytic semigroups and Lipschitz continuity of the nonlinear
drift and dispersion coefficients. Methods originally used by Szymon Peszat for
the small noise asymptotics problem are adapted to solve the small time
asymptotics problem.
