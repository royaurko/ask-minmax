We prove a uniqueness theorem for an inverse boundary value problem for the
Maxwell system with boundary data assumed known only in part of the bound- ary.
We assume that the inaccessible part of the boundary is either part of a plane,
or part of a sphere. This work generalizes the results obtained by Isakov for
the Schr\"odinger equation to Maxwell equations.
