Computing the winning set for B{\"u}chi objectives in alternating games on
graphs is a central problem in computer aided verification with a large number
of applications. The long standing best known upper bound for solving the
problem is $\tilde{O}(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices and $m$
is the number of edges in the graph. We are the first to break the
$\tilde{O}(n\cdot m)$ bound by presenting a new technique that reduces the
running time to $O(n^2)$. This bound also leads to an $O(n^2)$ algorithm time
for computing the set of almost-sure winning vertices in alternating games with
probabilistic transitions (improving an earlier bound of $\tilde{O}(n\cdot m)$)
and in concurrent graph games with constant actions (improving an earlier bound
of $O(n^3)$). We also show that the same technique can be used to compute the
maximal end-component decomposition of a graph in time $O(n^2)$. Finally, we
show how to maintain the winning set for B{\"u}chi objectives in alternating
games under a sequence of edge insertions or a sequence of edge deletions in
O(n) amortized time per operation. This is the first dynamic algorithm for this
problem.
