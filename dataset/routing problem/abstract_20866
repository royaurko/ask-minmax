In this work we consider viscosity solutions to second order partial
differential equations on Riemannian manifolds. We prove maximum principles for
solutions to Dirichlet problem on a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary.
Using a different method, we generalize maximum principles of Omori and Yau to
a viscosity version.
