Using direct numerical simulations we study dynamo action under the
Taylor-Green forcing with Prandtl number less than one. We observe bistability
with a weak magnetic field branch and a strong magnetic field branch. Both the
dynamo branches undergo subcritical dynamo transition. We also observe host of
dynamo states including constant, periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic magnetic
fields. One of the chaotic state originates through a quasiperiodic route with
phase locking, while another chaotic attractor appears to follow
Newhouse-Ruelle-Takens route to chaos. We also observe intermittent transitions
among quasiperiodic and chaotic states for a given Taylor-Green forcing.
