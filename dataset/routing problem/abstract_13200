This paper is devoted to the investigation of the energy-momentum problem in
two theories, i.e., General Relativity and teleparallel gravity. We use
Einstein, Landau-Lifshitz, Bergmann-Thomson and M\"{o}ller's prescriptions to
evaluate energy-momentum distribution of Bell-Szekeres metric in both the
theories. It is shown that these prescriptions give the same energy-momentum
density components in both General Relativity and teleparallel theory.
M\"{o}ller's prescription yields constant energy in both the theories.
