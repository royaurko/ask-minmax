A simple, yet efficient procedure to solve quasistatic problems of special
linear visco-elastic solids at small strains with equal rheological response in
all tensorial components, utilizing boundary element method (BEM), is
introduced. This procedure is based on the implicit discretisation in time (the
so-called Rothe method) combined with a simple "algebraic" transformation of
variables, leading to a numerically stable procedure (proved explicitly by
discrete energy estimates), which can be easily implemented in a BEM code to
solve initial-boundary value visco-elastic problems by using the Kelvin
elastostatic fundamental solution only. It is worth mentioning that no inverse
Laplace transform is required here. The formulation is straightforward for both
2D and 3D problems involving unilateral frictionless contact. Although the
focus is to the simplest Kelvin-Voigt rheology, a generalization to Maxwell,
Boltzmann, Jeffreys, and Burgers rheologies is proposed, discussed, and
implemented in the BEM code too. A few 2D and 3D initial-boundary value
problems, one of them with unilateral frictionless contact, are solved
numerically.
