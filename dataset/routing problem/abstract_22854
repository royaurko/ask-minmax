The exact ground state of four electrons in an arbitrary large two leg
Hubbard ladder is deduced from nine analytic and explicit linear equations. The
used procedure is described, and the properties of the ground state are
analyzed. The method is based on the construction in r-space of the different
type of orthogonal basis wave vectors which span the subspace of the Hilbert
space containing the ground state. In order to do this, we start from the
possible microconfigurations of the four particles within the system. These
microconfigurations are then rotated, translated and spin-reversed in order to
build up the basis vectors of the problem. A closed system of nine analytic
linear equations is obtained whose secular equation, by its minimum energy
solution, provides the ground state energy and the ground state wave function
of the model.
