The two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the interface between LaAlO$_3$
(LAO) and SrTiO$_3$ (STO) has become one of the most fascinating and
highly-debated oxide systems of recent times. Here we propose that a
one-dimensional electron gas (1DEG) can be engineered at the step edges of the
LAO/STO interface. These predictions are supported by first principles
calculations and electrostatic modeling which elucidate the origin of the 1DEG
as an electronic reconstruction to compensate a net surface charge in the step
edge. The results suggest a novel route to increasing the functional density in
these electronic interfaces.
