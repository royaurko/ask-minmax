We give an explicit recursive presentation for Mihailova's subgroup $M(H)$ of
$F_n \times F_n$ corresponding to a finite, concise and Peiffer aspherical
presentation $H=< x_1,..., x_n \mid R_1,..., R_m>$. This partially answers a
question of R.I. Grigorchuk, [8, Problem 4.14]. As a corollary, we construct a
finitely generated recursively presented orbit undecidable subgroup of
$Aut(F_3)$.
