In the paper, we consider the Cauchy problem for a fifth order
pseudoparabolic equation that appears in studying the issues of fluid
filtration in fissured media, the moisture transfer in soils and etc. The
Cauchy problem with non-classic conditions not requiring the agreement
conditions are studied for a discontinuous coefficient pseudoparabolic
equation. The equivalence of these conditions with the Cauchy classic condition
is substantiated in the case when the solution of the stated problem is sought
in S.L.Sobolev anisotropic space.
