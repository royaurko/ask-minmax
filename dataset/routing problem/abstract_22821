The aim of this study is to analyze the properties of harmonic fields in the
vicinity of rough boundaries where either a constant potential or a zero flux
is imposed, while a constant field is prescribed at an infinite distance from
this boundary. We introduce a conformal mapping technique that is tailored to
this problem in two dimensions. An efficient algorithm is introduced to compute
the conformal map for arbitrarily chosen boundaries. Harmonic fields can then
simply be read from the conformal map. We discuss applications to "equivalent"
smooth interfaces. We study the correlations between the topography and the
field at the surface. Finally we apply the conformal map to the computation of
inhomogeneous harmonic fields such as the derivation of Green function for
localized flux on the surface of a rough boundary.
