This paper treats subelliptic estimates for the $\bar{\partial}$-Neumann
problem on a class of domains known as regular coordinate domains. Our main
result is that the largest subelliptic gain for a regular coordinate domain is
bounded below by a purely algebraic number, the inverse of twice the
multiplicity of the ideal associated to a given boundary point.
