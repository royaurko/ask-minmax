Suppose an interval is put on a horizontal line with random roughness. With
probability one it is supported at two points, one from the left, and another
from the right from its center. We compute probability distribution of support
points provided the roughness is fine grained. We also solve an analogous
problem where a circle is put on a rough plane. Some applications in static are
given.
