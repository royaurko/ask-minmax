The general problem of a perfect incompressible fluid motion with vortex
areas and variant constant vorticities is formulated. The M.A. Goldshtik's
variational approach is considered on research of dual problems for flows with
vortex and potential areas that describe detached flow and a motion model of a
perfect incompressible fluid in field of Coriolis forces.
