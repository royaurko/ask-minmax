This is the 4-th paper in the series devoted to a systematic study of the
problem of mathematically correct formulation of the rules needed to manage an
effective field theory. Here we consider the problem of constructing the full
set of essential parameters in the case of the most general effective
scattering theory containing no massless particles with spin J > 1/2. We
perform the detailed classification of combinations of the Hamiltonian coupling
constants and select those which appear in the expressions for renormalized
S-matrix elements at a given loop order.
