Identifying promising compounds from a vast collection of feasible compounds
is an important and yet challenging problem in the pharmaceutical industry. An
efficient solution to this problem will help reduce the expenditure at the
early stages of drug discovery. In an attempt to solve this problem, Mandal, Wu
and Johnson [Technometrics 48 (2006) 273--283] proposed the SELC algorithm.
Although powerful, it fails to extract substantial information from the data to
guide the search efficiently, as this methodology is not based on any
statistical modeling. The proposed approach uses Gaussian Process (GP) modeling
to improve upon SELC, and hence named $\mathcal{G}$-SELC. The performance of
the proposed methodology is illustrated using four and five dimensional test
functions. Finally, we implement the new algorithm on a real pharmaceutical
data set for finding a group of chemical compounds with optimal properties.
