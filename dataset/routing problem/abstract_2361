I propose that some irregular `messy' planetary nebulae owe their
morphologies to triple-stellar evolution where tight binary systems are tidally
and frictionally destroyed inside the envelope of asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars. The tight binary system might breakup with one star leaving the system.
In an alternative evolution, one of the stars of the brook-up tight binary
system falls toward the AGB envelope with low specific angular momentum, and
drowns in the envelope. In a different type of destruction process the drag
inside the AGB envelope causes the tight binary system to merge. This releases
gravitational energy within the AGB envelope, leading to a very asymmetrical
envelope ejection, with an irregular and `messy' planetary nebula as a
descendant. The evolution of the triple-stellar system before destruction can
be in a full common envelope evolution (CEE) or in a grazing envelope evolution
(GEE). Both before and after destruction the system might lunch pairs of
opposite jets. One pronounced signature of triple-stellar evolution might be a
large departure from axisymmetrical morphology of the descendant planetary
nebula. I estimate that about one in six non-spherical PNe is shaped by one of
these triple-stellar evolutionary routes.
