Integral Value Transformation (IVT) is a family of transformations from N0kto
N0. An algebraic result has been established in p-adic IVT systems and an
application of the result is described in this paper. The result in this paper
provides the rule to find the pth pre image of a natural number for the Collatz
like bijective functions in p-adic IVT systems. Using this result a routing
algorithm is proposed. This proposed routing algorithm reduces number of
address calculation.
