I show that the power iteration method applied to the phase retrieval problem
converges under special conditions. One is given the relative phases between
small non-overlapping groups of pixels of a recorded intensity pattern, but no
information on the phase between the groups of pixels. Numerical tests show
that the inverse block iteration recovers the solution in 1 iteration.
