A generalization of the maximum noise fraction (MNF) transform is proposed.
Powers of each band are included as new bands before the MNF transform is
performed. The generalized MNF (GMNF) is shown to perform better than the MNF
on a time dependent airborne electromagnetic (AEM) data filtering problem.
