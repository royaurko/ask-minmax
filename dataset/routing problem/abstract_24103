The work presented here is aimed at introducing a virtual human controller in
a virtual prototyping framework. After a brief introduction describing the
problem solved in the paper, we describe the interest as for digital humans in
the context of concurrent engineering. This leads us to draw a control
architecture enabling to drive virtual humans in a real-time immersed way, and
to interact with the product, through motion capture. Unfortunately, we show
this control scheme can lead to unfeasible movements because of the lack of
balance control. Introducing such a controller is a problem that was never
addressed in the context of real-time. We propose an implementation of a
balance controller, that we insert into the previously described control
scheme. Next section is dedicated to show the results we obtained. Finally, we
propose a virtual reality platform into which the digital character controller
is integrated.
