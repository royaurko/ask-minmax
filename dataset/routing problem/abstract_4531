In this work we investigate the resolvent operator and completeness of
eigenfunctions of a Sturm-Liouville problem with discontinuities at two points.
The problem contains an eigenparameter in the one of boundary conditions. For
operator-theoretic formulation of the considered problem we define an
equivalent inner product in the Hilbert space and suitable self-adjoint lineer
operator in it.
