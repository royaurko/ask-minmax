In this paper, we revisit the much studied problem of Pattern Matching with
Swaps (Swap Matching problem, for short). We first present a graph-theoretic
model, which opens a new and so far unexplored avenue to solve the problem.
Then, using the model, we devise two efficient algorithms to solve the swap
matching problem. The resulting algorithms are adaptations of the classic
shift-and algorithm. For patterns having length similar to the word-size of the
target machine, both the algorithms run in linear time considering a fixed
alphabet.
