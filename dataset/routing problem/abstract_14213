We propose an approach to detect flying objects such as UAVs and aircrafts
when they occupy a small portion of the field of view, possibly moving against
complex backgrounds, and are filmed by a camera that itself moves.
  Solving such a difficult problem requires combining both appearance and
motion cues. To this end we propose a regression-based approach to motion
stabilization of local image patches that allows us to achieve effective
classification on spatio-temporal image cubes and outperform state-of-the-art
techniques.
  As the problem is relatively new, we collected two challenging datasets for
UAVs and Aircrafts, which can be used as benchmarks for flying objects
detection and vision-guided collision avoidance.
