This paper presents a characterization of distributed controllers subject to
delay constraints induced by a strongly connected communication graph that
achieve a prescribed closed loop $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ norm. Inspired by the
solution to the $\mathcal{H}_2$ problem subject to delays, we exploit the fact
that the communication graph is strongly connected to decompose the controller
into a local finite impulse response component and a global but delayed
infinite impulse response component. This allows us to reduce the control
synthesis problem to a linear matrix inequality feasibility test.
