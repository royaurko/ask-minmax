In this short paper, the Electre Tri-Machine Learning Method, generally used
to solve ordinal classification problems, is proposed for solving the Record
Linkage problem. Preliminary experimental results show that, using the Electre
Tri method, high accuracy can be achieved and more than 99% of the matches and
nonmatches were correctly identified by the procedure.
