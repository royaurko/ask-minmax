This note proposes an effective pruning-based Pareto front generation method
in mixed-discrete bi-objective optimization. The mixed-discrete problem is
decomposed into multiple continuous subproblems; two-phase pruning steps
identify and prune out non-contributory subproblems to the Pareto front
construction. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated on two
benchmark examples.
