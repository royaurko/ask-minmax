Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is a powerful representation often
used to formulate decision-making problems under uncertainty. However, it lacks
a natural mechanism to reason about objects, classes of objects, and relations.
First-order logic (FOL), on the other hand, excels at reasoning about classes
of objects, but lacks a rich representation of uncertainty. While representing
propositional logic in MILP has been extensively explored, no theory exists yet
for fully combining FOL with MILP. We propose a new representation, called
first-order programming or FOP, which subsumes both FOL and MILP. We establish
formal methods for reasoning about first order programs, including a sound and
complete lifted inference procedure for integer first order programs. Since FOP
can offer exponential savings in representation and proof size compared to FOL,
and since representations and proofs are never significantly longer in FOP than
in FOL, we anticipate that inference in FOP will be more tractable than
inference in FOL for corresponding problems.
