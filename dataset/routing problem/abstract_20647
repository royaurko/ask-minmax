We establish a mortar boundary element scheme for hypersingular boundary
integral equations representing elliptic boundary value problems in three
dimensions. We prove almost quasi-optimal convergence of the scheme in broken
Sobolev norms of order 1/2. Sub-domain decompositions can be geometrically
non-conforming and meshes must be quasi-uniform only on sub-domains. Numerical
results confirm the theory.
