We review the idea of our earlier proposed string field theory
\cite{early1,early2,ourappear}, which makes the second quantized string theory
appear as described by one or two types of stationary - so called - "objects"
for string theories respectively with and without open strings. It may be
better to look on our string field theory as a {\em solution} of a second
quantized string theory, in which we have decided to ignore, how strings are
topologically hanging together. Rather we satisfy ourselves with realizing
solely the information contained in the knowledge of, through which points in
space time passes a string. In the formulation of the string field theory, in
which we have rewritten the systems of strings into a system of what we call
"objects", the scattering of strings take place without any of the
"fundamental" "objects" (technically "even objects") changing. They are only
{\em exchanged} instead. A route to extract from our formalism the vertex of
the Veneziano model theory is sketched, and thus in principle we have a line of
arguments leading to, that our string field theory indeed gives the Veneziano
model scattering amplitudes for the scatterings, that are in fact in our model
{\em only exchanges}.
