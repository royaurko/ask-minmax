We consider large-scale wireless sensor networks with $n$ nodes, out of which
k are in possession, (e.g., have sensed or collected in some other way) k
information packets. In the scenarios in which network nodes are vulnerable
because of, for example, limited energy or a hostile environment, it is
desirable to disseminate the acquired information throughout the network so
that each of the n nodes stores one (possibly coded) packet so that the
original k source packets can be recovered, locally and in a computationally
simple way from any k(1 + \epsilon) nodes for some small \epsilon > 0. We
develop decentralized Fountain codes based algorithms to solve this problem.
Unlike all previously developed schemes, our algorithms are truly distributed,
that is, nodes do not know n, k or connectivity in the network, except in their
own neighborhoods, and they do not maintain any routing tables.
