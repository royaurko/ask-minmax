Rotating properties of Bose-Einstein condensates in synthetic magnetic field
are studied by numerically solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and compared
with condensates confined in the rotating trap. It seems that it is more
difficult to add large angular momentum to condensates spined up by the
synthetic magnetic field than by the rotating trap. However, strengthening the
repulsive interaction between atoms is an effective and realizable route to
overcome this problem and can at least generate vortex-lattice-like structures.
In addition, the validity of the Feynman rule for condensates in synthetic
magnetic field is verified.
