We have examined the stability of collinear in Robes's generalised restricted
three body problem. The problem is generalised in the sense that more massive
primary has been taken as an oblate spheroid. We have found the position of
collinear equilibrium points. We have obtained variational equations of the
problem. With the help of characteristic roots, we conclude that the collinear
points are unstable. Robe's result may be verified from the generalised result.
