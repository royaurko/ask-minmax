In this paper we study a problem of vertex two-coloring of undirected graph
such that there is no monochromatic cycle of given length. We show that this
problem is hard to solve. We give a proof by presenting a reduction from
variation of satisfiability (SAT) problem. We show nice properties of coloring
cliques with two colors which plays pivotal role in the reduction construction.
