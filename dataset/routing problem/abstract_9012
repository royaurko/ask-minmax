The anomalous U(1)_A symmetry provides a generic method of getting accidental
symmetries. Therefore, it can play a crucial role in solving the
doublet-triplet splitting and the \mu-problems via the `pseudo-Goldstone'
mechanism: U(1)_A can naturally uncorrelate the two grand unified Higgs sectors
in the superpotential and simultaneously induce the desired expectation values
through the Fayet-Iliopoulos D-term. The zero modes of the resulting compact
vacuum degeneracy can be identified with the massless electroweak Higgs
doublets. This automatically solves the doublet-triplet splitting and the
\mu-problems to all orders in M_P^{-1}. No additional discrete or global
symmetries are needed. U(1)_A can also play the role of the `matter parity' and
suppress the baryon number violating operators. We present the simplest SU(6)
gauge model with a minimal Higgs sector and no doublet-triplet splitting
problem. This model also relates the fermion mass hierarchy to the hierarchy of
scales and predicts, for the generic non-minimal Kahler potential,
approximately universal values for the tree-level electroweak Higgs mass
parameters.
