A general lossless joint source-channel coding (JSCC) scheme based on linear
codes and random interleavers for multiple-access channels (MACs) is presented
and then analyzed in this paper. By the information-spectrum approach and the
code-spectrum approach, it is shown that a linear code with a good joint
spectrum can be used to establish limit-approaching lossless JSCC schemes for
correlated general sources and general MACs, where the joint spectrum is a
generalization of the input-output weight distribution. Some properties of
linear codes with good joint spectra are investigated. A formula on the
"distance" property of linear codes with good joint spectra is derived, based
on which, it is further proved that, the rate of any systematic codes with good
joint spectra cannot be larger than the reciprocal of the corresponding
alphabet cardinality, and any sparse generator matrices cannot yield linear
codes with good joint spectra. The problem of designing arbitrary rate coding
schemes is also discussed. A novel idea called "generalized puncturing" is
proposed, which makes it possible that one good low-rate linear code is enough
for the design of coding schemes with multiple rates. Finally, various coding
problems of MACs are reviewed in a unified framework established by the
code-spectrum approach, under which, criteria and candidates of good linear
codes in terms of spectrum requirements for such problems are clearly
presented.
