We describe a mechanical device which can be used as an analog computer to
solve the transportation problem. In practice this device is simulated by a
numerical algorithm. Tests show that this algorithm is 60 times faster than a
current subroutine (NAG library) for an average 1000 x 1000 problem. Its
performance is even better for degenerate problems in which the weights take
only a small number of integer values.
