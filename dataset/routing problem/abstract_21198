Abbreviated Abstract: The objective of Evolutionary Computation is to solve
practical problems (e.g. optimization, data mining) by simulating the
mechanisms of natural evolution. This thesis addresses several topics related
to adaptation and self-organization in evolving systems with the overall aims
of improving the performance of Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), understanding its
relation to natural evolution, and incorporating new mechanisms for mimicking
complex biological systems.
