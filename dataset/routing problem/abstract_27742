The aim of Harmonic Broadcasting protocol is to reduce the bandwidth usage in
video-on-demand service where a video is divided into some equal sized segments
and every segment is repeatedly transmitted over a number of channels that
follows harmonic series for channel bandwidth assignment. As the bandwidth of
channels differs from each other and users can join at any time to these
multicast channels, they may experience a synchronization problem between
download and playback. To deal with this issue, some schemes have been
proposed, however, at the cost of additional or wastage of bandwidth or sudden
extreme bandwidth requirement. In this paper we present an adaptive quasi
harmonic broadcasting scheme (AQHB) which delivers all data segment on time
that is the download and playback synchronization problem is eliminated while
keeping the bandwidth consumption as same as traditional harmonic broadcasting
scheme without cost of any additional or wastage of bandwidth. It also ensures
the video server not to increase the channel bandwidth suddenly that is, also
eliminates the sudden buffer requirement at the client side. We present several
analytical results to exhibit the efficiency of our proposed broadcasting
scheme over the existing ones.
