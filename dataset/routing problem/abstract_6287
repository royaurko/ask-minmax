We present a method for proving the existence of symmetric periodic,
heteroclinic or homoclinic orbits in dynamical systems with the reversing
symmetry. As an application we show that the Planar Restricted Circular Three
Body Problem (PCR3BP) corresponding to the Sun-Jupiter-Oterma system possesses
an infinite number of symmetric periodic orbits and homoclinic orbits to the
Lyapunov orbits. Moreover, we show the existence of symbolic dynamics on six
symbols for PCR3BP and the possibility of resonance transitions of the comet.
This extends earlier results by Wilczak and Zgliczynski - Heteroclinic
