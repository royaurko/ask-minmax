In this paper, we present a new variation of dilated matrix inequalities
(MIs) for Bounded Real MI, invariant set MI and constraint MI, for both state
and output feedback synthesis problems. In these dilated MIs, system matrices
are separated from Lyapunov matrices to allow the use of different Lyapunov
matrices in multi-objective and robust problems. To demonstrate the benefit of
these new dilated MIs over conventional ones, they are used in solving
controller synthesis problem for systems with bounded actuator in disturbance
attenuation. It is shown that for the resulting multi-objective saturation
problem, the new form of dilated MIs achieves an upper bound for $L_2$ gain
that is less than or equal to the upper bound estimate achieved by conventional
method.
