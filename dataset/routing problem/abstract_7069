In this paper we study Bayesian answers to testing problems when the
hypotheses are not well separated and propose a general approach with a special
focus on shape constrains testing. We then apply our method to several testing
problems including testing for positivity and monotonicity in a nonparametric
regression setting. For each of this problems, we show that our approach leads
to the optimal separation rate of testing, which indicates that our tests have
the best power. To our knowledge, separation rates have not been studied in the
Bayesian literature so far.
