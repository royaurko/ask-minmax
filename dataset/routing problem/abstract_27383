In this paper, using kernel convolution of order based dependent Dirichlet
process (Griffin & Steel (2006)) we construct a nonstationary, nonseparable,
nonparametric space-time process, which, as we show, satisfies desirable
properties, and includes the stationary, separable, parametric processes as
special cases. We also investigate the smoothness properties of our proposed
model.
  Since our model entails an infinite random series, for Bayesian model fitting
purpose we must either truncate the series or more appropriately consider a
random number of summands, which renders the model dimension a random variable.
We attack the vari- able dimensionality problem using the novel
Transdimensional Transformation based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TTMCMC)
methodology introduced by Das & Bhat- tacharya (2014b), which can update all
the variables and also change dimensions in a single block using a single
random variable drawn from some arbitrary density defined on a relevant
support. For the sake of completeness we also address the problem of truncating
the infinite series by providing a uniform bound on the error incurred by
truncating the infinite series.
  We illustrate our model and the methodologies on a simulated data set and
also fit a real, ozone data set. The results that we obtain from both the
studies are quite encouraging.
