We propose highly accurate finite-difference schemes for simulating wave
propagation problems described by linear second-order hyperbolic equations. The
schemes are based on the summation by parts (SBP) approach modified for
applications with violation of input data smoothness. In particular, we derive
and implement stable schemes for solving elastodynamic anisotropic problems
described by the Navier wave equation in complex geometry. To enhance potential
of the method, we use a general type of coordinate transformation and
multiblock grids. We also show that the conventional spectral element method
(SEM) can be treated as the multiblock finite-difference method whose blocks
are the SEM cells with SBP operators on GLL grid.
