This study concerns problems of time-series forecasting under the weakest of
assumptions. Related results are surveyed and are points of departure for the
developments here, some of which are new and others are new derivations of
previous findings. The contributions in this study are all negative, showing
that various plausible prediction problems are unsolvable, or in other cases,
are not solvable by predictors which are known to be consistent when mixing
conditions hold.
