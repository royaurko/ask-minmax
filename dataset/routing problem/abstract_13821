The present paper proposes and analyzes an interior penalty technique using
$C^0$-finite elements to solve the Maxwell equations in domains with
heterogeneous properties. The convergence analysis for the boundary value
problem and the eigenvalue problem is done assuming only minimal regularity in
Lipschitz domains. The method is shown to converge for any polynomial degrees
and to be spectrally correct.
