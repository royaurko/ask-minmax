A society's single emergent, increasing intelligence arises partly from the
thermodynamic advantages of networking the innate intelligence of different
individuals, and partly from the accumulation of solved problems. Economic
growth is proportional to the square of the network entropy of a society's
population times the network entropy of the number of the society's solved
problems.
