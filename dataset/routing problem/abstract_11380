Families of operator identities appeared as a consequence of an existence of
finite-dimensional representation of (super) Lie algebras of first-order
differential operators and $q$-deformed (quantum) algebras of first-order
finite-difference operators are presented. It is shown that those identities
can be rewritten in terms of creation/annihilation operators and it leads to a
simplification of the problem of the normal ordering in the second quantization
method.
