The inference of new information on the relatedness of species by
phylogenetic trees based on DNA data is one of the main challenges of modern
biology. But despite all technological advances, DNA sequencing is still a
time-consuming and costly process. Therefore, decision criteria would be
desirable to decide a priori which data might contribute new information to the
supertree which is not explicitly displayed by any input tree. A new concept,
so-called groves, to identify taxon sets with the potential to construct such
informative supertrees was suggested by An\'e et al. in 2009. But the important
conjecture that maximal groves can easily be identified in a database remained
unproved and was published on the Isaac Newton Institute's list of open
phylogenetic problems. In this paper, we show that the conjecture does not
generally hold, but also introduce a new concept, namely 2-overlap groves,
which overcomes this problem.
