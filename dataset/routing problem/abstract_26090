In this letter we show that although the application of standard Lyapunov
analysis predicts that completely integrable Kepler motion is unstable, the
geometrical analysis of Horwitz et al [1] predicts the observed stability. This
seems to us to provide evidence for both the incompleteness of the standard
Lyapunov analysis and the strength of the geometrical analysis. Moreover, we
apply this approach to the three body problem in which the third body is
restricted to move on a circle of large radius which induces an adiabatic time
dependent potential on the second body. This causes the second body to move in
a very interesting and intricate but periodic trajectory; however, the standard
Lyapunov analysis, as well as methods based on the parametric variation of
curvature associated with the Jacobi metric, incorrectly predict chaotic
behavior. The geometric approach predicts the correct stable motion in this
case as well.
