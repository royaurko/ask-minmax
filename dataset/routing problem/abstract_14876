We show that the mu problem and the strong CP problem can be resolved in the
context of the gauged U(1)_R symmetry, realizing an automatic Peccei-Quinn
symmetry. In this scheme, right-handed neutrinos can be introduced to explain
small Majorana or Dirac neutrino mass. The U(1)_R D-term mediated SUSY
breaking, called the U(1)_R mediation, gives rise to a specific form of the
flavor-conserving superpartner masses. For the given solution to the mu
problem, electroweak symmetry breaking condition requires the superpartners of
the Standard Model at low energy to be much heavier than the gravitino. Thus
dark matter candidate can be either gravitino or right-handed sneutrino. In the
Majorana neutrino case, only gravitino is a natural dark matter candidate. On
the other hand, in the Dirac neutrino case, the right-handed sneutrino can be
also a dark matter candidate as it gets mass only from SUSY breaking. We
discuss the non-thermal production of our dark matter candidates from the late
decay of stau and find that the constraints from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
can be evaded for a TeV-scale stau mass.
