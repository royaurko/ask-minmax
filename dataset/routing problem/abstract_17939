Let $C$ be a compact convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, $f:C\to\mathbb{R}$ be a
convex function, and $m\in\{1, 2, ..., \infty\}$. Assume that, along with $f$,
we are given a family of polynomials satisfying Whitney's extension condition
for $C^m$, and thus that there exists $F\in C^{m}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ such that
$F=f$ on $C$. It is natural to ask for further (necessary and sufficient)
conditions on this family of polynomials which ensure that $F$ can be taken to
be convex as well. We give satisfactory solutions to this problem in the cases
$m=1$ and $m=\infty$. Moreover, in the case $m=1$ we also solve the problem for
not necessarily convex compacta $C$, and we give a geometrical application
concerning a characterization of compact sets which can be interpolated by
boundaries of $C^1$ convex bodies.
