In this paper we present a new Turbo analog error correcting coding scheme
for real valued signals that are corrupted by impulsive noise. This Turbo code
improves Donoho's deterministic construction by using a probabilistic approach.
More specifically, our construction corrects more errors than the matrices of
Donoho by allowing a vanishingly small probability of error (with the increase
in block size). The problem of decoding the long block code is decoupled into
two sets of parallel Linear Programming problems. This leads to a significant
reduction in decoding complexity as compared to one-step Linear Programming
decoding.
