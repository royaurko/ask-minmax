Sivashinsky's (1977) nonlinear integro-differential equation for the shape of
corrugated 1-dimensional flames is ultimately reducible to a 2N-body problem,
involving the 2N complex poles of the flame slope. Thual, Frisch & Henon (1985)
derived singular linear integral equations for the pole density in the limit of
large steady wrinkles $(N \gg 1)$, which they solved exactly for monocoalesced
periodic fronts of highest amplitude of wrinkling and approximately otherwise.
Here we solve those analytically for isolated crests, next for monocoalesced
then bicoalesced periodic flame patterns, whatever the (large-) amplitudes
involved. We compare the analytically predicted pole densities and flame shapes
to numerical results deduced from the pole-decomposition approach. Good
agreement is obtained, even for moderately large Ns. The results are extended
to give hints as to the dynamics of supplementary poles. Open problems are
evoked.
