We consider a fractional elliptic equation in an unbounded set with both
Dirichlet and fractional normal derivative datum prescribed. We prove that the
domain and the solution are necessarily radially symmetric.
  The extension of the result in bounded non-convex regions is also studied, as
well as the radial symmetry of the solution when the set is a priori supposed
to be rotationally symmetric.
