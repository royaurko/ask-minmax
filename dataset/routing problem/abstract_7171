This paper shows new general nonasymptotic achievability and converse bounds
and performs their dispersion analysis for the lossy compression problem in
which the compressor observes the source through a noisy channel. While this
problem is asymptotically equivalent to a noiseless lossy source coding problem
with a modified distortion function, nonasymptotically there is a noticeable
gap in how fast their minimum achievable coding rates approach the
rate-distortion function, providing yet another example in which at finite
blocklengths one must put aside traditional asymptotic thinking.
