We analyse the computational complexity of three problems in judgment
aggregation: (1) computing a collective judgment from a profile of individual
judgments (the winner determination problem); (2) deciding whether a given
agent can influence the outcome of a judgment aggregation procedure in her
favour by reporting insincere judgments (the strategic manipulation problem);
and (3) deciding whether a given judgment aggregation scenario is guaranteed to
result in a logically consistent outcome, independently from what the judgments
supplied by the individuals are (the problem of the safety of the agenda). We
provide results both for specific aggregation procedures (the quota rules, the
premise-based procedure, and a distance-based procedure) and for classes of
aggregation procedures characterised in terms of fundamental axioms.
