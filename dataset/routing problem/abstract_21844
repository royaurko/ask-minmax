Jaeger's directed cycle double cover conjecture can be formulated as a
problem of existence of special perfect matchings in a class of graphs that we
call hexagon graphs. In this work, we explore the structure of hexagon graphs.
We show that hexagon graphs are braces that can be generated from the ladder on
8 vertices using two types of McCuaig's augmentations.
