Let (M,g) be a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary. This paper
addresses the Yamabe-type problem of finding a conformal scalar-flat metric on
M, which has the boundary as a constant mean curvature hypersurface. When the
boundary is umbilic, we prove an existence theorem that finishes some remaining
cases of this problem.
