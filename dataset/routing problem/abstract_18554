Dynamics of the major USA market indices DJIA, S&P, Nasdaq, and NYSE is
analyzed from the point of view of the random walking problem with two-step
correlations of the market moves. The parameters characterizing the stochastic
dynamics are determined empirically from the historical quotes for the daily,
weekly, and monthly series. The results show existence of statistically
significant correlations between the subsequent market moves. The weekly and
monthly parameters are calculated in terms of the daily parameters, assuming
that the Markov chains with two-step correlations give a complete description
of the market stochastic dynamics. We show that the macro- and micro-parameters
obey the renorm group equation. The comparison of the parameters determined
from the renorm group equation with the historical values shows that the Markov
chains approach gives reasonable predictions for the weekly quotes and
underestimates the probability for continuation of the down trend in the
monthly quotes. The return and its dispersion for the "buy-and-hold" and
"follow-trend" strategies are calculated. The problem of how to combine these
two strategies to reduce the dispersion is discussed and its analytical
solution is proposed. The results of the constructing a "computer-based"
strategy which combines the series analysis with the candlesticks charting
techniques are reported.
