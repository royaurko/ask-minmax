We are Turing complete, and natural language parsing is decidable, so our
syntactic abilities are in excess to those needed to speak a natural language.
This is an anomaly, because evolution would not keep an overqualified feature
for long. We solve this anomaly by using a coincidence, both syntax and problem
solving are computing, and a difference, Turing completeness is not a
requirement of syntax, but of problem solving. Then computing should have been
shaped by evolutionary requirements coming from both syntax and problem
solving, but the last one, Turing completeness, only from problem solving. So
we propose and analyze a hypothesis: syntax and problem solving co-evolved in
humans towards Turing completeness. Finally, we argue that Turing completeness,
also known as recursion, is our most singular feature.
