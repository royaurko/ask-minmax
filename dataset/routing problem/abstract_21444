We offer a public key exchange protocol in the spirit of Diffie-Hellman, but
we use (small) matrices over a group ring of a (small) symmetric group as the
platform. This "nested structure" of the platform makes computation very
efficient for legitimate parties. We discuss security of this scheme by
addressing the Decision Diffie-Hellman (DDH) and Computational Diffie-Hellman
(CDH) problems for our platform.
