To study initial-boundary value problems for linear PDEs we have recently
proposed two alternative approaches in Fourier space: the "analyticity appoach"
and the "elimination by restriction approach". In this paper we present the
analyticity appoach and we illustrate its power in studying the well-posedness
of initial - boundary value problems for second and third order evolutionary
PDEs, and in constructing their solution. We also show the connection between
the analyticity approach and the elimination by restriction approach in the
study of the Dirichelet and Neumann problems for the Schroedinger equation in
the n-dimensional quadrant.
