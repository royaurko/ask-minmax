We present a new method aimed to handle long Gamma-Ray Burst (GRBs) as cosmic
rulers. The recent discovery of a tight correlation between the collimation
corrected GRB energy and the peak of the gamma-ray spectrum has opened the
possibility to use GRBs as a new category of standard candles. Unfortunately,
because of the lack of low-z GRBs, up to now this correlation is obtained from
high-z GRBs with the consequence that it depends on the cosmological parameters
we pretend to constrain. Hopefully this circularity problem will be solved
when, in a few years, the low-z GRB sample will be increased enough. In the
meanwhile we present here a new Bayesian method that eases the aforesaid
circularity problem, and allows to introduce new constrains on the cosmological
(Om,OL) diagram as well as to explore the universe kinematics up to z~3. The
method we propose offers the further advantage to make handy the problem of the
(Om,OL) loitering line singularity which inevitably appears when standard
candles with z>2 are used. The combination of GRB with SN Ia data makes the
popular LambdaCDM cosmology more consistent with the Hubble diagram at a 68%
confidence level. For a flat cosmology we find Om=0.28\pm0.03 for the combined
GRB+SN Ia data set. Correspondingly, the transition redshift between cosmic
deceleration and acceleration is z_T=0.73\pm0.09, slightly larger than the
value found by considering SNe Ia alone. We briefly discuss our results also in
terms of non--LambdaCDM dark energy models.
