Continuous Galerkin Petrov time discretization scheme is tested on some
Hamiltonian systems including simple harmonic oscillator, Kepler's problem with
different eccentricities and molecular dynamics problem. In particular, we
implement the fourth order Continuous Galerkin Petrov time discretization
scheme and analyze numerically, the efficiency and conservation of Hamiltonian.
A numerical comparison with some symplectic methods including Gauss implicit
Runge-Kutta method and general linear method of same order is given for these
systems. It is shown that the above mentioned scheme, not only preserves
Hamiltonian but also uses the least CPU time compared with upto-date and
optimized methods.
