More than a hundred years ago H.Poincare and V.A.Steklov considered a problem
for the Laplace equation with spectral parameter in the boundary conditions.
Today similar problems for two adjacent domains with the spectral parameter in
the conditions on the common boundary of the domains arises in a variety of
situations: in justification and optimization of domain decomposition method,
simple 2D models of oil extraction, (thermo)conductivity of composite
materials. Singular 1D integral Poincare-Steklov equation with spectral
parameter naturally emerges after reducing this 2D problem to the common
boundary of the domains. We present a constructive representation for the
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of this integral equation in terms of moduli of
explicitly constructed pants, one of the simplest Riemann surfaces with
boundary. Essentially the solution of integral equation is reduced to the
solution of three transcendent equations with three unknown numbers, moduli of
pants. The discreet spectrum of the equation is related to certain surgery
procedure ('grafting') invented by B.Maskit (1969), D.Hejhal (1975) and
D.Sullivan- W.Thurston (1983).
