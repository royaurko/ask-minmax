Present status of the neutrino magnetic moment solutions of the solar
neutrino problem is reviewed. In particular, we discuss a possibility of
reconciling different degrees of suppression and time variation of the signal
(or lack of such a variation) observed in different solar neutrino experiments.
It is shown that the resonant spin--flavor precession of neutrinos due to the
interaction of their transitions magnetic moments with solar magnetic field can
account for all the available solar neutrino data. For not too small neutrino
mixing angles ($\sin 2\theta_0 \aprge 0.2$) the combined effect of the resonant
spin--flavor precession and neutrino oscillations can result in an observable
flux of solar $\bar{\nu}_{e}$'s.
