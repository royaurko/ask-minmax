In my PhD thesis I show the existence of global-in-time weak solutions for a
Navier-Stokes fluid interacting with a linearly elastic shell of Koiter type.
This is achieved by the introduction of a new method for showing the
compactness of bounded sequences of approximate weak solutions. This method
might be of general interest in the study of fluid dynamical problems involving
a free boundary. There is no damping term involved in the shell equations.
