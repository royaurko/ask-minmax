In time-critical wireless sensor network (WSN) applications, a high degree of
reliability is commonly required. A dynamical jumping real-time fault-tolerant
routing protocol (DMRF) is proposed in this paper. Each node utilizes the
remaining transmission time of the data packets and the state of the forwarding
candidate node set to dynamically choose the next hop. Once node failure,
network congestion or void region occurs, the transmission mode will switch to
jumping transmission mode, which can reduce the transmission time delay,
guaranteeing the data packets to be sent to the destination node within the
specified time limit. By using feedback mechanism, each node dynamically
adjusts the jumping probabilities to increase the ratio of successful
transmission. Simulation results show that DMRF can not only efficiently reduce
the effects of failure nodes, congestion and void region, but also yield higher
ratio of successful transmission, smaller transmission delay and reduced number
of control packets.
