MDS (maximum distance separable) array codes are widely used in storage
systems due to their computationally efficient encoding and decoding
procedures. An MDS code with r redundancy nodes can correct any r erasures by
accessing (reading) all the remaining information in both the systematic nodes
and the parity (redundancy) nodes. However, in practice, a single erasure is
the most likely failure event; hence, a natural question is how much
information do we need to access in order to rebuild a single storage node? We
define the rebuilding ratio as the fraction of remaining information accessed
during the rebuilding of a single erasure. In our previous work we showed that
the optimal rebuilding ratio of 1/r is achievable (using our newly constructed
array codes) for the rebuilding of any systematic node, however, all the
information needs to be accessed for the rebuilding of the parity nodes.
Namely, constructing array codes with a rebuilding ratio of 1/r was left as an
open problem. In this paper, we solve this open problem and present array codes
that achieve the lower bound of 1/r for rebuilding any single systematic or
parity node.
