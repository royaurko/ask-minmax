We analyze an initial-boundary value problem for the Ostrovsky-Vakhnenko
equation on the half-line. This equation can be viewed as the short wave model
for the Degasperis-Procesi (DP) equation. We show that the solution u(x,t) can
be recovered from its initial and boundary values via the solution of a 3\times
3 vector Riemann-Hilbert problem formulated in the complex plane of a spectral
parameter z.
