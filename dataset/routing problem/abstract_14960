Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are heuristic algorithms inspired by natural
evolution. They are often used to obtain satisficing solutions in practice. In
this paper, we investigate a largely underexplored issue: the approximation
performance of EAs in terms of how close the solution obtained is to an optimal
solution. We study an EA framework named simple EA with isolated population
(SEIP) that can be implemented as a single- or multi-objective EA. We analyze
the approximation performance of SEIP using the partial ratio, which
characterizes the approximation ratio that can be guaranteed. Specifically, we
analyze SEIP using a set cover problem that is NP-hard. We find that in a
simple configuration, SEIP efficiently achieves an $H_n$-approximation ratio,
the asymptotic lower bound, for the unbounded set cover problem. We also find
that SEIP efficiently achieves an $(H_k-\frac{k-1}/{8k^9})$-approximation
ratio, the currently best-achievable result, for the k-set cover problem.
Moreover, for an instance class of the k-set cover problem, we disclose how
SEIP, using either one-bit or bit-wise mutation, can overcome the difficulty
that limits the greedy algorithm.
