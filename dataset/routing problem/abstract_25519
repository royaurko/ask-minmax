We show that problems which have finite integer index and satisfy a
requirement we call treewidth-bounding admit linear kernels on the class of
$H$-topological-minor free graphs, for an arbitrary fixed graph $H$. This
builds on earlier results by Fomin et al.\ on linear kernels for $H$-minor-free
graphs and by Bodlaender et al.\ on graphs of bounded genus. Our framework
encompasses several problems, the prominent ones being Chordal Vertex Deletion,
Feedback Vertex Set and Edge Dominating Set.
