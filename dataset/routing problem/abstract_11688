The purpose of this paper is to analyze the singularities of a well known
benchmark problem ``Andrews' squeezing mechanism''. We show that for physically
relevant parameter values this system admits singularities. The method is based
on Gr\"obner bases computations and ideal decomposition. It is algorithmic and
can thus be applied to study constraint singularities which arise in more
general situations.
