The study focuses on propagation of longitudinal waves in an elastic pipe
partly embedded in a medium with dry friction. Mathematical formulation of the
problem on the impact pipe driving into the soil is based on the model of
longitudinal vibration of an elastic rod with taking into account lateral
resistance. The lateral resistance of soil is described by the law of the
contact dry friction. Numerical and analytical solutions to problems on
longitudinal impulse loading of a pipe are compared.
