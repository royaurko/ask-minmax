The X(3872) has non-charmonium-like properties, such as decay processes that
seem to violate isospin, and a mass that lies unexpectedly close to the
neutral-D-plus-neutral-D-excited-state threshold. An EFT that includes both
charmonium-like (short distance) and molecule-like (meson bound state)
properties is used to analyze the X(3872) as it is produced in the decay of
\psi(4160). This is a route that BESIII may be able to measure. We find that
the correlation between the angular distribution of the outcoming photon (or
X(3872)) and the polarization of the \psi(4160) source may be used to provide
information on whether short-distance or long-distance effects dominate.
