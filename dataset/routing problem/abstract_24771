We explore 5 network communication problems where the possibility of
interference alignment, and consequently the total number of degrees of freedom
(DoF) with channel uncertainty at the transmitters are unknown. These problems
share the common property that in each case the best known outer bounds are
essentially robust to channel uncertainty and represent the outcome with
interference alignment, but the best inner bounds -- in some cases conjectured
to be optimal -- predict a total collapse of DoF, thus indicating the
infeasibility of interference alignment under channel uncertainty at
transmitters. Our main contribution is to show that even with no knowledge of
channel coefficient values at the transmitters, the knowledge of the channels'
correlation structure can be exploited to achieve interference alignment. In
each case, we show that under a staggered block fading model, the transmitters
are able to align interference without the knowledge of channel coefficient
values. The alignment schemes are based on linear beamforming -- which can be
seen as a repetition code over a small number of symbols -- and involve delays
of only a few coherence intervals.
