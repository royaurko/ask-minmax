We consider the Einstein-Maxwell system as a Cauchy initial value problem
taking the electric and magnetic fields as independent variables. Maxwell's
equations in curved spacetimes are derived in detail using a 3+1 formalism and
their hyperbolic properties are analyzed, showing that the resulting system is
symmetric hyperbolic. We also focus on the problem of finding initial data for
multiple charged black holes assuming time-symmetric initial data and using a
puncture-like method to solve the Hamiltonian and the Gauss constraints. We
study the behavior of the resulting initial data families, and show that
previous results in this direction can be obtained as particular cases of our
approach.
