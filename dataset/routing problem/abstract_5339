In this paper, we study the minimal cost constrained input-output (I/O) and
control configuration co-design problem. Given a linear time-invariant plant,
where a collection of possible inputs and outputs is known a priori, we aim to
determine the collection of inputs, outputs and communication among them
incurring in the minimum cost, such that desired control performance, measured
in terms of arbitrary pole-placement capability of the closed-loop system, is
ensured. We show that this problem is NP-hard in general (in the size of the
state space). However, the subclass of problems, in which the dynamic matrix is
irreducible, is shown to be polynomially solvable and the corresponding
algorithm is presented. In addition, under the same assumption, the same
algorithm can be used to solve the minimal cost constrained I/O selection
problem, and the minimal cost control configuration selection problem,
individually. In order to illustrate the main results of this paper, some
simulations are also provided.
