In the article (Rothleitner and Francis 2011 Metrologia 48 187-195) the
correction due to the finite speed of light in absolute gravimeters is analyzed
from the viewpoint of special relativity. The relativistic concepts eventually
lead to the two classical approaches to the problem: analysis of the beat
frequency, and introduction of the retarded times. In the first approach, an
additional time delay has to be assumed, because the frequency of the beam
bounced from the accelerated reflector differs at the point of reflection from
that at the point of interference. The retarded times formalism is equivalent
to a single Doppler shift, but results in the same correction as the beat
frequency approach, even though the latter is explicitly combines two Doppler
shifts. In our comments we discuss these and other problems we found with the
suggested treatment of the correction.
