We model a problem motivated by road design as a feasibility problem.
Projections onto the constraint sets are obtained, and projection methods for
solving the feasibility problem are studied. We present results of numerical
experiments which demonstrate the efficacy of projection methods even for
challenging nonconvex problems.
