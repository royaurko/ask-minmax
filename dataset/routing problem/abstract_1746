We use the Gutzwiller ansatz and analyze the phase diagram of the extended
Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian with on-site (U) and nearest-neighbor (V) repulsions.
For $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattices, when 2dV < U, it is well-known that
the ground state alternates between the charge-density-wave (CDW) and Mott
insulators, and the supersolid (SS) phase occupies small regions around the CDW
insulators. However, when 2dV > U, in this paper, we show that the ground state
has only CDW insulators, and more importantly, the SS phase occupies a much
larger region in the phase diagram, existing up to very large hopping values
which could be orders of magnitude higher than that of the well-known case. In
particular, the SS-superfluid phase boundary increases linearly as a function
of hopping when 2dV \gtrsim 1.5U, for which the prospects of observing the SS
phase with dipolar Bose gases loaded into optical lattices is much higher.
