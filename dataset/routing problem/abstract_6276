These notes form an extended version of a minicourse delivered in Universite
de Montreal (June 2002) within the framework of a NATO workshop ``Normal Forms,
Bifurcations and Finiteness Problems in Differential Equations''.
  The focus is on Poincare--Dulac theory of ``Fuchsian'' (logarithmic)
singularities of integrable systems, with applications to problems on zeros of
Abelian integrals in view.
