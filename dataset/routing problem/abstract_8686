Based on the plenty method, this paper describes a numerical method for 2D
non-smooth contact problems with Coulomb friction and bilateral constraints and
its application to the simulation of statics and dynamics for a frictional
translational joint. Comparison is made with results obtained using a finite
element program, ANSYS.
