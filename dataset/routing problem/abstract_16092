Forbidden Patterns Problems (FPPs) are a proper generalisation of Constraint
Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). However, we show that when the input is connected
and belongs to a class which has low tree-depth decomposition (e.g. structure
of bounded degree, proper minor closed class and more generally class of
bounded expansion) any FPP becomes a CSP. This result can also be rephrased in
terms of expressiveness of the logic MMSNP, introduced by Feder and Vardi in
relation with CSPs. Our proof generalises that of a recent paper by Nesetril
and Ossona de Mendez. Note that our result holds in the general setting of
problems over arbitrary relational structures (not just for graphs).
