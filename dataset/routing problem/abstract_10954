We consider layered two-dimensional Ising and directed walk models and show
that the two problems are inherently related. The information about the
zero-field thermodynamical properties of the Ising model is contained into the
transfer matrix of the directed walk. For several hierarchical and aperiodic
distributions of the couplings, critical exponents for the two problems are
obtained exactly through renormalization.
