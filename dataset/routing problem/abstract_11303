In this talk I review the present status of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly
and discuss some solutions that have been presented in the literature to solve
this problem. In particular I review the "standard" solution in terms of
neutrino oscillations as well as alternative scenarios such as the possibility
of flavour changing neutrino interactions with the Earth and neutrino decay.
