For given $a\in\R$, c<0, we are concerned with the solution $f^{}_b$ of the
differential equation
$f^{\prime\prime\prime}+ff^{\prime\prime}+\g(f^{\prime})=0$, satisfying the
initial conditions $f(0)=a$, $f'(0)=b$, $f''(0)=c< 0$, where g is some
nonnegative subquadratic locally Lipschitz function. It is proven that there
exists $b_*>0$ such that $f^{}_b$ exists on $[0,+\infty)$ and is such that
$f'_b(t)\to 0$ as $t\to+\infty$, if and only if $b\geq b_*$. This allows to
answer questions about existence, uniqueness and boundedness of solutions to a
boundary value problem arising in fluid mechanics, and especially in boundary
layer theory.
