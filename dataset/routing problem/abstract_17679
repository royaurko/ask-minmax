In this paper we use the theory of viscosity solutions for Hamilton-Jacobi
equations to study propagation phenomena in kinetic equations. We perform the
hydrodynamic limit of some kinetic models thanks to an adapted WKB ansatz. Our
models describe particles moving according to a velocity-jump process, and
proliferating thanks to a reaction term of monostable type. The scattering
operator is supposed to satisfy a maximum principle. When the velocity space is
bounded, we show, under suitable hypotheses, that the phase converges towards
the viscosity solution of some constrained Hamilton-Jacobi equation which
effective Hamiltonian is obtained solving a suitable eigenvalue problem in the
velocity space. In the case of unbounded velocities, the non-solvability of the
spectral problem can lead to different behavior. In particular, a front
acceleration phenomena can occur. Nevertheless, we expect that when the
spectral problem is solvable one can extend the convergence result.
