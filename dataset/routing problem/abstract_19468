Declarative spatial reasoning denotes the ability to (declaratively) specify
and solve real-world problems related to geometric and qualitative spatial
representation and reasoning within standard knowledge representation and
reasoning (KR) based methods (e.g., logic programming and derivatives). One
approach for encoding the semantics of spatial relations within a declarative
programming framework is by systems of polynomial constraints. However, solving
such constraints is computationally intractable in general (i.e. the theory of
real-closed fields).
  We present a new algorithm, implemented within the declarative spatial
reasoning system CLP(QS), that drastically improves the performance of deciding
the consistency of spatial constraint graphs over conventional polynomial
encodings. We develop pruning strategies founded on spatial symmetries that
form equivalence classes (based on affine transformations) at the qualitative
spatial level. Moreover, pruning strategies are themselves formalised as
knowledge about the properties of space and spatial symmetries. We evaluate our
algorithm using a range of benchmarks in the class of contact problems, and
proofs in mereology and geometry. The empirical results show that CLP(QS) with
knowledge-based spatial pruning outperforms conventional polynomial encodings
by orders of magnitude, and can thus be applied to problems that are otherwise
unsolvable in practice.
