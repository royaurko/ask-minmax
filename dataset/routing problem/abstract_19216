The origin of fermion mass hierarchies and mixings is one of the unresolved
and most difficult problem in high-energy physics. One possibility to address
the flavour problem is by extending the Standard Model to include a family
symmetry. In the recent years it has become very popular to use non-Abelian
discrete flavour symmetries because of their power in the prediction of the
large leptonic mixing angles relevant for neutrino oscillation experiments.
Here we give an introduction to the flavour problem and to discrete groups
which have been used to attempt a solution for it. We review the current status
of models in the light of the recent measurement of the reactor angle and we
consider different model building directions taken. The use of the flavons or
multi Higgs scalars in model building is discussed as well as the direct vs.
indirect approaches. We also focus on the possibility to distinguish
experimentally flavour symmetry models by means of mixing sum rules and mass
sum rules. In fact, we illustrate in this review the complete path from
mathematics, via model building, to experiments, so that any reader interested
to start working in the field could use this text as a starting point in order
to get a broad overview of the different subject areas.
