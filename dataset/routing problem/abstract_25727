We consider the supercritical problem {equation*} -\Delta u=|u|
^{p-2}u\text{\in}\Omega,\quad u=0\text{\on}\partial\Omega, {equation*} where
$\Omega$ is a bounded smooth domain in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ and $p$ smaller than
the critical exponent $2_{N,k}^{\ast}:=\frac{2(N-k)}{N-k-2}$ for the Sobolev
embedding of $H^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{N-k})$ in $L^{q}(\mathbb{R}^{N-k})$, $1\leq
k\leq N-3.$ We show that in some suitable domains $\Omega$ there are positive
and sign changing solutions with positive and negative layers which concentrate
along one or several $k$-dimensional submanifolds of $\partial\Omega$ as $p$
approaches $2_{N,k}^{\ast}$ from below.
  Key words:Nonlinear elliptic boundary value problem; critical and
supercritical exponents; existence of positive and sign changing solutions.
