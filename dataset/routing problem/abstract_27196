The paper addresses the following problem: given a set of man-made shapes,
e.g., chairs, can we quickly rank and explore the set of shapes with respect to
a given avatar pose? Answering this question requires identifying which shapes
are more suitable for the defined avatar and pose; and moreover, to provide
fast preview of how to alter the input geometry to better fit the deformed
shapes to the given avatar pose? The problem naturally links physical
proportions of human body and its interaction with object shapes in an attempt
to connect ergonomics with shape geometry. We designed an interaction system
that allows users to explore shape collections using the deformation of human
characters while at the same time providing interactive previews of how to
alter the shapes to better fit the user-specified character. We achieve this by
first mapping ergonomics guidelines into a set of simultaneous multi-part
constraints based on target contacts; and then, proposing a novel contact-based
deformation model to realize multi-contact constraints. We evaluate our
framework on various chair models and validate the results via a small user
study.
