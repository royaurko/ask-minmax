In the past 30 years there have been extensive discoveries in the theory of
integrable statistical mechanical models including the discovery of non-linear
differential equations for Ising model correlation functions, the theory of
random impurities, level crossing transitions in the chiral Potts model and the
use of Rogers-Ramanujan identities to generalize our concepts of Bose/Fermi
statistics. Each of these advances has led to the further discovery of major
unsolved problems of great mathematical and physical interest. I will here
discuss the mathematical advances, the physical insights and extraordinary lack
of visibility of this field of physics.
