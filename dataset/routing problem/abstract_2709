We present an alternative model of coronal-loop oscillations which considers
that the waves are trapped in a 2D waveguide formed by the entire arcade of
field lines. This differs from the standard 1D model which treats the waves as
the resonant oscillations of just the visible bundle of field lines. Within the
framework of our 2D model, the two types of oscillations that have been
observationally identified, flare-induced waves and "decayless" oscillations,
can both be attributed to MHD fast waves. The two components of the signal
differ only because of the duration and spatial extent of the source that
creates them. The flare-induced waves are generated by strong localized sources
of short duration, while the decayless background can be excited by a
continuous, stochastic source. Further, the oscillatory signal arising from a
localized, short-duration source can be interpreted as a pattern of
interference fringes produced by waves that have traveled diverse routes of
various pathlengths through the waveguide. The resulting amplitude of the
fringes slowly decays in time with an inverse square root dependence. The
details of the interference pattern depend on the shape of the arcade and the
spatial variation of the Alfv\'en speed. The rapid decay of this wave
component, which has previously been attributed to physical damping mechanisms
that remove energy from resonant oscillations, occurs as a natural consequence
of the interference process without the need for local dissipation.
