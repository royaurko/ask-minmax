This paper establishes an equivalence between existence of free involutions
on $H{\Bbb C}P^3$ and existence of involutions on $S^6$ with fixed point set an
imbedded $S^3$, then a family of counterexamples of the Smith conjecture for
imbeddings of $S^3$ in $S^6$ are given by known result on $H{\Bbb C}P^3$. In
addition, this paper also shows that every smooth homotopy complex projective
3-space admits no orientation preserving smooth free involution, which answers
an open problem [Pe]. Moreover, the study of existence problem for smooth
orientation preserving involutions on $H{\Bbb C}P^3$ is completed.
