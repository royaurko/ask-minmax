We establish three results dealing with the character varieties of finitely
generated groups. The first two are concerned with the behavior of $\dim
X_n(\Gamma)$ as a function of $n$, and the third addresses the problem of
realizing a $\mathbb{Q}$-defined complex affine algebraic variety as a
character variety.
