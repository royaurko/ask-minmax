Higher order normalizations are performed in the generalized
photogravitational restricted three body problem with Poynting-Robertson drag.
In this problem we have taken bigger primary as a source of radiation and
smaller primary as an oblate spheroid. Whittaker method is used to transform
the second order part of the Hamiltonian into the normal form. We have also
performed Birkhoff's normalization of the Hamiltonian. For this we have tilized
Henrard's method and expanded the coordinates of the infinitesimal body in
double D'Alembert series. We have found the values of first and second order
components. They are affected by radiation pressure, oblateness and P-R drag.
Finally we obtained the third order part of the Hamiltonian zero.
