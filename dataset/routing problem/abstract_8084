Ill posed linear and nonlinear initial value problems may be stabilized, that
it converted to to well posed initial value problems, by the addition of purely
nonscalar linear dispersive terms. This is a stability analog of the Turing
instability. This idea applies to systems of quasilinear Schr\"odinger
equations from nonlinear optics.
