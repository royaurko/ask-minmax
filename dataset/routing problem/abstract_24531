Functional constraints and bi-functional constraints are an important
constraint class in Constraint Programming (CP) systems, in particular for
Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) systems. CP systems with finite domain
constraints usually employ CSP-based solvers which use local consistency, for
example, arc consistency. We introduce a new approach which is based instead on
variable substitution. We obtain efficient algorithms for reducing systems
involving functional and bi-functional constraints together with other
non-functional constraints. It also solves globally any CSP where there exists
a variable such that any other variable is reachable from it through a sequence
of functional constraints. Our experiments on random problems show that
variable elimination can significantly improve the efficiency of solving
problems with functional constraints.
