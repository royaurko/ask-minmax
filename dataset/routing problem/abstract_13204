Finding a common factor of two multivariate polynomials with approximate
coefficients is a problem in symbolic-numeric computing. Taking a tropical view
on this problem leads to efficient preprocessing techniques, applying
polyhedral methods on the exact exponents with numerical techniques on the
approximate coefficients. With Maple we will illustrate our use of tropical
algebraic geometry.
