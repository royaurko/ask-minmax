The problem of estimating small transition probabilities for overdamped
Langevin dynamics is considered. A simplification of Girsanov's formula is
obtained in which the relationship between the infinitesimal generator of the
underlying diffusion and the change of probability measure corresponding to a
change in the potential energy is made explicit. From this formula an
asymptotic expression for transition probability densities is derived.
Separately the problem of estimating the probability that a small noise
Langevin process excapes a potential well is discussed.
