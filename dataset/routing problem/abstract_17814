A theoretical analysis and a practical solution to the fundamental problem of
optimum perfect universal steganography of finite memoryless sources with a
passive warden are provided. The theoretical analysis rests on the fact that
Slepian's Variant I permutation coding implements first-order perfect universal
steganography with maximum embedding rate. The practical solution underlines
the duality between perfect steganography with optimum embedding rate and
lossless source coding with optimum compression rate, since it is shown that
permutation coding can be implemented by means of adaptive arithmetic coding. A
distance constraint between host signal and information-carrying signal must be
observed in universal steganography, and thus an optimum tradeoff between
embedding rate and embedding distortion must be achieved. Partitioned
permutation coding is shown to be the solution to this problem. A practical
implementation of partitioned permutation coding is given that performs close
to an unattainable upper bound on the rate-distortion function of the problem.
