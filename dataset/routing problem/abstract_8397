We investigate the action of the depolarising (qubit) channel on permutation
invariant input states. More specifically, we raise the question on which
invariant subspaces the output of the depolarising channel, given such special
input, is supported. An answer is given for equidistributed states on
isotypical subspaces, also called symmetric Werner states. Horns problem and
two of the corresponding inequalities are invoked as a method of proof.
