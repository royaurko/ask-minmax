Ruscheweyh extended the work of Becker and Ahlfors on sufficient conditions
for a normalized analytic function on the unit disk to be univalent there. In
this paper we refine the result to a quasiconformal extension criterion with
the help of Becker's method. As an application, a positive answer is given to
an open problem proposed by Ruscheweyh.
