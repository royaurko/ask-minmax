Recent developments on the final state of a gravitationally collapsing
massive matter cloud are summarized and reviewed here. After a brief background
on the problem, we point out how the black hole and naked singularity end
states arise naturally in spherical collapse. We see that it is the geometry of
trapped surfaces that governs this phenomena.
