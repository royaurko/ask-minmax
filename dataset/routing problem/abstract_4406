We position Turing's result regarding the undecidability of the halting
problem as a result about programs rather than machines. The mere requirement
that a program of a certain kind must solve the halting problem for all
programs of that kind leads to a contradiction in the case of a recent
unsolvability result regarding the halting problem for programs. In this paper,
we investigate this autosolvability requirement in a setting in which programs
take the form of instruction sequences.
