Formulas are derived for solutions of many-body wave scattering problems by
small particles in the case of acoustically soft, hard, and impedance particles
embedded in an inhomogeneous medium. The case of transmission (interface)
boundary conditions is also studied in detail. The limiting case is considered,
when the size $a$ of small particles tends to zero while their number tends to
infinity at a suitable rate. Equations for the limiting effective
(self-consistent) field in the medium are derived. The theory is based on a
study of integral equations and asymptotics of their solutions as $a\to 0$. The
case of wave scattering by many small particles embedded in an inhomogeneous
medium is also studied.
