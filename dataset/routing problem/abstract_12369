We address the problem of estimating unknown model parameters and state
variables in stochastic reaction processes when only sparse and noisy
measurements are available. Using an asymptotic system size expansion for the
backward equation we derive an efficient approximation for this problem. We
demonstrate the validity of our approach on model systems and generalize our
method to the case when some state variables are not observed.
