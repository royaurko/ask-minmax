We continue the study of the assignment problem for a random cost matrix. We
analyse the number of $k$-cycles for the solution and their dependence on the
symmetry of the random matrix. We observe that for a symmetric matrix one and
two-cycles are dominant in the optimal solution. In the antisymmetric case the
situation is the opposite and the one and two-cycles are suppressed. We solve
the model for a pure random matrix (without correlations between its entries)
and give analytic arguments to explain the numerical results in the symmetric
and antisymmetric case. We show that the results can be explained to great
accuracy by a simple ansatz that connects the expected number of $k$-cycles to
that of one and two cycles.
