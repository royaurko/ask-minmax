The problem MaxLin2 can be stated as follows. We are given a system $S$ of
$m$ equations in variables $x_1,...,x_n$, where each equation is $\sum_{i \in
I_j}x_i = b_j$ is assigned a positive integral weight $w_j$ and $x_i,b_j \in
\mathbb{F}_2$, $I_j \subseteq \{1,2,...,n\}$ for $j=1,...,m$. We are required
to find an assignment of values to the variables in order to maximize the total
weight of the satisfied equations.
  Let $W$ be the total weight of all equations in $S$. We consider the
following parameterized version of MaxLin2: decide whether there is an
assignment satisfying equations of total weight at least $W-k$, where $k$ is a
nonnegative parameter. We prove that this parameterized problem is W[1]-hard
even if each equation of $S$ has exactly three variables and every variable
appears in exactly three equations and, moreover, each weight $w_j$ equals 1
and no two equations have the same left-hand side. We show the tightness of
this result by proving that if each equation has at most two variables then the
parameterized problem is fixed-parameter tractable. We also prove that if no
variable appears in more than two equations then we can maximize the total
weight of satisfied equations in polynomial time.
