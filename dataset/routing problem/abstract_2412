The rapidly growing base of observational data for supernova explosions of
massive stars demands theoretical explanations. Central of these is a
self-consistent model for the physical mechanism that provides the energy to
start and drive the disruption of the star. We give arguments why the delayed
neutrino-heating mechanism should still be regarded as the standard paradigm to
explain most explosions of massive stars and show how large-scale and even
global asymmetries can result as a natural consequence of convective overturn
in the neutrino-heating region behind the supernova shock. Since the explosion
is a threshold phenomenon and depends sensitively on the efficiency of the
energy transfer by neutrinos, even relatively minor differences in numerical
simulations can matter on the secular timescale of the delayed mechanism. To
enhance this point, we present some results of recent one- and two-dimensional
computations, which we have performed with a Boltzmann solver for the neutrino
transport and a state-of-the-art description of neutrino-matter interactions.
Although our most complete models fail to explode, the simulations demonstrate
that one is encouragingly close to the critical threshold because a modest
variation of the neutrino transport in combination with postshock convection
leads to a weak neutrino-driven explosion with properties that fulfill
important requirements from observations.
