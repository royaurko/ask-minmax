In this article, we discuss the semicontinuity problem of certain properties
on fibers for a morphism of Noetherian schemes. One aspect of this problem is
local. Namely, we consider properties of schemes at the level of local rings,
in which the main results are established by solving the lifting and
localization problems for local rings. In particular, we obtain the
localization theorem in the case of seminormal and F-rational rings,
respectively. The second aspect is the global issue, which is related to the
vanishing problem of certain higher direct image sheaves. We discuss the
deformation of globally F-regular varieties in this case.
