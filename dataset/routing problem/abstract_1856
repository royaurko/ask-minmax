Using discrete molecular dynamics simulations we study the relation between
the thermodynamic and diffusive behaviors of a primitive model of aqueous
solutions of hydrophobic solutes consisting of hard spheres in the Jagla
particles solvent, close to the liquid-liquid critical point of the solvent. We
find that the fragile-to-strong dynamic transition in the diffusive behavior is
always coupled to the low-density/high-density liquid transition. Above the
liquid-liquid critical pressure, the diffusivity crossover occurs at the Widom
line, the line along which the thermodynamic response functions show maxima.
Below the liquid-liquid critical pressure, the diffusivity crossover occurs
when the limit of mechanical stability lines are crossed, as indicated by the
hysteresis observed when going from high to low temperature and vice versa.
These findings show that the strong connection between dynamics and
thermodynamics found in bulk water persists in hydrophobic solutions for
concentrations from low to moderate, indicating that experiments measuring the
relaxation time in aqueous solutions represent a viable route for solving the
open questions in the field of supercooled water.
