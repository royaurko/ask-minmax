Consider classical solutions to the following Cauchy problem in a punctured
space: $ &u_t=\Delta u -u^p  \text{in} (R^n-\{0\})\times(0,\infty); &
u(x,0)=g(x)\ge0 \text{in} R^n-\{0\}; &u\ge0 \text{in}
(R^n-\{0\})\times[0,\infty). $ We prove that if $p\ge\frac n{n-2}$, then the
solution to \eqref{abstract} is unique for each $g$. On the other hand, if
$p<\frac n{n-2}$, then uniqueness does not hold when $g=0$; that is, there
exists a nontrivial solution with vanishing initial data.
