We consider the semilinear Lane Emden problem in a smooth bounded simply
connected domain in the plane, invariant by the action of a finite symmetry
group G. We show that if the orbit of each point in the domain, under the
action of the group G, has cardinality greater than or equal to four then, for
p sufficiently large, there exists a sign changing solution of the problem with
two nodal regions whose nodal line does not touch the boundary of the domain.
This result is proved as a consequence of an analogous result for the
associated parabolic problem.
