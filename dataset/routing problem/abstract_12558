Given (M, g0) we consider the problem -{\epsilon}^2Delta_{g0+h}u + u =
(u+)^{p-1} with ({\epsilon}, h) \in (0, {\epsilon}0) \times B{\rho}. Here
B{\rho} is a ball centered at 0 with radius {\rho} in the Banach space of all
Ck symmetric covariant 2-tensors on M. Using the Poincar\'e polynomial of M, we
give an estimate on the number of nonconstant solutions with low energy for
({\epsilon}, h) belonging to a residual subset of (0, {\epsilon}0) \times
B{\rho}, for ({\epsilon}0, {\rho}) small enough.
