In the continuous 1.5-dimensional terrain guarding problem we are given an
$x$-monotone chain (the \emph{terrain} $T$) and ask for the minimum number of
point guards (located anywhere on $T$), such that all points of $T$ are covered
by at least one guard. It has been shown that the 1.5-dimensional terrain
guarding problem is \NP-hard. The currently best known approximation algorithm
achieves a factor of $4$. For the discrete problem version with a finite set of
guard candidates and a finite set of points on the terrain that need to be
monitored, a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) has been presented
[10]. We show that for the general problem we can construct finite guard and
witness sets, $G$ and $W$, such that there exists an optimal guard cover $G^*
\subseteq G$ that covers $T$, and when these guards monitor all points in $W$
the entire terrain is guarded. This leads to a PTAS as well as an (exact) IP
formulation for the continuous terrain guarding problem.
