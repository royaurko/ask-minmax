The restricted version of the Hilbert 16th problem for quadratic vector
fields requires an upper estimate of the number of limit cycles through a
vector parameter that characterizes the vector fields considered and the limit
cycles to be counted. In this paper we give an upper estimate of the number of
limit cycles of quadratic vector fields $"\sigma $--distant from centers and
$\ka $-distant from singular quadratic vector fields" provided that the limit
cycles are $"\delta $--distant from singular points and infinity".
