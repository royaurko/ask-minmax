One of the main pervasive problems Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) encounter
is to maintain flawless communication sharing and cooperative processing
between sensors via radio links to ensure a reliable treatment of information.
Many applications based on these WSNs consider local clocks at each sensor node
that need to be synchronized to a common notion of time. In this context, the
majority of previous researches were focused on the study of protocols, and
algorithms that address these issues in order to resolve synchronization
problems. Previous fforts and empirical studies in wireless sensor network
(WSN) proposed several solutions (algorithms). The focus of this this paper is
to examine and evaluate the most important synchronization algorithms based on
the positions of various quantitative and qualitative synchronization protocols
for energy-efficient information processing and routing in WSNs.
