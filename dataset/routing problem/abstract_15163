We extend to pairs classical results of R. Elkik on lifting of homomorphisms
and algebraization. In particular, we establish algebraization of an affine
rig-smooth formal variety with a rig-smooth closed subvariety. This solves
affirmatively a problem raised by M. Temkin and has applications to
desingularization theory.
