The configuration space of general relativity is superspace - the space of
all Riemannian 3-metrics modulo diffeomorphisms. However, it has been argued
that the configuration space for gravity should be conformal superspace - the
space of all Riemannian 3-metrics modulo diffeomorphisms and conformal
transformations. Taking this conformal nature seriously leads to a new theory
of gravity which although very similar to general relativity has some very
different features particularly in cosmology and quantisation. It should
reproduce the standard tests of general relativity. The cosmology is studied in
some detail. The theory is incredibly restrictive and as a result admits an
extremely limited number of possible solutions. The problems of the standard
cosmology are addressed and most remarkably the cosmological constant problem
is resolved in a natural way. The theory also has several attractive features
with regard to quantisation particularly regarding the problem of time.
