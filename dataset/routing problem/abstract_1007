Noncooperation or failure to work together is a big challenge that surely
degrades the performance and reliability of Mobile Adhoc Networks. In MANETs,
nodes have dual responsibilities of forwarding and routing, that's why it needs
unison with nodes. To sort out non-cooperation a real life behavior should be
implemented, so that misbehavior is nullified. In this paper, we present the
"Mirror Model" that strictly enforces cooperation due to its punishment
strategy. Node's behavior is watched by its neighbors in PON mode, to update
the NPF, NPRF values for a threshold time. After the expiry of the threshold
time each node calculates the PFR and broadcasts its neighbors. Similarly all
neighbors broadcasted PFR is received and processed by the node to define the
'G' and 'BP' values. The G value is used to isolate selfish nodes from the
routing paths and BP denotes the amount of packets to be dropped by an honest
node against a selfish node in spite of its misbehavior/packet drops.
Cooperation within the neighbors, certainly result in subsiding misbehavior of
selfish nodes, therein enhancing cooperation of the whole MANET. This model
ensures honesty and reliability in MANET because it does not eliminate a node,
but it behaves in the same way as the node behaved. Therefore, it justifies its
name, after all mirrors reflects the same. We have implemented the model in
"GloMoSim" on top of the DSR protocol, resulting its effectiveness, as compared
to the DSR protocol when the network is misconducting for its selfish needs.
