In this paper we consider the problem of classification of the nilpotent
class 2 finitely generated torsion free groups up to the geometric equivalence.
By a very easy technique it is proved that this problem is equivalent to the
problem of classification of the complete (in the Maltsev sense) nilpotent
torsion free finite rank groups up to the isomorphism. This result, allows us
to once more comprehend the complication of the problem of the classification
of the quasi-varieties of nilpotent class 2 groups. It is well known that the
variety of a nilpotent class s (for every s) groups is Noetherian. So the
problem of the classification of the quasi-varieties generated even by a single
nilpotent class 2 finitely generated torsion free group, is equivalent to the
problem of classification of complete (in the Maltsev sense) nilpotent torsion
free finite rank groups up to the isomorphism.
