This is the final article in a series of four articles. Richard Karp has
proven that a deterministic polynomial time solution to K-SAT will result in a
deterministic polynomial time solution to all NP-Complete problems. However, it
is demonstrated that a deterministic polynomial time solution to any
NP-Complete problem does not necessarily produce a deterministic polynomial
time solution to all NP-Complete problems.
