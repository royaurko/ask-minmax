Radiation damage is considered to be the major problem that still prevents
imaging an individual biological molecule for structural analysis. So far, all
known mapping techniques using sufficient short wave-length radiation, be it
X-rays or high energy electrons, circumvent this problem by averaging over many
molecules. Averaging, however, leaves conformational details uncovered. Even
the anticipated use of ultra-short but extremely bright X-ray bursts of a Free
Electron Laser shall afford averaging over 10^6 molecules to arrive at atomic
resolution. Here we present direct experimental evidence for non-destructive
imaging of individual DNA molecules. In fact, we show that DNA withstands
coherent low energy electron radiation with deBroglie wavelength in the
Angstrom regime despite a vast dose of 10^8 electrons/nm^2 accumulated over
more than one hour.
