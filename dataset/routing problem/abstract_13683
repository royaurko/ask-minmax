We develop the heuristic PROBI for the probabilistic Euclidean k-median
problem based on a coreset construction by Lammersen et al. Our algorithm
computes a summary of the data and then uses an adapted version of k-means++
(Arthur and Vassilvitskii, 2007) to compute a good solution on the summary. The
summary is maintained in a data stream, so PROBI can be used in a data stream
setting on very large data sets. We experimentally evaluate the quality of the
summary and of the computed solution and compare the running time to state of
the art data stream clustering algorithms.
