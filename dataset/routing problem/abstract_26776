Mobile crowdsensing leverages mobile devices (e.g., smart phones) and human
mobility for pervasive information exploration and collection; it has been
deemed as a promising paradigm that will revolutionize various research and
application domains. Unfortunately, the practicality of mobile crowdsensing can
be crippled due to the lack of incentive mechanisms that stimulate human
participation. In this paper, we study incentive mechanisms for a novel Mobile
Crowdsensing Scheduling (MCS) problem, where a mobile crowdsensing application
owner announces a set of sensing tasks, then human users (carrying mobile
devices) compete for the tasks based on their respective sensing costs and
available time periods, and finally the owner schedules as well as pays the
users to maximize its own sensing revenue under a certain budget. We prove that
the MCS problem is NP-hard and propose polynomial-time approximation mechanisms
for it. We also show that our approximation mechanisms (including both offline
and online versions) achieve desirable game-theoretic properties, namely
truthfulness and individual rationality, as well as O(1) performance ratios.
Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate the correctness and
effectiveness of our approach.
