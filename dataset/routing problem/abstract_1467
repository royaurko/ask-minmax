The search for macroscopic magnetic ordering phenomena in organic materials,
in particular in pure graphite, has been one of the more exciting scientific
activities working in the frontiers of physics, chemistry, and materials
science. In this Letter we report on a novel chemical route leading to
undoubtedly obtain macroscopic quantities of magnetic graphite. This material
has a stable and strong ferromagnetic response even at room temperature where
it can be attracted by a commercial magnet. We have obtained this magnetic
graphite by a vapor reaction consisting of a controlled etching on the graphite
structure. This behavior has been previously predicted and postulated to be
associated to micro-structural characteristics breaking the continuity of the
delocalized p-electron clouds of the graphitic material, thus allowing the
existence of magnetic centers related to the topology.
