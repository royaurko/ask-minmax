As a result of resonance overlap, planetary systems can exhibit chaotic
motion. Planetary chaos has been studied extensively in the Hamiltonian
framework, however, the presence of chaotic motion in systems where dissipative
effects are important, has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we study the
onset of stochastic motion in presence of dissipation, in the context of
classical perturbation theory, and show that planetary systems approach chaos
via a period-doubling route as dissipation is gradually reduced. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that chaotic strange attractors can exist in mildly damped
systems. The results presented here are of interest for understanding the early
dynamical evolution of chaotic planetary systems, as they may have transitioned
to chaos from a quasi-periodic state, dominated by dissipative interactions
with the birth nebula.
