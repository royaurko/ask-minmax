This paper focuses on managing the cost of deliberation before action. In
many problems, the overall quality of the solution reflects costs incurred and
resources consumed in deliberation as well as the cost and benefit of
execution, when both the resource consumption in deliberation phase, and the
costs in deliberation and execution are uncertain and may be described by
probability distribution functions. A feasible (in terms of resource
consumption) strategy that minimizes the expected total cost is termed
computationally-optimal. For a situation with several independent,
uninterruptible methods to solve the problem, we develop a
pseudopolynomial-time algorithm to construct generate-and-test computationally
optimal strategy. We show this strategy-construction problem to be NP-complete,
and apply Bellman's Optimality Principle to solve it efficiently.
