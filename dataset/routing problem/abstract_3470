We construct a class of finitely presented groups where the isomorphism
problem is solvable but the commensurability problem is unsolvable. Conversely,
we construct a class of finitely presented groups within which the
commensurability problem is solvable but the isomorphism problem is unsolvable.
These are first examples of such a contrastive complexity behaviour with
respect to the isomorphism problem.
