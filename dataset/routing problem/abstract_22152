We propose a scaling relation for critical phenomena in which a
symmetry-breaking field is dengerously irrelevant. We confirm its validity on
the 6-state clock model in three and four dimensions by numerical simulation.
In doing so, we point out the problem in the previously-used order parameter,
and present an alternative evidence based on the mass-dependent fluctuation.
