In this manuscript we study quantitatively the predictability of the chiral
critical end point (CEP) position in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model in the
following sense: we use some phenomenological zero temperature quantities (with
a given probability distribution around the experimental values) to compute the
parameters of the model and then we study the distribution of the CEPs in the
($T$, $\mu$) plane.
  To achieve this goal one has to compute efficiently the inverse problem {\it
i.e.} compute the model parameters from the phenomenological inputs: we will
show that an exact inverse problem solution is possible in the NJL model.
  As a first result we show that with a small ($\simeq 1\%$) dispersion around
the phenomenological values, the CEP has a large dispersion and may even
disappears, characterizing a poor predictability.
  Finally we will give a quantitative analysis of this result by studying the
sensibility of a prediction with respect to a variation of the inputs.
