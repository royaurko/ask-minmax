We establish a direct link between the time-reversal technique and the
so-called adjoint method for imaging. Using this relationship, we derive new
solution strategies for an inverse problem which arises in telecommunication.
These strategies are all based on iterative time-reversal experiments, which
try to solve the inverse problem experimentally instead of computationally. We
will focus in particular on examples from underwater acoustic communication and
wireless communication in a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) setup.
