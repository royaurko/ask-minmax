The behaviour of the wave function of the Universe under the barrier for
anisotropic cosmological Bianchi type IX model with account of influence of the
scalar field is explored. In view of known difficulties with interpretation of
multidimensional wave functions the method of reduction of such problems to
one-dimensional is offered. For this purpose in frameworks of semiclassical
approach the system of characteristics equations relative to one variable is
written out. This system describe a bundle of the characteristics along which
the multidimensional problem is reduced to one-dimensional one that allows to
utillize the standard interpretation of the wave function as well as for usual
Schrodinger equation. The obtained results for Bianchi type IX model are
reduced to the following statement: the Universe tunnels through the barrier
from an isotropic state with zero initial value of the scalar field and appear
in classically allowed region with small anisotropy that is necessary for
providing of long-lived inflation for deriving the Universe such as ours.
