The article develops and proves an exponentially convergent
numerical-analytical method (the FD-method) for solving Sturm-Liouville
problems with a singular Legendre operator and a singular potential. Obtained
within are sufficient conditions for convergence of the method and a priori
estimates of its accuracy. A detailed algorithm for programmatic implementation
of the FD-method is presented and compared with known algorithms (SLEIGN2).
