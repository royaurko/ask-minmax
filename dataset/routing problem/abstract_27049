We have proved that the group of all inner automorphisms of the free Burnside
group $B(m,n)$ is the unique normal subgroup in $Aut(B(m,n))$ among all its
subgroups, which are isomorphic to free Burnside group $B(s,n)$ of some rank
$s$ for all odd $n\ge1003$ and $m>1$. It follows that the group of
automorphisms $Aut(B(m,n))$ of the free Burnside group $B(m,n)$ is complete for
odd $n\ge1003$, that is it has a trivial center and any automorphism of
$Aut(B(m,n))$ is inner. Thus, for groups $B(m,n)$ is solved the automorphism
tower problem and is showed that it is as short as the automorphism tower of
the absolutely free groups. Moreover, proved that every automorphism of
$End(B(m,n))$ is a conjugation by an element of $Aut(B(m,n))$.
