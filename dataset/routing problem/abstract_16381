We prove a result of existence of positive solutions of the Dirichlet problem
for $-\Delta_p u=\mathrm{w}(x)f(u,\nabla u)$ in a bounded domain
$\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$, where $\Delta_p$ is the $p$-Laplacian and
$\mathrm{w}$ is a weight function. As in previous results by the contributors, and
in contrast with the hypotheses usually made, no asymptotic behavior is assumed
on $f$, but simple geometric assumptions on a neighborhood of the first
eigenvalue of the $p$-Laplacian operator. We start by solving the problem in a
radial domain by applying the Schauder Fixed Point Theorem and this result is
used to construct an ordered pair of sub- and super-solution, also valid for
nonlinearities which are super-linear both at the origin and at $+\infty$. We
apply our method to the Dirichlet problem $-\Delta_pu = \lambda
u(x)^{q-1}(1+|\nabla u(x)|^p)$ in $\Omega$ and give examples of super-linear
nonlinearities which are also handled by our method.
