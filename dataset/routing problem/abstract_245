The main problem in designing DWDM transport networks is the wavelength
assignment of light paths. One way of solving this problem is to use the
algorithm BCO-RWA. However, BCO-RWA has the following disadvantages: algorithm
not solved the problem of choosing the location of the optical convector in the
network; base algorithm ignores placement optical convector during calculating
route selecting probability; base algorithm do not take into account the
nonlinear four-wave mixing phenomenon. In this paper we present an algorithm
which takes into account a number of disadvantages due to modifications
introduced in the algorithm.
