Communication protocols for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) follow either an
Optimum Routing Approach (ORA) or the Least Overhead Routing Approach (LORA):
With ORA, protocols tend to determine and use the optimal communication
structure at every time instant; whereas with LORA, a protocol tends to use a
chosen communication structure as long as it exists. In this paper, we study
the impact of the ORA and LORA strategies on minimum hop routes and minimum
connected dominating sets (MCDS) in MANETs. Our primary hypothesis is that the
LORA strategy could yield routes with a larger time-averaged hop count and MCDS
node size when compared to the minimum hop count of routes and the node size of
the MCDS determined using the ORA strategy. Our secondary hypothesis is that
the impact of ORA vs. LORA also depends on how long the communication structure
is being used. Our hypotheses are evaluated using extensive simulations under
diverse conditions of network density, node mobility and mobility models such
as the Random Waypoint model, City Section model and the Manhattan model. In
the case of minimum hop routes, which exist for relatively a much longer time
compared to the MCDS, the hop count of routes maintained according to LORA,
even though not dramatically high, is appreciably larger (6-12%) than those
maintained according to ORA; on the other hand, the number of nodes
constituting a MCDS maintained according to LORA is only at most 6% larger than
the node size of a MCDS maintained under the ORA strategy.
