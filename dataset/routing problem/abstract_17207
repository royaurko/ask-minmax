We outline a comprehensive and first-principle solution to the wall-crossing
problem in D=4 N=2 Seiberg-Witten theories. We start with a brief review of the
multi-centered nature of the typical BPS states and recall how the
wall-crossing problem thus becomes really a bound state formation/dissociation
problem. Low energy dynamics for arbitrary collections of dyons is derived,
from Seiberg-Witten theory, with the proximity to the so-called marginal
stability wall playing the role of the small expansion parameter. We find that,
surprisingly, the $\mathbb{R}^{3n}$ low energy dynamics of n+1 BPS dyons cannot
be consistently reduced to the classical moduli space, $\CM$, yet the index can
be phrased in terms of $\CM$. We also explain how an equivariant version of
this index computes the protected spin character of the underlying field
theory, where $SO(3)_\CJ$ isometry of $\CM$ turns out to be the diagonal
subgroup of $SU(2)_L$ spatial rotation and $SU(2)_R$ R-symmetry. The so-called
rational invariants, previously seen in the Kontsevich-Soibelman formalism of
wall-crossing, are shown to emerge naturally from the orbifolding projection
due to Bose/Fermi statistics.
