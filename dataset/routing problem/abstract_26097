The problem of pairing in the $^{1}$S$_{0}$ channel of finite nuclei is
revisited. In nuclear matter forces of separable form can be adjusted to the
bare nuclear force, to any phenomenological pairing interaction such as the
Gogny force or to exact solutions of the gap equation. In finite nuclei,
because of translational invariance, such forces are no longer separable. Using
well known techniques of Talmi and Moshinsky we expand the matrix elements in a
series of separable terms, which converges quickly preserving translational
invariance and finite range. In this way the complicated problem of a cut-off
at large momenta or energies inherent in other separable or zero range pairing
forces is avoided. Applications in the framework of the relativistic Hartree
Bogoliubov approach show that the pairing properties are depicted on almost the
same footing as by the original pairing interaction not only in nuclear matter,
but also in finite nuclei. This simple separable force can be easily applied
for the investigation of pairing properties in nuclei far from stability as
well as for further investigations going beyond mean field theory.
