In this paper have written the results of the information analysis of
structures. The obtained information estimation (IE) are based on an entropy
measure of C. Shannon. Obtained IE is univalent both for the non-isomorphic and
for the isomorphic graphs, algorithmically, it is asymptotically steady and has
vector character. IE can be used for the solution of the problems ranking of
structures by the preference, the evaluation of the structurization of subject
area, the solution of the problems of structural optimization. Information
estimations and method of the information analysis of structures it can be used
in many fields of knowledge (Electrical Systems and Circuit, Image recognition,
Computer technology, Databases and Bases of knowledge, Organic chemistry,
Biology and others) and it can be base for the structure calculus.
