In this paper we consider the problem of the occurrence of spurious modes
when computing the eigenvalues of Dirac operators, with the motivation to
describe relativistic electrons in an atom or a molecule. We present recent
mathematical results which we illustrate by simple numerical experiments. We
also discuss open problems.
