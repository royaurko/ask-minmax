A generalized Randall sundrum model in six dimensional bulk is studied in
presence of non-flat 3-branes at the orbifold fixed points. The warp factors
for this model is determined in terms of multiple moduli and brane cosmological
constant. We show that the requirements of a vanishingly small cosmological
constant on the visible brane along with non-hierarchical moduli, each with
scale close to Planck length, lead to a scenario where the 3-branes can not
have any intermediate scale and have energy scales either close to Tev or close
to Planck scale. Such a scenario can address both the gauge hierarchy as well
as fermion mass hierarchy problem in standard model. Thus simultaneous
resolutions to these problems are closely linked with the near flatness
condition of our universe without any intermediate hierarchical scale for the
moduli.
