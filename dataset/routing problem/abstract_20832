We consider the problem of the flattening of the velocity curves in galactic
discs and the consequent postulation of dark matter from three different but
converging perspectives-- a change in the large scale dimensionality of space,
a variation of $G$ and the MOND approach. We also discuss the paradigm of the
universe itself being a Black Hole.
