In multi-hop mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs),mobile nodes cooperate with each
other without using any infrastructure such as access points or base stations.
Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of
open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative
algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines
of defense. Among the various attacks to which MANETs are vulnerable, malicious
packet dropping attack is very common where a malicious node can partially
degrade or completely disrupt communication in the network by consistently
dropping packets. In this paper, a mechanism for detection of packet dropping
attack is presented based on cooperative participation of the nodes in a MANET.
The redundancy of routing information in an ad hoc network is utilized to make
the scheme robust so that it works effectively even in presence of transient
network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed scheme is
fully cooperative and thus more secure as the vulnerabilities of any election
algorithm used for choosing a subset of nodes for cooperation are absent.
Simulation results show the effectiveness of the protocol.
