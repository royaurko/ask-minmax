QoS is a very important issue for multimedia communication systems. In this
paper, a new system that reinstalls the relation between the QoS elements
(RSVP, routing protocol, sender, and receiver) during the multimedia
transmission is proposed, then an alternative path is created in case of
original multimedia path failure. The suggested system considers the resulting
problems that may be faced within and after the creation of rerouting path.
Finally, the proposed system is simulated using OPNET 11.5 simulation package.
Simulation results show that our proposed system outperforms the old one in
terms of QoS parameters like packet loss and delay jitter.
