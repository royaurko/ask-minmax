In this paper, we apply the Ljusternik-Schnirelman theory with local
Palais-Smale condition to study a class of N-body problems with strong force
potentials and fixed energies. Under suitable conditions on the potential $V$,
we prove the existence of infinitely many non-constant and non-collision
symmetrical periodic solutions .
