We show how to exploit the rich hyperfine structure of fermionic alkali atoms
to produce a quasi-1D topological superfluid while avoiding excessive heating
from off-resonant scattering. We model interacting fermions where four
hyperfine states are coupled by a variety of optical and microwave fields. We
calculate the local density of states in a trap, finding regimes with zero
energy topological edge modes. Heating rates in this system are significantly
suppressed compared to simple Raman-induced spin-orbit coupling approaches.
