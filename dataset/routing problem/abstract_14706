We refer to an action of the group Z/p (p here is an odd prime) on a stably
complex manifold as simple if all its fixed submanifolds have the trivial
normal bundle. The important particular case of a simple action is an action
with only isolated fixed points. The problem of cobordism classification of
manifolds with simple action of Z/p was posed by V.M.Buchstaber and S.P.Novikov
in 1971. The analogous question of cobordism classification with stricter
conditions on Z/p-action was answered by Conner and Floyd. Namely, Conner and
Floyd solved the problem in the case of simple actions with identical sets of
weights (eigenvalues of the differential of the map corresponding to the
generator of Z/p) for all fixed submanifolds of same dimension. However, the
general setting of the problem remained unsolved and is the subject of our
present paper. We have obtained the description of the set of cobordism classes
of stably complex manifolds with simple Z/p-action both in terms of the
coefficients of universal formal group law and in terms of the characteristic
numbers, which gives the complete solution to the above problem. In particular,
this gives a purely cohomological obstruction to the existence of a simple
Z/p-action (or an action with isolated fixed points) on a manifold. We also
review connections with the Conner-Floyd results and with the well-known
Stong-Hattori theorem.
