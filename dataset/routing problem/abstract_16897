In this paper a relation between iterated cyclings and iterated powers of
elements in a Garside group is shown. This yields a characterization of
elements in a Garside group having a rigid power, where 'rigid' means that the
left normal form changes only in the obvious way under cycling and decycling.
It is also shown that, given X in a Garside group, if some power X^m is
conjugate to a rigid element, then m can be bounded above by ||\Delta||^3. In
the particular case of braid groups, this implies that a pseudo-Anosov braid
has a small power whose ultra summit set consists of rigid elements. This
solves one of the problems in the way of a polynomial solution to the conjugacy
decision problem (CDP) and the conjugacy search problem (CSP) in braid groups.
In addition to proving the rigidity theorem, it will be shown how this paper
fits into the contributors' program for finding a polynomial algorithm to the
CDP/CSP, and what remains to be done.
