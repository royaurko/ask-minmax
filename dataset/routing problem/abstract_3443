Some physical problems as flame front propagation or Laplacian growth without
surface tension have nice analytical solutions which replace its complex
integro-differential motion equations by simple differential equations of poles
motion in a complex plane. Investigation of these equation was the main topic
of Kupervasser Oleg Ph.D. Thesis[7]. Some very interesting open problems were
hanged up there. Here we give these open problems and possible ways of their
solutions.
