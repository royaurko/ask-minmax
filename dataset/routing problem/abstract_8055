We consider a generalisation of the classical Lehmer problem about the parity
distribution of an integer and its modular inverse. We use some known estimates
of exponential sums to study a more general question of simultaneous
distribution of the residues of any fixed number of negative and positive
powers of integers in prescribed arithmetic progressions. In particular, we
improve and generalise a recent result of Y. Yi and W. Zhang.
