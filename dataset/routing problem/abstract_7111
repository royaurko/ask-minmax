We consider the constant radial acceleration problem. While the problem is
known to be integrable and has received some recent attention in an orbital
mechanics context, a closed form explicit solution, relating the state
variables to an anomaly, has eluded all researchers so far. We show how such a
solution exists and is elegantly expressed in terms of the Weierstrass elliptic
and related functions $\wp$,$\zeta$ and $\sigma$. We show how previously known
facts can be derived from the new explicit solution and discuss new insights
such an approach reveal.
