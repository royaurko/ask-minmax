We present two comparison principles for viscosity sub- and supersolutions of
Monge-Ampere-type equations associated to a family of vector fields. In
particular, we obtain the uniqueness of a viscosity solution to the Dirichlet
problem for the equation of prescribed horizontal Gauss curvature in a Carnot
group.
