We study the solvability and homogenization of a thermal-diffusion reaction
problem posed in a periodically perforated domain. The system describes the
motion of populations of hot colloidal particles interacting together via
Smoluchowski production terms. The upscaled system, obtained via two-scale
convergence techniques, allows the investigation of deposition effects in
porous materials in the presence of thermal gradients.
