The problem of estimating a sparse channel, i.e. a channel with a few
non-zero taps, appears in various areas of communications. Recently, we have
developed an algorithm based on iterative alternating minimization which
iteratively detects the location and the value of the taps. This algorithms
involves an approximate Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) probability scheme for
detection of the location of taps, while a least square method is used for
estimating the values at each iteration. In this work, based on the method of
factor graphs and message passing algorithms, we will compute an exact solution
for the MAP estimation problem. Indeed, we first find a factor graph model of
this problem, and then perform the well-known min-sum algorithm on the edges of
this graph. Consequently, we will find an exact estimator for the MAP problem
that its complexity grows linearly with respect to the channel memory. By
substituting this estimator in the mentioned alternating minimization method,
we will propose an estimator that will nearly achieve the Cramer-Rao bound of
the genie-aided estimation of sparse channels (estimation based on knowing the
location of non-zero taps of the channel), while it can perform faster than
most of the proposed algorithms in literature.
