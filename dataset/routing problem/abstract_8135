In the present paper we investigate distributional properties of sparse
sequences modulo almost all prime numbers. We obtain new results for a wide
class of sparse sequences which in particular find applications on additive
problems and the discrete Littlewood problem related to lower bound estimates
of the $L_1$-norm of trigonometric sums.
