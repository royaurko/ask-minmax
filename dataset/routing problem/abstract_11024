In [1] a new bosonization procedure has been illustrated, which allows to
express a fermionic gaussian system in terms of commuting variables at the
price of introducing an extra dimension. The Fermi-Bose duality principle
established in this way has many potential applications also outside the
context of gauge field theories in which it has been developed. In this work we
present an application to the problem of averaging the correlation functions
with respect to random potentials in disordered systems and similar problems.
