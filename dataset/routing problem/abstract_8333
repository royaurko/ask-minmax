We determine a general link between two different solutions of the MaxEnt
variational problem, namely, the ones that correspond to using either Shannon's
or Tsallis' entropies in the concomitant variational problem. It is shown that
the two variations lead to equivalent solutions that take different appearances
but contain the same information. These solutions are linked by our
transformation.
