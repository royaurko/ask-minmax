In this paper, we numerically investigate an inverse problem of recovering
the potential term in a fractional Sturm-Liouville problem from one spectrum.
The qualitative behaviors of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are discussed,
and numerical reconstructions of the potential with a Newton method from finite
spectral data are presented. Surprisingly, it allows very satisfactory
reconstructions for both smooth and discontinuous potentials, provided that the
order $\alpha\in(1,2)$ of fractional derivative is sufficiently away from 2.
