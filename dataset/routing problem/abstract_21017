The aim of this paper is to study the modified diagonal cycle in the triple
product of a curve over a global field defined by Gross and Schoen. Our main
result is an identity between the height of this cycle and the
self-intersection of the relative dualising sheaf. We have some applications to
the following problems in number theory and algebraic geometry.
