In this paper we consider the resolvent Stokes problem in the case there is a
small perturbation of the domain caused by a perturbed boundary. Firstly, we
prove that the solution of Stokes problem is continuous due to this small
perturbation. Secondly, we derive the first-order term in the displacement
field perturbation that due to the deformation of the domain. It is worth
emphasizing that even though only the first-order term is given, our method
enables us to derive higher-order terms as well. The derivation is rigorous and
based on layer potential techniques.
