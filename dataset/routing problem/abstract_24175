In this paper after recalling some essential tools concerning the theory of
differential forms in the Cartan, Hodge and Clifford bundles over a Riemannian
or Riemann-Cartan space or a Lorentzian or Riemann-Cartan spacetime we solve
with details several exercises involving different grades of difficult. One of
the problems is to show that a recent formula appearing in the literature for
the exterior covariant derivative of the Hodge dual of the torsion 2-forms is
simply wrong. We believe that the paper will be useful for students (and
eventually for some experts) on applications of differential geometry on
physical problems. A detailed account of the issues discussed in the paper
appears in the table of contents.
