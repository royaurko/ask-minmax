The fundamental solutions of diffusion equation for the local-equilibrium and
nonlocal models are considered as the limiting cases of the solution of a
problem related to consideration of the Brownian particles random walks. The
differences between fundamental solutions were studied. It was shown that on
the period of observation time and distances exceeding the time and space
associated with one step of random walk the fundamental solutions of diffusion
and telegraph equations are very close to each other. In particular, these
fundamental solutions are very close to the values of the probability density
distribution of diffusive particles that is obtained from the accurate solution
of the random walk problem. The new modified non-local diffusion equation is
suggested. It contains only microparameters of the random walk problem.
