We propose bi-directional face traversal algorithm $2FACE$ to shorten the
path the message takes to reach the destination in geometric routing. Our
algorithm combines the practicality of the best single-direction traversal
algorithms with the worst case message complexity of $O(|E|)$, where $E$ is the
number of network edges. We apply $2FACE$ to a variety of geometric routing
algorithms. Our simulation results indicate that bi-directional face traversal
decreases the latency of message delivery two to three times compared to single
direction face traversal. The thus selected path approaches the shortest
possible route. This gain in speed comes with a similar message overhead
increase. We describe an algorithm which compensates for this message overhead
by recording the preferable face traversal direction. Thus, if a source has
several messages to send to the destination, the subsequent messages follow the
shortest route. Our simulation results show that with most geometric routing
algorithms the message overhead of finding the short route by bi-directional
face traversal is compensated within two to four repeat messages.
