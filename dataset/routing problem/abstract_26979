The exact solution of the one-dimensional super-symmetric t-J model under
generic integrable boundary conditions is obtained via the Bethe ansatz
methods. With the coordinate Bethe ansatz, the corresponding R-matrix and
K-matrices are derived for the second eigenvalue problem associated with spin
degrees of freedom. It is found that the second eigenvalue problem can be
transformed to that of the transfer matrix of the inhomogeneous XXX spin chain,
which allows us to obtain the spectrum of the Hamiltonian and the associated
Bethe ansatz equations by the off-diagonal Bethe ansatz method.
