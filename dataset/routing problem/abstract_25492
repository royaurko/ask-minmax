Here we propose an optical method that use phase data of a laser beam
obtained from Shack-Hartmann sensor to estimate both inner and outer scales of
turbulence. The method is based on the sequential analysis of normalized
correlation functions of Zernike coefficients. It allows excluding the value of
refractive index structural constant from the analysis and reduces the solution
of a two-parameter problem to sequential solution of two single-parameter
problems. The method has been applied to analyze the results of measurements of
the laser beam that propagated through a water cell with induced turbulence and
yielded estimates for outer and inner scales.
