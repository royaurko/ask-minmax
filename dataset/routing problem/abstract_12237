Self-interacting dynamics of non-local Dirac's electron has been proposed.
This dynamics was revealed by the projective representation of operators
corresponding to spin/charge degrees of freedom. Energy-momentum field is
described by the system of quasi-linear ``field-shell" PDE's following from the
conservation law expressed by the affine parallel transport in $CP(3)$
\cite{Le1}. We discuss here solutions of these equations in the connection with
the following problems: curvature of $CP(3)$ as a potential source of
electromagnetic fields and the self-consistent problem of the electron mass.
