Analysis of data without labels is commonly subject to scrutiny by
unsupervised machine learning techniques. Such techniques provide more
meaningful representations, useful for better understanding of a problem at
hand, than by looking only at the data itself. Although abundant expert
knowledge exists in many areas where unlabelled data is examined, such
knowledge is rarely incorporated into automatic analysis. Incorporation of
expert knowledge is frequently a matter of combining multiple data sources from
disparate hypothetical spaces. In cases where such spaces belong to different
data types, this task becomes even more challenging. In this paper we present a
novel immune-inspired method that enables the fusion of such disparate types of
data for a specific set of problems. We show that our method provides a better
visual understanding of one hypothetical space with the help of data from
another hypothetical space. We believe that our model has implications for the
field of exploratory data analysis and knowledge discovery.
