In this paper, we consider inverse scattering and inverse boundary value
problems at sufficiently large and fixed energy for the multidimensional
relativistic and nonrelativistic Newton equations in a static external
electromagnetic field $(V,B)$, $V\in C^2,$ $B\in C^1$ in classical mechanics.
Developing the approach going back to Gerver-Nadirashvili 1983's work on an
inverse problem of mechanics, we obtain, in particular, theorems of uniqueness.
