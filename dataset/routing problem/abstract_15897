We establish when the two problems of minimizing a function of lifetime
minimum wealth and of maximizing utility of lifetime consumption result in the
same optimal investment strategy on a given open interval $O$ in wealth space.
To answer this question, we equate the two investment strategies and show that
if the individual consumes at the same rate in both problems -- the consumption
rate is a control in the problem of maximizing utility -- then the investment
strategies are equal only when the consumption function is linear in wealth on
$O$, a rather surprising result. It, then, follows that the corresponding
investment strategy is also linear in wealth and the implied utility function
exhibits hyperbolic absolute risk aversion.
