The asymptotic bound for a length-based attack on the Conjugacy Search
Problem in relatively hyperbolic groups is cubic for hyperbolic elements and a
"small" polynomial for parabolic elements, depending on the Conjugacy Search
Problem for the peripheral subgroups. The bound for relatively hyperbolic
groups in this paper is a significant improvement on previous work.
