The Kaczmarz method is an iterative method for solving large systems of
equations that projects iterates orthogonally onto the solution space of each
equation. In contrast to direct methods such as Gaussian elimination or
QR-factorization, this algorithm is efficient for problems with sparse
matrices, as they appear in constraint-based user interface (UI) layout
specifications. However, the Kaczmarz method as described in the literature has
its limitations: it considers only equality constraints and does not support
soft constraints, which makes it inapplicable to the UI layout problem.
  In this paper we extend the Kaczmarz method for solving specifications
containing soft constraints, using the prioritized IIS detection algorithm.
Furthermore, the performance and convergence of the proposed algorithms are
evaluated empirically using randomly generated UI layout specifications of
various sizes. The results show that these methods offer improvements in
performance over standard methods like Matlab's LINPROG, a well-known efficient
linear programming solver.
