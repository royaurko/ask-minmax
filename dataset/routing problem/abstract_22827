We report the numerical calculations of the static vortex structure and
critical curves in exponentially shaped long Josephson junctions for in-line
and overlap geometries. Each solution of the corresponding boundary value
problem is associated with the Sturm-Liouville problem whose minimal eigenvalue
allows to make a conclusion about the stability of the vortex. The change in
width of the junction leads to the renormalization of the magnetic flux in
comparison to the case of a linear one-dimensional model. We study the
influence of the model's parameters and, particularly, the shape parameter on
the stability of the states of the magnetic flux. We compare the vortex
structure and critical curves for the in-line and overlap geometries. Our
numerically constructed critical curve of the Josephson junction matches well
with the experimental one.
