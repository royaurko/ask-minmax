We give a proof of existence of centre manifolds within large domains for
systems with an integral of motion. The proof is based on a combination of
topological tools, normal forms and rigorous-computer-assisted computations. We
apply our method to obtain an explicit region in which we prove existence of a
center manifold in the planar Restricted Three Body Problem.
