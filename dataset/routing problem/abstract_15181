It is well known that a system of homogeneous second-order ordinary
differential equations (spray) is necessarily isotropic in order to be
metrizable by a Finsler function of scalar flag curvature. In Theorem 3.1 we
show that the isotropy condition, together with three other conditions on the
Jacobi endomorphism, characterize sprays that are metrizable by Finsler
functions of scalar flag curvature. The proof of Theorem 3.1 provides an
algorithm to construct the Finsler function of scalar flag curvature, in the
case when a given spray is metrizable. One condition of Theorem 3.1, regarding
the regularity of the sought after Finsler function, can be relaxed. By
relaxing this condition, we provide examples of sprays that are metrizable by
conic pseudo-Finsler functions as well as degenerate Finsler functions.
  Hilbert's fourth problem asks to determine the Finsler functions with
rectilinear geodesics. A Finsler function that is a solution to Hilbert's
fourth problem is necessarily of constant or scalar flag curvature. Therefore,
we can use the conditions of [11, Theorem 4.1] and Theorem 3.1 to test when the
projective deformations of a flat spray, which are isotropic, are metrizable by
Finsler functions of constant or scalar flag curvature. We show how to use the
algorithms provided by the proofs of [11, Theorem 4.1] and Theorem 3.1 to
construct solutions to Hilbert's fourth problem.
