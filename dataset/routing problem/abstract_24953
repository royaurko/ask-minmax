The light scalar mesons in a variety of approaches are briefly reviewed, as
well as their description in the Resonance-Spectrum Expansion and related
coupled-channel formalisms. A recent multichannel modelling of the light
scalars is extended to higher energies and with additional decay channels,
allowing to make predictions for the intermediate scalar mesons as well.
Prospects for further improvements are discussed.
