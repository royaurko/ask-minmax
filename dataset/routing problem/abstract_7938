This paper deals with the computation of the eigenvalues of non self-adjoint
Sturm-Liouville problems with parameter dependent boundary conditions using the
\textit{regularized sampling method}. A few numerical examples among which
singular ones will be presented to illustrate the merit of the method and
comparison made with the exact eigenvalues when they are available.
