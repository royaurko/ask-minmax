We suggest here a novel nano-laminate, 5[Fe]/2[W$_x$Re$_{1-x}$] (x=0.6-0.8),
with enhanced magnetic hardness in combination with a large saturation moment.
The calculated magnetic anisotropy of this material reaches values of 5.3-7.0
MJ/m$^3$, depending on alloying conditions. We also propose a recipe in how to
identify other novel magnetic materials, such as nano-laminates and
multilayers, with large magnetic anisotropy in combination with a high
saturation moment.
