We discuss marginal deformations of string vacua with Massive boson-fermion
Degeneracy Symmetry (MSDS), in connection to the cosmological evolution of the
Universe from an early non-geometrical era. In particular, we discuss recent
results on the stringy mechanism that resolves both Hagedorn divergences and
the Initial Singularity problem. Based on a talk given at the Workshop on
Cosmology & Strings, Corfu Institute, Greece, Sept 10, 2010.
