We discuss effect of nuclear shadowing in neutrino deep-inelastic scattering
in terms of non perturbative parton model. We found that for small Bjorken $x$
and large $Q^2$ the structure function $F_3$ is shadowed in nuclei about two
times as stronger as $F_2$. The underlying reason and phenomenological aspects
of this observation are discussed.
