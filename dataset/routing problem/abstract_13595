Embarrassingly parallel problems can be split in parts that are characterized
by a really low (or sometime absent) exchange of information during their
computation in parallel. As a consequence they can be effectively computed in
parallel exploiting commodity hardware, hence without particularly
sophisticated interconnection networks. Basically, this means Clusters,
Networks of Workstations and Desktops as well as Computational Clouds. Despite
the simplicity of this computational model, it can be exploited to compute a
quite large range of problems. This paper describes JJPF, a tool for developing
task parallel applications based on Java and Jini that showed to be an
effective and efficient solution in environment like Clusters and Networks of
Workstations and Desktops.
