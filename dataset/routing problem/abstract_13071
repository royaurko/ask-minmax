We describe the sets of accumulation of secants for orbits of real analytic
vector fields in dimension three having the origin as only {\omega}-limit
point. It is a kind of infinitesimal Poincar\'e-Bendixson problem in dimension
three. These sets have structure of cyclic graph when the singularities are
isolated under one blow-up. In the case of hyperbolic reduction of
singularities with conditions of type Morse-Smale, we prove that the
accumulation set is at most a single polycycle isomorphic to {\mathbb S}^1.
