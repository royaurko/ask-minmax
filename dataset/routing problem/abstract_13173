A long standing problem has been to develop "good" binary linear codes to be
used for error-correction. This paper investigates in some detail an attack on
this problem using a connection between quadratic residue codes and
hyperelliptic curves. One question which coding theory is used to attack is:
Does there exist a c<2 such that, for all sufficiently large $p$ and all
subsets S of GF(p), we have |X_S(GF(p))| < cp?
