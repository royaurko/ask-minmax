We consider variational inequality solutions with prescribed gradient
constraints for first order linear boundary value problems. For operators with
coefficients only in $L^2$, we show the existence and uniqueness of the
solution by using a combination of parabolic regularization with a penalization
in the nonlinear diffusion coefficient. We also prove the continuous dependence
of the solution with respect to the data, as well as, in a coercive case, the
asymptotic stabilization as time $t\rightarrow+\infty$ towards the stationary
solution. In a particular situation, motivated by the transported sandpile
problem, we give sufficient conditions for the equivalence of the first order
problem with gradient constraint with a two obstacles problem, the obstacles
being the signed distances to the boundary. This equivalence, in special
conditions, illustrates also the possible stabilization of the solution in
finite time.
