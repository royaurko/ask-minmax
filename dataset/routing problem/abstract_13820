We study a number of variants of an abstract scheduling problem inspired by
the scheduling of reclaimers in the stockyard of a coal export terminal. We
analyze the complexity of each of the variants, providing complexity proofs for
some and polynomial algorithms for others. For one, especially interesting
variant, we also develop a constant factor approximation algorithm.
