We construct analytic solutions for marginal deformations satisfying the
reality condition in open superstring field theory formulated by Berkovits when
operator products made of the marginal operator and the associated
superconformal primary field are regular. Our strategy is based on the recent
observation by Erler that the problem of finding solutions for marginal
deformations in open superstring field theory can be reduced to a problem in
the bosonic theory of finding a finite gauge parameter for a certain pure-gauge
configuration labeled by the parameter of the marginal deformation. We find a
gauge transformation generated by a real gauge parameter which infinitesimally
changes the deformation parameter and construct a finite gauge parameter by its
path-ordered exponential. The resulting solution satisfies the reality
condition by construction.
