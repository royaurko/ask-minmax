Half-inverse spectral problem for a Sturm--Liouville operator consists in
reconstruction of this operator by its spectrum and half of the potential. We
give the necessary and sufficient conditions for solvability of the
half-inverse spectral problem for the class of Sturm--Liouville operators with
singular potentials from the space $W^{-1}_2(0,1)$ and provide the
reconstruction algorithm.
