In this note we show that the non-symmetric version of the classical
Nitsche's method for the weak imposition of boundary conditions is stable
without penalty term. We prove optimal $H^1$-error estimates and
$L^2$-estimates that are suboptimal with half an order in $h$. Both the pure
diffusion and the convection--diffusion problems are discussed.
