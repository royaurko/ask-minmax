A new first integral for the equations corresponding to twisting type-N
vacuum gravitational fields with two non-commuting Killing vectors is
introduced. A new reduction of the problem to a complex second-order ordinary
differential equation is given. Alternatively, the mentioned first integral can
be used in order to provide a first integral of the second-order complex
equation introduced in a previous treatment of the problem.
