We present a perturbative approach to the problem of computation of
mixed-state fidelity susceptibility (MFS) for thermal states. The mathematical
techniques used provides an analytical expression for the MFS as a formal
expansion in terms of the thermodynamic mean values of successively higher
commutators of the Hamiltonian with the operator involved through the control
parameter. That expression is naturally divided into two parts: the usual
isothermal susceptibility and a constituent in the form of an infinite series
of thermodynamic mean values which encodes the noncommutativity in the problem.
If the symmetry properties of the Hamiltonian are given in terms of the
generators of some (finite dimensional) algebra, the obtained expansion may be
evaluated in a closed form. This issue is tested on several popular models, for
which it is shown that the calculations are much simpler if they are based on
the properties from the representation theory of the Heisenberg or SU(1, 1) Lie
algebra.
