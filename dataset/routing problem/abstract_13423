For two vertices $s$ and $t$ in a graph $G=(V,E)$, the next-to-shortest path
is an $st$-path which length is minimum amongst all $st$-paths strictly longer
than the shortest path length. In this paper we show that, when the graph is
undirected and all edge lengths are nonnegative, the problem can be solved in
linear time if the distances from $s$ and $t$ to all other vertices are given.
This result generalizes the previous work (DOI 10.1007/s00453-011-9601-7) to
allowing zero-length edges.
