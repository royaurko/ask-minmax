This paper deals with evaluating constant terms of a special class of
rational functions, the Elliott-rational functions. The constant term of such a
function can be read off immediately from its partial fraction decomposition.
We combine the theory of iterated Laurent series and a new algorithm for
partial fraction decompositions to obtain a fast algorithm for MacMahon's Omega
calculus, which (partially) avoids the "run-time explosion" problem when
eliminating several variables. We discuss the efficiency of our algorithm by
investigating problems studied by Andrews and his cocontributors; our running time
is much less than that of their Omega package.
