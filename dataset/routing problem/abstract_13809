We consider the problem of determining all pairs (c_1, c_2) of Chern classes
of rank 2 bundles that are cokernel of a skew-symmetric matrix of linear forms
in 3 variables, having constant rank 2c_1 and size 2c_1+2. We completely solve
the problem in the "stable" range, i.e. for pairs with c_1^2-4c_2<0, proving
that the additional condition c_2\le {{c_1+1}\choose 2} is necessary and
sufficient. For c_1^2-4c_2\ge 0, we prove that there exist globally generated
bundles, some even defining an embedding of P^2 in a Grassmannian, that cannot
correspond to a matrix of the above type. This extends previous work on c_1\le
