We pointed out in this work that in dealing with the BEC-BCS crossover
problem, the dynamic effect of <b(t)>is not negligible. Accordingly, an
equation of motion approach was devised to calculate the Green$^{\prime}$s
functions. Based on our result, we concluded that instead of crossover, BCS
states and Bose-Einstein condensation always coexist.
