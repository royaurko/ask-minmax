We discusse a relativistic Hamiltonian for an n-body problem in which all the
masses are equal and all spins take value 1/2. In the frame of reference in
which the total momentum $\v{P}=0$, the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation is
applies and the positive energy part of the Hamiltonian is separated. The
Hamiltonian with unharmonic oscillator potential is applied to describe mass
differences for charmonium and bottonium states.
