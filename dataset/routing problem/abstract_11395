We reexamine a recently proposed non-inflationary solution to the monopole
problem, based on the possibility that spontaneously broken Grand-Unified
symmetries do not get restored at high temperature. We go beyond leading order
by studying the self-consistent one-loop equations of the model. We find large
next-to-leading corrections that reverse the lowest order results and cause
symmetry restoration at high temperature.
