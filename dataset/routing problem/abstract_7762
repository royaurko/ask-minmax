We show that a short period of late D-term inflation can solve the
cosmological moduli (radion) problem of (asymmetric) inflation at the TeV
scale. Late inflation happens after the large compact dimensions are stabilized
which is crucial for obtaining the extremely small Hubble constant and inflaton
mass required.
