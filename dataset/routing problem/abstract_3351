Determining the evolutionary history of a given biological data is an
important task in biological sciences. Given a set of quartet topologies over a
set of taxa, the Maximum Quartet Consistency (MQC) problem consists of
computing a global phylogeny that satisfies the maximum number of quartets. A
number of solutions have been proposed for the MQC problem, including Dynamic
Programming, Constraint Programming, and more recently Answer Set Programming
(ASP). ASP is currently the most efficient approach for optimally solving the
MQC problem. This paper proposes encoding the MQC problem with pseudo-Boolean
(PB) constraints. The use of PB allows solving the MQC problem with efficient
PB solvers, and also allows considering different modeling approaches for the
MQC problem. Initial results are promising, and suggest that PB can be an
effective alternative for solving the MQC problem.
