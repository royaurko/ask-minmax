The Burnside Problem asks whether a finitely generated group of exponent n is
finite.
  We present a solution for 2-generator groups of prime power exponent. Results
of P. Hall and G. Higman extends the finiteness conclusion to groups having
composite exponents. Our main result, called the Generalized Burnside Theorem,
is a solvability theorem that applies to a family of groups called GB
(Generalized Burnside) groups that contain infinite as well as finite groups.
The final section discusses the extension to k-generator groups although
details are left for another time.
