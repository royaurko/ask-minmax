The purpose of the present work is to answer an open problem which is raised
by G.Costakis and A.Manoussos in their paper "J-class operators and
hypercyclicity " accepted by J. Operator Theory. More precisely, we give the
spectral description of the closure of the set of J-class operators acting on a
separable Hilbert space.
