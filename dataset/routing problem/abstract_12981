There is a deep underlying problem in the model dependent thermodynamic
analysis of black holes shown in the above quoted paper. In this method one can
only find out the canonical entropy of the black hole but not the
`microcanonical' entropy. Besides this crucial issue a few other problems are
also discussed.
