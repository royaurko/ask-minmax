A singular integral equation with two fixed singularities at the endpoints in
the class of functions bounded at the ends is analyzed. It reduces to a vector
Hilbert problem for a half-disc and then to a vector Riemann-Hilbert problem on
a real axis with a piece-wise constant matrix coefficient. A condition of
solvability and a closed-form solution are derived. For the Chebyshev
polynomials of the first kind in the right hand-side, the solution of the
integral equation is expressed in terms of some nonorthogonal polynomials.
Based on this new spectral relation for the singular operator with two fixed
singularities an approximate solution to the complete singular integral
equation is derived by recasting it as an infinite system of linear algebraic
equations of the second kind. The method is illustrated by solving two problems
of fracture mechanics, the antiplane and plane strain problems for a finite cut
in a composite plane. The plane is formed by a strip and two half-planes; the
elastic constants of the strip are different from those of the half-planes. The
crack is orthogonal to the interfaces, and it is located in the strip with the
ends lying in the interfaces.
