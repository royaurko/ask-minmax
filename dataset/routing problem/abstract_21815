We propose a splitting algorithm for solving a system of composite monotone
inclusions formulated in the form of the extended set of solutions in real
Hilbert spaces. The resluting algorithm is a an extension of the algorithm in
[4]. The weak convergence of the algorithm proposed is proved. Applications to
minimization problems is demonstrated.
