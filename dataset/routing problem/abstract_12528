It is often the case in mathematical analysis that solving an open problem
can be facilitated by finding a new set of coordinates which may illumniate the
known difficulties. In this article, we illustrate how to derive an assortment
coordinates in which to represent the relativistic Boltzmann collision
operator. We show the equivalence between some known representations, and
others which seem to be new. One of these representations has been used
recently to solve several open problems.
