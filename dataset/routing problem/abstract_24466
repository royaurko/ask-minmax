We study the spacetime-reduced (Eguchi-Kawai) version of large-N QCD with
nonzero chemical potential. We explore a method to suppress the sign
fluctuations of the Dirac determinant in the hadronic phase; the method employs
a re-summation of gauge configurations that are related to each other by center
transformations. We numerically test this method in two dimensions, and find
that it successfully solves the silver-blaze problem. We analyze the system
further, and measure its free energy F, the average phase theta of its Dirac
determinant, and its chiral condensate <psi-bar-psi>. We show that F and
<psi-bar-psi> are independent of mu in the hadronic phase but that, as chiral
perturbation theory predicts, the quenched chiral condensate drops from its
mu=0 value when mu~(pion mass)/2. Finally, we find that the distribution of
theta qualitatively agrees with further, more recent, predictions from chiral
perturbation theory.
