CeNi0.8Bi2 is very recent entrant in superconductivity kitchen [1], and the
same seeks reproduction from other groups. We report synthesis, structural
details and superconductivity in CeNi0.8Bi2 compound. The CeNi0.8Bi2 compound
is synthesized by solid state reaction route via vacuum encapsulation of high
purity mixed Ce, Ni, Bi and subsequent heating of the same at 500 0C for 10
hours followed by annealing at 750 0C for 20 hours. As synthesized compounds
are dark grey in color and do crystallize in tetragonal structure with space
group P4/nmm. The lattice parameters are a = 3.61 {\AA} and c = 10.20 {\AA}. AC
susceptibility measurements showed that synthesized CeNi0.8Bi2 compound is
weakly superconducting below 4.2K. We believe our article will regenerate fresh
activity to look for bulk superconductivity in CeNi0.8Bi2.
