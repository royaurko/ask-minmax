Free riding is a major problem in peer-to-peer networks. Reputation
management systems are generally proposed to overcome this problem. In this
paper we have discussed a possible way of resource allocation on the basis of
reputation management system i.e. probabilistic allocation based on reputation.
This seems to be a better way for allocation of resources because in this case
nodes that do not have very good reputation about each other, may also serve
each other at least some amount of resource with finite probability. This
avoids disconnect between them. Algorithms are presented for optimizing the
shared capacity, reputation based probabilistic allocation that is optimal for
a node, and formation of interest groups on the basis of similarity between
interests of nodes.
