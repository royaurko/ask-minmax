The recently proposed supersymmetric $A_4$ model of the neutrino mass matrix
is modified to merge with a previously proposed axionic solution of the strong
CP problem. The resulting model has only one input scale, i.e. that of $A_4$
symmetry breaking, which determines both the seesaw neutrino mass scale and the
axion decay constant. It also solves the $\mu$ problem and conserves R parity
automatically.
