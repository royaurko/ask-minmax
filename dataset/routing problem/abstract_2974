The circuit evaluation problem (also known as the compressed word problem)
for finitely generated linear groups is studied. The best upper bound for this
problem is $\mathsf{coRP}$, which is shown by a reduction to polynomial
identity testing. Conversely, the compressed word problem for the linear group
$\mathsf{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$ is equivalent to polynomial identity testing. In
the paper, it is shown that the compressed word problem for every finitely
generated nilpotent group is in $\mathsf{DET} \subseteq \mathsf{NC}^2$. Within
the larger class of polycyclic groups we find examples where the compressed
word problem is at least as hard as polynomial identity testing for skew
arithmetic circuits.
