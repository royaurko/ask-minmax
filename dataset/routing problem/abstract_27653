In pursuance of integrating Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) with other
systems, the use of techniques from other fields, such as machine learning and
information processing, are becoming more common. Therefore, we faced the
problem of missing network simulations that are not only focused on the packet
exchange between network elements, but also in the data that is transmitted
between them. In other words, we needed a tool that evaluated the WSNs on how
they evolve and react to the environmental changes. To illustrate the benefits
of having such perspective, we explain the kind of simulation problems that we
solved in our last work. Moreover, we outline the next steps in the direction
of creating an extension to support this approach.
