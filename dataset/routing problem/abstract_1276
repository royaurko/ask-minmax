Zr/N co-doped TiO2 nanostructures were successfully synthesized using
nanotubular titanic acid (NTA) as precursors by a facile wet chemical route and
subsequent calcination. These Zr/N-doped TiO2 nanostructures made by NTA
precursors show significantly enhanced visible light absorption and much higher
photocatalytic performance than the Zr/N-doped P25 TiO2 nanoparticles. Impacts
of Zr/N co-doping on the morphologies, optical properties, and photocatalytic
activities of the NTA precursor-based TiO2 were thoroughly investigated. The
origin of the enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity is discussed in
detail.
