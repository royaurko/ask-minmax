We present a thermal inflation model that incorporates the Affleck-Dine
leptogenesis in heavy gravitino/moduli scenario, which solves the
moduli-induced gravitino problem while producing a correct amount of baryon
asymmetry and relic dark matter density. The model involves two singlet flat
directions stabilized by radiative corrections associated with supersymmetry
breaking, one direction that generates the Higgs \mu and B parameters, and the
other direction that generates the scale of spontaneous lepton number
violation. The dark matter is provided by the lightest flatino which might be
identified as the axino if the model is assumed to have a U(1)_{PQ} symmetry to
solve the strong CP problem. We derive the conditions for the model to satisfy
various cosmological constraints coming from the Big-Bang nucleosynthesis and
the dark matter abundance.
