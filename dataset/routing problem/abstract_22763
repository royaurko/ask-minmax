We study the localization of a random heteropolymer onto an homogeneous
surface, the problem which is equivalent to the wetting of an interface at
disordered substrate in two dimensions, via replica trick by using the Green's
function technique. The exact treatment of one- and two-replica binding states
is used to compute the free energy of the random heteropolymer. We present
analytical results for two particular cases: {\it (i)} nearly statistically
symmetric copolymer in the vicinity of the threshold of the annealed problem,
and {\it (ii)} the asymmetric polymer with the interaction part of the annealed
Hamiltonian being nearly zero. In both cases the localization is due to
two-replica binding states. In the case {\it (i)} the two-replica binding state
exists both above and below of the one-replica binding state. In the case {\it
(ii)} the energy of the two-replica binding state at the transition is finite.
A schematic phase diagram of the localization-delocalization transition of the
random heteropolymer is suggested.
