Choosing the regularization parameter for inverse problems is of major
importance for the performance of the regularization method.
  We will introduce a fast version of the Lepskij balancing principle and show
that it is a valid parameter choice method for Tikhonov regularization both in
a deterministic and a stochastic noise regime as long as minor conditions on
the solution are fulfilled.
