Sum rule tests are performed on the spectral data for (i) flavor 'ud' vector-
current-induced hadronic tau decays and (ii) e^+ e^- hadroproduction, in the
region below s~3-4 GeV^2, where discrepancies exist between the isospin-
breaking-corrected charged and neutral current I=1 spectral functions. The tau
data is found to be compatible with expectations based on high-scale
alpha_s(M_Z) determinations, while the electroproduction data displays two
problems. The results favor determinations of the leading order hadronic
contribution to (g-2)_mu which incorporate hadronic tau decay data over those
employing electroproduction data only, and hence a reduced discrepancy between
experiment and the Standard Model prediction for (g-2)_mu.
