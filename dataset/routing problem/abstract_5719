In duty-cycled wireless sensor networks, the nodes switch between active and
dormant states, and each node may determine its active/dormant schedule
independently. This complicates the Minimum-Energy Multicasting (MEM) problem,
which has been primarily studied in always-active wireless ad-hoc networks. In
this paper, we study the duty-cycle-aware MEM problem in wireless sensor
networks, and we present a formulation of the Minimum-Energy Multicast Tree
Construction and Scheduling (MEMTCS) problem. We prove that the MEMTCS problem
is NP-hard, and it is unlikely to have an approximation algorithm with a
performance ratio of $(1-o(1))\ln\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum node
degree in a network. We propose a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for
the MEMTCS problem with a performance ratio of $\mathcal{O}(H(\Delta+1))$,
where $H(\cdot)$ is the harmonic number. We also provide a distributed
implementation of our algorithm. Finally, we perform extensive simulations and
the results demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperform other known
algorithms in terms of both the total energy cost and the transmission
redundancy.
