Quantified constraints and Quantified Boolean Formulae are typically much
more difficult to reason with than classical constraints, because quantifier
alternation makes the usual notion of solution inappropriate. As a consequence,
basic properties of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP), such as consistency
or substitutability, are not completely understood in the quantified case.
These properties are important because they are the basis of most of the
reasoning methods used to solve classical (existentially quantified)
constraints, and one would like to benefit from similar reasoning methods in
the resolution of quantified constraints. In this paper, we show that most of
the properties that are used by solvers for CSP can be generalized to
quantified CSP. This requires a re-thinking of a number of basic concepts; in
particular, we propose a notion of outcome that generalizes the classical
notion of solution and on which all definitions are based. We propose a
systematic study of the relations which hold between these properties, as well
as complexity results regarding the decision of these properties. Finally, and
since these problems are typically intractable, we generalize the approach used
in CSP and propose weaker, easier to check notions based on locality, which
allow to detect these properties incompletely but in polynomial time.
