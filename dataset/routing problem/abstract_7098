We study the problem of computing semantic-preserving word clouds in which
semantically related words are close to each other. While several heuristic
approaches have been described in the literature, we formalize the underlying
geometric algorithm problem: Word Rectangle Adjacency Contact (WRAC). In this
model each word is associated with rectangle with fixed dimensions, and the
goal is to represent semantically related words by ensuring that the two
corresponding rectangles touch. We design and analyze efficient polynomial-time
algorithms for some variants of the WRAC problem, show that several general
variants are NP-hard, and describe a number of approximation algorithms.
Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that our theoretically-sound algorithms
outperform the early heuristics.
