A Parity-Time (PT)-symmetric system with periodically varying-in-time gain
and loss modeled by two coupled Schrodinger equations (dimer) is studied. It is
shown that the problem can be reduced to a perturbed pendulum-like equation.
This is done by finding two constants of motion. Firstly, a generalized problem
using Melnikov type analysis and topological degree arguments is studied for
showing the existence of periodic (libration), shift periodic (rotation), and
chaotic solutions. Then these general results are applied to the PT-symmetric
dimer. It is interestingly shown that if a sufficient condition is satisfied,
then rotation modes, which do not exist in the dimer with constant gain-loss,
will persist. An approximate threshold for PT-broken phase corresponding to the
disappearance of bounded solutions is also presented. Numerical study is
presented accompanying the analytical results.
