The Dynamic Source Routing protocol (DSR) is a simple and efficient routing
protocol designed specifically for use in multi-hop wireless ad hoc networks of
mobile nodes. Preemptive DSR(PDSR) is the modified version of DSR. The main
objective of this paper is to analyze and compare the performance of Preemptive
DSR and Temporarily Ordered Routing Algorithm(TORA).It discusses the effect of
variation in number of nodes and average speed on protocol performance.
Simulation results (provided by the instructor) are analyzed to get an insight
into the operation of TORA and PDSR in small/large sized networks with
slow/fast moving nodes. Results show that PDSR outperforms TORA in terms of the
number of MANET control packets used to maintain/erase routes. Also, it is
concluded that TORA is a better choice than PDSR for fast moving highly
connected set of nodes. It is also observed that DSR provides better data
throughput than TORA and that routes can be created faster in PDSR than in
TORA. This paper tries to explain the reasons behind the nature of the results.
