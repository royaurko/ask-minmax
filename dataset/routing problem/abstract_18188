Calibration refers to the process of adjusting features of a computational
model that are not observed in the physical process so that the model matches
the real process. We propose a framework for calibration when the unobserved
features, i.e. calibration parameters, do not assume a single value, but are
functionally dependent on other inputs. We demonstrate that this problem is
curve to surface matching where the matched curve does not possess the same
length as the original curve. Therefore, we perform non-isometric matching of a
curve to a surface. Since in practical applications we do not observe a
continuous curve but a sample of data points, we use a graph-theoretic approach
to solve this matching of incomplete data. We define a graph structure in which
the nodes are selected from the incomplete surface and the weights of the edges
are decided based on the response values of the curve and surface. We show that
the problem of non-isometric incomplete curve to surface matching is a shortest
path problem in a directed acyclic graph. We apply the proposed method,
graph-theoretic non-isometric matching, to real and synthetic data and
demonstrate that the proposed method improves the prediction accuracy in
functional calibration.
