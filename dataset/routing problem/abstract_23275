The two possible Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) solutions of the solar
neutrino problem (one at small and the other at large mixing angle), up to now
tested mainly through absolute neutrino flux measurements, require
flux-independent tests both for a decisive confirmation and for their
discrimination. To this end, we perform a joint analysis of various
flux-independent observables that can be measured at the SuperKamiokande and
Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) experiments. In particular, we analyze the
recent data collected at SuperKamiokande after 374 days of operation, work out
the corresponding predictions for SNO, and study the interplay between
SuperKamiokande and SNO observables. It is shown how, by using only
flux-independent observables from SuperKamiokande and SNO, one can discriminate
between the two MSW solutions and separate them from the no oscillation case.
