This book chapter reviews signal detection and parameter estimation
techniques for multiuser multiple-antenna wireless systems with a very large
number of antennas, known as massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems.
We consider both centralized antenna systems (CAS) and distributed antenna
systems (DAS) architectures in which a large number of antenna elements are
employed and focus on the uplink of a mobile cellular system. In particular, we
focus on receive processing techniques that include signal detection and
parameter estimation problems and discuss the specific needs of massive MIMO
systems. Simulation results illustrate the performance of detection and
estimation algorithms under several scenarios of interest. Key problems are
discussed and future trends in massive MIMO systems are pointed out.
