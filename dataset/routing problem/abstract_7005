In this paper, we present a new mutation operator, Hybrid Mutation (HPRM),
for a genetic algorithm that generates high quality solutions to the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP). The Hybrid Mutation operator constructs an offspring
from a pair of parents by hybridizing two mutation operators, PSM and RSM. The
efficiency of the HPRM is compared as against some existing mutation operators;
namely, Reverse Sequence Mutation (RSM) and Partial Shuffle Mutation (PSM) for
BERLIN52 as instance of TSPLIB. Experimental results show that the new mutation
operator is better than the RSM and PSM.
