We consider evolutionary reaction-diffusion problem with mixed
Dirichlet--Robin boundary conditions. For this class of problems, we derive
two-sided estimates of the distance between any function in the admissible
energy space and exact solution of the problem. The estimates (majorants and
minorants) are explicitly computable and do not contain unknown functions or
constants. Moreover, it is proved that the estimates are equivalent to the
energy norm of the deviation from the exact solution.
