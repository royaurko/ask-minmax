Attempts to quantize general relativity encounter an odd problem. The
Hamiltonian that normally generates time evolution vanishes in the case of
general relativity as a result of diffeomorphism invariance. The theory seems
to be saying that time does not exist. The most obvious feature of our world,
namely that time seems to progress and that the world changes accordingly
becomes a problem in this presumably fundamental theory. This is called the
problem of time. In this essay we argue that this problem is the result of an
unphysical idealization. We are caught in this "problem of time" trap because
we took a wrong turn in the early days of relativity by permanently including a
split of geometry and matter into our physical theories. We show that another
possibility exists that circumvents the problem of time and also sheds new
light on other problems like the cosmological constant problem and the horizon
problem in early universe cosmology.
