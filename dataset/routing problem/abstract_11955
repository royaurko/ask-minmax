A parameter estimation problem is considered for a stochastic parabolic
equation with multiplicative noise under the assumption that the equation can
be reduced to an infinite system of uncoupled diffusion processes. From the
point of view of classical statistics, this problem turns out to be singular
not only for the original infinite-dimensional system but also for most
finite-dimensional projections. This singularity can be exploited to improve
the rate of convergence of traditional estimators as well as to construct
completely new closed-form exact estimator.
