The paper studies the visibility maintenance problem (VMP) for a
leader-follower pair of Dubins-like vehicles with input constraints, and
proposes an original solution based on the notion of controlled invariance. The
nonlinear model describing the relative dynamics of the vehicles is interpreted
as linear uncertain system, with the leader robot acting as an external
disturbance. The VMP is then reformulated as a linear constrained regulation
problem with additive disturbances (DLCRP). Positive D-invariance conditions
for linear uncertain systems with parametric disturbance matrix are introduced
and used to solve the VMP when box bounds on the state, control input and
disturbance are considered. The proposed design procedure is shown to be easily
adaptable to more general working scenarios. Extensive simulation results are
provided to illustrate the theory and show the effectiveness of our approach
