We prove that any MV-algebra has a faithful state can be embedded in an
\em{f}MV-algebra of integrable functions. As consequence, we prove H\"older's
inequality and Hausdorff moment problem for MV-algebras with product and we
propose a solution for the stochastic independence of probability MV-algebras.
