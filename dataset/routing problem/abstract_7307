In this work we study differential problems in which the reflection operator
and the Hilbert transform are involved. We reduce these problems to ODEs in
order to solve them. Also, we describe a general method for obtaining the
Green's function of reducible functional differential equations and illustrate
it with the case of homogeneous boundary value problems with reflection and
several specific examples.
