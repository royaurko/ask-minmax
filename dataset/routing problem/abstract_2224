The development of selective high precision chemical functionalization
strategies for device fabrication, in conjunction with associated techniques
for patterning graphene wafers with atomic accuracy would provide the necessary
basis for a post-CMOS manufacturing technology. This requires a thorough
understanding of the principles governing the reactivity and patterning of
graphene at the sub-nanometer length scale. This article reviews our quest to
delineate the principles of graphene chemistry - that is, the chemistry at the
Dirac point and beyond, and the effect of covalent chemistry on the electronic
structure, electrical transport and magnetic properties of this low-dimensional
material in order to enable the scalable production of graphene-based devices
for low- and high-end technology applications.
