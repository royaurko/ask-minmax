In this paper, we consider unsupervised partitioning problems, such as
clustering, image segmentation, video segmentation and other change-point
detection problems. We focus on partitioning problems based explicitly or
implicitly on the minimization of Euclidean distortions, which include
mean-based change-point detection, K-means, spectral clustering and normalized
cuts. Our main goal is to learn a Mahalanobis metric for these unsupervised
problems, leading to feature weighting and/or selection. This is done in a
supervised way by assuming the availability of several potentially partially
labelled datasets that share the same metric. We cast the metric learning
problem as a large-margin structured prediction problem, with proper definition
of regularizers and losses, leading to a convex optimization problem which can
be solved efficiently with iterative techniques. We provide experiments where
we show how learning the metric may significantly improve the partitioning
performance in synthetic examples, bioinformatics, video segmentation and image
segmentation problems.
