A recently formulated statistical mechanics method is used to study the phase
transition occurring in a generalisation of the Traveling Salesman Problem
(TSP) known as the centred TSP. The method shows that the problem has clear
signs of a crossover, but is only able to access (unscaled) finite temperatures
above the transition point. The solution of the problem using this method
displays a curious duality.
