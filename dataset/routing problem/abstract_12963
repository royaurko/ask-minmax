The problem of existence of closed knight tours for rectangular chessboards
was solved by Schwenk in 1991. Last year, in 2011, DeMaio and Mathew provide an
extension of this result for 3-dimensional rectangular boards. In this article,
we give the solution for $n$-dimensional rectangular boards, for $n\geq 4$.
