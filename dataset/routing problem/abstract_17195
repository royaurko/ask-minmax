In this paper, we study the isomorphism problem for linear representations. A
linear representation Tn*(K) of a point set K is a point-line geometry,
embedded in a projective space PG(n+1,q), where K is contained in a hyperplane.
We put constraints on K which ensure that every automorphism of Tn*(K) is
induced by a collineation of the ambient projective space. This allows us to
show that, under certain conditions, two linear representations Tn*(K) and
Tn*(K') are isomorphic if and only if the point sets K and K' are
PGammaL-equivalent. We also deal with the slightly more general problem of
isomorphic incidence graphs of linear representations. In the last part of this
paper, we give an explicit description of the group of automorphisms of Tn*(K)
that are induced by collineations of PG(n+1,q).
