A diamond is a graph obtained by removing an edge from a complete graph on
four vertices. A graph is diamond-free if it does not contain an induced
diamond. The Diamond-free Edge Deletion problem asks to find whether there
exist at most $k$ edges in the input graph whose deletion results in a
diamond-free graph. The problem is known to be fixed-parameter tractable and a
polynomial kernel of $O(k^5)$ vertices is found by Y. Cai [MPhil Thesis, 2012].
  In this paper, we give an improved kernel of $O(k^3)$ vertices for
Diamond-free Edge Deletion. We complement the result by proving that the
problem is NP-complete and cannot be solved in time $2^{o(k)}\cdot n^{O(1)}$,
unless Exponential Time Hypothesis fails.
