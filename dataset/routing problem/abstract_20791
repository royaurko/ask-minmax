Formalism based on complex-scaling method is developed for solving the few
particle scattering problem by employing only trivial boundary conditions.
Several applications are presented proving efficiency of the method in
describing elastic and three-body break-up reactions for Hamiltonians which may
include both short and long-range interaction.
