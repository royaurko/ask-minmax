We introduce $3N\times 3N$ Lax pair with spectral parameter for
Calogero-Inozemtsev model. The one degree of freedom case appears to have
$2\times 2$ Lax representation. We derive it from the elliptic Gaudin model via
some reduction procedure and prove algebraic integrability. This Lax pair
provides elliptic linear problem for the Painlev{\'e} VI equation in elliptic
form.
