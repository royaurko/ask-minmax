We solve the inverse problem of deblurring a pixelized image of Jupiter using
regularized deconvolution and by sample-based Bayesian inference. By
efficiently sampling the marginal posterior distribution for hyperparameters,
then the full conditional for the deblurred image, we find that we can perform
posterior sampling \emph{faster} than regularized inversion, when selection of
the regularizing parameter is considered. Comparison to random-walk
Metropolis-Hastings and block Gibbs MCMC shows that marginal then conditional
sampling also outperforms these more common sampling algorithms, and has much
better scaling with problem size. These conclusions also hold for other
linear-Gaussian inverse problems when problem-specific computations are
feasible, and in the infinite dimensional limit when that limit exists,
implying that sample-based Bayesian inference may be performed more cheaply
than regularized inversion and directly over function spaces.
