This volume contains the proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on
Synthesis of Continuous Parameters (SynCoP'14). The workshop was held in
Grenoble, France on April 6th, 2014, as a satellite event of the 17th European
Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS'14).
  SynCoP aims at bringing together researchers working on parameter synthesis
for systems with continuous variables, where the parameters consist of a
(usually dense) set of constant values. Synthesis problems for such parameters
arise for real-time, hybrid or probabilistic systems in a large variety
application domains. A parameter could be, e.g., a delay in a real-time system,
or a reaction rate in a biological cell model. The objective of the synthesis
problem is to identify suitable parameters to achieve desired behavior, or to
verify the behavior for a given range of parameter values.
  This volume contains seven contributions: two invited talks and five regular
papers.
