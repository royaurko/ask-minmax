This paper reviews some major episodes in the history of the spatial
isomorphism problem of dynamical systems theory (ergodic theory). In
particular, by analysing, both systematically and in historical context, a
hitherto unpublished letter written in 1941 by John von Neumann to Stanislaw
Ulam, this paper clarifies von Neumann's contribution to discovering the
relationship between spatial isomorphism and spectral isomorphism. The main
message of the paper is that von Neumann's argument described in his letter to
Ulam is the very first proof that spatial isomorphism and spectral isomorphism
are not equivalent because spectral isomorphism is weaker than spatial
isomorphism: von Neumann shows that spectrally isomorphic ergodic dynamical
systems with mixed spectra need not be spatially isomorphic.
