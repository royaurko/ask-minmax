This paper presents a new method for finding the node-disjoint paths with
maximum combined bandwidth in communication networks. This problem is an
NP-complete problem which can be optimally solved in exponential time using
integer linear programming (ILP). The presented method uses a maximum-cost
variant of Dijkstra algorithm and a virtual-node representation to obtain the
maximum-bandwidth node-disjoint path. Through several simulations, we compare
the performance of our method to a modern heuristic technique and to the ILP
solution. We show that, in a polynomial execution time, our proposed method
produces results that are almost identical to ILP in a significantly lower
execution time.
