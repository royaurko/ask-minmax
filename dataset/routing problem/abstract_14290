We study inverse spectral problems for ordinary differential equations with
regular singularities on compact star-type graphs when differential equations
have different orders on diferent edges. As the main spectral characteristics
we introduce and study the so-called Weyl-type matrices which are
generalizations of the Weyl function for the classical Sturm-Liouville
operator. We provide a procedure for constructing the solution of the inverse
problem and prove its uniqueness.
