The Poincare Problem can be reduced to a problem on fibered surfaces,
concretely, to bound the genus of the fibration by means of numerical
information of the canonical sheaf of the associated foliation. In this paper
we: 1. explain how this reduction can be carried out, 2. apply unipotent
reduction to obtain some possible answers to the problem, 3. obtain an answer
under some hypotheses on the eigenvalues of the singularities of the foliation
