The tight correlation of galactic velocity distribution to both luminosity
and its black hole mass and the relation of halo parameters to luminous mass
distribution, can not be due to collapse dynamics. A big bang shell can solve
galaxy formation problems by forming the supermassive black holes necessary to
capture the initial blast wave in a coordinated pattern.
