We study initial value problem for a system consisting of an integer order
and distributed-order fractional differential equation describing forced
oscillations of a body attached to a free end of a light viscoelastic rod.
Explicit form of a solution for a class of linear viscoelastic solids is given
in terms of a convolution integral. Restrictions on storage and loss moduli
following from the Second Law of Thermodynamics play the crucial role in
establishing the form of the solution. Some previous results are shown to be
special cases of the present analysis.
