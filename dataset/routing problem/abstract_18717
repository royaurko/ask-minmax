Structural quantities such as order parameters and correlation functions are
often employed to gain insight into the physical behavior and properties of
condensed matter systems. While standard quantities for characterizing
structure exist, often they are insufficient for treating problems in the
emerging field of nano and microscale self-assembly, where the structures
encountered may be complex and unusual. The computer science field of "shape
matching" offers a robust solution to this problem by defining diverse methods
for quantifying the similarity between arbitrarily complex shapes. Most order
parameters and correlation functions used in condensed matter apply a specific
measure of structural similarity within the context of a broader scheme. By
substituting shape matching quantities for traditional quantities, we retain
the essence of the broader scheme, but extend its applicability to more complex
structures. Here we review some standard shape matching techniques and discuss
how they might be used to create highly flexible structural metrics for diverse
systems such as self-assembled matter. We provide three proof-of-concept
example problems applying shape matching methods to identifying local and
global structures, and tracking structural transitions in complex assembled
systems. The shape matching methods reviewed here are applicable to a wide
range of condensed matter systems, both simulated and experimental, provided
particle positions are known or can be accurately imaged.
