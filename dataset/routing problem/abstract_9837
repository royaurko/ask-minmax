Wide-baseline matching focussing on problems with extreme viewpoint change is
considered. We introduce the use of view synthesis with affine-covariant
detectors to solve such problems and show that matching with the Hessian-Affine
or MSER detectors outperforms the state-of-the-art ASIFT.
  To minimise the loss of speed caused by view synthesis, we propose the
Matching On Demand with view Synthesis algorithm (MODS) that uses progressively
more synthesized images and more (time-consuming) detectors until reliable
estimation of geometry is possible. We show experimentally that the MODS
algorithm solves problems beyond the state-of-the-art and yet is comparable in
speed to standard wide-baseline matchers on simpler problems.
  Minor contributions include an improved method for tentative correspondence
selection, applicable both with and without view synthesis and a view synthesis
setup greatly improving MSER robustness to blur and scale change that increase
its running time by 10% only.
