The recent data for Bose-Einstein Correlations (BEC) of three-charged
particles obtained by NA44 Collaboration have been analysed using theoretical
formula with Coulomb wave functions. It has been recently proposed by Alt et
al. It turns out that there are discrepancies between these data and the
respective theoretical values. To resolve this problem we seek a possibly
modified theoretical formulation of this problem by introducing the degree of
coherence for the exchange effect due to the BEC between two-identical bosons.
As a result we obtain a modified formulation for the BEC of three-charged
particles showing good agreement with the data. Moreover, we investigate
physical connection between our modified formulation and the core-halo model
proposed by Csorgo et al. Our study indicates that the interaction region
estimated by the BEC of three-charged particles in the S + Pb collisions at 200
GeV/c per nucleon is equal to about 1.5 fm~1.8 fm.
