A classic problem, the design of the tallest column, is solved again using a
different method. By the use of a similarity solution the equations are
transformed and the difficult singularity at the endpoint is peeled away. The
resulting autonomous system has a critical point and the solution must be on
its stable manifold. The solution is found by starting near the critical point
in the direction of the stable manifold, and solving backwards numerically.
This removes the need for an iterative integration method that was previously
used. The method is shown to work for clamped or hinged boundary condition and
can also be used for other problems involving singularities at the endpoints.
