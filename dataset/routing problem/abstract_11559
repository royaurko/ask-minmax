The Adams spectral sequence was invented by J.F.Adams fifty years ago for
calculations of stable homotopy groups of topological spaces and in particular
of spheres. The calculation of differentials of this spectral sequence is one
of the most difficult problem of Algebraic Topology. Here we consider an
approach to find inductive formulas for the differentials. It is based on the
A_\infty-structures, E_\infty-structures and functional homology operations. As
This approach it will be applied to the Kervaire invariant problem.
