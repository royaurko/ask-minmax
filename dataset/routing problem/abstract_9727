Detection and elimination of redundant clauses from propositional formulas in
Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) is a fundamental problem with numerous
application domains, including AI, and has been the subject of extensive
research. Moreover, a number of recent applications motivated various
extensions of this problem. For example, unsatisfiable formulas partitioned
into disjoint subsets of clauses (so-called groups) often need to be simplified
by removing redundant groups, or may contain redundant variables, rather than
clauses. In this report we present a generalized theoretical framework of
labelled CNF formulas that unifies various extensions of the redundancy
detection and removal problem and allows to derive a number of results that
subsume and extend previous work. The follow-up reports contain a number of
additional theoretical results and algorithms for various computational
problems in the context of the proposed framework.
