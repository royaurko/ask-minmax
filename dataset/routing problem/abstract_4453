In the deterministic context Bakushinskii's theorem excludes the existence of
purely data driven convergent regularization for ill-posed problems. We will
prove in the present work that in the statistical setting we can either
construct a counter example or develop an equivalent formulation depending on
the considered class of probability distributions. Hence, Bakushinskii's
theorem does not generalize to the statistical context, although this has often
been assumed in the past. To arrive at this conclusion, we will deduce from the
classic theory new concepts for a general study of statistical inverse problems
and perform a systematic clarification of the key ideas of statistical
regularization.
