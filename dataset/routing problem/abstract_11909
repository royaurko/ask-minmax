Relying on the variational principle, it is proved that new contradictions
emerge from an analysis of the Lagrangian density of the Klein-Gordon field:
normalization problems arise and interaction with external electromagnetic
fields cannot take place. By contrast, the Dirac equation is free of these
problems. Other inconsistencies arise if the Klein-Gordon field is regarded as
a classical field.
