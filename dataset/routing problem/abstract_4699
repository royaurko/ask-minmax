We investigate a new application of Difference of Convex functions
programming and DCA in solving the constrained two-dimensional non-guillotine
cutting problem. This problem consists of cutting a number of rectangular
pieces from a large rectangular object. The cuts are done under some
constraints and the objective is to maximize the total value of the pieces cut.
We reformulate this problem as a DC program and solve it by DCA. The
performance of the approach is compared with the standard solver CPLEX.
