Inflation is a promising solution to many problems of the standard Big-Bang
cosmology. Nevertheless, inflationary models have proved less compelling. In
this chapter, we discuss why supersymmetry has led to more natural models of
inflation. We pay particular attention to multifield models, both with a high
and a low Hubble parameter.
