We discuss the decomposability of torsion-free abelian groups. We show that
among computable groups of finite rank this property is $\Sigma^0_3$-complete.
However, when we consider groups of infinite rank, it becomes
$\Sigma^1_1$-complete, so it cannot be characterized by a first-order formula
in the language of arithmetic.
