An enhanced covering lemma for a Markov chain is proved in this paper, and
then the distributed source coding problem of correlated general sources with
one average distortion criterion under fixed-length coding is investigated.
Based on the enhanced lemma, a sufficient and necessary condition for
determining the achievability of rate-distortion triples is given.
