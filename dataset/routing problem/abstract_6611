This paper presents a few additions to commutant lifting theory. An operator
interpolation problem is introduced and shown to be equivalent to the relaxed
commutant lifting problem. Using this connection a description of all solutions
of the former problem is given. Also a new application, involving bounded
operators induced by $H^2$ operator-valued functions, is presented.
