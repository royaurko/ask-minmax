Recently, fractional derivatives have been employed to analyze various
systems in engineering, physics, finance and hidrology. For instance, they have
been used to investigate anomalous diffusion processes which are present in
different physical systems like: amorphous semicondutors, polymers, composite
heterogeneous films and porous media. They have also been used to calculate the
heat load intensity change in blast furnace walls, to solve problems of control
theory \ and dynamic problems of linear and nonlinear hereditary mechanics of
solids. In this work, we investigate the scaling properties related to the
nonlinear fractional diffusion equations and indicate the possibilities to the
applications of these equations to simulate the water transport in unsaturated
soils. Usually, the water transport in soils with anomalous diffusion, the
dependence of concentration on time and distance may be expressed in term of a
single variable given by $\lambda _{q}=x/t^{q}.$ In particular, for $q=1/2$ the
systems obey Fick's law and Richards' equation for water transport. We show
that a generalization of Richards' equation via fractional approach can
incorporate the above property.
