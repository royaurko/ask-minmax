Data centers consume a large amount of energy and incur substantial
electricity cost. In this paper, we study the familiar problem of reducing data
center energy cost with two new perspectives. First, we find, through an
empirical study of contracts from electric utilities powering Google data
centers, that demand charge per kW for the maximum power used is a major
component of the total cost. Second, many services such as Web search tolerate
partial execution of the requests because the response quality is a concave
function of processing time. Data from Microsoft Bing search engine confirms
this observation.
  We propose a simple idea of using partial execution to reduce the peak power
demand and energy cost of data centers. We systematically study the problem of
scheduling partial execution with stringent SLAs on response quality. For a
single data center, we derive an optimal algorithm to solve the workload
scheduling problem. In the case of multiple geo-distributed data centers, the
demand of each data center is controlled by the request routing algorithm,
which makes the problem much more involved. We decouple the two aspects, and
develop a distributed optimization algorithm to solve the large-scale request
routing problem. Trace-driven simulations show that partial execution reduces
cost by $3\%--10.5\%$ for one data center, and by $15.5\%$ for geo-distributed
data centers together with request routing.
