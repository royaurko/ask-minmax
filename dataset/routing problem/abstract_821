We consider experimental routes to determine the nonclassical degree of
states of a field mode. We adopt a distance-type criterium based on the
Hilbert-Schmidt metric to quantify the nonclassicality. The concept of
nonclassical degree is extended for states of bipartite systems, allowing us to
discuss a possible connection between nonclassicality and entanglement
measures.
