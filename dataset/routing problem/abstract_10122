In the context of a Coleman-Weinberg mechanism for the Higgs boson mass, we
address the strong CP problem. We show that a DFSZ-like invisible axion model
with a gauge-singlet complex scalar field S, whose couplings to the Standard
Model are naturally ultra-weak, can solve the strong CP problem and
simultaneously generate acceptable electroweak symmetry breaking. The
ultra-weak couplings of the singlet S are associated with underlying
approximate shift symmetries that act as custodial symmetries and maintain
technical naturalness. The model also contains a very light pseudo-Goldstone
dilaton that is consistent with cosmological Polonyi bounds, and the axion can
be the dark matter of the universe. We further outline how a SUSY version of
this model, which may be required in the context of Grand Unification, can
avoid introducing a hierarchy problem.
