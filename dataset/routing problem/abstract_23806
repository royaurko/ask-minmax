We consider the Diophantine problem of Frobenius for semigroup ${\sf S}({\bf
d}^3)$ where ${\bf d}^3$ denotes the tuple $(d_1,d_2,d_3)$,
$\gcd(d_1,d_2,d_3)=1$. Based on the Hadamard product of analytic functions we
have found the analytic representation for the diagonal elements $a_{kk}({\bf
d}^3)$ of the Johnson's matrix of minimal relations in terms of $d_1,d_2,d_3$.
Bearing in mind the results of the recent paper this gives the analytic
representation for the Frobenius number $F({\bf d}^3)$, genus $G({\bf d}^3)$
and the Hilbert series $H({\bf d}^3;z)$ for the semigroups ${\sf S}({\bf
d}^3)$. This representation does complement the Curtis' theorem on the
non-algebraic representation of the Frobenius number $F({\bf d}^3)$. We also
give a procedure to calculate the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the
Johnson's matrix.
