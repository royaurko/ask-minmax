We consider in the plane the problem of reconstructing a domain from the
normal derivative of its Green's function with pole at a fixed point in the
domain. By means of the theory of conformal mappings, we obtain existence,
uniqueness, (non-spherical) symmetry results, and a formula relating the
curvature of the boundary of the domain to the normal derivative of its Green's
function.
