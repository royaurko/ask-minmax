We study the inverse boundary value problem for the wave equation using the
single-layer potential operator as the data. We assume that the data have
frequency content in a bounded interval. We prove how to choose classes of
nonsmooth coefficient functions so that optimization formulations of inverse
wave problems satisfy the prerequisites for application of steepest descent and
Newton-type iterative methods.
