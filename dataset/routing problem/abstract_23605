In a recent paper we discovered that a fermionic condensate is formed from
gravitational interactions due to the covariant coupling of fermions in the
presence of a torsion-fermion contact interaction. The condensate gap gives a
negative contribution to the bare cosmological constant. In this letter, we
show that the cosmological constant problem can be solved without fine tuning
of the bare cosmological constant. We demonstrate how a universe with a large
initial cosmological constant undergoes inflation, during which time the energy
gap grows as the volume of the universe. Eventually the gap becomes large
enough to cancel out the bare cosmological term, inflation ends and we end up
in a universe with an almost vanishing cosmological term. We provide a detailed
numerical analysis of the system of equations governing the self regulating
relaxation of the cosmological constant.
