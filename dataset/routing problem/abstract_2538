The strong interest in graphene has motivated the scalable production of high
quality graphene and graphene devices. Since large-scale graphene films
synthesized to date are typically polycrystalline, it is important to
characterize and control grain boundaries, generally believed to degrade
graphene quality. Here we study single-crystal graphene grains synthesized by
ambient CVD on polycrystalline Cu, and show how individual boundaries between
coalescing grains affect graphene's electronic properties. The graphene grains
show no definite epitaxial relationship with the Cu substrate, and can cross Cu
grain boundaries. The edges of these grains are found to be predominantly
parallel to zigzag directions. We show that grain boundaries give a significant
Raman "D" peak, impede electrical transport, and induce prominent weak
localization indicative of intervalley scattering in graphene. Finally, we
demonstrate an approach using pre-patterned growth seeds to control graphene
nucleation, opening a route towards scalable fabrication of single-crystal
graphene devices without grain boundaries.
