In the design of beam transport lines one often meets the problem of
constructing a quadrupole lens system that will produce desired transfer
matrices in both the horizontal and vertical planes. Nowadays this problem is
typically approached with the help of computer routines, but searching for the
numerical solution one has to remember that it is not proven yet that an
arbitrary four by four uncoupled beam transfer matrix can be represented by
using a finite number of drifts and quadrupoles (representation problem) and
the answer to this questions is not known not only for more or less realistic
quadrupole field models but also for the both most commonly used approximations
of quadrupole focusing, namely thick and thin quadrupole lenses. In this paper
we make a step forward in resolving the representation problem and, by giving
an explicit solution, we prove that an arbitrary four by four uncoupled beam
transfer matrix actually can be obtained as a product of a finite number of
thin-lenses and drifts.
