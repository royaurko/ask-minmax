In this paper, we consider the online version of the machine minimization
problem (introduced by Chuzhoy et al., FOCS 2004), where the goal is to
schedule a set of jobs with release times, deadlines, and processing lengths on
a minimum number of identical machines. Since the online problem has strong
lower bounds if all the job parameters are arbitrary, we focus on jobs with
uniform length. Our main result is a complete resolution of the deterministic
complexity of this problem by showing that a competitive ratio of $e$ is
achievable and optimal, thereby improving upon existing lower and upper bounds
of 2.09 and 5.2 respectively. We also give a constant-competitive online
algorithm for the case of uniform deadlines (but arbitrary job lengths); to the
best of our knowledge, no such algorithm was known previously. Finally, we
consider the complimentary problem of throughput maximization where the goal is
to maximize the sum of weights of scheduled jobs on a fixed set of identical
machines (introduced by Bar-Noy et al. STOC 1999). We give a randomized online
algorithm for this problem with a competitive ratio of e/e-1; previous results
achieved this bound only for the case of a single machine or in the limit of an
infinite number of machines.
