The maximal acceleration (MA) problem associated with the position-dependent
rest mass concept is considered. New arguments in favor of the mass-dependent
maximal acceleration (MDMA) are put forward. The hypothesis that there exists a
maximal force with the numerical value equal to the inverse Einstein's
gravitation constant is advanced. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian classical
dynamics of a point-like particle with the coordinate-dependent mass is given.
The effective Lagrangian for the pure gravitational interaction of a test
particle is proposed. Within the scope of this model the typical spiral galaxy
rotation is described. It is shown that by this model the peculiar form of the
corresponding rotation curve is as a whole reproduced without recourse to the
dark matter concept. Also, it is demonstrated that the canonical quantization
of this model leads directly to the Dirac oscillator model for a particle with
Plank's mass.
