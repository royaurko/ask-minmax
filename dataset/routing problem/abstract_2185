We numerically examine the two-dimensional ordering of a stripe forming
system of particles with competing long-range repulsion and short-range
attraction in the presence of a quasi-one-dimensional corrugated substrate. As
a function of increasing substrate strength or the ratio of the number of
particles to the number of substrate minima we show that a remarkable variety
of distinct orderings can be realized, including modulated stripes, prolate
clump phases, two dimensional ordered kink structures, crystalline void phases,
and smectic phases. Additionally in some cases the stripes align perpendicular
to the substrate troughs. Our results suggest that a new route to self assembly
for systems with competing interactions can be achieved through the addition of
a simple periodic modulated substrate.
