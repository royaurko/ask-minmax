In this work we prove a weak Noether type theorem for a class of variational
problems which include broken extremals. We then use this result to prove
discrete Noether type conservation laws for certain classes of finite element
discretisation of a model elliptic problem. In addition we study how well the
finite element scheme satisfies the continuous conservation laws arising from
the application of Noether's 1st Theorem (E. Noether 1918).
  We summarise extensive numerical tests, illustrating the conservativity of
the discrete Noether law using the $p$--Laplacian as an example.
