Given that the terminal condition is of at most linear growth, it is well
known that a Cauchy problem admits a unique classical solution when the
coefficient multiplying the second derivative (i.e., the volatility) is also a
function of at most linear growth. In this note, we give a condition on the
volatility that is necessary and sufficient for a Cauchy problem to admit a
unique solution.
