Here we present the results of applying the generalized Riemann zeta-function
regularization method to the gravitational radiation reaction problem. We
analyze in detail the headon collision of two nonspinning black holes with
extreme mass ratio. The resulting reaction force on the smaller hole is
repulsive. We discuss the possible extensions of these method to generic orbits
and spinning black holes. The determination of corrected trajectories allows to
add second perturbative corrections with the consequent increase in the
accuracy of computed waveforms.
