Spatial correlations - bubbles, domain walls, etc. - can best be studied by
concentrating on the degrees of freedom most relevant to the problem. For the
finite temperature confinement transition, I integrate out all gauge degrees of
freedom, leaving only spins - Ising or Potts - related to the Wilson line. I
present problems that arise in the course of this transformation and some
results for the effective spin action.
