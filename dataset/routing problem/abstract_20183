We address the problem of the determination of the images of the Galois
representations attached to genus 2 Siegel cusp forms of level 1 having
multiplicity one. These representations are symplectic. We prove that the
images are as large as possible for almost every prime, if the Siegel cusp form
is not a Maass spezialform and verifies two easy to check conditions.
