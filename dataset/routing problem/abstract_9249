We consider a team of $k$ identical, oblivious, asynchronous mobile robots
that are able to sense (\emph{i.e.}, view) their environment, yet are unable to
communicate, and evolve on a constrained path. Previous results in this weak
scenario show that initial symmetry yields high lower bounds when problems are
to be solved by \emph{deterministic} robots. In this paper, we initiate
research on probabilistic bounds and solutions in this context, and focus on
the \emph{exploration} problem of anonymous unoriented rings of any size. It is
known that $\Theta(\log n)$ robots are necessary and sufficient to solve the
problem with $k$ deterministic robots, provided that $k$ and $n$ are coprime.
By contrast, we show that \emph{four} identical probabilistic robots are
necessary and sufficient to solve the same problem, also removing the coprime
constraint. Our positive results are constructive.
