We show that several reconfiguration problems known to be PSPACE-complete
remain so even when limited to graphs of bounded bandwidth. The essential step
is noticing the similarity to very limited string rewriting systems, whose
ability to directly simulate Turing Machines is classically known. This
resolves a question posed open in [Bonsma P., 2012]. On the other hand, we show
that a large class of reconfiguration problems becomes tractable on graphs of
bounded treedepth, and that this result is in some sense tight.
