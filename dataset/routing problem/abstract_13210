In this talk, we propose a model of mirage mediation, in which Peccei-Quinn
symmetry is incorporated. In this \textit{axionic mirage mediation}, it is
shown that the Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking scale is dynamically determined
around $10^{10}$ GeV to $10^{12}$ GeV due to the supersymmetry breaking
effects. The problems in the original mirage mediation such as the
$\mu$-problem and the moduli problem can be solved simultaneouly. Furthermore,
in our model the axino, which is the superpartner of the axion, is the lightest
sparticle.
