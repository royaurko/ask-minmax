The purpose of this text is twofold. First we discuss some divisor problems
involving Paul Erd\H os (1913-1996), whose centenary of birth is this year. In
the second part some recent results on divisor problems are discussed, and
their connection with the powers moments of $|\zeta(\frac{1}{2}+it)|$ is
pointed out. This is an extended version of the lecture given at the conference
ERDOS100 in Budapest, July 1-5, 2013.
