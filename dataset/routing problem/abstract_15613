We solve the elliptic equations associated with the Hamiltonian and momentum
constraints, corresponding to a system composed of two black holes with
arbitrary linear and angular momentum. These new solutions are based on a
Kerr-Schild spacetime slicing which provides more physically realistic
solutions than the initial data based on conformally flat metric/maximal
slicing methods. The singularity/inner boundary problems are circumvented by a
new technique that allows the use of an elliptic solver on a Cartesian grid
where no points are excised, simplifying enormously the numerical problem.
