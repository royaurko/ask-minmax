If one randomly punches holes in an infinite tensed membrane, when does the
tension cease to exist? This problem was introduced by R. Connelly in
connection with applications of rigidity theory to natural sciences. We
outline a mathematical theory of tension based on graph rigidity theory and
introduce several probabilistic models for this problem. We show that if the
``centers'' of the holes are distributed in R^2 according to Poisson law with
parameter \lambda>0, and the distribution of sizes of the holes is independent
of the distribution of their centers, the tension vanishes on all of R^2 for
any value of \lambda. In fact, it follows from a more general result on the
behavior of iterative convex hulls of connected subsets of R^d, when the
initial configuration of subsets is distributed according to Poisson law and
the sizes of the elements of the original configuration are independent of
this Poisson distribution. For the latter problem we establish the existence
of a critical threshold in terms of the number of iterative convex hull
operations required for covering all of R^d. The processes described in the
paper are somewhat related to bootstrap and rigidity percolation models.
