This note proves a generalisation to inverse semigroups of Anisimov's theorem
that a group has regular word problem if and only if it is finite, answering a
question of Stuart Margolis. The notion of word problem used is the two-tape
word problem -- the set of all pairs of words over a generating set for the
semigroup which both represent the same element.
