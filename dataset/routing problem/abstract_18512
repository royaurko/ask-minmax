We investigate the equation $(u_t + (f(u))_x)_x = f''(u) (u_x)^2/2$ where
$f(u)$ is a given smooth function. Typically $f(u)= u^2/2$ or $u^3/3$. This
equation models unidirectional and weakly nonlinear waves for the variational
wave equation $u_{tt} - c(u) (c(u)u_x)_x =0$ which models some liquid crystals
with a natural sinusoidal $c$. The equation itself is also the Euler-Lagrange
equation of a variational problem. Two natural classes of solutions can be
associated with this equation. A conservative solution will preserve its energy
in time, while a dissipative weak solution loses energy at the time when
singularities appear. Conservative solutions are globally defined, forward and
backward in time, and preserve interesting geometric features, such as the
Hamiltonian structure. On the other hand, dissipative solutions appear to be
more natural from the physical point of view.
  We establish the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem within the class of
conservative solutions, for initial data having finite energy and assuming that
the flux function $f$ has Lipschitz continuous second-order derivative. In the
case where $f$ is convex, the Cauchy problem is well-posed also within the
class of dissipative solutions. However, when $f$ is not convex, we show that
the dissipative solutions do not depend continuously on the initial data.
