Comment on "Classification Scheme for Phenomenological Universalities in
Growth Problems in Physics and Other Sciences" by P. Castorina, P. P. Delsanto
and C. Guiot, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 96}, 188701 (2006) is presented. It has
been proved that the West-like function of growth derived by the contributors is
incorrect and the approach does not take into account the growth of the
biological systems undergoing atrophy or demographic and economic systems
undergoing involution or regression. A simple extension of the model, which
permits derivation of the so far unknown involuted Gompertz function of growth
is proposed.
