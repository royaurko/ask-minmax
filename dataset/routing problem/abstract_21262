In this article we formulate the superperturbation theory for the Anderson
impurity model on the real axis. The resulting impurity solver allows to
evaluate dynamical quantities without numerical analytical continuation by the
maximum entropy method or Pad\'e approximants. This makes the solver well
suited to study multiplet effects in solids within the dynamical mean field
theory. First examples including multi-orbital problems are discussed.
