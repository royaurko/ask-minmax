We survey the open problems in low--energy $KN$ physics, in the perspective
of using the new machines presently planned, such as the $\phi$--factory
DA$\Phi$NE at I.N.F.N. Nat. Labs. in Frascati (as a source of {\sl tagged},
low--energy kaons) and the KAON Factory at TRIUMF (as a producer of intense,
intermediate--energy kaon beams).
