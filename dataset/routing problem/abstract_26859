An interesting problem in synchronization is the study of coupled
oscillators, wherein oscillators with different natural frequencies synchronize
to a common frequency and equilibrium phase difference. In this paper, we
investigate the stability and convergence in a network of coupled oscillators
described by the Kuramoto model. We consider networks with finite number of
oscillators, arbitrary interconnection topology, non-uniform coupling gains and
non-identical natural frequencies. We show that such a network synchronizes
provided the underlying graph is connected and certain conditions on the
coupling gains are satisfied. In the analysis, we consider as states the phase
and angular frequency differences between the oscillators, and the resulting
dynamics possesses a continuum of equilibria. The synchronization problem
involves establishing the Lyapunov stability of the fixed points and showing
convergence of trajectories to these points. The synchronization result is
established in the framework of semistability theory.
