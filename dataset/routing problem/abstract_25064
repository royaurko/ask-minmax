This is a continuation of paper \cite{Li}. On any toric Fano manifold, we
discuss the behavior of limit metric of a sequence of metrics, which are
solutions to a continuity family of complex Monge-Ampere equations in
Kahler-Einstein problem. We show that the limit metric satisfies a singular
complex Monge-Ampere equation. This shows the conic type singularity for the
limit metric. The information of conic type singularities can be read from the
geometry of the moment polytope.
