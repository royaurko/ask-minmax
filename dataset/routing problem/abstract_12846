We study a $q-$analog of a singularly perturbed Cauchy problem with irregular
singularity in the complex domain which generalizes a previous result by S.
Malek in \cite{malek}. First, we construct solutions defined in open
$q-$spirals to the origin. By means of a $q-$Gevrey version of Malgrange-Sibuya
theorem we show the existence of a formal power series in the perturbation
parameter which turns out to be the $q-$Gevrey asymptotic expansion (of certain
type) of the actual solutions.
