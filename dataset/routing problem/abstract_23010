The paper considers software development issues for large-scale enterprise
information systems (IS) with databases (DB) in global heterogeneous
distributed computational environment. Due to high IT development rates, the
present-day society has accumulated and rapidly increases an extremely huge
data burden. Manipulating with such huge data arrays becomes an essential
problem, particularly due to their global distribution, heterogeneous and
weak-structured character. The conceptual approach to integrated Internet-based
IS design, development and implementation is presented, including formal
models, software development methodology and original software development
tools for visual problem-oriented development and content management. IS
implementation results proved shortening terms and reducing costs of
implementation compared to commercial software available.
