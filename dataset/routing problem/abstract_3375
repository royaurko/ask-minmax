Computational thinking is a new problem soling method named for its extensive
use of computer science techniques. It synthesizes critical thinking and
existing knowledge and applies them in solving complex technological problems.
The term was coined by J. Wing, but the relationship between computational and
critical thinking, the two modes of thiking in solving problems, has not been
yet learly established. This paper aims at shedding some light into this
relationship. We also present two classroom experiments performed recently at
the Graduate Technological Educational Institute of Patras in Greece. The
results of these experiments give a strong indication that the use of computers
as a tool for problem solving enchances the students' abilities in solving real
world problems involving mathematical modelling. This is also crossed by
earlier findings of other researchers for the problem solving process in
general (not only for mathematical problems).
