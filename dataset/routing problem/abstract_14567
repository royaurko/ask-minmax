An analytical approach for description of unsteady heat transfer in a
one-dimensional harmonic crystal is presented. A covariance temperature is
introduced. A constitutive law for the heat flux, an analogue of Fourier's law
for the considered system is obtained. A reversible thermal wave equation for
the kinetic temperature is derived and an integral solution of this equation is
obtained. Two example problems are solved: 1) decay of a sinusoidal thermal
perturbation; 2) heat transfer between hot and cold regions in the crystal. The
analytical solutions are confirmed by numeric simulations and compared with
other models of heat conduction.
