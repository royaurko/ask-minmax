The Consecutive-Ones Property (C1P) is a classical concept in discrete
mathematics that has been used in several genomics applications, from physical
mapping of contemporary genomes to the assembly of ancient genomes. A common
issue in genome assembly concerns repeats, genomic sequences that appear in
several locations of a genome. Handling repeats leads to a variant of the C1P,
the C1P with multiplicity (mC1P), that can also be seen as the problem of
covering edges of hypergraphs by linear and circular walks. In the present
work, we describe variants of the mC1P that address specific issues of genome
assembly, and polynomial time or fixed-parameter algorithms to solve them.
