We give a nontrivial algorithm for the satisfiability problem for cn-wire
threshold circuits of depth two which is better than exhaustive search by a
factor 2^{sn} where s= 1/c^{O(c^2)}. We believe that this is the first
nontrivial satisfiability algorithm for cn-wire threshold circuits of depth
two. The independently interesting problem of the feasibility of sparse 0-1
integer linear programs is a special case. To our knowledge, our algorithm is
the first to achieve constant savings even for the special case of Integer
Linear Programming. The key idea is to reduce the satisfiability problem to the
Vector Domination Problem, the problem of checking whether there are two
vectors in a given collection of vectors such that one dominates the other
component-wise.
  We also provide a satisfiability algorithm with constant savings for depth
two circuits with symmetric gates where the total weighted fan-in is at most
cn.
  One of our motivations is proving strong lower bounds for TC^0 circuits,
exploiting the connection (established by Williams) between satisfiability
algorithms and lower bounds. Our second motivation is to explore the connection
between the expressive power of the circuits and the complexity of the
corresponding circuit satisfiability problem.
