The problem of assessing the value of a candidate is viewed here as a
multiple combination problem. On the one hand a candidate can be evaluated
according to different criteria, and on the other hand several experts are
supposed to assess the value of candidates according to each criterion.
Criteria are not equally important, experts are not equally competent or
reliable. Moreover levels of satisfaction of criteria, or levels of confidence
are only assumed to take their values in qualitative scales which are just
linearly ordered. The problem is discussed within two frameworks, the
transferable belief model and the qualitative possibility theory. They
respectively offer a quantitative and a qualitative setting for handling the
problem, providing thus a way to compare the nature of the underlying
assumptions.
