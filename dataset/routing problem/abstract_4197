We describe algorithms for computing eigenpairs (eigenvalue--eigenvector) of
a complex $n\times n$ matrix $A$. These algorithms are numerically stable,
strongly accurate, and theoretically efficient (i.e., polynomial-time). We do
not believe they outperform in practice the algorithms currently used for this
computational problem. The merit of our paper is to give a positive answer to a
long-standing open problem in numerical linear algebra.
