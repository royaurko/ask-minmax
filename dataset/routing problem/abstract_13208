Many sequences of binomial coefficients share various unimodality properties.
In this paper we consider the unimodality problem of a sequence of binomial
coefficients located in a ray or a transversal of the Pascal triangle. Our
results give in particular an affirmative answer to a conjecture of Belbachir
et al which asserts that such a sequence of binomial coefficients must be
unimodal. We also propose two more general conjectures.
