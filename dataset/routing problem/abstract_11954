We are interested in the homogenization of elastic-electric coupling
equation, with rapidly oscillating coefficients, in periodically perforated
piezoelectric body. We justify the two first terms in the usual asymptotic
development of the problem solution. For the main convergence results of this
paper, we use the notion of {\it two-scale convergence}. A two-scale
homogenized system is obtained as the limit of the periodic problem. While in
the static limit the method provides homogenized electroelastic coefficients
whicht coincide with those deduced from other homogenization techniques
(asymptotic homogenization, $\Gamma$-convergence).
