We show that simple syntactic expressions such as existential second order
(ESO) universal Horn formulae can express NP-hard optimisation problems. There
is a significant difference between the expressibilities of decision problems
and optimisation problems. This is similar to the difference in computation
times for the two classes of problems; for example, a 2SAT Horn formula can be
satisfied in polynomial time, whereas the optimisation version in NP-hard. It
is known that all polynomially solvable decision problems can be expressed as
ESO universal ($\Pi_1$) Horn sentences in the presence of a successor relation.
We show here that, on the other hand, if $P \neq NP$, optimisation problems
defy such a characterisation, by demonstrating that even a $\Pi_0$ (quantifier
free) Horn formula is unable to guarantee polynomial time solvability. Finally,
by connecting concepts in optimisation duality with those in descriptive
complexity, we will show a method by which optimisation problems can be solved
by a single call to a "decision" Turing machine, as opposed to multiple calls
using a classical binary search setting.
