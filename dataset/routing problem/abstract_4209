In this paper, we consider an inverse problem to determine a semilinear term
of a parabolic equation from a single boundary measurement of Neumann type. For
this problem, a reconstruction algorithm is established by the spectral
representation for the fundamental solution of heat equation with homogeneous
Neumann boundary condition and the Whitney extension theorem.
