We report on the recently proposed joint resolution of two long-standing
puzzles in weak radiative (WR) and nonleptonic (NL) hyperon decays (HD). First,
a good VMD-based description of WRHD is presented. In particular, the large
negative asymmetry observed in the \Sigma^+ \to p \gamma decay is explained
through a calculably large SU(3)-breaking effect in the relevant
parity-violating amplitude. Second, the achieved description of the
parity-violating WRHD amplitudes permits the extraction, via the SU(2)_W + VMD
route, of the non-soft-pion correction term in the parity-violating NLHD
amplitudes. The latter subtracts a substantial amount from the current-algebra
commutator term, thus leading to the resolution of the old S:P discrepancy in
NLHD.
