In order to resolve the hierarchy problem, large extra dimensions have been
introduced, and it has been suggested that the size of extra dimensions is
sub-millimeter. On the other hand, we assume in this paper that the
cosmological constant comes from the Casimir energy of extra dimensions and
estimate the size of extra dimensions in terms of the value of the cosmological
constant discovered by the recent WMAP observations. We demonstrate that this
size is consistent with the one derived from the hierarchy problem and propose
that there may be a generic size of large extra dimensions when the number of
extra dimensions is equal to two.
