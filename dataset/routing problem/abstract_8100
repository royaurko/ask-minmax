In this work, we consider a spatially homogeneous Kac's equation with a non
cutoff cross section. We prove that the weak solution of the Cauchy problem is
in the Gevrey class for positive time. This is a Gevrey regularizing effect for
non smooth initial datum. The proof relies on the Fourier analysis of Kac's
operators and on an exponential type mollifier.
