In a small-n large-p hypothesis testing framework, most procedures in the
literature require quite stringent distributional assumptions, and restrict to
a specific scheme of (n,p)-asymptotics. We consider several classical testing
problems in multivariate analysis, directional statistics, and multivariate
time series: the problem of testing uniformity on the unit sphere, the
spherical location problem, the problem of testing that a process is white
noise versus serial dependence, the problem of testing for multivariate
independence, and the problem of testing for sphericity. In each case, we show
that the natural sign tests enjoy nonparametric validity and are
distribution-free in a universal (n, p)-asymptotics framework, where p may go
to infinity in an arbitrary way as n does. Simulations confirm our asymptotic
results.
