A problem with non-classical conditions on all the boundary not requiring
agreement conditions is considered for a sixth order pseudoparapolic equation.
The equivalence of these conditions with the classic boundary condition is
substantiated in the case if the solution of the stated problem is sought in
S.L.Sobolev isotropic space.
