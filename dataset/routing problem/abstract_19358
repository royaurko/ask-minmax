The Fifth International Workshop on Domain-Specific Languages and Models for
Robotic Systems (DSLRob'14) was held in conjunction with the 2014 International
Conference on Simulation, Modeling, and Programming for Autonomous Robots
(SIMPAR 2014), October 2014 in Bergamo, Italy.
  The main topics of the workshop were Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and
Model-driven Software Development (MDSD) for robotics. A domain-specific
language is a programming language dedicated to a particular problem domain
that offers specific notations and abstractions that increase programmer
productivity within that domain. Model-driven software development offers a
high-level way for domain users to specify the functionality of their system at
the right level of abstraction. DSLs and models have historically been used for
programming complex systems. However recently they have garnered interest as a
separate field of study. Robotic systems blend hardware and software in a
holistic way that intrinsically raises many crosscutting concerns (concurrency,
uncertainty, time constraints, ...), for which reason, traditional
general-purpose languages often lead to a poor fit between the language
features and the implementation requirements. DSLs and models offer a powerful,
systematic way to overcome this problem, enabling the programmer to quickly and
precisely implement novel software solutions to complex problems within the
robotics domain.
