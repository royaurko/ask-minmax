In the store-and-forward routing problem, packets have to be routed along
given paths such that the arrival time of the latest packet is minimized. A
groundbreaking result of Leighton, Maggs and Rao says that this can always be
done in time O(congestion + dilation), where the congestion is the maximum
number of paths using an edge and the dilation is the maximum length of a path.
However, the analysis is quite arcane and complicated and works by iteratively
improving an infeasible schedule. Here, we provide a more accessible analysis
which is based on conditional expectations. Like [LMR94], our easier analysis
also guarantees that constant size edge buffers suffice.
  Moreover, it was an open problem stated e.g. by Wiese, whether there is any
instance where all schedules need at least (1 + epsilon)*(congestion +
dilation) steps, for a constant epsilon > 0. We answer this question
affirmatively by making use of a probabilistic construction.
