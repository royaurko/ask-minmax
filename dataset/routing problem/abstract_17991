The initial motivation of this text was to provide an up to date translation
of the monograph [45] written in french by the first contributor, taking account of
more recent developments of infinite dimensional dynamics based on the
{\L}ojasiewicz gradient inequality. In order to keep the present work within
modest size bounds and to make it available to the readers without too much
delay, we decided to make a first volume entirely dedicated to the so-called
convergence problem for autonomous systems of dissipative type. We hope that
this volume will help the interested reader to make the connection between the
rather simple background developed in the french monograph and the rather
technical specialized literature on the convergence problem which grew up
rather fast in the recent years.
