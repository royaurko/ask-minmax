The (ordinary) Sachs-Wolfe effect relates primordial matter perturbations to
the temperature variations $\delta T/T$ in the cosmic microwave background
radiation; $\delta T/T$ can be observed in all directions around us. A standard
but idealised model of this effect leads to an infinite set of moment-like
equations: the integral of $P(k) j_\ell^2(ky)$ with respect to k ($0<k<\infty$)
is equal to a given constant, $C_\ell$, for $\ell=0,1,2,...$. Here, P is the
power spectrum of the primordial density variations, $j_\ell$ is a spherical
Bessel function and y is a positive constant. It is shown how to solve these
equations exactly for ~$P(k)$. The same solution can be recovered, in
principle, if the first ~m equations are discarded. Comparisons with classical
moment problems (where $j_\ell^2(ky)$ is replaced by $k^\ell$) are made.
