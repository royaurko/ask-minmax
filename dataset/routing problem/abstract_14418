This paper is a theoretical study of the following Non-Rigid Structure from
Motion problem. What can be computed from a monocular view of a parametrically
deforming set of points? We treat various variations of this problem for affine
and polynomial deformations with calibrated and uncalibrated cameras. We show
that in general at least three images with quasi-identical two deformations are
needed in order to have a finite set of solutions of the points' structure and
calculate some simple examples.
