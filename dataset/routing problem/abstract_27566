In the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), we are given a complete graph $K_n$
together with an integer weighting $w$ on the edges of $K_n$, and we are asked
to find a Hamilton cycle of $K_n$ of minimum weight. Let $h(w)$ denote the
average weight of a Hamilton cycle of $K_n$ for the weighting $w$. Vizing
(1973) asked whether there is a polynomial-time algorithm which always finds a
Hamilton cycle of weight at most $h(w)$. He answered this question in the
affirmative and subsequently Rublineckii (1973) and others described several
other TSP heuristics satisfying this property. In this paper, we prove a
considerable generalisation of Vizing's result: for each fixed $k$, we give an
algorithm that decides whether, for any input edge weighting $w$ of $K_n$,
there is a Hamilton cycle of $K_n$ of weight at most $h(w)-k$ (and constructs
such a cycle if it exists). For $k$ fixed, the running time of the algorithm is
polynomial in $n$, where the degree of the polynomial does not depend on $k$
(i.e., the generalised Vizing problem is fixed-parameter tractable with respect
to the parameter $k$).
