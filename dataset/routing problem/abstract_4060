For the class of unitary CMV operators with super-exponentially decaying
Verblunsky coefficients we give a new proof of the inverse resonance problem of
reconstructing the operator from its resonances - the zeros of the Jost
function. We establish a stability result for the inverse resonance problem
that shows continuous dependence of the operator coefficients on the location
of the resonances.
