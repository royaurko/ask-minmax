This is the third paper of a series revisiting the Faraday effect. The
question of the absolute convergence of the sums over the band indices entering
the Verdet constant is considered. In general, sum rules and traces per unit
volume play an important role in solid state physics, and they give rise to
certain convergence problems widely ignored by physicists. We give a complete
answer in the case of smooth potentials and formulate an open problem related
to less regular perturbations.
