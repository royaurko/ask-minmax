Three recent experiments, which looked at pionic effects in nuclei have
concluded that there are no excess pions. This puts into serious question the
conventional meson-exchange picture of the nucleon-nucleon interaction. Based
on arguments of partial restoration of chiral symmetry with density we propose
a resolution to this problem.
