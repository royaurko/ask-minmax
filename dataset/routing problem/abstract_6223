The brane world scenario advocated by Arkani-Hamed et al. transmutes the
hierarchy problem into explaining why extra dimensions have sizes much larger
than the fundamental scale. In this paper we discuss possible solutions to this
problem by considering the compactified dimensions to be populated by a large
number of branes in a crystal lattice. The experimental consequences of this
scenario are described, including the presence of large energy gaps in the
spectrum of Kaluza-Klein modes.
