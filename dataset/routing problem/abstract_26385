Considered in this paper is the modified Camassa-Holm equation with cubic
nonlinearity, which is integrable and admits the single peaked solitons and
multi-peakon solutions. The short-wave limit of this equation is known as the
short-pulse equation. The main investigation is the Cauchy problem of the
modified Camassa-Holm equation with qualitative properties of its solutions. It
is firstly shown that the equation is locally well-posed in a range of the
Besov spaces. The blow-up scenario and the lower bound of the maximal time of
existence are then determined. A blow-up mechanism for solutions with certain
initial profiles is described in detail and nonexistence of the smooth
traveling wave solutions is also demonstrated. In addition, the persistence
properties of the strong solutions for the equation are obtained.
