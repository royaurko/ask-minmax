In the category of free arrangements, inductively and recursively free
arrangements are important. In particular, in the former, Terao's open problem
asking whether freeness depends only on combinatorics is true. A long standing
problem whether all free arrangements are recursively free or not was settled
by the second contributor and Hoge very recently, by giving a free but
non-recursively free plane arrangement consisting of 27 planes. In this paper,
we construct free but non-recursively free plane arrangements consisting of 13
and 15 planes, and show that the example with 13 planes is the smallest in the
sense of the cardinality of planes. In other words, all free plane arrangements
consisting of at most 12 planes are recursively free. To show this, we
completely classify all free plane arrangements in terms of inductive freeness
and three exceptions when the number of planes is at most 12. Several
properties of the 15 plane arrangement are proved by computer programs. Also,
these two examples solve negatively a problem posed by Yoshinaga on the moduli
spaces, (inductive) freeness and, rigidity of free arrangements.
