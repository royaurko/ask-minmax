Multiple instance learning (MIL) is concerned with learning from sets (bags)
of objects (instances), where the individual instance labels are ambiguous. In
this setting, supervised learning cannot be applied directly. Often,
specialized MIL methods learn by making additional assumptions about the
relationship of the bag labels and instance labels. Such assumptions may fit a
particular dataset, but do not generalize to the whole range of MIL problems.
Other MIL methods shift the focus of assumptions from the labels to the overall
(dis)similarity of bags, and therefore learn from bags directly. We propose to
represent each bag by a vector of its dissimilarities to other bags in the
training set, and treat these dissimilarities as a feature representation. We
show several alternatives to define a dissimilarity between bags and discuss
which definitions are more suitable for particular MIL problems. The
experimental results show that the proposed approach is computationally
inexpensive, yet very competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms on a wide
range of MIL datasets.
