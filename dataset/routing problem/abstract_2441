For a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a two-dimensional (2D) trap, we
introduce cross patterns, which are generated by intersection of two domain
walls (DWs) separating immiscible species, with opposite signs of the wave
functions in each pair of sectors filled by the same species. The cross pattern
remains stable up to the zero value of the immiscibility parameter $|\Delta |$,
while simpler rectilinear (quasi-1D) DWs exist only for values of $|\Delta |$
essentially exceeding those in BEC mixtures (two spin states of the same
isotope) currently available to the experiment. Both symmetric and asymmetric
cross configurations are investigated, with equal or different numbers
$N_{1,2}$ of atoms in the two species. In rotating traps, ``propellers''
(stable revolving crosses) are found too. A full stability region for of the
crosses and propellers in the system's parameter space is identified, unstable
crosses evolving into arrays of vortex-antivortex pairs. Stable rotating
rectilinear DWs are found too, at larger vlues of $|\Delta |$. All the patterns
produced by the intersection of three or more DWs are unstable, rearranging
themselves into ones with two DWs. Optical propellers are also predicted in a
twisted nonlinear photonic-crystal fiber carrying two different wavelengths or
circular polarizations, which can be used for applications to switching and
routing.
