Based on Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP), this paper established a
generalized PMP aiming at non-feedback control system with stochastic initial
conditions. We proved the conclusion and show its coming back to PMP when the
randomness collapses. Through the generalized PMP, a general method is
introduced to solve expectation maximum problem of these systems and thereafter
an example showed its feasibility.
