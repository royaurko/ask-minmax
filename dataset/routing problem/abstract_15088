This paper considers the inverse problem of scattering of time-harmonic
acoustic and electromagnetic plane waves by bounded, inhomogeneous, penetrable
obstacles in a homogeneous background medium. A new method is proposed to prove
the unique determination of the penetrable, inhomogeneous obstacle from the
far-field pattern for all incident plane waves at a fixed frequency. Our method
is based on constructing a well-posed interior transmission problem in a {\em
small} domain associated with the Helmholtz or modified Helmholtz equation and
the Maxwell or modified Maxwell equations, where a key role is played by the
fact that the domain is small, which ensures, for the previously unresolved
case with the transmission coefficient $\la=1$ or $\la_H=1$, that the lowest
transmission eigenvalue is large so that a given wave number $k$ is not an
eigenvalue of the interior transmission problem. Another ingredient in our
proofs is a priori estimates of solutions to the transmission scattering
problems with boundary data in $L^p$ ($1<p<2$), which are established in this
paper by using the integral equation method. A main feature of the new method
is that it can deal with the acoustic and electromagnetic cases in a unified
way and can be easily applied to deal with inverse scattering by unbounded
rough interfaces.
