We study the integral representation of $\Gamma$-limits of $p$-coercive
integral functionals of the calculus of variations in the spirit of
\cite{dalmaso-modica86}. We use infima of local Dirichlet problems to
characterize the limit integrands. Applications to homogenization and
relaxation are given.
