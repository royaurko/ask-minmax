We study synthesis of optimal schedulers for the linear temporal logic (LTL)
with future discounting. The logic, introduced by Almagor, Boker and Kupferman,
is a quantitative variant of LTL in which an event in the far future has only
discounted contribution to a truth value (that is a real number in the unit
interval [0,1]). The precise problem we study---it naturally arises e.g. in
search for a scheduler that recovers from an internal error state as soon as
possible---is the following: given a Kripke frame, a formula and a number in
[0, 1] called a margin, find a path of the Kripke frame that is optimal with
respect to the formula up to the prescribed margin (a truly optimal path may
not exist). We present an algorithm for the problem: it relies on a translation
to quantitative automata and their optimal value problem, a technique that is
potentially useful also in other settings of optimality synthesis.
