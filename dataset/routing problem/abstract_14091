Several recent papers construct auxiliary polynomials to bound the Weil
height of certain classes of algebraic numbers from below. Following these
techniques, the contributor gave a general method for introducing auxiliary
polynomials to problems involving the Weil height. The height appears as a
solution to a certain extremal problem involving polynomials. We further
generalize the above techniques to acquire both the projective height and the
height on subspaces in the same way. We further obtain lower bounds on the
heights of points on some subvarieties of $\mathbb P^{N-1}(\overline{\mathbb
Q})$.
