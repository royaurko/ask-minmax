This is an English translation of the paper in which N. I. Akhiezer
discovered his famous orthogonal polynomials on two intervals in a connection
with a generalization of the Korkin-Zolotarev (Korkine-Zolotaref) problem (see
the small commentary by P. Yuditskii, attached to the current publication).
