Grand unified theories may display multiply interacting fields with strong
coupling dynamics. This poses two new problems: (1) What is the nature of
chaotic reheating after inflation, and (2) How is reheating sensitive to the
mass spectrum of these theories ? We answer these questions in two interesting
limiting cases and demonstrate an increased efficiency of reheating which
strongly enhances non-thermal topological defect formation, including monopoles
and domain walls. Nevertheless, the large fluctuations may resolve this
monopole problem via a modified Dvali-Liu-Vachaspati mechanism in which
non-thermal destabilsation of discrete symmetries occurs at reheating.
