We report on the Hubble Space Telescope program to observe periodic comet
9P/Tempel 1 in conjunction with NASA's Deep Impact mission. Our objectives were
to study the generation and evolution of the coma resulting from the impact and
to obtain wide-band images of the visual outburst generated by the impact. Two
observing campaigns utilizing a total of 17 HST orbits were carried out: the
first occurred on 2005 June 13-14 and fortuitously recorded the appearance of a
new, short-lived fan in the sunward direction on June 14. The principal
campaign began two days before impact and was followed by contiguous orbits
through impact plus several hours and then snapshots one, seven, and twelve
days later. All of the observations were made using the Advanced Camera for
Surveys (ACS). For imaging, the ACS High Resolution Channel (HRC) provides a
spatial resolution of 36 km (16 km/pixel) at the comet at the time of impact.
Baseline images of the comet, made prior to impact, photometrically resolved
the comet's nucleus. The derived diameter, 6.1 km, is in excellent agreement
with the 6.0 +/- 0.2 km diameter derived from the spacecraft imagers. Following
the impact, the HRC images illustrate the temporal and spatial evolution of the
ejecta cloud and allow for a determination of its expansion velocity
distribution. One day after impact the ejecta cloud had passed out of the
field-of-view of the HRC.
