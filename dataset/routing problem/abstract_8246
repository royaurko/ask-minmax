The present text is an introduction to \'Ecalle's theory of resurgent
functions and alien calculus, in connection with problems of exponentially
small separatrix splitting. An outline of the resurgent treatment of Abel's
equation for resonant dynamics in one complex variable is included. The
emphasis is on examples of nonlinear difference equations, as a simple and
natural way of introducing the concepts.
