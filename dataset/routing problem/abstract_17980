Well posedness is established for a family of equations modelling particle
populations undergoing delocalised coagulation, advection, inflow and outflow
in a externally specified velocity field. Very general particle types are
allowed while the spatial domain is a bounded region of $d$-dimensional space
for which every point lies on exactly one streamline associated with the
velocity field. The problem is formulated as a semi-linear ODE in the Banach
space of bounded measures on particle position and type space. A local
Lipschitz property is established in total variation norm for the propagators
(generalised semi-groups) associated with the problem and used to construct a
Picard iteration that establishes local existence and global uniqueness for any
initial condition. The unique weak solution is shown further to be a
differentiable or at least bounded variation strong solution under smoothness
assumptions on the parameters of the coagulation interaction. In the case of
one spatial dimension strong differentiability is established even for
coagulation parameters with a particular bounded variation structure in space.
This one dimensional extension establishes the convergence of the simulation
processes studied in [Patterson, Stoch. Anal. Appl. 31, 2013] to a unique and
differentiable limit.
