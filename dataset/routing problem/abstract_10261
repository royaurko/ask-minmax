Here is presented a generalization of photogravitational restricted 3-bodies
problem to the case of influence of Yarkovsky effect, which is known as reason
of additional infinitesimal acceleration of a small bodies in the space (due to
anisotropic re-emission of absorbed energy from the sun, other stellar
sources). Asteroid is supposed to move under the influence of gravitational
forces from 2 massive bodies (which are rotating around their common centre of
masses on Kepler trajectories), as well under the influence of pressure of
light from both the primaries. Analyzing the ODE system of motion, we explore
the existense of equilibrium points for a small body (asteroid) in the case
when the 2-nd primary is non-oblate spheroid. In such a case, it is proved the
existence of maximally 256 different non-planar libration points in generalized
photogravitational restricted 3-bodies problem when we take into consideration
even a small Yarkovsky effect.
