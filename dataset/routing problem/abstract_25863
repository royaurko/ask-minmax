Many university texts on Mechanics deal with the problem of the effect of the
air drag force, using as example the slowing down of a parachute. Hardly no one
discuss what happens when the drag force is proportional to both $u$ and $u^2$.
In this paper we deal with a real problem to illustrate the effect of both
terms in the speed of a runner: a theoretical model of the performance of the
100 m world record sprint of Usain Bolt during the 2009 World Championships at
Berlin is developed, assuming a drag force proportional to $u$ and to $u^2$.
The resulting equation of motion is solved and fitted to the experimental data
obtained from the International Amateur of Athletics Federations that recorded
Bolt's position with a LAVEG (laser velocity guard) device. It is worth to note
that our model works only for short sprints.
