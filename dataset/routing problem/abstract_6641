This tutorial paper describes the problem of image reconstruction from
interferometric data with a particular focus on the specific problems
encountered at optical (visible/IR) wavelengths. The challenging issues in
image reconstruction from interferometric data are introduced in the general
framework of inverse problem approach. This framework is then used to describe
existing image reconstruction algorithms in radio interferometry and the new
methods specifically developed for optical interferometry.
