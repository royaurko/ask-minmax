Asymptotic expansion is constructed and justified for the solution to a
nonuniform Neumann boundary-value problem for the Poisson equation with the
right-hand side that depends both on longitudinal and transversal variables in
a thin cascade domain. Asymptotic energetic and uniform pointwise estimates for
the difference between the solution of the initial problem and the solution of
the corresponding limiting problem are proved.
