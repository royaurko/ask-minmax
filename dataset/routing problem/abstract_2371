We use ideas from distributed computing and game theory to study dynamic and
decentralized environments in which computational nodes, or decision makers,
interact strategically and with limited information. In such environments,
which arise in many real-world settings, the participants act as both economic
and computational entities. We exhibit a general non-convergence result for a
broad class of dynamics in asynchronous settings. We consider implications of
our result across a wide variety of interesting and timely applications:
circuit design, social networks, Internet routing, and congestion control. We
also study the computational and communication complexity of testing the
convergence of asynchronous dynamics, as well as the effects of limited
asynchrony. For uncoupled game dynamics, in which preferences are private
inputs, we give new bounds on the recall necessary for self stabilization to an
equilibrium. Our work opens a new avenue for research at the intersection of
distributed computing and game theory.
