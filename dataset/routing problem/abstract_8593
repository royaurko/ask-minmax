We study a well-known problem concerning a random variable $Z$ uniformly
distributed between two independent random variables. A new extension has been
introduced for this problem and fairly large classes of randomly weighted
average distributions are identified by their generalized Stieltjes transforms.
In this article we employ the Schwartz distribution theory for finding
distributions of this extension; we also study some of their properties.
