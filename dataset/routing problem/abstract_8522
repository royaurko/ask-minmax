We use variational minimizing methods to study spatial restricted N+1-body
problems with a zero mass moving on the vertical axis of the moving plane for N
equal masses. We prove that the minimizer of the Lagrangian action on the
anti-T/2 or odd symmetric loop space must be a non-planar periodic solution for
any $N\geq2$.
