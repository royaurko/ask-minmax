This paper addresses two seemingly unrelated problems, (a) What is the
entropy and energy accounting in the Maxwell Demon problem? and (b) How can the
efficiency of markets be measured? Here we show, in a simple model for the
Maxwell Demon, the entropy of the universe increases by an amount
eta=0.839995520 in going from a random state to an ordered state and by an
amount eta*=2.731382 in going from one sorted state to another sorted state. We
calculate the efficiency of an engine driven by the Maxwell sorting process.
The efficiency depends only on the temperatures of the particles and of the
computer the Demon uses to sort the particles. We also show the approach is
general and create a simple model of a stock market in which the Limit Trader
plays the role of the Maxwell Demon. We use this model to define and measure
market efficiency.
