In Einstein's equation we suggest a geometrical object substituting the
tensor of energy of impulse and tension. The obtained equation, together with
the equation for external field, makes up the complete problem of mathematical
equations of gravitation, as well as those of inertia. Based on the example of
centrally symmetrical field those problems and their consequences are
discussed.
