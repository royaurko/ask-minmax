We propose composite approache to the special sum-type convex optimization
problem with affine restriction and special entropy type regularization. Since
the fuctional has a penalty type form we reformulate initial conditional
optimization problem in a special unconstrained form that allows us to put the
penalty type functional into the composite term.
