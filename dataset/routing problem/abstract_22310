Given a Riemannian manifold and a closed submanifold, we find a geodesic
segment with free boundary on the given submanifold. This is a corollary of the
min-max theory which we develop in this article for the free boundary
variational problem. In particular, we develop a modified Birkhoff curve
shortening process to achieve a strong "Colding-Minicozzi" type min-max
approximation result.
