We study an analogue of the classical moment problem in the framework where
moments are indexed by graphs instead of natural numbers. We study limit
objects of graph sequences where edges are labeled by elements of a topological
space. Among other things we obtain strengthening and generalizations of the
main results of previous papers characterizing reflection positive graph
parameters, graph homomorphism numbers, and limits of simple graph sequences.
We study a new class of reflection positive partition functions which
generalize the node-coloring models (homomorphisms into weighted graphs).
