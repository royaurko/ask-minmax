In this paper, we study a model of simplified four-body problem called planar
two-center-two-body problem. In the plane, we have two fixed centers
$Q_1=(-\chi,0)$, $Q_2=(0,0)$ of masses 1, and two moving bodies $Q_3$ and $Q_4$
of masses $\mu\ll 1$. They interact via Newtonian potential. $Q_3$ is captured
by $Q_2$, and $Q_4$ travels back and forth between two centers. Based on a
model of Gerver, we prove that there is a Cantor set of initial conditions
which lead to solutions of the Hamiltonian system whose velocities are
accelerated to infinity within finite time avoiding all early collisions. We
consider this model as a simplified model for the planar four-body problem case
of the Painlev\'{e} conjecture.
