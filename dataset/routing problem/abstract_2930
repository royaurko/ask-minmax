We design the first polynomial time approximation schemes (PTASs) for the
Minimum Betweenness problem in tournaments and some related higher arity
ranking problems. This settles the approximation status of the Betweenness
problem in tournaments along with other ranking problems which were open for
some time now. The results depend on a new technique of dealing with fragile
ranking constraints and could be of independent interest.
