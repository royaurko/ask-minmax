In this paper, we consider the problem of minimizing the completion delay for
instantly decodable network coding (IDNC), in wireless multicast and broadcast
scenarios. We are interested in this class of network coding due to its
numerous benefits, such as low decoding delay, low coding and decoding
complexities and simple receiver requirements. We first extend the IDNC graph,
which represents all feasible IDNC coding opportunities, to efficiently operate
in both multicast and broadcast scenarios. We then formulate the minimum
completion delay problem for IDNC as a stochastic shortest path (SSP) problem.
Although finding the optimal policy using SSP is intractable, we use this
formulation to draw the theoretical guidelines for the policies that can
efficiently reduce the completion delay in IDNC. Based on these guidelines, we
design a maximum weight clique selection algorithm, which can efficiently
reduce the IDNC completion delay in polynomial time. We also design a quadratic
time heuristic clique selection algorithm, which can operate in real-time
applications. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithms efficiently
reduce the IDNC completion delay compared to the random and maximum-rate
algorithms, and almost achieve the global optimal completion delay performance
over all network codes in broadcast scenarios.
