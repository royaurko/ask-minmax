The polycrystalline sample of LaGa1-xMnxO3 (0<x<0.2) has been prepared by
solid state reaction route. The phase purity of these samples has been
confirmed by powder x-ray diffraction experiments carried out on BL-12 at
Indus-2 synchrotron radiation source. The room temperature
magneto-capacitance/magneto-dielectric (MC/MD) study on these samples has been
carried out in the frequency range of 20 Hz to 5 MHz. The MD effect about 4% at
f = 100 kHz and H = 0.4 Tesla has been observed at room temperature. With
increasing applied magnetic field the value of dielectric constant
({\epsilon}r) increases significantly throughout the frequency range i.e. up to
5 MHZ. The change in {\epsilon}r with magnetic field is significant (~1.8%)
even at higher frequencies such as at 1 MHz. The observed results are analyzed
in the framework of Maxwell-Wagner behavior and the intrinsic
magneto-dielectric effect; i.e. by systematically analyzing magneto-capacitance
(MC) and dielectric loss as a function of frequency. Our results and analysis
suggests that at lower frequencies i.e. up to ~30 kHz the MD effect is
dominated by Maxwell-Wagner effects where as at higher frequencies the observed
MD coupling might be the intrinsic property of these samples and appears to be
dominated by magnetic field induced dipolar relaxation. Our results of
intrinsic and significant MD coupling at room temperature, illustrate a new
path for the next generation MD materials for device applications.
