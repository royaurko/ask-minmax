Let A={a_1,a_2,...,a_s} and B={b_1,b_2,...,b_t} be two sets of objects with
s+r=n, the generalized assignment problem assigns each element a_i in A to at
least alpha_i and at most alpha '_i elements in B, and each element b_j in B to
at least beta_j and at most beta '_j elements in A for all 1 <= i <= s and 1 <=
j <= t. In this paper, we present an O(n^4) time and O(n) space algorithm for
this problem using the well known Hungarian algorithm. We also present an
O(n^3) algorithm for a special case of the generalized assignment, called the
limited-capacity assignment problem, where alpha_i,beta_j=1 for all i,j.
