This paper considers the recovery of sparse control inputs to an overactuated
linear system, i.e., one in which the number of inputs greatly outnumbers the
number of states. Such a system is relevant for certain models of biological
systems such as neuronal networks. In general, the overactuated formulation
leads to an underdetermined recovery problem, such that it is impossible to
exactly infer the system inputs based on state observation alone. We show,
however, that under assumptions of input sparsity, it is possible to perform
exact and stable recovery over a finite time-horizon and develop an error bound
for the reconstructed control input. The solution methodology involves l1-based
regularization, commonplace is sparse recovery problems, but here extended to
the case of a linear dynamical system evolving over a time horizon. Simulation
results are presented to verify the solution and performance bounds.
