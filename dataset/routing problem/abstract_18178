The problem of detecting a small number of outliers in a large dataset is an
important task in many fields from fraud detection to high-energy physics. Two
approaches have emerged to tackle this problem: unsupervised and supervised.
Supervised approaches require a sufficient amount of labeled data and are
challenged by novel types of outliers and inherent class imbalance, whereas
unsupervised methods do not take advantage of available labeled training
examples and often exhibit poorer predictive performance. We propose BORE (a
Bagged Outlier Representation Ensemble) which uses unsupervised outlier scoring
functions (OSFs) as features in a supervised learning framework. BORE is able
to adapt to arbitrary OSF feature representations, to the imbalance in labeled
data as well as to prediction-time constraints on computational cost. We
demonstrate the good performance of BORE compared to a variety of competing
methods in the non-budgeted and the budgeted outlier detection problem on 12
real-world datasets.
