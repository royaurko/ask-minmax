Many different approaches for solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)
and related Constraint Optimization Problems (COPs) exist. However, there is no
single solver (nor approach) that performs well on all classes of problems and
many portfolio approaches for selecting a suitable solver based on simple
syntactic features of the input CSP instance have been developed. In this paper
we first present a simple portfolio method for CSP based on k-nearest neighbors
method. Then, we propose a new way of using portfolio systems --- training them
shortly in the exploitation time, specifically for the set of instances to be
solved and using them on that set. Thorough evaluation has been performed and
has shown that the approach yields good results. We evaluated several machine
learning techniques for our portfolio. Due to its simplicity and efficiency,
the selected k-nearest neighbors method is especially suited for our short
training approach and it also yields the best results among the tested methods.
We also confirm that our approach yields good results on SAT domain.
