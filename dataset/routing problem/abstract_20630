We here discuss the outcome of an hypothetic experiments of populations
dynamics, where a set of independent realizations is made available. The
importance of ensemble average is clarified with reference to the registered
time evolution of key collective indicators. The problem is here tackled for
the logistic case study. Theoretical prediction are compared to numerical
simulations.
