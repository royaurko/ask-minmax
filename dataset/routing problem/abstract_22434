In this paper, we consider an output consensus problem for a general class of
nonlinear multi-agent systems without a prior knowledge of the agents' control
directions. Two distributed Nussbaumtype control laws are proposed to solve the
leaderless and leader-following adaptive consensus for heterogeneous multiple
agents. Examples and simulations are given to verify their effectiveness
