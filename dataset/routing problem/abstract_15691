The analysis of the resonant spin-flavour (RSF) solutions to the solar
neutrino problem in the framework of simplest analytic solutions to the solar
magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) equations is presented. We performed the global fit
of the recent solar neutrino data, including event rates as well as day and
night recoil electron spectra induced by solar neutrino interactions in
SuperKamiokande. We compare quantitatively our simplest MHD-RSF fit with vacuum
oscillation (VAC) and MSW--type (SMA, LMA and LOW) solutions to the solar
neutrino problem using a common well-calibrated theoretical calculation and fit
procedure and find MHD-RSF fit to be somewhat better than those obtained for
the favored neutrino oscillation solutions. We made the predictions for future
experiments to disentangle the MHD-RSF scenario from other scenarios.
