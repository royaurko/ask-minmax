We develop a framework for a {\em unified} treatment of well-posedness for
the Stefan problem with and without surface tension. In the absence of surface
tension, we provide new estimates for the regularity of the moving
free-surface. We construct solutions as a limit of a carefully chosen sequence
of approximate solutions to our so-called $\kappa $-problem, in which moving
surface is regularized and the boundary condition is modified. We conclude by
proving that solutions of the Stefan problem with positive surface tension
$\sigma$ converge to solutions of the classical Stefan problem as $\sigma\to0$.
