Sequential detection problems in sensor networks are considered. The true
state of nature/true hypothesis is modeled as a binary random variable $H$ with
known prior distribution. There are $N$ sensors making noisy observations about
the hypothesis; $\mathcal{N} =\{1,2,\ldots,N\}$ denotes the set of sensors.
Sensor $i$ can receive messages from a subset $\mathcal{P}^i \subset
\mathcal{N}$ of sensors and send a message to a subset $\mathcal{C}^i \subset
\mathcal{N}$. Each sensor is faced with a stopping problem. At each time $t$,
based on the observations it has taken so far and the messages it may have
received, sensor $i$ can decide to stop and communicate a binary decision to
the sensors in $\mathcal{C}^i$, or it can continue taking observations and
receiving messages. After sensor $i$'s binary decision has been sent, it
becomes inactive. Sensors incur operational costs (cost of taking observations,
communication costs etc.) while they are active. In addition, the system incurs
a terminal cost that depends on the true hypothesis $H$, the sensors' binary
decisions and their stopping times. The objective is to determine decision
strategies for all sensors to minimize the total expected cost.
