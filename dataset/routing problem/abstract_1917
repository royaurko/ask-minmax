Graphene has exceptional optical, mechanical and electrical properties,
making it an emerging material for novel optoelectronics, photonics and for
flexible transparent electrode applications. However, the relatively high sheet
resistance of graphene is a major constrain for many of these applications.
Here we propose a new approach to achieve low sheet resistance in large-scale
CVD monolayer graphene using non-volatile ferroelectric polymer gating. In this
hybrid structure, large-scale graphene is heavily doped up to 3{\times}1013
cm-2 by non-volatile ferroelectric dipoles, yielding a low sheet resistance of
120 {\Omega}{\Box} at ambient conditions. The graphene-ferroelectric
transparent conductors (GFeTCs) exhibit more than 95% transmittance from the
visible to the near infrared range owing to the highly transparent nature of
the ferroelectric polymer. Together with its excellent mechanical flexibility,
chemical inertness and the simple fabrication process of ferroelectric
polymers, the proposed GFeTCs represent a new route towards large-scale
graphene based transparent electrodes and optoelectronics.
