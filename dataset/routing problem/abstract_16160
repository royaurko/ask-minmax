Variance estimation is a fundamental problem in statistical modeling. In
ultrahigh dimensional linear regressions where the dimensionality is much
larger than sample size, traditional variance estimation techniques are not
applicable. Recent advances on variable selection in ultrahigh dimensional
linear regressions make this problem accessible. One of the major problems in
ultrahigh dimensional regression is the high spurious correlation between the
unobserved realized noise and some of the predictors. As a result, the realized
noises are actually predicted when extra irrelevant variables are selected,
leading to serious underestimate of the noise level. In this paper, we propose
a two-stage refitted procedure via a data splitting technique, called refitted
cross-validation (RCV), to attenuate the influence of irrelevant variables with
high spurious correlations. Our asymptotic results show that the resulting
procedure performs as well as the oracle estimator, which knows in advance the
mean regression function. The simulation studies lend further support to our
theoretical claims. The naive two-stage estimator which fits the selected
variables in the first stage and the plug-in one stage estimators using LASSO
and SCAD are also studied and compared. Their performances can be improved by
the proposed RCV method.
