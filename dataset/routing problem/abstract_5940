Non-convex optimization problems often arise from probabilistic modeling,
such as estimation of posterior distributions. Non-convexity makes the problems
intractable, and poses various obstacles for us to design efficient algorithms.
In this work, we attack non-convexity by first introducing the concept of
\emph{probable convexity} for analyzing convexity of real functions in
practice. We then use the new concept to analyze an inference problem in the
\emph{Correlated Topic Model} (CTM) and related nonconjugate models. Contrary
to the existing belief of intractability, we show that this inference problem
is concave under certain conditions. One consequence of our analyses is a novel
algorithm for learning CTM which is significantly more scalable and qualitative
than existing methods. Finally, we highlight that stochastic gradient
algorithms might be a practical choice to resolve efficiently non-convex
problems. This finding might find beneficial in many contexts which are beyond
probabilistic modeling.
