We reduce the problem of constructing a linear solution operator to the
\dbar-equation on smoothly bounded weakly pseudoconvex domains, $\Omega$, in
$\mathbb{C}^2$ to the problem of the boundary $\mdbar_b$-equation. We show
there is a solution operator to $\mdbar$ which is bounded as a map
$W^{s}_{(0,1)}(\Omega)\cap{ker}\mdbar \rightarrow W^{s}(\Omega)$ for all
$s>1/2$ if there is a corresponding solution operator to the $\mdbar_b$-problem
with analogous regularity properties.
