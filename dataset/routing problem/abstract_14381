We address spectral properties of the the Cauchy operator $|\Delta
|_D^{1/2}$, constrained by means of the exterior Dirichlet boundary data to the
interval $D=(-1,1) \subset R$. The major technical tool is a transformation of
the eigenvalue problem into that of a hypersingular Fredholm-type integral
equation which is subsequently solved with the aid of both analytic and
numerical methods. As a byproduct of discussion we give a direct analytic proof
that trigonometric functions $\cos(n\pi x/2)$ and $\sin(n\pi x)$, for integer
$n$ are {\it not} the eigenfunctions of $|\Delta |_D^{1/2}$.
