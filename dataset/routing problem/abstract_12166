We construct a continuous Lagrangian, strictly convex and superlinear in the
third variable, such that the associated variational problem has a Lipschitz
minimizer which is non-differentiable on a dense set. More precisely, the upper
and lower Dini derivatives of the minimizer differ by a constant on a dense
(hence second category) set. In particular, we show that mere continuity is an
insufficient smoothness assumption for Tonelli's partial regularity theorem.
