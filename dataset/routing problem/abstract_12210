The Eisenhart problem of finding parallel tensors is solved for the symmetric
case in the regular $f$-Kenmotsu framework. On this way, the Olszack-Rosca
example of Einstein manifolds provided by $f$-Kenmotsu manifolds via locally
symmetric Ricci tensors is recovered as well as a case of Killing vector
fields. Some other classes of Einstein-Kenmotsu manifolds are presented. Our
result is interpreted in terms of Ricci solitons and special quadratic first
integrals.
