The status of the QCD-based heavy quark expansion is briefly reviewed. A good
agreement between properly applied theory and new precision data is observed.
Critical remarks on certain recent claims from HQET are presented. Recent
applications to the exclusive heavy flavor transitions are addressed. The `1/2
> 3/2' problem for the transitions into the charm P-wave states is discussed.
