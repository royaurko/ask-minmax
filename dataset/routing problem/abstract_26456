The square root modulo problem is a known primitive in designing an
asymmetric cryptosystem. It was first attempted by Rabin. Decryption failure of
the Rabin cryptosystem caused by the 4-to-1 decryption output is overcome
efficiently in this work. The proposed scheme (known as the AA_\beta-
cryptosystem) has its encryption speed having a complexity order faster than
the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, El-Gammal, RSA and ECC. It can also transmit a
larger data set securely when compared to existing asymmetric schemes. It has a
simple mathematical structure. Thus, it would have low computational
requirements and would enable communication devices with low computing power to
deploy secure communication procedures efficiently.
