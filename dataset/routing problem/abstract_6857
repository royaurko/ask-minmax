Multidimensional minimax single facility location problems with Chebyshev
distance are examined within the framework of idempotent algebra. A new
algebraic solution based on an extremal property of the eigenvalues of
irreducible matrices is given. The solution reduces both unconstrained and
constrained location problems to evaluation of the eigenvalue and eigenvectors
of an appropriate matrix.
