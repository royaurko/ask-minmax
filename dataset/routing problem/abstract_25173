Influence maximization is the problem of finding a set of users in a social
network, such that by targeting this set, one maximizes the expected spread of
influence in the network. Most of the literature on this topic has focused
exclusively on the social graph, overlooking historical data, i.e., traces of
past action propagations. In this paper, we study influence maximization from a
novel data-based perspective. In particular, we introduce a new model, which we
call credit distribution, that directly leverages available propagation traces
to learn how influence flows in the network and uses this to estimate expected
influence spread. Our approach also learns the different levels of
influenceability of users, and it is time-aware in the sense that it takes the
temporal nature of influence into account. We show that influence maximization
under the credit distribution model is NP-hard and that the function that
defines expected spread under our model is submodular. Based on these, we
develop an approximation algorithm for solving the influence maximization
problem that at once enjoys high accuracy compared to the standard approach,
while being several orders of magnitude faster and more scalable.
