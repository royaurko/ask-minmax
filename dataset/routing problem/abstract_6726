We develop a rounding method based on random walks in polytopes, which leads
to improved approximation algorithms and integrality gaps for several
assignment problems that arise in resource allocation and scheduling. In
particular, it generalizes the work of Shmoys & Tardos on the generalized
assignment problem in two different directions, where the machines have hard
capacities, and where some jobs can be dropped. We also outline possible
applications and connections of this methodology to discrepancy theory and
iterated rounding.
