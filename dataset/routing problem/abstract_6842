A new definition of Lie invariance for nonlinear multi-dimensional boundary
value problems (BVPs) is proposed by the generalization of known definitions to
much wider classes of BVPs. The class of (1+3)-dimensional nonlinear BVPs of
the Stefan type, modeling the process of melting and evaporation of metals, is
studied in detail. Using the definition proposed, the group classification
problem for this class of BVPs is solved and some reductions (with physical
meaning) to BVPs of lower dimensionality are made. Examples of how to construct
exact solutions of the (1+3)-dimensional nonlinear BVP with the
correctly-specified coefficients are presented.
