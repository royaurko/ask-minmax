Using dual method we establish the existence of nodal ground state solution
for the following class of problems $$ \left\{ \begin{array}{l} \Delta^2 u =
f(u), \quad \mbox{in} \quad \Omega, \\ u =Bu=0,\quad\mbox{on} \quad \partial
\Omega \end{array} \right. $$ where $\Delta^2$ is the biharmonic operator,
$B=\Delta$ or $B=\dfrac{\partial}{\partial \nu}$ and $f$ is a $C^1$-function
having subcritical growth.
