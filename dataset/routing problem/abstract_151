In this paper we suggest the use of light for performing useful computations.
Namely, we propose a special device which uses light rays for solving the
Hamiltonian path problem on a directed graph. The device has a graph-like
representation and the light is traversing it following the routes given by the
connections between nodes. In each node the rays are uniquely marked so that
they can be easily identified. At the destination node we will search only for
particular rays that have passed only once through each node. We show that the
proposed device can solve small and medium instances of the problem in
reasonable time.
