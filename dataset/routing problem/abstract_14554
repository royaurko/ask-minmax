We prove the folklore corollary of the geometrization theorem that there is
an algorithm for the homeomorphism problem for closed, oriented, triangulated
3-manifolds. To support the interpretation of this result as a corollary of
geometrization, we give a self-contained proof that uses only the statement of
the geometrization theorem, standard moves on triangulations, hyperbolic
triangulations, and old results from computability theory. We make no use of
more advanced algorithmic methods from geometric group theory or normal surface
theory, nor any of Thurston's or Perelman's methods used to prove
geometrization. We also give variations of several steps of the algorithm and
proof.
  In a second result, we combine normal surface theory results with hyperbolic
triangulations to prove that the homeomorphism problem is elementary recursive.
