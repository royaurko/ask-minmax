Solution of the Cox-Thompson inverse scattering problem at fixed energy
[1,2,3] is reformulated resulting in semi-analytic equations. The new set of
equations for the normalization constants and the nonphysical (shifted) angular
momenta are free of matrix inversion operations. This simplification is a
result of treating only the input phase shifts of partial waves of a given
parity. Therefore, the proposed method can be applied for identical particle
scattering of the bosonic type (or for certain cases of identical fermionic
scattering). The new formulae are expected to be numerically more efficient
than the previous ones. Based on the semi-analytic equations an approximate
method is proposed for the generic inverse scattering problem, when partial
waves of arbitrary parity are considered.
