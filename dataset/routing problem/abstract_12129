The paper faces the problem of scheduling from a new perspective, trying to
bridge the gap between classical heuristic approaches and system identification
and control strategies. To this aim, a complete mathematical formulation of a
general scheduling process is derived, beginning from very broad assumptions.
This allows a greater freedom of manipulation and guarantee the resolution of
the identification (and control) techniques. Both an adaptive and a switching
strategies are presented in relation to the performances of a simple Round
Robin algorithm.
