The central mean subspace (CMS) and iterative Hessian transformation (IHT)
have been introduced recently for dimension reduction when the conditional mean
is of interest. Suppose that X is a vector-valued predictor and Y is a scalar
response. The basic problem is to find a lower-dimensional predictor \eta^TX
such that E(Y|X)=E(Y|\eta^TX). The CMS defines the inferential object for this
problem and IHT provides an estimating procedure. Compared with other methods,
IHT requires fewer assumptions and has been shown to perform well when the
additional assumptions required by those methods fail. In this paper we give an
asymptotic analysis of IHT and provide stepwise asymptotic hypothesis tests to
determine the dimension of the CMS, as estimated by IHT. Here, the original IHT
method has been modified to be invariant under location and scale
transformations. To provide empirical support for our asymptotic results, we
will present a series of simulation studies. These agree well with the theory.
The method is applied to analyze an ozone data set.
