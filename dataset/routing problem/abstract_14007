The paper studies problems of satisfiability, decidability and admissibility
of inference rules, conceptions of knowledge and agent's knowledge in
non-transitive temporal linear logic LTL(Past,m). We find algorithms solving
mentioned problems, justify our approach to consider linear non-transitive time
with several examples. Main, most complicated, technical new result is
decidability of LTL(Past,m) w.r.t. admissible rules. We discuss several ways to
formalize conceptions of knowledge and agent's knowledge within given approach
in non-transitive linear logic with models directed to past.
