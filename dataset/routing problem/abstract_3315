In this report we study the problem of determining three-dimensional
orientations for noisy projections of randomly oriented identical particles.
The problem is of central importance in the tomographic reconstruction of the
density map of macromolecular complexes from electron microscope images and it
has been studied intensively for more than 30 years.
  We analyze the computational complexity of the orientation problem and show
that while several variants of the problem are $NP$-hard, inapproximable and
fixed-parameter intractable, some restrictions are polynomial-time approximable
within a constant factor or even solvable in logarithmic space. The orientation
search problem is formalized as a constrained line arrangement problem that is
of independent interest. The negative complexity results give a partial
justification for the heuristic methods used in orientation search, and the
positive complexity results on the orientation search have some positive
implications also to the problem of finding functionally analogous genes.
