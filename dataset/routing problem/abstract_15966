Before the universe there was nothing, absolute nothing. That is the starting
point because it is the only starting point that requires no cause, no
explanation nor justification of its existence.
  But, that starting point has two impediments to the universe, or anything,
coming into existence from it. First is the problem of change from nothing to
something without, at least initially, an infinite rate of change, which is
impossible. Second is the problem of change from nothing to something without
violating conservation, which must be maintained.
  Mathematical analysis develops the sole solution to both problems. That is
that the beginning had to be of a +/-[1 - cosine] form. That solution indicates
the fundamental nature of matter, energy and field.
