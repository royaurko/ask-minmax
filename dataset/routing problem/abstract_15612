This paper solves two major problems which have blocked a free-fall
Equivalence-Principle (EP) in a satellite for 25 years: a semimajor-axis error
between the two proof masses cannot be distinguished from an EP violation and
the response to an EP violation only grows as t not t^2. Using the cancellation
method described in this paper, the nonobservability problem can be suppressed
and a t^2 response can be generated which lasts between 10^4 and 10^6 seconds
depending on the cancellation accuracy. t^2 response times between 10^5 and
10^6 seconds are equivalent to a very tall (0.1 to 10 AU) drop tower with a
constant gravitational field of 3/7 ge.
