We combine the ideas of atomistic/continuum energy blending and ghost force
correction to obtain an energy-based atomistic/continuum coupling scheme which
has, for a range of benchmark problems, the same convergence rates as optimal
force-based coupling schemes.
  We present the construction of this new scheme, numerical results exploring
its accuracy in comparison with established schemes, as well as a rigorous
error analysis for an instructive special case.
