Given a k-uniform hypergraph on n vertices, partitioned in k equal parts such
that every hyperedge includes one vertex from each part, the k-dimensional
matching problem asks whether there is a disjoint collection of the hyperedges
which covers all vertices. We show it can be solved by a randomized polynomial
space algorithm in time O*(2^(n(k-2)/k)). The O*() notation hides factors
polynomial in n and k.
  When we drop the partition constraint and permit arbitrary hyperedges of
cardinality k, we obtain the exact cover by k-sets problem. We show it can be
solved by a randomized polynomial space algorithm in time O*(c_k^n), where
c_3=1.496, c_4=1.642, c_5=1.721, and provide a general bound for larger k.
  Both results substantially improve on the previous best algorithms for these
problems, especially for small k, and follow from the new observation that
Lovasz' perfect matching detection via determinants (1979) admits an embedding
in the recently proposed inclusion-exclusion counting scheme for set covers,
despite its inability to count the perfect matchings.
