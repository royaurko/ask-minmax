Models with gauge-Higgs unification on a flat space are typically affected by
common problems, the main of which are the prediction of a too small top and
Higgs mass and a too low compactification scale. We show how, by breaking the
SO(4,1) Lorentz symmetry in the bulk and introducing a Z_2 ``mirror'' symmetry,
a potentially realistic model arises, in which all these problems are solved.
