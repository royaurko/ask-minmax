Web application (WA) expands its usages to provide more and more services and
it has become one of the most essential communication channels between service
providers and the users. To augment the users experience many web applications
are using client side scripting languages such as JavaScript but this growing
of JavaScript is increasing serious security vulnerabilities in web application
too, such as cross site scripting (XSS). In this paper, I survey all the
techniques those have been used to detect XSS and arrange a number of analyses
to evaluate performances of those methodologies. This paper points major
difficulties to detect XSS. I do not implement any solution of this
vulnerability problem because my focus is for reviewing this issue. But, I
believe that this assessment will be cooperative for further research on this
concern as this treatise figure out everything on this transcendent security
problem.
