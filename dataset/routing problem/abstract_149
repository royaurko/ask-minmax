During route discovery of mobile ad hoc network, broadcasting of route
request and route reply packets are the essential operations for finding the
path between two ends. In such situations, intermediate node which may or may
not belongs will participate in route discovery process, update routing table
and rebroadcast the route discovery packets again to its neighboring nodes.
Finally optimal path is found with minimum hops. This simply upsurges overhead
and deteriorates the performance of routing. The proposed Petal Ant Routing
(PAR) algorithm offers a low overhead by optimizing FANT and BANT transmissions
in route discover process. The algorithm is an improved version of SARA and has
features extracted from petal routing. The algorithm is simulated on NS2,
compared with ACO frame work called SARA and classical routing protocols such
as AODV and AOMDV. The simulation results shows that PAR further reduces
overhead by eliminating redundant FANT transmission compared to other routing
algorithm.
