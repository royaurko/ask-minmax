This paper aims at providing a survey on the problems that can be easily
addressed by clonalbased cellular automata in bioinformatics. Researchers try
to address the problems in bioinformatics independent of each problem. None of
the researchers has tried to relate the major problems in bioinformatics and
find a solution using common frame work. We tried to find various problems in
bioinformatics which can be addressed easily by clonal based cellular automata.
Extensive literature survey is conducted. We have considered some papers in
various journals and conferences for conduct of our research. This paper
provides intuition towards relating various problems in bioinformatics
logically and tries to attain a common frame work with respect to clonal based
cellular automata classifier for addressing the same.
