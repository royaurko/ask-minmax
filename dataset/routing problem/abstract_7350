The menu-dependent nature of regret-minimization creates subtleties when it
is applied to dynamic decision problems. Firstly, it is not clear whether
\emph{forgone opportunities} should be included in the \emph{menu}, with
respect to which regrets are computed, at different points of the decision
problem. If forgone opportunities are included, however, we can characterize
when a form of dynamic consistency is guaranteed. Secondly, more subtleties
arise when sophistication is used to deal with dynamic inconsistency. In the
full version of this paper, we examine, axiomatically and by common examples,
the implications of different menu definitions for sophisticated,
regret-minimizing agents.
