Retrieving resources in a distributed environment is more difficult than
finding data in centralised databases. In the last decade P2P system arise as
new and effective distributed architectures for resource sharing, but searching
in such environments could be difficult and time-consuming. In this paper we
discuss efficiency of resource discovery in PROSA, a self-organising P2P system
heavily inspired by social networks. All routing choices in PROSA are made
locally, looking only at the relevance of the next peer to each query. We show
that PROSA is able to effectively answer queries for rare documents, forwarding
them through the most convenient path to nodes that much probably share
matching resources. This result is heavily related to the small-world structure
that naturally emerges in PROSA.
