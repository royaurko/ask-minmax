Given a symmetric linear transformation on a Hilbert space, a natural problem
to consider is the characterization of its set of symmetric extensions. This
problem is equivalent to the study of the partial isometric extensions of a
fixed partial isometry. We provide a new function theoretic characterization of
the set of all self-adjoint extensions of any symmetric linear transformation
$B$ with equal indices and inner Livsic characteristic function $\Theta _B$ by
constructing a natural bijection between the set of self-adjoint extensions and
the set of all contractive analytic functions $\Phi$ which are greater or equal
to $\Theta _B$. In addition we characterize the set of all symmetric extensions
$B'$ of $B$ which have equal indices in the case where $\Theta _B$ is inner.
