The Polonyi field is a necessary ingredient in any viable scenario of gravity
mediated supersymmetry breaking. However, it is known that the presence of the
Polonyi field leads to several serious cosmological problems, which are
collectively referred to as the Polonyi problem. We show that the Polonyi
problem can be solved if the Polonyi field couples to a pseudo modulus in the
superpotential and this pseudo modulus has a large field expectation value
during inflation. To illustrate our idea, we construct an explicit model which
can be readily connected to scenarios of gravity mediation. The generation of
the mass parameters contained in our model by strong gauge dynamics is also
commented on.
