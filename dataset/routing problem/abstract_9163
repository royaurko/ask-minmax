In query learning, the goal is to identify an unknown object while minimizing
the number of "yes or no" questions (queries) posed about that object. We
consider three extensions of this fundamental problem that are motivated by
practical considerations in real-world, time-critical identification tasks such
as emergency response. First, we consider the problem where the objects are
partitioned into groups, and the goal is to identify only the group to which
the object belongs. Second, we address the situation where the queries are
partitioned into groups, and an algorithm may suggest a group of queries to a
human user, who then selects the actual query. Third, we consider the problem
of query learning in the presence of persistent query noise, and relate it to
group identification. To address these problems we show that a standard
algorithm for query learning, known as the splitting algorithm or generalized
binary search, may be viewed as a generalization of Shannon-Fano coding. We
then extend this result to the group-based settings, leading to new algorithms.
The performance of our algorithms is demonstrated on simulated data and on a
database used by first responders for toxic chemical identification.
