We here study Max Hamming XSAT, ie, the problem of finding two XSAT models at
maximum Hamming distance. By using a recent XSAT solver as an auxiliary
function, an O(1.911^n) time algorithm can be constructed, where n is the
number of variables. This upper time bound can be further improved to
O(1.8348^n) by introducing a new kind of branching, more directly suited for
finding models at maximum Hamming distance. The techniques presented here are
likely to be of practical use as well as of theoretical value, proving that
there are non-trivial algorithms for maximum Hamming distance problems.
