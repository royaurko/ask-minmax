We establish a necessary and sufficient criterion for the Fredholmness of a
general locally compact band-dominated operator $A$ on $L^p(R)$ and solve the
long-standing problem of computing its Fredholm index in terms of the limit
operators of $A$. The results are applied to operators of convolution type with
almost periodic symbol.
