Set intersection is the core in a variety of problems, e.g. frequent itemset
mining and sparse boolean matrix multiplication. It is well-known that large
speed gains can, for some computational problems, be obtained by using a
graphics processing unit (GPU) as a massively parallel computing device.
However, GPUs require highly regular control flow and memory access patterns,
and for this reason previous GPU methods for intersecting sets have used a
simple bitmap representation. This representation requires excessive space on
sparse data sets. In this paper we present a novel data layout, "BatMap", that
is particularly well suited for parallel processing, and is compact even for
sparse data.
  Frequent itemset mining is one of the most important applications of set
intersection. As a case-study on the potential of BatMaps we focus on frequent
pair mining, which is a core special case of frequent itemset mining. The main
finding is that our method is able to achieve speedups over both Apriori and
FP-growth when the number of distinct items is large, and the density of the
problem instance is above 1%. Previous implementations of frequent itemset
mining on GPU have not been able to show speedups over the best single-threaded
implementations.
