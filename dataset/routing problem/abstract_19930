Two methods for the nonperturbative solution of field-theoretic bound-state
problems, based on light-front coordinates, are briefly reviewed. One uses
Pauli-Villars regularization and the other supersymmetry. Applications to
Yukawa theory and super Yang-Mills theory with fundamental matter are
emphasized.
