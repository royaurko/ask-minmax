In this letter, we revisit the {\em orbit problem}, which was studied in
\cite{HAR69,SHA79,KL86}. In \cite{KL86}, Kannan and Lipton proved that this
problem is decidable in polynomial time. In this paper, we study the {\em
approximate orbit problem}, and show that this problem is decidable except for
one case.
