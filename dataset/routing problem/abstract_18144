Crowdsourcing is a process of accumulating the ideas, thoughts or information
from many independent participants, with aim to find the best solution for a
given challenge. Modern information technologies allow for massive number of
subjects to be involved in a more or less spontaneous way. Still, the full
potentials of crowdsourcing are yet to be reached. We introduce a modeling
framework through which we study the effectiveness of crowdsourcing in relation
to the level of collectivism in facing the problem. Our findings reveal an
intricate relationship between the number of participants and the difficulty of
the problem, indicating the the optimal size of the crowdsourced group. We
discuss our results in the context of modern utilization of crowdsourcing.
