The discovery of the accelerating universe indicates strongly the presence of
a scalar field which is not only expected to solve today's version of the
cosmological constant problem, or the fine-tuning and the coincidence problems,
but also provides a way to understand dark energy. It has also been shown that
Jordan's scalar-tensor theory is now going to be re-discovered in the new
lights. In this letter we suggest a way to search for the extremely light
scalar field by means of a laboratory experiment on the low-energy
photon-photon interactions with the quasi-parallel incident beams.
