We present a general and highly efficient scheme for performing narrow-band
Raman transitions between molecular vibrational levels using a coherent train
of weak pump-dump pairs of shaped ultrashort pulses. The use of weak pulses
permits an analytic description within the framework of coherent control in the
perturbative regime, while coherent accumulation of many pulse pairs enables
near unity transfer efficiency with a high spectral selectivity, thus forming a
powerful combination of pump-dump control schemes and the precision of the
frequency comb. The concept is presented analytically and its feasibility and
robustness are verified by simulations of dynamics in Rb$_2$. We consider
application of this concept to the formation of stable, deeply bound, ultracold
molecules.
