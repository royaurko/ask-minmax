We study the content placement problem for cache delivery video-on-demand
systems under static random network topologies with fixed heavy-tailed video
demand. The performance measure is the amount of server load; we wish to
minimize the total download rate for all users from the server and maximize the
rate from caches. Our approach reduces the analysis for multiple videos to
consideration of decoupled systems with a single video each. For each placement
policy, insights gained from the single video analysis carry back to the
original multiple video content placement problem. Finally, we propose a hybrid
placement technique that achieves near optimal performance with low complexity.
