Slow-light enhanced absorption in liquid-infiltrated photonic crystals has
recently been proposed as a route to compensate for the reduced optical path in
typical lab-on-a-chip systems for bio-chemical sensing applications. A simple
perturbative expression has been applied to ideal structures composed of
lossless dielectrics. In this work we study the enhancement in structures
composed of lossy dielectrics such as a polymer. For this particular sensing
application we find that the material loss has an unexpected limited drawback
and surprisingly, it may even add to increase the bandwidth for low-index
contrast systems such as polymer devices.
