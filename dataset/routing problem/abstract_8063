Spectral equivalences of the quasi-exactly solvable sectors of two classes of
Schrodinger operators are established, using Gaudin-type Bethe ansatz
equations. In some instances the results can be extended leading to full
isospectrality. In this manner we obtain equivalences between PT-symmetric
problems and Hermitian problems. We also find equivalences between some classes
of Hermitian operators.
