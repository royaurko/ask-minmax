Let N be the set of non-negative integer numbers, T the circle group and c
the cardinality of the continuum. Given an abelian group G of size at most 2^c
and a countable family F of infinite subsets of G, we construct "Baire many"
monomorphisms p: G --> T^c such that p(E) is dense in {y in T^c : ny=0}
whenever n in N, E in F, nE={0} and {x in E: mx=g} is finite for all g in G and
m such that n=mk for some k in N--{1}. We apply this result to obtain an
algebraic description of countable potentially dense subsets of abelian groups,
thereby making a significant progress towards a solution of a problem of Markov
going back to 1944. A particular case of our result yields a positive answer to
a problem of Tkachenko and Yaschenko. Applications to group actions and
discrete flows on T^c, diophantine approximation, Bohr topologies and Bohr
compactifications are also provided.
