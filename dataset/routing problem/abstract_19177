A Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is a framework used for modeling and
solving constrained problems. Tree-search algorithms like backtracking try to
construct a solution to a CSP by selecting the variables of the problem one
after another. The order in which these algorithm select the variables
potentially have significant impact on the search performance. Various
heuristics have been proposed for choosing good variable ordering. Many
powerful variable ordering heuristics weigh the constraints first and then
utilize the weights for selecting good order of the variables. Constraint
weighting are basically employed to identify global bottlenecks in a CSP.
  In this paper, we propose a new approach for learning weights for the
constraints using competitive coevolutionary Genetic Algorithm (GA). Weights
learned by the coevolutionary GA later help to make better choices for the
first few variables in a search. In the competitive coevolutionary GA,
constraints and candidate solutions for a CSP evolve together through an
inverse fitness interaction process. We have conducted experiments on several
random, quasi-random and patterned instances to measure the efficiency of the
proposed approach. The results and analysis show that the proposed approach is
good at learning weights to distinguish the hard constraints for quasi-random
instances and forced satisfiable random instances generated with the Model RB.
For other type of instances, RNDI still seems to be the best approach as our
experiments show.
