Wiring systems powered by high-efficient superconductors have long been a
dream of scientists, but researchers have faced practical challenges such as
finding flexible materials. Here we report superconductivity in Nb2PdxS5-delta
fibers with transition temperature up to 7.43 K, which have typical diameters
of 0.3-3 micrometer. Superconductivity occurs in a wide range of Pd and S
contents, suggesting that the superconductivity in this system is very robust.
Long fibers with suitable size provide a new route to high-power transmission
cables and electronic devices.
