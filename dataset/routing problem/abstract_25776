Evolutionary graph theory studies the evolutionary dynamics of populations
structured on graphs. A central problem is determining the probability that a
small number of mutants overtake a population. Currently, Monte Carlo
simulations are used for estimating such fixation probabilities on general
directed graphs, since no good analytical methods exist. In this paper, we
introduce a novel deterministic framework for computing fixation probabilities
for strongly connected, directed, weighted evolutionary graphs under neutral
drift. We show how this framework can also be used to calculate the expected
number of mutants at a given time step (even if we relax the assumption that
the graph is strongly connected), how it can extend to other related models
(e.g. voter model), how our framework can provide non-trivial bounds for
fixation probability in the case of an advantageous mutant, and how it can be
used to find a non-trivial lower bound on the mean time to fixation. We provide
various experimental results determining fixation probabilities and expected
number of mutants on different graphs. Among these, we show that our method
consistently outperforms Monte Carlo simulations in speed by several orders of
magnitude. Finally we show how our approach can provide insight into synaptic
competition in neurology.
