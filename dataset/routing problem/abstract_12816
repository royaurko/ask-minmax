~Based on the gauge invariant quark canonical momentum we construct two
theoretically possible decompositions of nucleon momentum to those of quarks
and gluons. We predict that either 6% or 21% of nucleon momentum is carried by
gluons, depending on what type of gluons are in nucleons. We clarify the
existing confusions on this problem and discuss the physical implications of
our result on the proton spin crisis problem.
