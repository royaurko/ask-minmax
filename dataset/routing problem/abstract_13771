The list coloring problem is a variant of vertex coloring where a vertex may
be colored only a color from a prescribed set. Several applications of vertex
coloring are more appropriately modelled as instances of list coloring and thus
we argue that it is an important problem to consider. Regardless of the
importance of list coloring, few published algorithms exist for it. In this
paper we review the only two existing ones we could find and propose an exact
branch and bound one. We conduct an experimental evaluation of the three
algorithms.
