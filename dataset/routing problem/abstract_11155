Finding low-weight multiples of a binary polynomial is a difficult problem
arising in the context of stream ciphers cryptanalysis. The classical algorithm
to solve this problem is based on a time memory trade-off. We will present an
improvement to this approach using discrete logarithm rather than a direct
representation of the involved polynomials. This gives an algorithm which
improves the theoretical complexity, and is also very flexible in practice.
