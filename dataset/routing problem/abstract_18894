The reduced basis method is a model reduction technique yielding substantial
savings of computational time when a solution to a parametrized equation has to
be computed for many values of the parameter. Certification of the
approximation is possible by means of an a posteriori error bound. Under
appropriate assumptions, this error bound is computed with an algorithm of
complexity independent of the size of the full problem. In practice, the
evaluation of the error bound can become very sensitive to round-off errors. We
propose herein an explanation of this fact. A first remedy has been proposed in
[F. Casenave, Accurate \textit{a posteriori} error evaluation in the reduced
basis method. \textit{C. R. Math. Acad. Sci. Paris} \textbf{350} (2012)
539--542.]. Herein, we improve this remedy by proposing a new approximation of
the error bound using the Empirical Interpolation Method (EIM). This method
achieves higher levels of accuracy and requires potentially less
precomputations than the usual formula. A version of the EIM stabilized with
respect to round-off errors is also derived. The method is illustrated on a
simple one-dimensional diffusion problem and a three-dimensional acoustic
scattering problem solved by a boundary element method.
