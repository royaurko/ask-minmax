We look for particular solutions to the restricted three-body problem where
the bodies are allowed to either lose or gain mass to or from a static
atmosphere. In the case that all the masses are proportional to the same
function of time,we find analogous solution to the five stationary solutions of
the usual restricted problem of constant masses: the three collinear and the
two triangular solutions, but now the relative distance of the bodies changes
with time at the same rate. Under some restrictions, there are also coplanar,
infinitely remote and ring solutions.
