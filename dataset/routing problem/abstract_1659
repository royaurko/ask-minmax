Many successful terrorist groups operate across international borders where
different countries host different stages of terrorist operations. Often the
recruits for the group come from one country or countries, while the targets of
the operations are in another. Stopping such attacks is difficult because
intervention in any region or route might merely shift the terrorists
elsewhere. Here we propose a model of transnational terrorism based on the
theory of activity networks. The model represents attacks on different
countries as paths in a network. The group is assumed to prefer paths of lowest
cost (or risk) and maximal yield from attacks. The parameters of the model are
computed for the Islamist-Salafi terrorist movement based on open source data
and then used for estimation of risks of future attacks. The central finding is
that the USA has an enduring appeal as a target, due to lack of other nations
of matching geopolitical weight or openness. It is also shown that countries in
Africa and Asia that have been overlooked as terrorist bases may become highly
significant threats in the future. The model quantifies the dilemmas facing
countries in the effort to cut such networks, and points to a limitation of
deterrence against transnational terrorists.
