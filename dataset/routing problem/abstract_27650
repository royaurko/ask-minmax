Information flow properties express the capability for an agent to infer
information about secret behaviours of a partially observable system. In a
language-theoretic setting, where the system behaviour is described by a
language, we define the class of rational information flow properties (RIFP),
where observers are modeled by finite transducers, acting on languages in a
given family $\mathcal{L}$. This leads to a general decidability criterion for
the verification problem of RIFPs on $\mathcal{L}$, implying
PSPACE-completeness for this problem on regular languages. We show that most
trace-based information flow properties studied up to now are RIFPs, including
those related to selective declassification and conditional anonymity. As a
consequence, we retrieve several existing decidability results that were
obtained by ad-hoc proofs.
