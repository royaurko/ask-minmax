In this paper we propose a collocation method for solving some well-known
classes of Lane-Emden type equations which are nonlinear ordinary differential
equations on the semi-infinite domain. They are categorized as singular initial
value problems. The proposed approach is based on a Hermite function
collocation (HFC) method. To illustrate the reliability of the method, some
special cases of the equations are solved as test examples. The new method
reduces the solution of a problem to the solution of a system of algebraic
equations. Hermite functions have prefect properties that make them useful to
achieve this goal. We compare the present work with some well-known results and
show that the new method is efficient and applicable.
