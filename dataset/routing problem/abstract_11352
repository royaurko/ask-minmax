We solve the general problem of mixing of electromagnetic and scalar or
pseudoscalar fields coupled by axion-type interactions ${\cal L}_{int}
=g_{\phi} \phi \epsilon_{\mu \nu \a \b}F^{\mu \nu}F^{\a \b} $. The problem
depends on several dimensionful scales, including the magnitude and direction
of background magnetic field, the pseudoscalar mass, plasma frequency,
propagation frequency, wave number, and finally the pseudoscalar coupling. We
apply the results to the first consistent calculations of the mixing of light
propagating in a background magnetic field of varying direction, which shows a
great variety of fascinating resonant and polarization effects.
