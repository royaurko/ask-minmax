Motivated by questions in robust control and switched linear dynamical
systems, we consider the problem checking whether all convex combinations of k
matrices in R^{n x n} are stable. In particular, we are interested whether
there exist algorithms which can solve this problem in time polynomial in n and
k. We show that if $k= \lceil n^d \rceil$ for any fixed real d>0, then the
problem is NP-hard, meaning that no polynomial-time algorithm in n exists
provided that P is not NP, a widely believed conjecture in computer science. On
the other hand, when k is a constant independent of n, then it is known that
the problem may be solved in polynomial time in n. Using these results and the
method of measurable switching rules, we prove our main statement: verifying
the absolute asymptotic stability of a continuous-time switched linear system
with more than n^d matrices A_i in R^{n x n} satisfying 0 >= A_i + A_i^{T} is
NP-hard.
