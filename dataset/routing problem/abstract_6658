In this paper, we study a class of initial-boundary value problems for the
Korteweg-de Vries equation posed on a bounded domain $(0,L)$. We show that the
initial-boundary value problem is locally well-posed in the classical Sobolev
space $H^s(0,L)$ for $s>-\frac34$, which provides a positive answer to one of
the open questions of Colin and Ghidalia .
