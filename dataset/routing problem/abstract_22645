For a delta-correlated velocity field, simultaneous correlation functions of
a passive scalar satisfy closed equations. We analyze the equation for the
four-point function. To describe a solution completely, one has to solve the
matching problems at the scale of the source and at the diffusion scale. We
solve both the matching problems and thus find the dependence of the four-point
correlation function on the diffusion and pumping scale for large space
dimensionality $d$. It is shown that anomalous scaling appears in the first
order of $1/d$ perturbation theory. Anomalous dimensions are found analytically
both for the scalar field and for it's derivatives, in particular, for the
dissipation field.
