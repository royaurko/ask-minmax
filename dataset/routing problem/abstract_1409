The ANTARES group at the University of Erlangen is working towards the
integration of a set of acoustic sensors into the ANTARES Neutrino Telescope.
With this setup, tests of acoustic particle detection methods and background
studies shall be performed. The ANTARES Neutrino Telescope, which is currently
being constructed in the Mediterranean Sea, will be equipped with the
infrastructure to accommodate a 3-dimensional array of photomultipliers for the
detection of Cherenkov light. Within this infrastructure, the required
resources for acoustic sensors are available: Bandwidth for the transmission of
the acoustic data to the shore, electrical power for the off-shore electronics
and physical space to install the acoustic sensors and to route the connecting
cables (transmitting signals and power) into the electronics containers. It
will be explained how the integration will be performed with minimal
modifications of the existing ANTARES design and which setup is foreseen for
the acquisition of the acoustic data.
