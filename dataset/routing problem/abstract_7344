We present and discuss some open problems formulated by participants of the
International Workshop "Knots, Braids, and Auto\-mor\-phism Groups" held in
Novosibirsk, 2014. Problems are related to palindromic and commutator widths of
groups; properties of Brunnian braids and two-colored braids, corresponding to
an amalgamation of groups; extreme properties of hyperbolic 3-orbifold groups,
relations between inner and quasi-inner automorphisms of groups; and Staic's
construction of symmetric cohomology of groups.
