We study the gap probabilities of the single-time Tacnode process. Through
steepest descent analysis of a suitable Riemann-Hilbert problem, we show that
under appropriate scaling regimes the gap probability of the Tacnode process
degenerates into a product of two independent gap probabilities of the Airy
processes.
