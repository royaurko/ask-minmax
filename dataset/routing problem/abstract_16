The internet is now-a-days experiencing a stress due to some inherent
problems with the main interdomain routing protocol, boarder gateway protocol
(BGP), the amount of time it takes to converge, number of update message
exchanged followed by a failure to stabilize, the amount of time required to
get a valid alternate path following the failure, the way size of routing table
increasing, and security issues like integrity and privacy of routing tables
and routing updates exchanged among the routers, are of our primary concern. In
our proposed research work we plan to address aforementioned issues related to
internet routing specially in boarder gateway protocol to enable BGP to offer
expeditious unswerving routing to corroborate nascent internet. We plan to make
some changes in the design of boarder gateway protocol and may introduce
addition of extra features in BGP to help support above mentioned objective.
