NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory put on You Tube a problem that has been
baffling the scientists for sometime. It involves an unexpected force acting on
the space probes. The contributor proves that NASA'S satellite orbit anomaly problem
can be solved in the frame of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. The
anomaly confirms that gravity fields propagate with velocity of light as
Einstein predicted. The proof is based on the contributors discovery of the
relativistic version of Newton's gravity field. The contributor provides formulas
for relativistic equation of motion for a spacecraft in the joint gravitational
field of the Earth and the Sun in a Lorentzian frame attached to the Earth. The
formulas are suitable for digital computers and can be easily implemented. He
also shows how to find solutions of the relativistic equations of motion for
the spacecraft.
