Quantum Mechanics at Planck scale is considered as a deformation of the
conventional Quantum Mechanics. Similar to the earlier works of the contributor, the
main object of deformation is the density matrix. On this basis a notion of the
entropy density is introduced that is a matrix value used for a detail study of
the Information Problem at the Universe, and in particular, for the Information
Paradox Problem.
