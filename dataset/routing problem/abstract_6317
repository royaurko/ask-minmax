Treating a boundary value problem in analytical fluid dynamics, translation
of 2D steady Navier-Stokes equations to ordinary differential form leads to a
second order equation of Riccati type. In the case of a compressible fluid with
constant kinematic viscosity along streamlines, it is possible to find an exact
solution of the differential problem by rational combination of Airy's
functions and their derivatives.
