We introduce a gaussian probability density for the space-time distribution
of wormholes, thus taking effectively into account wormhole interaction. Using
a mean-field approximation for the free energy, we show that giant wormholes
are probabilistically suppressed in a homogenous isotropic ``large'' universe.
