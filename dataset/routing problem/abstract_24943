In this paper we develop a new approach to sparse principal component
analysis (sparse PCA). We propose two single-unit and two block optimization
formulations of the sparse PCA problem, aimed at extracting a single sparse
dominant principal component of a data matrix, or more components at once,
respectively. While the initial formulations involve nonconvex functions, and
are therefore computationally intractable, we rewrite them into the form of an
optimization program involving maximization of a convex function on a compact
set. The dimension of the search space is decreased enormously if the data
matrix has many more columns (variables) than rows. We then propose and analyze
a simple gradient method suited for the task. It appears that our algorithm has
best convergence properties in the case when either the objective function or
the feasible set are strongly convex, which is the case with our single-unit
formulations and can be enforced in the block case. Finally, we demonstrate
numerically on a set of random and gene expression test problems that our
approach outperforms existing algorithms both in quality of the obtained
solution and in computational speed.
