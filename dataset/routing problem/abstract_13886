Conditions are established under which Fredholmness, Coburn's property and
one- or two-sided invertibility are shared by a Toeplitz operator with matrix
symbol $G$ and the Toeplitz operator with scalar symbol $\det G$. These results
are based on one-sided invertibility criteria for rectangular matrices over
appropriate commutative rings and related scalar corona type problems.
