In this paper we present an algorithm for determining whether a subgroup H of
a non-connected reductive group G is G-completely reducible. The algorithm
consists of a series of reductions; at each step, we perform operations
involving connected groups, such as checking whether a certain subgroup of G^0
is G^0 -cr. This essentially reduces the problem of determining G-complete
reducibility to the connected case.
