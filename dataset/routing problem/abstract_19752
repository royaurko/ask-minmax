Motivated by the initial-boundary value problem for the Einstein equations,
we propose a definition of symmetric hyperbolicity for systems of evolution
equations that are first order in time but second order in space. This can be
used to impose constraint-preserving boundary conditions. The general methods
are illustrated in detail in the toy model of electromagnetism.
