We address the problem of sampling double-ended diffusive paths. The ensemble
of paths is expressed using a symmetric version of the Onsager-Machlup formula,
which only requires evaluation of the force field and which, upon direct time
discretization, gives rise to a symmetric integrator that is accurate to second
order. Efficiently sampling this ensemble requires avoiding the well-known
stiffness problem associated with sampling infinitesimal Brownian increments of
the path, as well as a different type of stiffness associated with sampling the
coarse features of long paths. The fine-feature sampling stiffness is
eliminated with the use of the fast sampling algorithm (FSA), and the
coarse-feature sampling stiffness is avoided by introducing the sliding and
sampling (S&S) algorithm. A key feature of the S&S algorithm is that it enables
massively parallel computers to sample diffusive trajectories that are long in
time. We use the algorithm to sample the transition path ensemble for the
structural interconversion of the 38-atom Lennard-Jones cluster at low
temperature.
