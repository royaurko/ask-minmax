It is shown that the alpha^2-dynamo of Magnetohydrodynamics, the hydrodynamic
Squire equation as well as an interpolation model of PT-symmetric Quantum
Mechanics are closely related as spectral problems in Krein spaces. For the
alpha^2-dynamo and the PT-symmetric model the strong similarities are
demonstrated with the help of a 2x2 operator matrix representation, whereas the
Squire equation is re-interpreted as a rescaled and Wick-rotated PT-symmetric
problem. Based on recent results on the Squire equation the spectrum of the
PT-symmetric interpolation model is analyzed in detail and the Herbst limit is
described as spectral singularity.
