The natural order in the space of binary sequences permits to recover the
$U$-sequence. Also the scaling laws of the period-doubling cascade and the
intermittency route to chaos defined in that ordered set are explained. These
arise as intrinsic properties of this ordered set, and independent from any
consideration about dynamical systems.
