Given an embedded planar acyclic digraph G, we define the problem of "acyclic
hamiltonian path completion with crossing minimization (Acyclic-HPCCM)" to be
the problem of determining an hamiltonian path completion set of edges such
that, when these edges are embedded on G, they create the smallest possible
number of edge crossings and turn G to a hamiltonian digraph. Our results
include:
  --We provide a characterization under which a triangulated st-digraph G is
hamiltonian.
  --For an outerplanar triangulated st-digraph G, we define the st-polygon
decomposition of G and, based on its properties, we develop a linear-time
algorithm that solves the Acyclic-HPCCM problem with at most one crossing per
edge of G.
  --For the class of st-planar digraphs, we establish an equivalence between
the Acyclic-HPCCM problem and the problem of determining an upward 2-page
topological book embedding with minimum number of spine crossings. We infer
(based on this equivalence) for the class of outerplanar triangulated
st-digraphs an upward topological 2-page book embedding with minimum number of
spine crossings and at most one spine crossing per edge.
  To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that edge-crossing
minimization is studied in conjunction with the acyclic hamiltonian completion
problem and the first time that an optimal algorithm with respect to spine
crossing minimization is presented for upward topological book embeddings.
