This thesis starts from a review on current research on the local
hypoellipticity of the $\bar\partial$-Neumann problem. It presents the
classical method of regularity from estimates of the energy: subelliptic as
well as superlogarithmic. More recent material is included in which the
regularity of the solution is obtained from the geometry of the singularities
of the Levi form. The new contribution to this discussion consists in a general
weighted Kohn-H\"ormander-Morrey formula twisted by a pseudodifferential
operator. As an application, a new class of domains for which the
$\bar\partial$-Neumann problem is locally regular is exhibited.
