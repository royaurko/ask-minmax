In this paper, we study the problem of controllability of Schr\"odinger
equation. We prove that the system is exactly controllable in infinite time to
any position. The proof is based on an inverse mapping theorem for multivalued
functions. We show also that the system is not exactly controllable in finite
time in lower Sobolev spaces.
