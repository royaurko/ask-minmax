We have considered the following semi linear elliptic problem on the unit
disk $B$ $-\Delta u = \lambda_1 u+e^u+f $ in $B$ with the Dirichlet boundary
condition and $f$ satisfying the following condition : $f\in L^r(B)$, for some
$r>2$ and $-\int_B f\phi_1<4\pi$. Where $\phi_1$ is the eigen function of
$(-\Delta)$ corresponding to the first eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ in $H_0^1(B)$. We
shall find the existence of a radial solution of this PDE. We shall use degree
theory to get the existence starting from a suitable with known solution with
its degree. Connecting those two PDE's by homotopy and getting the uniform
estimate for the connecting PDE's we shall achieve our result.
