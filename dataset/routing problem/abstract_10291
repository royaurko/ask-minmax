We consider the problem of angle-robust joint transmit waveform and receive
filter design for colocated Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radar, in the
presence of signal-dependent interferences. The design problem is cast as a
max-min optimization problem to maximize the worst-case output
signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) with respect to the unknown
angle of the target of interest. Based on rank-one relaxation and semi-definite
programming (SDP) representation of a nonnegative trigonometric polynomial, a
cyclic optimization algorithm is proposed to tackle this problem. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated via numerical examples.
