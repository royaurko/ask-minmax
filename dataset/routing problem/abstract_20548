The unit cost model is both convenient and largely realistic for describing
integer decision algorithms over (+,*). Additional operations like division
with remainder or bitwise conjunction, although equally supported by computing
hardware, may lead to a considerable drop in complexity. We show a variety of
concrete problems to benefit from such NON-arithmetic primitives by presenting
and analyzing corresponding fast algorithms.
