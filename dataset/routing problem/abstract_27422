This paper studies reachability, coverability and inclusion problems for
Integer Vector Addition Systems with States (ZVASS) and extensions and
restrictions thereof. A ZVASS comprises a finite-state controller with a finite
number of counters ranging over the integers. Although it is folklore that
reachability in ZVASS is NP-complete, it turns out that despite their
naturalness, from a complexity point of view this class has received little
attention in the literature. We fill this gap by providing an in-depth analysis
of the computational complexity of the aforementioned decision problems. Most
interestingly, it turns out that while the addition of reset operations to
ordinary VASS leads to undecidability and Ackermann-hardness of reachability
and coverability, respectively, they can be added to ZVASS while retaining
NP-completness of both coverability and reachability.
