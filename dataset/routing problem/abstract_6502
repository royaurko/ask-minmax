We provide general product formulas for the solutions of non-autonomous
abstract Cauchy problems. The main technical tool is the application of
evolution semigroup methods, allowing the direct application of existing
results on autonomous problems. The results are then illustrated by the example
of a imaginary time Schr\"odinger equation with time dependent potential. We
also obtain convergence rates for the Strang-splitting applied to this problem.
