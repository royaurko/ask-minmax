This paper studies the Cauchy problem for systems of semi-linear wave
equations on $\mathbb{R}^{3+1}$ with nonlinear terms satisfying the null
conditions. We construct future global-in-time classical solutions with
arbitrarily large initial energy. The proof adapts the short pulse method
introduced by Christodoulou in his works on the black-hole formations in
general relativity. He studied the characteristic data prescribed on the past
null infinity so that the decay rate of the solutions may be regarded as given.
The main difficulty of the current work is to derive the decay estimates for
the Cauchy problem. It requires a more delicate analysis on a relaxed
propagation estimate both on the decay and on the largeness of the solutions.
