Aim of this paper is the qualitative analysis of a boundary value problem for
a third order non linear parabolic equation which describes several dissipative
models. When the source term is linear, the problem is explictly solved by
means of a Fourier series with properties of rapid convergence. In the non
linear case, appropriate estimates of this series allow to deduce the
asymptotic behaviour of the solution.
