The problem of generating large transition magnetic moments for nearly
massless neutrinos in a truly three--generation case is discussed. A model to
achieve the same by exploiting an octahedral symmetry is presented. The scheme
also accomodates a radiatively generated mass of $17\:keV$ for a pseudo--Dirac
neutrino that decays rapidly through the Majoron channel.
