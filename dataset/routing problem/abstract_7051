In this paper, we extend the Beta divergence family to multivariate power
spectral densities. Similarly to the scalar case, we show that it smoothly
connects the multivariate Kullback-Leibler divergence with the multivariate
Itakura-Saito distance. We successively study a spectrum approximation problem,
based on the Beta divergence family, which is related to a multivariate
extension of the THREE spectral estimation technique. It is then possible to
characterize a family of solutions to the problem. An upper bound on the
complexity of these solutions will also be provided. Simulations suggest that
the most suitable solution of this family depends on the specific features
required from the estimation problem.
