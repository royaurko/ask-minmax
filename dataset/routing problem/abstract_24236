Evaluation of effective or macroscopic coefficients of thermal conductivity
under coupled heat and moisture transfer is presented. The paper first gives a
detailed summary on the solution of a simple steady state heat conduction
problem with an emphasis on various types of boundary conditions applied to the
representative volume element -- a periodic unit cell. Since the results
essentially suggest no superiority of any type of boundary conditions, the
paper proceeds with the coupled nonlinear heat and moisture problem subjecting
the selected representative volume element to the prescribed macroscopically
uniform heat flux. This allows for a direct use of the academic or commercially
available codes. Here, the presented results are derived with the help of the
SIFEL (SIimple Finite Elements) system.
