In this paper we study the generalized Erdos-Falconer distance problems in
the finite field setting. The generalized distances are defined in terms of
polynomials, and various formulas for sizes of distance sets are obtained. In
particular, we develop a simple formula for estimating the cardinality of
distance sets determined by diagonal polynomials. As a result, we generalize
the spherical distance problems due to Iosevich and Rudnev and the cubic
distance problems due to Iosevich and Koh. Moreover, our results are of higher
dimensional version for Vu's work on two dimension. In addition, we set up and
study the generalized pinned distance problems in finite fields. We give a nice
generalization of some recent work in which the pinned distance problems
related to spherical distances were investigated. Discrete Fourier analysis and
exponential sum estimates play an important role in our proof.
