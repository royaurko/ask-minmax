The low-rank matrix completion problem can be succinctly stated as follows:
given a subset of the entries of a matrix, find a low-rank matrix consistent
with the observations. While several low-complexity algorithms for matrix
completion have been proposed so far, it remains an open problem to devise
search procedures with provable performance guarantees for a broad class of
matrix models. The standard approach to the problem, which involves the
minimization of an objective function defined using the Frobenius metric, has
inherent difficulties: the objective function is not continuous and the
solution set is not closed. To address this problem, we consider an
optimization procedure that searches for a column (or row) space that is
geometrically consistent with the partial observations. The geometric objective
function is continuous everywhere and the solution set is the closure of the
solution set of the Frobenius metric. We also preclude the existence of local
minimizers, and hence establish strong performance guarantees, for special
completion scenarios, which do not require matrix incoherence or large matrix
size.
