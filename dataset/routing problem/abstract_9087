Problems of interface growth have received much attention recently Such are,
for example, the duffusion limited aggregation (DLA), random sequential
adsorption (RSA), Laplacian growth or flame front propagation. We will mainly
pay attention in this Thesis to the numerical and analytical investigation of
the last two problems. In addition to the fact that flame front propagation is
an interesting physical problem we feel that we can also explain experimental
results on the basis of theoretical investigations. There exists possibility to
use methods found for the flame front propagation, in different fields where
similar problems appear such as the important model of Laplacian growth .
