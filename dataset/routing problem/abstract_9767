Approximate analytical solution of two dimensional problem for stationary
Navier-Stokes, continuity and Fourier-Kirchhoff equations describing free
convective heat transfer from isothermal surface of half infinite vertical
plate is presented. The problem formulation is based on the typical for natural
convection assumptions: the fluid noncompressibility and Boussinesq
approximation. We also assume that orthogonal to the plate component of
velocity is small. Apart from the basic equations it includes boundary
conditions: the constant temperature and zero velocity on the plate. At the
starting point of the flow we fix average temperature and vertical component of
velocity, as well as basic conservation laws in integral form. The solution of
the boundary problem is represented as a Taylor Series in horizontal variable
with coefficients depending on vertical variable.
