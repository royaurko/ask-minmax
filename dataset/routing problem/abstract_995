Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) consist of sensor nodes which can be deployed
for various operations such as agriculture and environmental sensing, wild life
monitoring, health care, military surveillance, industrial control, home
automation, security etc. Quality of Service (QoS) is an important issue in
wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and providing QoS support in WSNs is an
emerging area of research. Due to resource constraints nature of sensor
networks like processing power, memory, bandwidth, energy etc. providing QoS
support in WSNs is a challenging task. Delay is an important QoS parameter for
forwarding data in a time constraint WSNs environment. In this paper we propose
a delay aware routing protocol for transmission of time critical event
information to the Sink of WSNs. The performance of the proposed protocol is
evaluated by NS2 simulations under different scenarios.
