An approach to solving the Strong CP Problem in supersymmetric theories is
discussed which uses abelian family symmetries to align the mass matrices of
the quarks and squarks. In this way both the Strong CP Problem and the
characteristic flavor and CP problems of supersymmetry can be solved in a
single way.
