The rectification efficiency of an underdamped ratchet operated in the
adiabatic regime increases according to a scaling current-amplitude curve as
the damping constant approaches a critical threshold; below threshold the
rectified signal becomes extremely irregular and eventually its time average
drops to zero. Periodic (locked) and diffusive (fully chaotic) trajectories
coexist on fine tuning the amplitude of the input signal. The transition from
regular to chaotic transport in noiseless ratchets is studied numerically.
