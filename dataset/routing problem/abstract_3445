In this volume in honor of GianCarlo Ghirardi, I discuss my involvement with
ideas of dynamical collapse of the state vector. 10 problems are introduced, 9
of which were seen following my initial work. 4 of these problems had a
resolution in GianCarlo Ghirardi, Alberto Rimini and Tullio Weber's Spontaneous
Localization (SL) model (which added 1 more problem). This stimulated a
(somewhat different) resolution of these 5 problems in the Continuous
Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model, in which I combined my initial work with
SL. In an upcoming volume in honor of Abner Shimony I shall discuss the status
of the 5 remaining post-CSL problems.
