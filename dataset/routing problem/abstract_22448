The problem of determining gauge and monoidal equivalence classes of fusion
categories is considered from the perspective of geometric invariant theory. It
is shown that the gauge (or monoidal) class of a fusion category is determined
by the evaluation of a finite set of gauge (or monoidal) invariant functions.
In the multiplicity free case this leads to a fast algorithm for computing a
classifying set of functions.
