We introduce a flexible almost isometric version of the almost transitivity
property of Banach spaces. With the help of this new notion we generalize to
several directions a strong recent rotational characterization of Hilbert
spaces due to Randrianantoanina. This characterization is a partial answer to
the classical Banach-Mazur rotation problem.
