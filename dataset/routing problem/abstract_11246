The DESY-Swansea Collaboration performed numerical simulations investigating
SU(2) lattice gauge theory at non-zero chemical potential with one staggered
quark flavour in the adjoint representation. This lattice model has similar
features to QCD itself and its study gives interesting insights into some open
problems of high density quark matter. In particular the role of the ``sign
problem'' can be clarified in connection with diquark condensation and the
phase diagram.
