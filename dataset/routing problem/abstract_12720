In an effort to aid communication among different fields and perhaps
facilitate progress on problems common to all of them, this article discusses
hidden Markov processes from several viewpoints, especially that of symbolic
dynamics, where they are known as sofic measures, or continuous shift-commuting
images of Markov measures. It provides background, describes known tools and
methods, surveys some of the literature, and proposes several open problems.
