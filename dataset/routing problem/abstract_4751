This paper is concerned with the existence and uniqueness of the solution to
a doubly nonlinear parabolic problem which arises directly from a circuit model
of microwave heating. Beyond the relevance from a physical point of view, the
problem is very interesting also in a mathematical approach: in fact, it
consists of a nonlinear partial differential equation with a further
nonlinearity in the boundary condition. Actually, we are going to prove a
general result: the two nonlinearities are allowed to be maximal monotone
operators and then an existence result will be shown for the resulting problem.
