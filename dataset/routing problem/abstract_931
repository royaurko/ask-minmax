CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) ceramics which has perovskite structure gained
considerable attention due to its giant permittivity. But, it has high tan
{\delta} (0.1 at 1kHz) at room temperature, which needs to be minimised to the
level of practical applications. Hence, TeO2 which is a good glass former has
been deliberately added to CCTO nano ceramic (derived from the oxalate
precursor route) to explore the possibility of reducing the dielectric loss
while maintaining the high permittivity. The structural, morphological and
dielectric properties of the pure CCTO and TeO2 added ceramics were studied
using X-ray diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscope along with Energy
Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDX), spectroscopy and Impedance analyzer. For the
2.0 wt % TeO2 added ceramics, there is a remarkable difference in the
microstructural features as compared to that of pure CCTO ceramics. This sample
exhibited permittivity values as high as 7387 @ 10 KHz and low dielectric loss
value of 0.037 @ 10 kHz, which can be exploited for the high frequency
capacitors application.
