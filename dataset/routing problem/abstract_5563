The SUSY CP problem is one of serious problems in construction of realistic
supersymmetric standard models. We consider the problem in a framework in which
adjoint chiral multiplets are introduced and gauginos have Dirac mass terms
induced by a U(1) gauge interaction in the hidden sector. This is realized in
hidden sector models without singlet chiral multiplets, which are favored from
a recent study of the Polonyi problem. We find that the dominant contributions
to electron and neutron electric dipole moments (EDMs) in the model come from
phases in the supersymmetric adjoint mass terms. When the supersymmetric
adjoint masses are suppressed by a factor of \sim 100 compared with the Dirac
ones, the electron and neutron EDMs are suppressed below the experimental bound
even if the SUSY particle masses are around 1 TeV. Thus, this model works as a
framework to solve the SUSY CP problem.
