We address the question of radiation emitted from a collapsing star. We
consider the simple model of a spherical star consisting of pressure-free dust
and we derive the emission spectrum via a systematic asymptotic expansion of
the complete Bogolubov amplitude. We present a review of standard features of
the problem and we point out certain inconsistencies in previous derivations.
