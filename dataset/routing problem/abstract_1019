We present the first theoretical approach to the angular-average of the
two-body correlation function $\tilde g(r)$ for simple solids. It is based on
three sum rules for $\tilde g(r)$: the compressibility and virial equations and
the normalization. We apply the theory to determine this correlation function
for the case of the FCC solid phase of hard spheres. The agreement with
simulation data is excellent over all the density range. The application to
other simple systems is discussed. The approach opens a new route to
perturbation theories for simple solids.
