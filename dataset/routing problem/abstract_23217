A classical solution to the Yang-Mills theory is given a new semiclassical
interpretation in terms of particle scattering. It solves the complex time
boundary value problem, which arises in the semiclassical approximation to a
multi particle transition probability in the one-instanton sector at fixed
energy. The imaginary part of the action of the solution on the complex time
contour and its topological charge obey the same relation as the self-dual
Euclidean configurations. Hence the solution is relevant for the problem of
tunneling with fermion number violation in the electroweak theory. It describes
transitions from an initial state with a smaller number of particles to a final
state with a larger number of particles. The implications of these results for
multi particle production in the electroweak theory are also discussed.
