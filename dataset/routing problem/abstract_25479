We analyze the setting of minimum-cost perfect matchings with selfish
vertices through the price of anarchy (PoA) and price of stability (PoS) lens.
The underlying solution concept used for this analysis is the Gale-Shapley
stable matching notion, where the preferences are determined so that each
player (vertex) wishes to minimize the cost of her own matching edge.
