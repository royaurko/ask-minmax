In this paper, an error analysis of a three steps two level Galekin finite
element method for the two dimensional transient Navier-Stokes equations is
discussed. First of all, the problem is discretized in spatial direction by
employing finite element method on a coarse mesh $\mathcal{T} _H$ with mesh
size $H$. Then, in step two, the nonlinear system is linearized around the
coarse grid solution, say, $u_H$, which is similar to Newton's type iteration
and the resulting linear system is solved on a finer mesh $\mathcal{T}_h$ with
mesh size $h$. In step three, a correction is obtained through solving a linear
problem on the finer mesh and an updated final solution is derived. Optimal
error estimates in $L^{\infty}({\bf L}^2)$-norm, when $h=\mathcal{O}
(H^{2-\delta})$ and in $L^{\infty}(\bH^1)$-norm, when
$h=\mathcal{O}(H^{4-\delta})$ for the velocity and in $L^{\infty}(L^2)$-norm,
when $h=\mathcal{O}(H^{4-\delta})$ for the pressure are established for
arbitrarily small $\delta>0$. Further, under uniqueness assumption, these
estimates are proved to be valid uniformly in time. Then based on backward
Euler method, a completely discrete scheme is analyzed and {\it a priori} error
estimates are derived. Finally, the paper is concluded with some numerical
experiments.
