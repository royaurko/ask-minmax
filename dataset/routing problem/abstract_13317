The Macaulay2 package PHCpack.m2 provides an interface to PHCpack, a
general-purpose polynomial system solver that uses homotopy continuation. The
main method is a numerical blackbox solver which is implemented for all Laurent
systems. The package also provides a fast mixed volume computation, the ability
to filter solutions, homotopy path tracking, and a numerical irreducible
decomposition method. As the size of many problems in applied algebraic
geometry often surpasses the capabilities of symbolic software, this package
will be of interest to those working on problems involving large polynomial
systems.
