We propose and analyze a mathematical model of Modulated Luminescent
Tomography. We show that when single X-rays or focused X-rays are used as an
excitation, the problem is similar to the inversion of weighted X-ray
transforms. In particular, we give an explicit inversion in the case of Dual
Cone X-ray excitation.
