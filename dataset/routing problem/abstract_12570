We consider the direct and inverse spectral problems for Dirac operators that
are generated by the differential expressions $$ \mathfrak t_q:=\frac{1}{i}[I&0
0&-I]\frac{d}{dx}+[0&q q^*&0] $$ and some separated boundary conditions. Here
$q$ is an $r\times r$ matrix-valued function with entries belonging to
$L_2((0,1),\mathbb C)$ and $I$ is the identity $r\times r$ matrix. We give a
complete description of the spectral data (eigenvalues and suitably introduced
norming matrices) for the operators under consideration and suggest an
algorithm of reconstructing the potential $q$ from the corresponding spectral
data.
