We give a counterexample to the long standing conjecture that the ball
maximises the first eigenvalue of the Robin eigenvalue problem with negative
parameter among domains of the same volume. Furthermore, we show that the
conjecture holds in two dimensions provided that the boundary parameter is
small. This is the first known example within the class of isoperimetric
spectral problems for the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian where the ball is
not an optimiser.
