The quadratic traveling salesman problem (QTSP) is to find a least cost
Hamiltonian cycle in an edge-weighted graph. We define a restricted version of
QTSP, the $k$-neighbour TSP (TSP($k$)), and give a linear time algorithm to
solve TSP($k$) on a Halin graph for $k\leq 3$. This algorithm can be extended
to solve TSP($k$) on any fully reducible class of graphs for any fixed $k$ in
polynomial time. This result generalizes corresponding results for the standard
TSP. Further, these results are useful in establishing approximation bounds
based on domination analysis. TSP($k$) can be used to model various machine
scheduling problems including an optimal routing problem for UAVs.
