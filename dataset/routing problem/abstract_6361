We consider the inverse problem for periodic sl(2) lattices as a canonical
transformation from the separation to local variables. A new concept of a
factorized separation chain is introduced allowing to solve the inverse problem
explicitly. The method is applied to an arbitrary representation of the
corresponding Sklyanin algebra.
