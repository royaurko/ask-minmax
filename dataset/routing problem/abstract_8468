We apply the splitting method to three well-known counting problems, namely
3-SAT, random graphs with prescribed degrees, and binary contingency tables. We
present an enhanced version of the splitting method based on the
capture-recapture technique, and show by experiments the superiority of this
technique for SAT problems in terms of variance of the associated estimators,
and speed of the algorithms.
