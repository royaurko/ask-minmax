In this contribution we present a new computational method for coupled
bulk-surface problems modeling the evolution of soluble surfactants on
time-dependent domains. The method is based on a space-time formulation using
discontinuous piecewise linear elements in time and continuous piecewise linear
elements in space on a fixed background mesh. The domain is represented using a
piecewise linear level set function on the background mesh and a cut finite
element method is used to discretize the bulk and surface problems. In the cut
finite element method the bilinear forms associated with the weak formulation
of the problem are directly evaluated on the bulk domain and the surface
defined by the level set, essentially using the restrictions of the piecewise
linear functions to the computational domain. In addition a stabilization term
is added to stabilize convection as well as the resulting algebraic system that
is solved in each time step. We show in numerical examples that the resulting
method is accurate and stable and results in well conditioned algebraic systems
independent of the position of the interface relative to the background mesh.
