We consider the problem of optimizing the locations of source nodes in
transportation networks. A reduction of the fraction of surplus nodes induces a
glassy transition. In contrast to most constraint satisfaction problems
involving discrete variables, our problem involves continuous variables which
lead to cavity fields in the form of functions. The one-step replica symmetry
breaking (1RSB) solution involves solving a stable distribution of functionals,
which is in general infeasible. In this paper, we obtain small closed sets of
functional cavity fields and demonstrate how functional recursions are
converted to simple recursions of probabilities, which make the 1RSB solution
feasible. The physical results in the replica symmetric (RS) and the 1RSB
frameworks are thus derived and the stability of the RS and 1RSB solutions are
examined.
