We reexamine fundamental problems from computational geometry in the word RAM
model, where input coordinates are integers that fit in a machine word. We
develop a new algorithm for offline point location, a two-dimensional analog of
sorting where one needs to order points with respect to segments. This result
implies, for example, that the convex hull of n points in three dimensions can
be constructed in (randomized) time n 2^O(sqrt{lglg n}). Similar bounds hold
for numerous other geometric problems, such as planar Voronoi diagrams, planar
off-line nearest neighbor search, line segment intersection, and triangulation
of non-simple polygons.
  In FOCS'06, we developed a data structure for online point location, which
implied a bound of O(n lg n/lglg n) for three-dimensional convex hulls and the
other problems. Our current bounds are dramatically better, and a convincing
improvement over the classic O(nlg n) algorithms. As in the field of integer
sorting, the main challenge is to find ways to manipulate information, while
avoiding the online problem (in that case, predecessor search).
