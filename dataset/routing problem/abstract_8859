We define a new finite element method for a steady state elliptic problem
with discontinuous diffusion coefficients where the meshes are not aligned with
the interface. We prove optimal error estimates in the $L^2$ norm and $H^1$
weighted semi-norm independent of the contrast between the coefficients.
Numerical experiments validating our theoretical findings are provided.
