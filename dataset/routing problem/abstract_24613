The mean first passage time (MFPT) for a Brownian particle to reach a small
target in cellular microdomains is a key parameter for chemical activation.
Although asymptotic estimations of the MFPT are available for various
geometries, these formula cannot be applied to degenerated structures where one
dimension of is much smaller compared to the others. Here we study the narrow
escape time (NET) problem for a Brownian particle to reach a small target
located on the surface of a flat cylinder, where the cylinder height is
comparable to the target size, and much smaller than the cylinder radius. When
the cylinder is sealed, we estimate the MFPT for a Brownian particle to hit a
small disk located centrally on the lower surface. For a laterally open
cylinder, we estimate the conditional probability and the conditional MFPT to
reach the small disk before exiting through the lateral opening. We apply our
results to diffusion in the narrow synaptic cleft, and compute the fraction and
the mean time for neurotransmitters to find their specific receptors located on
the postsynaptic terminal. Finally, we confirm our formulas with Brownian
simulations.
