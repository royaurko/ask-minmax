We investigate the diffusion of particles in an attractive one-dimensional
potential that grows logarithmically for large $|x|$ using the Fokker-Planck
equation.
  An eigenfunction expansion shows that the Boltzmann equilibrium density does
not fully describe the long time limit of this problem. Instead this limit is
characterized by an infinite covariant density. This non-normalizable density
yields the mean square displacement of the particles, which for a certain range
of parameters exhibits anomalous diffusion. In a symmetric potential with an
asymmetric initial condition, the average position decays anomalously slowly.
This problem also has applications outside the thermal context, as in the
diffusion of the momenta of atoms in optical molasses.
