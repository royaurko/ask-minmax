In the literature concerning the monopole matter, three gauges: Dirac,
Schwinger, and Wu-Yang's, have been contrasted to each other, and the Wu-Yang's
often appears as the most preferable one. The article aims to analyse this view
by interpreting the monopole situation in terms of the conventioal Fourier
series theory; in particular, having relied on the Dirichlet theorem. It is
shown that the monopole case can be labelled as a very spesific and even rather
simple class of problems in the frame of that theory: all the three monopole
gauges amount to practicaly the same one-dimentional problem for functions
given on the interval [0,pi] having a single point of discontinuity; these
three vary only in its location.In addition, some general aspects of the
Aharonov-Bohm effect are discussed; the way of how any singular potentials such
as monopole's, being allowed in physics, touche the essence of the physical
gauge principle itself is considered.
