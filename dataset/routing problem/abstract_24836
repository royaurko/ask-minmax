Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) are useful in a broad range of
applications. In this paper we tackle the problem of learning a sparse GMRF in
a high-dimensional space. Our approach uses the l1-norm as a regularization on
the inverse covariance matrix. We utilize a novel projected gradient method,
which is faster than previous methods in practice and equal to the best
performing of these in asymptotic complexity. We also extend the l1-regularized
objective to the problem of sparsifying entire blocks within the inverse
covariance matrix. Our methods generalize fairly easily to this case, while
other methods do not. We demonstrate that our extensions give better
generalization performance on two real domains--biological network analysis and
a 2D-shape modeling image task.
