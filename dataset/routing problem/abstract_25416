Gaussian and quadratic approximations of message passing algorithms on graphs
have attracted considerable recent attention due to their computational
simplicity, analytic tractability, and wide applicability in optimization and
statistical inference problems. This paper presents a systematic framework for
incorporating such approximate message passing (AMP) methods in general
graphical models. The key concept is a partition of dependencies of a general
graphical model into strong and weak edges, with the weak edges representing
interactions through aggregates of small, linearizable couplings of variables.
AMP approximations based on the Central Limit Theorem can be readily applied to
the weak edges and integrated with standard message passing updates on the
strong edges. The resulting algorithm, which we call hybrid generalized
approximate message passing (Hybrid-GAMP), can yield significantly simpler
implementations of sum-product and max-sum loopy belief propagation. By varying
the partition of strong and weak edges, a performance-complexity trade-off can
be achieved. Structured sparsity problems are studied as an example of this
general methodology where there is a natural partition of edges.
