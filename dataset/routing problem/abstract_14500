In this paper we develop a Hamiltonian approach to sufficient conditions in
optimal control problems. We extend the known conditions for $C^2$ maximised
Hamiltonians into two directions: on the one hand we explain the role of a
super Hamiltonian (i.e. a Hamiltonian which is greater then or equal to the
maximised one) on the other we develop the theory under some minimal regularity
assumptions. The results we present enclose many known results and they can be
used to tackle new problems.
