It is well known that the bivariate polynomial interpolation problem at
domain points of a triangle is correct. Thus the corresponding interpolation
matrix $M$ is nonsingular. L.L. Schumaker stated the conjecture, that the
determinant of $M$ is positive. Furthermore, all its principal minors are
conjectured to be positive, too. This result would solve the constrained
interpolation problem. In this paper, the basic conjecture for the matrix $M$,
the conjecture on minors of polynomials for degree <=17 and for some particular
configurations of domain points are confirmed.
