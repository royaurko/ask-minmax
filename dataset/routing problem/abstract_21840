In this article, we consider the inverse Galois problem for parameterized
differential equations over k((t))(x) with k any field of characteristic zero
and use the method of patching over fields due to Harbater and Hartmann. As an
application, we prove that every connected semisimple k((t))-split linear
algebraic group is a parameterized Galois group over k((t))(x).
