Selecting customers for demand response programs is challenging and existing
methodologies are hard to scale and poor in performance. The existing methods
were limited by lack of temporal consumption information at the individual
customer level. We propose a scalable methodology for demand response targeting
utilizing novel data available from smart meters. The approach relies on
formulating the problem as a stochastic integer program involving predicted
customer responses. A novel approximation is developed algorithm so it can
scale to problems involving millions of customers. The methodology is tested
experimentally using real utility data.
