LaBaCaCu3O7 (La:1113) and NdBaCaCu3O7 (Nd:1113) compounds are synthesized by
solid state reaction route. Both compounds crystallize in tetragonal structure.
  Four probe resistivity measurements showed that superconducting transition
temperature (Tc) is 73 K and 41 K respectively for La:1113 and Nd:1113
compounds. Considering the fact that for RE:123 (REBa2Cu3O7) compounds the Tc
hardly depends upon the choice of RE (Rare earth, except Ce, Pr and Tb), the
current nearly two fold increase in Tc of La:1113 when compared to Nd:1113,
warrants serious discussion.
