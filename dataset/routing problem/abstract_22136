The ideas of model averaging are used to find weights in peak-over-threshold
problems using a possible range of thresholds. A range of the largest
observations are chosen and considered as possible thresholds, each time
performing estimation. Weights based on an information criterion for each
threshold are calculated. A weighted estimate of the threshold and shape
parameter can be calculated.
