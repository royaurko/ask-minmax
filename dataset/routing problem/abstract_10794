Monopolies in graphs have a quite long range of applications in several
problems related to overcoming failures, since they frequently have some common
approaches around the notion of majorities, for instance to consensus problems,
diagnosis problems or voting systems. Monopolies in graphs are also closely
related to different parameters in graphs. Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and
$X\subseteq V$, if $\delta_X(v)$ is the number of neighbors $v$ has in $X$, $k$
is an integer and $t$ is a positive integer, then we establish in this article
a connection between the following three concepts:
  - Given a nonempty set $M\subseteq V$ a vertex $v$ of $G$ is said to be
$k$-controlled by $M$ if $\delta_M(v)\ge \frac{\delta_V(v)}{2}+k$. The set $M$
is called a $k$-monopoly for $G$ if it $k$-controls every vertex $v$ of $G$.
  - A function $f: V\rightarrow \{-1,1\}$ is called a signed total
$t$-dominating function for $G$ if $f(N(v))=\sum_{v\in N(v)}f(v)\geq t$ for all
$v\in V$.
  - A nonempty set $S\subseteq V$ is a global (defensive and offensive)
$k$-alliance in $G$ if $\delta_S(v)\ge \delta_{V-S}(v)+k$ holds for every $v\in
V$.
  In this article we prove that the problem of computing the minimum
cardinality of a $0$-monopoly in a graph is NP-complete even restricted to
bipartite or chordal graphs. Nevertheless, for the case of trees the problem
becomes polynomial and we give an algorithm for computing the $0$-monopoly
number of a tree in polynomial time. In addition we present some general bounds
for the minimum cardinality of $k$-monopolies and we derive some exact values.
