Consider the initial-boundary value problem for a strictly hyperbolic,
genuinely nonlinear, Temple class system of conservation laws % $$
u_t+f(u)_x=0, \qquad u(0,x)=\ov u(x), \qquad {{array}{ll} &u(t,a)=\widetilde
u_a(t), \noalign{\smallskip} &u(t,b)=\widetilde u_b(t), {array}. \eqno(1) $$ on
the domain $\Omega =\{(t,x)\in\R^2 : t\geq 0, a \le x\leq b\}.$ We study the
mixed problem (1) from the point of view of control theory, taking the initial
data $\bar u$ fixed, and regarding the boundary data $\widetilde u_a,
\widetilde u_b$ as control functions that vary in prescribed sets $\U_a, \U_b$,
of $\li$ boundary controls. In particular, we consider the family of
configurations $$ \A(T) \doteq \big\{u(T,\cdot); ~ u {\rm is a sol. to} (1),
\quad \widetilde u_a\in \U_a, \widetilde u_b \in \U_b \big\} $$ that can be
attained by the system at a given time $T>0$, and we give a description of the
attainable set $\A(T)$ in terms of suitable Oleinik-type conditions. We also
establish closure and compactness of the set $\A(T)$ in the $lu$ topology.
