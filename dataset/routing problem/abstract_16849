Inverse nodal problem on Dirac operator is finding the parameters in the
boundary conditions, the number m and the potential function V in the Dirac
equations by using a set of nodal points of a component of two component vector
eigenfunctions as the given spectral data. In this study, we solve a stability
problem using nodal set of vector eigenfunctions and show that space of all V
functions is homeomorphic to the partition set of all space of asymptotically
equivalent nodal sequences induced by an equivalence relation. Furthermore, we
give a reconstruction formula for the potential function as a limit of a
sequence of functions and associated nodal data of one component of vector
eigenfunctions. Our method depends on the explicit asymptotic expressions of
the nodal points and nodal lengths and basically, this method is similar to
<cite>Tsay</cite> and <cite>Cheng</cite> which is given for Sturm-Liouville and
Hill operators, respectively.
