We develop a new approach to the invertibility of the layer potentials on
$L^p$ associated with elliptic equations and systems in Lipschitz domains. As a
consequence, for $n\ge 4$ and $(2(n-1)/(n+1))-\epsilon<p<2$, we obtain the
solvability of the L^p Neumann type boundary value problems for second order
elliptic systems. The analogous results for the biharmonic equation are also
established.
