A problem of linear surface waves discussed by Forbes(1984) initially gave
rise to a singular integrodifferential equation over the real line. We have
been able to transform this integrodifferential equation into a linear second
order differential equation whose solution has been found explicitly in terms
of the sine and cosine integral functions. Furthermore, we have been able to
recover known results of physical interest using more simple techniques.
