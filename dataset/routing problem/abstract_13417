The First Hilbert problem is studied in this paper by applying two
instruments: a new methodology distinguishing between mathematical objects and
mathematical languages used to describe these objects; and a new numeral system
allowing one to express different infinite numbers and to use these numbers for
measuring infinite sets. Several counting systems are taken into consideration.
It is emphasized in the paper that different mathematical languages can
describe mathematical objects (in particular, sets and the number of their
elements) with different accuracies. The traditional and the new approaches are
compared and discussed.
