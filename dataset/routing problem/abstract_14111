In this paper, we are concerned with the global structure of radial positive
solutions of boundary value problem$$\text{div}\big(\phi_{N}(\nabla
v)\big)+\lambda f(|x|, v)=0 \text{in} B(R), v=0 \text{on} \partial B(R),
  $$where $\phi_{N}(y)=\frac{y}{\sqrt{1-|y|^{2}}}, y\in \mathbb{R}^{N}$,
$\lambda$ is a positive parameter, $B(R)=\{x\in \mathbb{R}^{N} :|x|<R\}$, and
$|\cdot|$ denote the Euclidean norm in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$. All results, depending
on the behavior of nonlinear term $f$ near 0, are obtained by using global
bifurcation techniques.
