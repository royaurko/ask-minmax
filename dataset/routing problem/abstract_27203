Resolving in time the dynamics of light absorption by atoms and molecules,
and the electronic rearrangement this induces, is among the most challenging
goals of attosecond spectroscopy. The attoclock is an elegant approach to this
problem, which encodes ionization times in the strong-field regime. However,
the accurate reconstruction of these times from experimental data presents a
formidable theoretical challenge. Here, we solve this problem by combining
analytical theory with ab-initio numerical simulations. We apply our theory to
numerical attoclock experiments on the hydrogen atom to extract ionization time
delays and analyse their nature. Strong field ionization is often viewed as
optical tunnelling through the barrier created by the field and the core
potential. We show that, in the hydrogen atom, optical tunnelling is
instantaneous. By calibrating the attoclock using the hydrogen atom, our method
opens the way to identify possible delays associated with multielectron
dynamics during strong-field ionization.
