Anomalous diffusion has recently turned out to be almost ubiquitous in
transport problems. When the physical properties of the medium where the
transport process takes place are stationary and constant at each spatial
location, anomalous transport has been successfully analyzed within the
Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) model. In this paper, within a Monte Carlo
approach to CTRW, we focus on the particle transport through two regions
characterized by different physical properties, in presence of an external
driving action constituted by an additional advective field, modeled within
both the Galilei invariant and Galilei variant schemes. Particular attention is
paid to the interplay between the distributions of space and time across the
discontinuity. The resident concentration and the flux of the particles are
finally evaluated and it is shown that at the interface between the two regions
the flux is continuous as required by mass conservation, while the
concentration may reveal a neat discontinuity. This result could open the route
to the Monte Carlo investigation of the effectiveness of a physical
discontinuity acting as a filter on particle concentration.
