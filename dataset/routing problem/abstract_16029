The initial value problem of scalar-tensor theories of gravity (STT) is
analyzed in the physical (Jordan) frame using a 3+1 decomposition of spacetime.
A first order strongly hyperbolic system is obtained for which the well
posedness of the Cauchy problem can be established. We provide two simple
applications of the 3+1 system of equations: one for static and spherically
symmetric spacetimes which allows the construction of unstable initial data
(compact objects) for which a further black hole formation and scalar
gravitational wave emission can be analyzed, and another application is for
homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes that permits to study the dynamics of the
Universe in the framework of STT.
