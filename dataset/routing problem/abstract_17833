In this paper we shall consider the problem of deploying attention to subsets
of the video streams for collating the most relevant data and information of
interest related to a given task. We formalize this monitoring problem as a
foraging problem. We propose a probabilistic framework to model observer's
attentive behavior as the behavior of a forager. The forager, moment to moment,
focuses its attention on the most informative stream/camera, detects
interesting objects or activities, or switches to a more profitable stream. The
approach proposed here is suitable to be exploited for multi-stream video
summarization. Meanwhile, it can serve as a preliminary step for more
sophisticated video surveillance, e.g. activity and behavior analysis.
Experimental results achieved on the UCR Videoweb Activities Dataset, a
publicly available dataset, are presented to illustrate the utility of the
proposed technique.
