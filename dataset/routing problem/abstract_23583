Warped extra dimension claims remarkable success: solving the hierarchy
problem; explaining hierarchies in particle phenomenology; yielding standard
cosmology, plus interesting nonstandard scenarios. Yet it has marked
shortcomings: we over-rely on a single toy model, Randall-Sundrum; we treat
matter and gravity in an ad hoc, asymmetric way; and we conceptualize
integrated 4D effective field theory inconsistently. I here construct sounder
4D effective field theories for matter and gravity in warped extra dimension --
whether Randall-Sundrum or higher codimension. I track both Planck and particle
scales through brane formation, beginning with fully extradimensional matter
and gravity, at unified scale, in gravitationally warped backgrounds with bulk
electroweak symmetry-breaking. This validates hierarchy solution, as warp
generically drives 4D effective Planck and particle scales apart. It evades
classic obstacles to warped confinement of matter: colocalizing particles and
assuring effective charge universality. Diverse particles do fail to
colocalize, generically and in discussed models; however, aggregate 4D
effective field theory still holds, since hierarchy solution fixes unresolvably
small extradimensional radius. Electromagnetic charge universality emerges
generically, and weak charge universality in the Randall-Sundrum case.
