We investigate the regularity in $L^p$ ($p>2$) of the gradient of any weak
solution of a Cauchy problem with mixed Neumann-power type boundary conditions.
Under suitable assumptions we prove the existence of weak solutions that
satisfy explicit estimates. Some considerations on the steady-state regularity
are discussed.
