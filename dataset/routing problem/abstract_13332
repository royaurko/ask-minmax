Donald Saari conjectured that the $N$-body motion with constant
configurational measure is a motion with fixed shape. Here, the configurational
measure $\mu$ is a scale invariant product of the moment of inertia $I=\sum_k
m_k |q_k|^2$ and the potential function $U=\sum_{i<j} m_i
m_j/|q_i-q_j|^\alpha$, $\alpha >0$. Namely, $\mu = I^{\alpha/2}U$. We will show
that this conjecture is true for planar equal-mass three-body problem under the
strong force potential $\sum_{i<j} 1/|q_i-q_j|^2$.
