We propose a CP-safe gravity mediation model, where the phases of the Higgs B
parameter, scalar trilinear couplings and gaugino mass parameters are all
aligned. Since all dangerous CP violating phases are suppressed, we are now
safe to consider low-energy SUSY scenarios. As an application, we consider a
gravity mediation model explaining the observed muon $g-2$ anomaly. The CP-safe
property originates in two simple assumptions: SUSY breaking in the K\"ahler
potential and a shift symmetry of a SUSY breaking field $Z$. As a result of the
shift symmetry, the imaginary part of $Z$ behaves as a QCD axion, leading to an
intriguing possibility: the strong CP problem in QCD and the SUSY CP problem
are solved simultaneously.
