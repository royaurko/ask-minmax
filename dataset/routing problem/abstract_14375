In this paper we look at the knot complement problem for L-space
$\mathbb{Z}$-homology spheres. We show that if an L-space $\mathbb{Z}$-homology
sphere $Y$ can be reproduced by a non-trivial surgery on some knot $K\subset
Y$, then the surgery reverses orientation. As a consequence, we prove that
knots in an L-space $\mathbb{Z}$-homology sphere are determined by their
oriented complements. This result is refined for the Poincar\'e sphere. We show
that no non-trivial surgery on $\Sigma(2,3,5)$ can produce $\Sigma(2,3,5)$ or
$-\Sigma(2,3,5)$. In particular knots in the Poincar\'e sphere are determined
by their complements, without consideration of orientation.
