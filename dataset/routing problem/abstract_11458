In this talk we consider the geometrical basis for the reduction of the
relativistic 2-body problem, much like the non-relativistic one, to describing
the motion of an effective particle in an external field. It is shown that this
possibility is deeply related with the Lobachevsky geometry. The concept of
relativistic reduced mass and effective relativistic particle is discussed
using this geometry. Different recent examples for application of relativistic
effective particle are described in short.
