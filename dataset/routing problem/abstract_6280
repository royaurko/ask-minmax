In this paper we study a semilinear elliptic problem on a bounded domain in
$\R^2$ with large exponent in the nonlinear term. We consider positive
solutions obtained by minimizing suitable functionals. We prove some asymtotic
estimates which enable us to associate a "limit problem" to the initial one.
Usong these estimates we prove some quantitative properties of the solution,
namely characterization of level sets and nondegeneracy.
