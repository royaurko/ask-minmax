Given two finite posets P and Q, P is a chain minor of Q if there exists a
partial function f from the elements of Q to the elements of P such that for
every chain in P there is a chain C_Q in Q with the property that f restricted
to C_Q is an isomorphism of chains. We give an algorithm to decide whether a
poset P is a chain minor of o poset Q that runs in time O(|Q| log |Q|) for
every fixed poset P. This solves an open problem from the monograph by Downey
and Fellows [Parameterized Complexity, 1999] who asked whether the problem was
fixed parameter tractable.
