In this paper, we consider the so-called "Furstenberg set problem" in high
dimensions. First, following Wolff's work on the two dimensional real case, we
provide "reasonable" upper bounds for the problem for $\mathbb{R}$ or
$\mathbb{F}_p$. Next we study the "critical" case and improve the "trivial"
exponent by $\Omega (\frac{1}{n^2})$ for $\mathbb{F}_p^n$. Our key tool to
obtain this lower bound is a theorem about how things behave when the
Loomis-Whitney inequality is nearly sharp, as it helps us to reduce the problem
down to dimension two.
