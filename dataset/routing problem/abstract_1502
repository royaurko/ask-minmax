Half-metallic antiferromagnets are the ideal materials for spintronic
applications since their zero magnetization leads to lower stray fields and
thus tiny energy losses. Starting from the Mn$_2$VAl and Mn$_2$VSi alloys we
substitute Co or Fe for Mn and we show by means of first-principle electronic
structure calculations that the resulting compounds are ferrimagnets. When the
total number of valence electrons reaches the magic number of 24 the Fe-doped
compounds are semi-metals and thus non-magnetic while the Co-doped ones show
the desirable half-metallic antiferromagnetic character. The compounds are very
likely to be synthesized experimentally since the parent compounds, Mn$_2$VAl
and Co$_2$VAl, have been already grown in the Heusler $L2_1$ lattice structure.
