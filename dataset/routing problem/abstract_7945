The paper presents theorems on the calculation of the index of a singular
point and at the infinity of monotone type mappings. These theorems cover basic
cases when the principal linear part of a mapping is degenerate. Applications
of these theorems to proving solvability and nontrivial solvability of the
Dirichlet problem for ordinary and partial differential equations are
considered.
