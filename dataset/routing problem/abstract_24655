The minimal SUSY SO(10) GUT models with {\bf 10}, {\bf 126} and {\bf 210}
Higgs and only renormalizable couplings has been shown to provide a simple way
to understand the neutrino mixings as well as the ratio $\Delta
m^2_\odot/\Delta m^2_A$ in terms of quark mixing parameter $\theta_{Cabibbo}$,
provided neutrino masses are described by type II seesaw formula. However, in
this minimal picture, it is impossible to realize type II dominance with
renormalizable couplings in 4-dimensions. We show that this problem can be
cured by embedding this model into a warped 5-dimensional space time with
warping between the Planck and the GUT scale, where both type II as well as
mixed seesaw formulae can be realized in a natural manner without expanding the
Higgs sector. These models also avoid the possible problem of threshold effects
associated with large Higgs representations since the theory above the GUT
scale is now strongly coupled.
