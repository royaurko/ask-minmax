A simple quasiperiodically forced one-dimensional cubic map is shown to
exhibit very many types of routes to chaos via strange nonchaotic attractors
(SNAs) with reference to a two-parameter $(A-f)$ space. The routes include
transitions to chaos via SNAs from both one frequency torus and period doubled
torus. In the former case, we identify the fractalization and type I
intermittency routes. In the latter case, we point out that atleast four
distinct routes through which the truncation of torus doubling bifurcation and
the birth of SNAs take place in this model. In particular, the formation of
SNAs through Heagy-Hammel, fractalization and type--III intermittent mechanisms
are described. In addition, it has been found that in this system there are
some regions in the parameter space where a novel dynamics involving a sudden
expansion of the attractor which tames the growth of period-doubling
bifurcation takes place, giving birth to SNA. The SNAs created through
different mechanisms are characterized by the behaviour of the Lyapunov
exponents and their variance, by the estimation of phase sensitivity exponent
as well as through the distribution of finite-time Lyapunov exponents.
