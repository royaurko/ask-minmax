Simultaneously solving multiple related learning tasks is beneficial under a
variety of circumstances, but the prior knowledge necessary to correctly model
task relationships is rarely available in practice. In this paper, we develop a
novel kernel-based multi-task learning technique that automatically reveals
structural inter-task relationships. Building over the framework of output
kernel learning (OKL), we introduce a method that jointly learns multiple
functions and a low-rank multi-task kernel by solving a non-convex
regularization problem. Optimization is carried out via a block coordinate
descent strategy, where each subproblem is solved using suitable conjugate
gradient (CG) type iterative methods for linear operator equations. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on pharmacological and
collaborative filtering data.
