Six months ago I was asked to write a personal history of my engagement with
the high-Tc problem of the cuprate superconductors, in rather informal and
autobiographical style. As the work proceeded I realized that it was impossible
and would have been dishonest to separate out my rather amusing but seminal
early fumblings from the complete restructuring of the problem which I have
achieved during the past decade. But the result became considerably too long,
by over half, for its intended recipient. The assignment had left me with no
obligation to deal with all the fascinating but irrelevant phenomenology which
I had more or less instinctively ignored on my way, but that feature also fails
to endear the article to any conceivable editorial board containing
knowledgeable experts on the subject. Also, their purpose was for it to serve
as a (quote) introduction to the more technical debates, but its message is
that almost all of these are not relevant. They are not, on the whole, focused
on achieving understanding of the crucial experimental anomalies, many, if not
most, of which are now understood. The key to the problem is a new method of
dealing with the constrained Hilbert space which follows from the necessity of
Gutzwiller projection.
