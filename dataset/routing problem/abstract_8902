The anomalously slow rotation of the solar core is just one from a remarkable
lists of fundamental indications showing that the solar core is somehow coupled
to the surface activity cycle. On the other hand, the atmospheric, LSND and
solar neutrino problems are not consistent, therefore one or more of the
neutrino experiments must be attributed - at least in part - to some phenomena
other than neutrino oscillations, or a fourth neutrino is required. We use the
luminosity constraint in a general case not considered yet, taking into account
nuclear reactions occurring in small hot bubbles indicated to be present in the
solar core (Grandpierre, 2000). The dynamic solar model fit the observed
neutrino fluxes within one-and-half sigma even without oscillations. This fit
is shown to be better than the present day MSW and VAC fits. An attracting
perspective is obtained for a simultaneous solution of the neutrino problems
and the solar core-related astrophysical problems. Predictions of the dynamic
solar model are presented for the SNO measurements.
