Laboratory investigations have shown that a formal theory of fault-tolerance
will be essential to harness nanoscale self-assembly as a medium of
computation. Several researchers have voiced an intuition that self-assembly
phenomena are related to the field of distributed computing. This paper
formalizes some of that intuition. We construct tile assembly systems that are
able to simulate the solution of the wait-free consensus problem in some
distributed systems. (For potential future work, this may allow binding errors
in tile assembly to be analyzed, and managed, with positive results in
distributed computing, as a "blockage" in our tile assembly model is analogous
to a crash failure in a distributed computing model.) We also define a
strengthening of the "traditional" consensus problem, to make explicit an
expectation about consensus algorithms that is often implicit in distributed
computing literature. We show that solution of this strengthened consensus
problem can be simulated by a two-dimensional tile assembly model only for two
processes, whereas a three-dimensional tile assembly model can simulate its
solution in a distributed system with any number of processes.
