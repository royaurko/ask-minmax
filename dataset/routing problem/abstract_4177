We previously obtained a congruence modulo four for the number of real
solutions to many Schubert problems on a square Grassmannian given by
osculating flags. Here, we consider Schubert problems given by more general
isotropic flags, and prove this congruence modulo four for the largest class of
Schubert problems that could be expected to exhibit this congruence.
