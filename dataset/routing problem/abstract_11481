We construct a countable inductive limit of weighted Banach spaces of
holomorphic functions, which is not a topological subspace of the
corresponding weighted inductive limit of spaces of continuous functions. The
main step of our construction, using a special sequence of outer holomorphic
functions, shows that a certain sequence space is isomorphic to a complemented
subspace of a weighted space of holomorphic functions in two complex
variables.
  This example solves in the negative a well-known open problem raised by
Bierstedt, Meise and Summers.
