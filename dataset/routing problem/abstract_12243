Global well-posedness of the initial-boundary value problem for the
stochastic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation in a bounded domain $D$ with a
multiplicative noise is studied. It is shown that under suitable sufficient
conditions, for any initial data $u_0\in L^2(D\times \Omega)$ this problem has
a unique global solution $u$ in the space $L^2(\Omega,C([0,T],L^2({D})))$ for
any $T>0$, and the solution map $u_0\mapsto u$ is Lipschitz continuous.
