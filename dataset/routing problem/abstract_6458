This paper presents algorithms for solving multiobjective integer programming
problems. The algorithm uses Barvinok's rational functions of the polytope that
defines the feasible region and provides as output the entire set of
nondominated solutions for the problem. Theoretical complexity results on the
algorithm are provided in the paper. Specifically, we prove that encoding the
entire set of nondominated solutions of the problem is polynomially doable,
when the dimension of the decision space is fixed. In addition, we provide
polynomial delay algorithms for enumerating this set. An implementation of the
algorithm shows that it is useful for solving multiobjective integer linear
programs.
