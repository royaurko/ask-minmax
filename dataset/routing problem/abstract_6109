Computational difficulties in the general application of Bretthorsts
formalism to time-series problems, posed by the large number of possible models
and the use of models with nonorthogonal base-functions are discussed. The
specific problem under consideration is a Bayesian procedure for model
selection, parameter estimation, and classification, that was applied to the
search for the {\it {In Vivo}} $T_2$ decay rate distributions in brain tissues.
Through the estimation of the meta-parameter $\sigma$ in the process, we also
gain a better understanding of the meaning and estimation of "noise" in the
frame-work of probability theory as logic.
