In a 1977 paper, Diaconis and Graham studied what Knuth calls the total
displacement of a permutation $w$, which is the sum of the distances
$|w(i)-i|$. In recent work of the first contributor and Tenner, this statistic
appears as twice the type $A_{n-1}$ version of a statistic for Coxeter groups
called the depth of $w$. There are various enumerative results for this
statistic in the work of Diaconis and Graham, codified as exercises in Knuth's
textbook, and some other results in the work of Petersen and Tenner. However,
no formula for the generating function of this statistic appears in the
literature. Knuth comments that "the generating function for total displacement
does not appear to have a simple form." In this paper, we translate the problem
of computing the distribution of total displacement into a problem of counting
weighted Motzkin paths. In this way, standard techniques allow us to express
the generating function for total displacement as a continued fraction.
