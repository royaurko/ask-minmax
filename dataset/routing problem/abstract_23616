We study the Cauchy problem for an $p$-Laplacian type of evolution system
${\mathbf H}_{t}+\g [ | \g {\mathbf H}|^{p-2} \g {\mathbf H}|]={\mathbf F}$.
This system governs the evolution of a magnetic field ${\bf H}$, where the
current displacement is neglected and the electrical resistivity is assumed to
be some power of the current density. The existence, uniqueness and regularity
of solutions to the system are established. Furthermore, it is shown that the
limit solution as the power $p\rightarrow \infty$ solves the problem of Bean's
model in the type-II superconductivity theory. The result provides us
information about how the superconductor material under the external force to
become the normal conductor and vice visa. It also provides an effective method
to find numerical solutions to Bean's model.
