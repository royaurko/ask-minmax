We present complexity results regarding a matching-type problem related to
structural controllability of dynamical systems modelled on graphs.
Controllability of a dynamical system is the ability to choose certain inputs
in order to drive the system from any given state to any desired state; a graph
is said to be structurally controllable if it represents the structure of a
controllable system. We define the Orientation Control Matching problem (OCM)
to be the problem of orienting an undirected graph in a manner that maximizes
its structural controllability. A generalized version, the Asymmetric
Orientation Control Matching problem (AOCM), allows for asymmetric weights on
the possible directions of each edge. These problems are closely related to
2-matchings, disjoint path covers, and disjoint cycle covers. We prove using
reductions that OCM is polynomially solvable, while AOCM is much harder; we
show that it is NP-complete as well as APX-hard.
