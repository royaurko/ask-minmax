Our main result is a limit shape theorem for the two-dimensional surface
defined by a uniform random n-by-n square Young tableau. The analysis leads to
a calculus of variations minimization problem that resembles the minimization
problems studied by Logan-Shepp, Vershik-Kerov, and Cohn-Larsen-Propp. Our
solution involves methods from the theory of singular integral equations, and
sheds light on the somewhat mysterious derivations in these works. An extension
to rectangular diagrams, using the same ideas but involving some nontrivial
computations, is also given.
  We give several applications of the main result. First, we show that the
location of a particular entry in the tableau is in the limit governed by a
semicircle distribution.
  Next, we derive a result on the length of the longest increasing subsequence
in segments of a minimal Erdos-Szekeres permutation, namely a permutation of
the numbers 1,2,...,n^2 whose longest monotone subsequence is of length n (and
hence minimal by the Erdos-Szekeres theorem).
  Finally, we prove a limit shape theorem for the surface defined by a random
plane partition of a very large integer over a large square (and more generally
rectangular) diagram.
