We investigate the barriers separating metastable states in the spherical
p-spin glass model using the instanton method. We show that the problem of
finding the barrier heights can be reduced to the causal two-real-replica
dynamics. We find the probability for the system to escape one of the highest
energy metastable states and the energy barrier corresponding to this process.
