In [5] the structure of the bifurcation diagrams of a class of superlinear
indefinite problems with a symmetric weight was ascertained, showing that they
consist of a primary branch and secondary loops bifurcating from it. In [4] it
has been proved that, when the weight is asymmetric, the bifurcation diagrams
are no longer connected since parts of the primary branch and loops of the
symmetric case form an arbitrarily high number of isolas. In this work we give
a deeper insight on this phenomenon, studying how the secondary bifurcations
break as the weight is perturbed from the symmetric situation. Our proofs rely
on the approach of [5,4], i.e. on the construction of certain Poincar\'e maps
and the study of how they vary as some of the parameters of the problems
change, constructing in this way the bifurcation diagrams.
