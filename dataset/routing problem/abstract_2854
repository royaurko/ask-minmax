We investigate continuous parameter dependence for solutions of general
boundary value problems for ordinary linear differential systems. The
generalization of Kiguradze's theorem (1987) on correctness of such problems
was obtained. Also sufficient conditions for the Green matrices of such
problems to converge uniformly to the Green matrix of the limiting problem were
found.
