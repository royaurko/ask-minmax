We develop a new KAM scheme that applies to SL(2,R) cocycles with one
frequency, irrespective of any Diophantine condition on the base dynamics. It
gives a generalization of Dinaburg-Sinai's Theorem to arbitrary frequencies:
under a closeness to constant assumption, the non-Abelian part of the classical
reducibility problem can always be solved for a positive measure set of
parameters.
