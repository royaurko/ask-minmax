We investigate numerically models of the static spherically symmetric
boson-fermion stars in the scalar-tensor theory of gravity with massive dilaton
field. The proper mathematical model of such stars is interpreted as a
nonlinear two-parametric eigenvalue problem with unknown internal boundary. To
solve this problem the Continuous Analogue of Newton Method is used.
