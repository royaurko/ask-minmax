Motivated by questions arising in connection with branched coverings of
connected smooth projective curves over finite fields, we study the proportion
of fixed point free elements (derangements) in cosets of normal subgroups of
primitive permutations groups. Using the Aschbacher-O'Nan-Scott theorem for
primitive groups to partition the problem, we provide complete answers for
affine groups and groups which contain a regular normal nonabelian subgroup.
