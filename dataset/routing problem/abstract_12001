Developing fast and efficient algorithms for retrieval of objects to a given
user query is an area of active research. The present study investigates
retrieval of time series objects from a phoneme database to a given user
pattern or query. The proposed method maps the one-dimensional time series
retrieval into a sequence retrieval problem by partitioning the
multi-dimensional phase-space using k-means clustering. The problem of whole
sequence as well as subsequence matching is considered. Robustness of the
proposed technique is investigated on phoneme time series corrupted with
additive white Gaussian noise. The shortcoming of classical power-spectral
techniques for time series retrieval is also discussed.
