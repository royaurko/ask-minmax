Implementation is a common problem with feedback laws with distributed
delays. This paper focuses on a specific aspect of the implementation problem
for predictor-based feedback laws: the problem of the approximation of the
predictor mapping. It is shown that the numerical approximation of the
predictor mapping by means of a numerical scheme in conjunction with a hybrid
feedback law that uses sampled measurements, can be used for the global
stabilization of all forward complete nonlinear systems that are globally
asymptotically stabilizable and locally exponentially stabilizable in the
delay-free case. Special results are provided for the linear time invariant
case. Explicit formulae are provided for the estimation of the parameters of
the resulting hybrid control scheme.
