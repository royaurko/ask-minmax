We are given a set of jobs, each one specified by its release date, its
deadline and its processing volume (work), and a single (or a set of)
speed-scalable processor(s). We adopt the standard model in speed-scaling in
which if a processor runs at speed s then the energy consumption is s^{\alpha}
per time unit, where \alpha>1. Our goal is to find a schedule respecting the
release dates and the deadlines of the jobs so that the total energy
consumption is minimized. While most previous works have studied the preemptive
case of the problem, where a job may be interrupted and resumed later, we focus
on the non-preemptive case where once a job starts its execution, it has to
continue until its completion without any interruption. We propose improved
approximation algorithms for particular instances of the multiprocessor
non-preemptive speed-scaling problem.
