Memristors have been suggested as a novel route to neuromorphic computing
based on the similarity between neurons (synapses and ion pumps) and
memristors. The D.C. action of the memristor is a current spike, which we think
will be fruitful for building memristor computers. In this paper, we introduce
4 different logical assignations to implement sequential logic in the memristor
and introduce the physical rules, summation, `bounce-back', directionality and
`diminishing returns', elucidated from our investigations. We then demonstrate
how memristor sequential logic works by instantiating a NOT gate, an AND gate
and a Full Adder with a single memristor. The Full Adder makes use of the
memristor's memory to add three binary values together and outputs the value,
the carry digit and even the order they were input in.
