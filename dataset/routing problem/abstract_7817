We study generic holomorphic families of dynamical systems presenting
problems of small divisors with fixed arithmetic. We prove that we have
convergence for all parameter values or divergence everywhere except for an
exceptional set in the potential theory sense. We illustrate this general
principle in different problems of small divisors.
