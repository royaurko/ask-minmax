We study the problem of representation of statistical data (of any origin) by
a complex probability amplitude. This paper is devoted to representation of
data collected from measurements of two trichotomous observables. The
complexity of the problem eventually increased comparing to with the case of
dichotomous observables. We see that only special statistical data (satisfying
s number of nonlinear constraints) have the quantum--like representation.
