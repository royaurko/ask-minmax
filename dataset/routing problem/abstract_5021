We discuss the Dirichlet problem of the quasi-linear elliptic system
\begin{eqnarray*} -e^{-f(U)}div(e^{f(U)}\bigtriangledown
U)+&{1/2}f'(U)|\bigtriangledown U|^2&=0, {in $\Omega$},
  & U|_{\partial\Omega}&=\phi. \end{eqnarray*} Here $\Omega$ a smooth bounded
domain in $R^n$, $f: R^N\to R$ is a smooth function, $U:\Omega\to R^N$ is the
unknown vector-valued function, $\phi:\bar\Omega\to R^N$ is a given
vector-valued $C^2$ function, $f'$ is the gradient of the function $f$ with
respect to the variable $U$. Such problems arise in population dynamics and
Differential Geometry. The difficulty of studying this problem is that this
nonlinear elliptic system does not fit the usual growth condition in
M.Giaquinta's book [G] and the natural working space $H^1\cap
L^{\infty}(\Omega)$ for the corresponding Euler-Lagrange functional does not
fit the usual minimization or variational argument. We use the direct method on
a convex subset of $H^1\cap L^{\infty}(\Omega)$ to overcome these difficulties.
Under a suitable assumption on the function $f$, we prove that there is at
least one solution to this problem. We also give application of our result to
the Dirichlet problem of harmonic maps into the standard sphere
