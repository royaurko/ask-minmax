The heterotic string theory can embeds the crossed SU(5) x SU(5) gauge group.
Here we investigate the string unification in this framework and the concerning
problems. We show generically that only a very constrained parameter space is
allowed for new particles, mostly due to the gauge coupling constant
$\alpha_1^{-1}$. One possible but unfavorable solution is given by the
introduction of three fermion generations of SU(5)_L-adjoint representation.
Only the low-scale decompositions of SU(5)_L with vanishing hypercharge,
$\Sigma_3\sim(1,3)_0$ and $\Sigma_8\sim(8,1)_0$, of fermionic and bosonic types
can be included to circumvent the problem. The triplets must live in TeV region
and could be accessible at colliders. We also show that non-supersymmetric
scenario is exclusively compatible with the introduction of additional
color-SU(2)_L-triplet field while supersymmetry is solely possible at
high-energy scale. All these intermediated thresholds are easily incorporated
into the called Adjoint SU(5) schemes.
