The tropical arithmetic operations on $\mathbb{R}$ are defined by $a\oplus
b=\min\{a,b\}$ and $a\otimes b=a+b$. Let $A$ be a tropical matrix and $k$ a
positive integer, the problem of Tropical Matrix Factorization (TMF) asks
whether there exist tropical matrices $B\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times k}$ and
$C\in\mathbb{R}^{k\times n}$ satisfying $B\otimes C=A$. We show that no
algorithm for TMF is likely to work in polynomial time for every fixed $k$,
thus resolving a problem proposed by Barvinok in 1993.
