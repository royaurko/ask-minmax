We consider nonlinear inverse problems described by operator equations in
Banach spaces. Assuming conditional stability of the inverse problem, that is,
assuming that stability holds on a closed, convex subset of the domain of the
operator, we introduce a novel nonlinear projected steepest descent iteration
and analyze its convergence to an approximate solution given limited accuracy
data. We proceed with developing a multi-level algorithm based on a nested
family of closed, convex subsets on which stability holds and the stability
constants are ordered. Growth of the stability constants is coupled to the
increase in accuracy of approximation between neighboring levels to ensure that
the algorithm can continue from level to level until the iterate satisfies a
desired discrepancy criterion, after a finite number of steps.
