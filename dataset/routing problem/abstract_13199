Mapping workflow applications onto parallel platforms is a challenging
problem, even for simple application patterns such as pipeline graphs. Several
antagonistic criteria should be optimized, such as throughput and latency (or a
combination). Typical applications include digital image processing, where
images are processed in steady-state mode. In this paper, we study the mapping
of a particular image processing application, the JPEG encoding. Mapping
pipelined JPEG encoding onto parallel platforms is useful for instance for
encoding Motion JPEG images. As the bi-criteria mapping problem is NP-complete,
we concentrate on the evaluation and performance of polynomial heuristics.
