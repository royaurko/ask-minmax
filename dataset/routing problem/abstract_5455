We consider logic-based argumentation in which an argument is a pair (Fi,al),
where the support Fi is a minimal consistent set of formulae taken from a given
knowledge base (usually denoted by De) that entails the claim al (a formula).
We study the complexity of three central problems in argumentation: the
existence of a support Fi ss De, the validity of a support and the relevance
problem (given psi is there a support Fi such that psi ss Fi?). When arguments
are given in the full language of propositional logic these problems are
computationally costly tasks, the validity problem is DP-complete, the others
are SigP2-complete. We study these problems in Schaefer's famous framework
where the considered propositional formulae are in generalized conjunctive
normal form. This means that formulae are conjunctions of constraints build
upon a fixed finite set of Boolean relations Ga (the constraint language). We
show that according to the properties of this language Ga, deciding whether
there exists a support for a claim in a given knowledge base is either
polynomial, NP-complete, coNP-complete or SigP2-complete. We present a
dichotomous classification, P or DP-complete, for the verification problem and
a trichotomous classification for the relevance problem into either polynomial,
NP-complete, or SigP2-complete. These last two classifications are obtained by
means of algebraic tools.
