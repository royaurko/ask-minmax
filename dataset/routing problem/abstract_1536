We develop a new, group-theoretic approach to bounding the exponent of matrix
multiplication. There are two components to this approach: (1) identifying
groups G that admit a certain type of embedding of matrix multiplication into
the group algebra C[G], and (2) controlling the dimensions of the irreducible
representations of such groups. We present machinery and examples to support
(1), including a proof that certain families of groups of order n^(2 + o(1))
support n-by-n matrix multiplication, a necessary condition for the approach to
yield exponent 2. Although we cannot yet completely achieve both (1) and (2),
we hope that it may be possible, and we suggest potential routes to that result
using the constructions in this paper.
