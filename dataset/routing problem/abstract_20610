We review chiral symmetry breaking at the BCS level, in the framework of
chiral invariant quark models and in the Schwinger-Dyson formalism. We revisit
the pi mass problem beyond the BCS level. We show a theorem on the masses, on
the widths and on the q qbar content of the scalar mesons sigma and f0.
