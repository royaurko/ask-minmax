We survey the recent investigations on (bounded, sequential) approximate
amenability/contractibility and pseudo-amenability/contractibility for Banach
algebras. We will discuss the core problems concerning these notions and
address the significance of any solutions to them to the development of the
field. A few new results are also included.
