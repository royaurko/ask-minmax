Graph pebbling considers the problem of transforming configurations of
discrete pebbles to certain target configurations on the vertices of a graph,
using the so-called pebbling move. This paper provides counterexamples to a
monotonicity conjecture stated by Hurlbert et al. concerning the pebbling
number compared to the pebbling threshold.
