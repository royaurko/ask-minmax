The identification of performance-optimizing parameter settings is an
important part of the development and application of algorithms. We describe an
automatic framework for this algorithm configuration problem. More formally, we
provide methods for optimizing a target algorithm's performance on a given
class of problem instances by varying a set of ordinal and/or categorical
parameters. We review a family of local-search-based algorithm configuration
procedures and present novel techniques for accelerating them by adaptively
limiting the time spent for evaluating individual configurations. We describe
the results of a comprehensive experimental evaluation of our methods, based on
the configuration of prominent complete and incomplete algorithms for SAT. We
also present what is, to our knowledge, the first published work on
automatically configuring the CPLEX mixed integer programming solver. All the
algorithms we considered had default parameter settings that were manually
identified with considerable effort. Nevertheless, using our automated
algorithm configuration procedures, we achieved substantial and consistent
performance improvements.
