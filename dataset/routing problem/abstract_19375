A data-driven procedure for identifying the dominant transport barriers in a
time-varying flow from limited quantities of Lagrangian data is presented. Our
approach partitions state space into pairs of coherent sets, which are sets of
initial conditions chosen to minimize the number of trajectories that "leak"
from one set to the other under the influence of a stochastic flow field during
a pre-specified interval in time. In practice, this partition is computed by
posing an optimization problem, which once solved, yields a pair of functions
whose signs determine set membership. From prior experience with synthetic,
"data rich" test problems and conceptually related methods based on
approximations of the Perron-Frobenius operator, we observe that the functions
of interest typically appear to be smooth. As a result, given a fixed amount of
data our approach, which can use sets of globally supported basis functions,
has the potential to more accurately approximate the desired functions than
other functions tailored to use compactly supported indicator functions. This
difference enables our approach to produce effective approximations of pairs of
coherent sets in problems with relatively limited quantities of Lagrangian
data, which is usually the case with real geophysical data. We apply this
method to three examples of increasing complexity: the first is the double
gyre, the second is the Bickley Jet, and the third is data from numerically
simulated drifters in the Sulu Sea.
