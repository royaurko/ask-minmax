Big data dictate their requirements to the hardware and software. Simple
migration to the cloud data processing, while solving the problem of increasing
computational capabilities, however creates some issues: the need to ensure the
safety, the need to control the quality during data transmission, the need to
optimize requests. Computational cloud does not simply provide scalable
resources but also requires network infrastructure, unknown routes and the
number of user requests. In addition, during functioning situation can occur,
in which you need to change the architecture of the application - part of the
data needs to be placed in a private cloud, part in a public cloud, part stays
on the client.
