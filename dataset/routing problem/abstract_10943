We address the problem of multispecies anyons, i.e. particles of different
species whose wave function is subject to anyonlike conditions. The cluster and
virial coefficients are considered. Special attention is paid to the case of
anyons in the lowest Landau level of a strong magnetic field, when it is
possible (i) to prove microscopically the equation of state,
 in particular in terms of Aharonov-Bohm charge-flux composite systems, and
(ii) to formulate the problem in terms of single-state statistical
distributions.
