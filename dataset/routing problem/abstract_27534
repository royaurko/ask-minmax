We solve for the first time the classical linear Cauchy--Poisson problem for
the time evolution an initial surface disturbance when a uniform shear current
is present beneath the surface. The solution is general, including the effects
of gravity, surface tension and constant finite depth. The particular case of
an initially Gaussian disturbance of width $b$ is studied for different values
of three system parameters: a "shear Froude number" $S\sqrt{b/g}$ ($S$ is the
uniform vorticity), the Bond number and the depth relative to the initial
perturbation width. Different phase and group velocity in different directions
yield very different wave patterns in different parameter regimes when the
shear is strong, and the well known pattern of diverging ring waves in the
absence of shear can take on very different qualitative behaviours. For a given
shear Froude number, both finite depth and nonzero capillary effects are found
to weaken the influence of the shear on the resulting wave pattern. The various
patterns are analysed and explained in light of the shear-modified dispersion
relation.
