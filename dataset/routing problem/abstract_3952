Geometric methods proposed by Stallings for treating finitely generated
subgroups of free groups were successfully used to solve a wide collection of
decision problems for free groups and their subgroups.
  In the present paper we employ the generalized Stallings' methods, developed
by the contributor, to solve various algorithmic problems concerning finitely
generated subgroups of amalgams of finite groups.
