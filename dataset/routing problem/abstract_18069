The alternating direction method with multipliers (ADMM) has been one of most
powerful and successful methods for solving various composite problems. The
convergence of the conventional ADMM (i.e., 2-block) for convex objective
functions has been justified for a long time, and its convergence for nonconvex
objective functions has, however, been established very recently. The
multi-block ADMM, a natural extension of ADMM, is a widely used scheme and has
also been found very useful in solving various nonconvex optimization problems.
It is thus expected to establish convergence theory of the multi-block ADMM
under nonconvex frameworks. In this paper we present a Bregman modification of
3-block ADMM and establish its convergence for a large family of nonconvex
functions. We further extend the convergence results to the $N$-block case ($N
\geq 3$), which underlines the feasibility of multi-block ADMM applications in
nonconvex settings. Finally, we present a simulation study and a real-world
application to support the correctness of the obtained theoretical assertions.
