We address two fundamental and well-known problems of Gromov and Lyndon:
 \demo{Problem A} (Gromov, see [5]). Consider a category $M_n$ of closed
manifolds of dimension $n$ with nonzero-degree ways as morphisms. Study a
partial order $M \ge N \Leftrightarrow Mor (M, N) \neq \phi$. For which $N$ the
degrees of maps $f: M \to N$ are bounded for all $M$?
 \demo{Problem B} (Lyndon, [12], problem 13). Extend and relate the theories of
deficiency, the rate of growth and the Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic. In
particular, what influence does the deficiency have on the structure of an
infinite group?
