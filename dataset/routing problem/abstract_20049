We reconsider the well-known issue of string corrections to Supergravity
theory. Our treatment is carried out to second order in the string slope
parameter. We establish a procedure for solving the Bianchi identities in the
non minimal case, and we solve a long standing problem in the perturbative
expansion of D=10, N=1 string corrected Supergravity, obtaining the H sector
tensors, torsions and curvatures.
