Results of the most sophisticated measurements in coincidence of the angular
resolved K-shell photo- and Auger-electrons, and of two atomic ions produced by
dissociation of N2 molecule, are analyzed. Detection of photoelectrons at
certain angles allows separating the Auger decay processes of the 1{\sigma}g
and 1{\sigma}u core hole states. The Auger electron angular distributions for
each of these hole states are measured as a function of the kinetic energy
release of two atomic ions and are compared with the corresponding theoretical
angular distributions. From that comparison one can disentangle the
contributions of different repulsive doubly charged molecular ion states to the
Auger decay. Different kinetic energy release values are directly related to
the different internuclear distances. In this way one can trace experimentally
the behavior of the potential energy curves of dicationic final states inside
the Frank-Condon region. Presentation of the Auger electron angular
distributions as a function of kinetic energy release of two atomic ions opens
a new dimension in the study of Auger decay.
