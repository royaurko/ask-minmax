We consider the obstacle problem with irregular barriers for semilinear
elliptic equation involving measure data and operator corresponding to a
general quasi-regular Dirichlet form. We prove existence and uniqueness of a
solution as well as its representation as an envelope of a supersolution to
some related partial differential equation. We also prove regularity results
for the solution and the Lewy-Stampacchia inequality.
