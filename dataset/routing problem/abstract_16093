The paper investigates the properties of certain biorthogonal polynomials
appearing in a specific simultaneous Hermite-Pade' approximation scheme.
Associated to any totally positive kernel and a pair of positive measures on
the positive axis we define biorthogonal polynomials and prove that their
zeroes are simple and positive. We then specialize the kernel to the Cauchy
kernel 1/{x+y} and show that the ensuing biorthogonal polynomials solve a
four-term recurrence relation, have relevant Christoffel-Darboux generalized
formulae, and their zeroes are interlaced. In addition, these polynomial solve
a combination of Hermite-Pade' approximation problems to a Nikishin system of
order 2. The motivation arises from two distant areas; on one side, in the
study of the inverse spectral problem for the peakon solution of the
Degasperis-Procesi equation; on the other side, from a random matrix model
involving two positive definite random Hermitian matrices. Finally, we show how
to characterize these polynomials in term of a Riemann-Hilbert problem.
