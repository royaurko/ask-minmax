The Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) pioneering numerical experiment played a major
role in the history of computer simulation because it introduced this concept
for the first time. Moreover, it raised a puzzling question which was answered
more than 10 years later. After an introduction to this problem, we briefly
review its history and then suggest some simple numerical experiments, with a
provided Matlab code, to study various aspects of the ``FPU'' problem.
