The classical Kramers problem with specular -- diffuse boundary conditions of
the kinetic theory is considered. On an example of Kramers problem the new
method of the decision of the boundary problems of the kinetic theory is
stated. The method allows to receive the decision with any degree of accuracy.
At the basis of a method lays the idea of representation of a boundary
condition on distribution function in the form of a source in the kinetic
equation. By means of integrals Furier the kinetic equation with a source is
reduced to the integral equation of Fredholm type of the second kind. The
decision is received in the form of Neumann's series.
