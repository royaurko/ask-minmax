We study a class of scalar, linear, non-local Riemann-Hilbert problems (RHP)
involving finite subgroups of PSL(2,C). We associate to such problems a (maybe
infinite) root system and describe the relevance of the orbits of the Weyl
group in the construction of its solutions. As an application, we study in
detail the large N expansion of SU(N) or SO(N) or Sp(2N) Chern-Simons partition
function Z_N(M) of 3-manifolds M that are either rational homology spheres or
more generally Seifert fibered spaces. It has a matrix model-like
representation, whose spectral curve can be characterized in terms of a RHP as
above. When pi_1(M) is finite (i.e. for manifolds M that are quotients of
\mathbb{S}_{3} by a finite isometry group of type ADE), the Weyl group
associated to the RHP is finite and the spectral curve is algebraic and can be
in principle computed. We then show that the large $N$ expansion of Z_N(M) is
computed by the topological recursion. This has consequences for the
analyticity properties of SU/SO/Sp perturbative invariants of knots along
fibers in $M$.
