he Singular Manifold Method is presented as an excellent tool to study a 2+1
dimensional equation in despite of the fact that the same method presents
several problems when applied to 1+1 reductions of the same equation.
Nevertheless these problems are solved when the number of dimensions of the
equation is increased.
