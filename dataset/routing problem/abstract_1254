We propose a vortex-like metamaterial device that is capable of transferring
image along a spiral route without losing subwavelength information of the
image. The super-resolution image can be guided and magnified at the same time
with one single design. Our design may provide insights in manipulating
super-resolution image in a more flexible manner. Examples are given and
illustrated with numerical simulations.
