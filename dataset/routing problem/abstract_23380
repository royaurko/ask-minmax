Radiation emitted by unpolarized high-energy electrons penetrating crystals
may be linearly polarized. This occurs when the particle velocity makes an
angle, with respect to some major crystal axis, being sufficiently larger than
the axial-channelling angle. For such orientation, a complete description of
spectral and polarization characteristics of the radiation is derived. At
planar channelling, a non-perturbative contribution to the probability of the
process appears caused by the plane field, and we must solve exactly a
one~-~dimensional mechanical problem. For that, the approximate form of the
actual plane potential is suggested which provides a precise fit for any
crystal plane and an analytical solution to the motion problem. In a practical
case, we must consider electron-photon showers developing in sufficiently thick
crystals. For the first time, this development is described taking into account
the polarization of photons. We discuss qualitative features of the phenomenon,
present results of numerical calculations for thin and thick crystals, and
evaluate the possibility of the use of differently oriented crystals in a
polarized hard photon source.
