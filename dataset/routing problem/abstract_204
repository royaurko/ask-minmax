Reactive routing protocols are gaining popularity due to their event driven
nature day by day. In this vary paper, reactive routing is studied precisely.
Route request, route reply and route maintenance phases are modeled with
respect to control overhead. Control overhead varies with respect to change in
various parameters. Our model calculates these variations as well. Besides
modeling, we chose three most favored reactive routing protocols as Ad-Hoc on
Demand Distance Vector (AODV), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Dynamic MANET
on Demand (DYMO) for our experiments. We simulated these protocols using ns-2
for a detailed comparison and performance analysis with respect to mobility and
scalability issues keeping metrics of throughput, route delay and control over
head. Their performances and comparisons are extensively presented in last part
of our work.
