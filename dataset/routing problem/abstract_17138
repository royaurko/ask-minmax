The regularization of a new problem, namely the three-body problem, using
'similar' coordinate system is proposed. For this purpose we use the relation
of 'similarity', which has been introduced as an equivalence relation in a
previous paper (see \cite{rom11}). First we write the Hamiltonian function, the
equations of motion in canonical form, and then using a generating function, we
obtain the transformed equations of motion. After the coordinates
transformations, we introduce the fictitious time, to regularize the equations
of motion. Explicit formulas are given for the regularization in the coordinate
systems centered in the more massive and the less massive star of the binary
system. The 'similar' polar angle's definition is introduced, in order to
analyze the regularization's geometrical transformation. The effect of
Levi-Civita's transformation is described in a geometrical manner. Using the
resulted regularized equations, we analyze and compare these canonical
equations numerically, for the Earth-Moon binary system.
