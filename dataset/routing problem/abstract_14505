In this paper we give a unified approach in categorical setting to the
problem of finding the Galois closure of a finite cover, which includes as
special cases the familiar finite separable field extensions, finite unramified
covers of a connected undirected graph, finite covering spaces of a locally
connected topological space, and finite \'etale covers of a smooth projective
irreducible algebraic variety. We present two algorithms whose outputs are
shown to be desired Galois closures. An upper bound of the degree of the Galois
closure under each algorithm is also obtained.
