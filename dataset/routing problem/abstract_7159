The induction motor behaviour is represented by a fifth order differential
equation model. Addition of a torque correction factor to the model accurately
reproduces the transient torques and instantaneous real and reactive power
flows of the full seventh order differential equation model. The variational
iteration homotopy perturbation method (VIHPM) is employed to solve the seventh
order boundary value problems. The approximate solutions of the problems are
obtained in terms of a rapidly convergent series. Several numerical examples
are given to illustrate the implementation and efficiency of the method.
