We provide a mathematical analysis and a numerical framework for Lorentz
force electrical conductivity imaging. Ultrasonic vibration of a tissue in the
presence of a static magnetic field induces an electrical current by the
Lorentz force. This current can be detected by electrodes placed around the
tissue; it is proportional to the velocity of the ultrasonic pulse, but depends
nonlinearly on the conductivity distribution. The imaging problem is to
reconstruct the conductivity distribution from measurements of the induced
current. To solve this nonlinear inverse problem, we first make use of a
virtual potential to relate explicitly the current measurements to the
conductivity distribution and the velocity of the ultrasonic pulse. Then, by
applying a Wiener filter to the measured data, we reduce the problem to imaging
the conductivity from an internal electric current density. We first introduce
an optimal control method for solving such a problem. A new direct
reconstruction scheme involving a partial differential equation is then
proposed based on viscosity-type regularization to a transport equation
satisfied by the current density field. We prove that solving such an equation
yields the true conductivity distribution as the regularization parameter
approaches zero. We also test both schemes numerically in the presence of
measurement noise, quantify their stability and resolution, and compare their
performance.
