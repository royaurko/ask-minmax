We study the Rayleigh-Taylor problem for two incompressible, immiscible,
viscous magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows, with zero resistivity, surface tension
(or without surface tenstion) and special initial magnetic field, evolving with
a free interface in the presence of a uniform gravitational field. First, we
reformulate in Lagrangian coordinates MHD equations in a infinite slab as one
for the Navier-Stokes equations with a force term induced by the fluid flow
map. Then we analyze the linearized problem around the steady state which
describes a denser immiscible fluid lying above a light one with an free
interface separating the two fluids, and both fluids being in (unstable)
equilibrium. By a general method of studying a family of modified variational
problems, we construct smooth (when restricted to each fluid domain) solutions
to the linearized problem that grow exponentially fast in time in Sobolev
spaces, thus leading to an global instability result for the linearized
problem. Finally, using these pathological solutions, we demonstrate the global
instability for the corresponding nonlinear problem in an appropriate sense. In
addition, we compute that the so-called critical number indeed is equal
$\sqrt{g[\varrho]/2}$.
