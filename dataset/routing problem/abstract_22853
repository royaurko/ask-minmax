We consider the problem of equilibration of a single oscillator system with
dynamics given by the generalized Langevin equation. It is well-known that this
dynamics can be obtained if one considers a model where the single oscillator
is coupled to an infinite bath of harmonic oscillators which are initially in
equilibrium. Using this equivalence we first determine the conditions necessary
for equilibration for the case when the system potential is harmonic. We then
give an example with a particular bath where we show that, even for parameter
values where the harmonic case always equilibrates, with any finite amount of
nonlinearity the system does not equilibrate for arbitrary initial conditions.
We understand this as a consequence of the formation of nonlinear localized
excitations similar to the discrete breather modes in nonlinear lattices.
