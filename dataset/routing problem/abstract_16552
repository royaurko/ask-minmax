Given a directed acyclic graph with labeled vertices, we consider the problem
of finding the most common label sequences ("traces") among all paths in the
graph (of some maximum length m). Since the number of paths can be huge, we
propose novel algorithms whose time complexity depends only on the size of the
graph, and on the frequency epsilon of the most frequent traces. In addition,
we apply techniques from streaming algorithms to achieve space usage that
depends only on epsilon, and not on the number of distinct traces. The abstract
problem considered models a variety of tasks concerning finding frequent
patterns in event sequences. Our motivation comes from working with a data set
of 2 million RFID readings from baggage trolleys at Copenhagen Airport. The
question of finding frequent passenger movement patterns is mapped to the above
problem. We report on experimental findings for this data set.
