We consider multidimensional optimization problems, which are formulated and
solved in terms of tropical mathematics. The problems are to minimize
(maximize) a linear or nonlinear function defined on vectors of a
finite-dimensional semimodule over an idempotent semifield, and may have
constraints in the form of linear equations and inequalities. The aim of the
paper is twofold: first to give a broad overview of known tropical optimization
problems and solution methods, including recent results; and second, to derive
a direct, complete solution to a new constrained optimization problem as an
illustration of the algebraic approach recently proposed to solve tropical
optimization problems with nonlinear objective function.
