We consider the problem of the period measurement in the case of the
following scenarios: stationary source of successive light signals and
accelerating receiver, stationary receiver and accelerating source of
successive light signals and stationary machine gun that fires successive
bullets received by an accelerating receiver. The accelerated motion is the
hyperbolic one.
