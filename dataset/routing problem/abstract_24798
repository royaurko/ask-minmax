Recursive matrix relations for kinematics and dynamics of the Orthoglide
parallel robot having three concurrent prismatic actuators are established in
this paper. These are arranged according to the Cartesian coordinate system
with fixed orientation, which means that the actuating directions are normal to
each other. Three identical legs connecting to the moving platform are located
on three planes being perpendicular to each other too. Knowing the position and
the translation motion of the platform, we develop the inverse kinematics
problem and determine the position, velocity and acceleration of each element
of the robot. Further, the principle of virtual work is used in the inverse
dynamic problem. Some matrix equations offer iterative expressions and graphs
for the input forces and the powers of the three actuators.
