We apply $hp$-cloud method to the radial Dirac eigenvalue problem. The
difficulty of occurrence of spurious eigenvalues among the genuine ones in the
computation is resolved. The method of treatment is based on assuming
$hp$-cloud Petrov-Galerkin scheme to construct the weak formulation of the
problem which adds a consistent diffusivity to the variational formulation. The
size of the artificially added diffusion term is controlled by a stability
parameter ($\tau$). The derivation of $\tau$ assumes the limit behavior of the
eigenvalues at infinity. The parameter $\tau$ is applicable for generic basis
functions. This is combined with the choice of appropriate intrinsic
enrichments in the construction of the cloud shape functions.
