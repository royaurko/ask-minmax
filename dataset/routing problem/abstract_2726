Processing data received as a stream is a task commonly performed by modern
embedded devices, in a wide range of applications such as multimedia
(encoding/decoding/ playing media), networking (switching and routing), digital
security, scientific data processing, etc. Such processing normally tends to be
calculation intensive and therefore requiring significant processing power.
Therefore, hardware acceleration methods to increase the performance of such
applications constitute an important area of study. In this paper, we present
an evaluation of one such method to process streaming data, namely
multi-processor pipeline architecture. The hardware is based on a
Multiple-Processor System on Chip (MPSoC), using a data encryption algorithm as
a case study. The algorithm is partitioned on a coarse grained level and mapped
on to an MPSoC with five processor cores in a pipeline, using specifically
configured Xtensa LX3 cores. The system is then selectively optimized by
strengthening and pruning the resources of each processor core. The optimized
system is evaluated and compared against an optimal single-processor System on
Chip (SoC) for the same application. The multiple-processor pipeline system for
data encryption algorithms used was observed to provide significant speed ups,
up to 4.45 times that of the single-processor system, which is close to the
ideal speed up from a five-stage pipeline.
