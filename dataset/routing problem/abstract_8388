By using the degree theory and the $\tau-$topology of Kryszewski and Szulkin,
we establish a version of the Fountain Theorem for strongly indefinite
functionals. The abstract result will be applied for studying the existence of
infinitely many solutions of two strongly indefinite semilinear problems
including the semilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation.
