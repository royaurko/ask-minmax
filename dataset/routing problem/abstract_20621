In this note we show that the system of equations t_{x}+t_{y}=t_{p},\quad
t_{y}+t_{z}=t_{q},\quad t_{x}+t_{z}=t_{r}, where $t_{x}=x(x+1)/2$ is a
triangular number, has infinitely many solutions in integers. Moreover we show
that this system has rational three-parametric solution. Using this result we
show that the system t_{x}+t_{y}=t_{p},\quad t_{y}+t_{z}=t_{q},\quad
t_{x}+t_{z}=t_{r},\quad t_{x}+t_{y}+t_{z}=t_{s} has infinitely many rational
two-parametric solutions.
