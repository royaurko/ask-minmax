We prove that any countable support iteration formed with
posets with $\omega_2$-p.i.c.\  has $\omega_2$-c.c., assuming
CH in the ground model and assuming also that $\omega_1$
is not collapsed.  This improves earlier results of Shelah
by removing the restriction on the length of the iteration.
Thus, we solve the problem of obtaining a large
continuum via such forcing iterations.
