The problem of classifying modules over a tame algebra A reduces to a block
matrix problem of tame type whose indecomposable canonical matrices are zero-
or one-parameter. Respectively, the set of nonisomorphic indecomposable modules
of dimension at most d divides into a finite number f(d,A) of modules and
one-parameter series of modules.
  We prove that the number of m-by-n canonical parametric block matrices with a
given partition into blocks is bounded by 4^s, where s is the number of free
entries (which is at most mn), and estimate the number f(d,A).
