Identifying co-varying causal elements in very high dimensional feature space
with internal structures, e.g., a space with as many as millions of linearly
ordered features, as one typically encounters in problems such as whole genome
association (WGA) mapping, remains an open problem in statistical learning. We
propose a block-regularized regression model for sparse variable selection in a
high-dimensional space where the covariates are linearly ordered, and are
possibly subject to local statistical linkages (e.g., block structures) due to
spacial or temporal proximity of the features. Our goal is to identify a small
subset of relevant covariates that are not merely from random positions in the
ordering, but grouped as contiguous blocks from large number of ordered
covariates. Following a typical linear regression framework between the
features and the response, our proposed model employs a sparsity-enforcing
Laplacian prior for the regression coefficients, augmented by a 1st-order
Markovian process along the feature sequence that "activates" the regression
coefficients in a coupled fashion. We describe a sampling-based learning
algorithm and demonstrate the performance of our method on simulated and
biological data for marker identification under WGA.
