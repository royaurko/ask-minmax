The fragmentation functions of quarks and gluons into photons are studied
beyond the Leading Logarithm approximation. We address the nature of the
initial conditions of the evolution equation solutions and study problems
related to factorization scheme invariance. The possibility of measuring these
distributions in LEP experiments is discussed, and a comparison with existing
data is made.
