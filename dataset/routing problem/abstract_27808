This paper considers the problem of estimating the covariance of the relative
displacement measurement output by the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm.
The problem is relevant for localization of mobile robots (using a sensor of
the Kinect type) or for autonomous vehicles (using a sensor of the Velodyne
type) where the relative displacement measurement must be fused with other
sensors' measurements, such as wheel encoders or inertial sensors, in a Kalman
or a particle filter. The closed-form formulas proposed in previous literature
generally build upon the fact that the solution to ICP is obtained by
minimizing a function of the data. In this paper, we prove this approach is on
shaky ground because the rematching step of the ICP is not explicitly accounted
for, and a blind application to point-to-point ICP leads to completely
erroneous covariances. Yet we justify that the method is applicable to
point-to-plane ICP as already known to practitioners, by proposing a geometric
mathematical proof bounding the errors made.
