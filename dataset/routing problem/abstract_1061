Based upon a widely-accepted internal-barrier-layer-capacitance (IBLC) model,
the dielectric loss in the giant-dielectric-constant CaCu$_{3}$Ti$_{4}$O$_{12}$
(CCTO) material is expected to decrease as the conductivity of the CCTO
grains/subgrains increases. In this letter, we report that this idea was
successfully realized through the La-for-Ca substitution in the CCTO ceramics.
The impedance spectroscopy analysis gives the evidence.
