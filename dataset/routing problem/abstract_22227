We study existence and uniqueness of solution for stochastic differential
equations with distributional drift by giving a meaning to the Stroock-Varadhan
martingale problem associated such equations. The approach we exploit is the
one of paracontrolled distributions introduced in [13]. As a result we make
sense of the three dimensional polymer measure with white noise potential.
