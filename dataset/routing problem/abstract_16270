Given a direct sum G of cyclic groups, we find a sharp bound for the minimal
number of proper subgroups whose union is G. This generalizes to sums of cyclic
modules over more general rings, and we are able to solve this covering problem
for all local, Artinian, or Dedekind rings (and even for monoids).
  This and related questions have been the subject of much past study, but only
for finite groups. Our methods differ from those found in the literature, and
make it possible to work in the general setting of "Chinese rings", which
generalize the Chinese Remainder Theorem (and include the above cases).
  We also address a related problem: given a finite set M that is a direct sum
of cyclic R-modules, and a distinguished element m in M, what is the smallest
number of cosets of proper R-submodules whose union is M \ {m} ? When R is the
ring of integers, this question is related to various conjectures in the
literature.
