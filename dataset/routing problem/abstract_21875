With a view to study problems of smoothability, we construct a minimal free
resolution for the coordinate ring of an algebroid monomial curve associated to
an $AS$ numerical semigroup (i.e. generated by an arithmetic sequence),
obtained independently of the result of \cite{gss2} and equipped with the
explicit description of all the involved maps.
