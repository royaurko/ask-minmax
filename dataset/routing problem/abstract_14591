The problem of noise-induced escape from a metastable state arises in
physics, chemistry, biology, systems engineering, and other areas. The problem
is well understood when the underlying dynamics of the system obey detailed
balance. When this assumption fails many of the results of classical
transition-rate theory no longer apply, and no general method exists for
computing the weak-noise asymptotics of fundamental quantities such as the mean
escape time. In this paper we present a general technique for analysing the
weak-noise limit of a wide range of stochastically perturbed continuous-time
nonlinear dynamical systems. We simplify the original problem, which involves
solving a partial differential equation, into one in which only ordinary
differential equations need be solved. This allows us to resolve some old
issues for the case when detailed balance holds. When it does not hold, we show
how the formula for the mean escape time asymptotics depends on the dynamics of
the system along the most probable escape path. We also present new results on
short-time behavior and discuss the possibility of focusing along the escape
path.
