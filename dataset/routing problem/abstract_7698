We show that the problem of directed percolation on an arbitrary lattice is
equivalent to the problem of m directed random walkers with rather general
attractive interactions, when suitably continued to m=0. In 1+1 dimensions,
this is dual to a model of interacting steps on a vicinal surface. A similar
correspondence with interacting self-avoiding walks is constructed for
isotropic percolation.
