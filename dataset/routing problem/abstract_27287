Symmetric and antisymmetric terms have been obtained in the framework of the
variational approach for two-dimensional (2D) Coulomb systems of symmetric
trions XXY. Stability diagrams and certain anomalies arising in the 2D space
are explained qualitatively in the framework of the Born--Oppenheimer adiabatic
approximation. The asymptotics of energy terms at large distances obtained for
an arbitrary space dimensionality are analyzed, and some approximation formulas
for 2D terms are proposed. An anomalous dependence of multipole moments on the
space dimensionality has been found in the case of a spherically symmetric
field. The main results obtained for the 2D and 3D problems of two Coulomb
centers are compared.
