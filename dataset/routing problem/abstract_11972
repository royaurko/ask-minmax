In this paper we consider a one-dimensional diffusion equation on the
interval $[0,1]$ satisfying non-Feller boundary conditions. As a consequence,
the initial value Cauchy problem fails to preserve nonnegativity or
boundedness. Nonetheless, probability theory plays an interesting role in our
analysis and understanding of solutions to this equation.
