The covariogram $g_{K}$ of a convex body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the
function which associates to each $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ the volume of the
intersection of $K$ with $K+x$. Determining $K$ from the knowledge of $g_K$ is
known as the covariogram problem. It is equivalent to determining the
characteristic function $1_K$ of $K$ from the modulus of its Fourier-Laplace
transform $\widehat{1_K}$, a particular instance of the phase retrieval
problem.
  We prove that when $K$ is sufficiently smooth and in any dimension $n$, $K$
is determined by $g_K$ in the class of sufficiently smooth bodies. We also
prove the corresponding result for the problem of determining two planar convex
bodies $H$ and $K$ from the knowledge of the area of the intersection of $H$
with the translates of $K$ (i.e. from the cross covariogram). The proofs use in
an essential way a study of the asymptotic behavior at infinity of the zero set
of the Fourier-Laplace transform $\widehat{1_K}$ in $\mathbb{C}^n$ done by T.
Kobayashi.
  We also discuss the relevance for the covariogram problem of known
determination results for the phase retrieval problem and the difficulty of
finding explicit geometric conditions on $K$ which grant that the entire
function $\widehat{1_K}$ cannot be factored as the product of non-trivial
entire functions. This shows a connection between the covariogram problem and
the Pompeiu problem.
