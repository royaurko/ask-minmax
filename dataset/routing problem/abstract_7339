We consider the problem of clustering functional data while jointly selecting
the most relevant features for classification. This problem has never been
tackled before in the functional data context, and it requires a proper
definition of the concept of sparsity for functional data. Functional sparse
clustering is here analytically defined as a variational problem with a hard
thresholding constraint ensuring the sparsity of the solution. First, a unique
solution to sparse clustering with hard thresholding in finite dimensions is
proved to exist. Then, the infinite dimensional generalization is given and
proved to have a unique solution. Both the multivariate and the functional
version of sparse clustering with hard thresholding exhibits improvements on
other standard and sparse clustering strategies on simulated data. A real
functional data application is also shown.
