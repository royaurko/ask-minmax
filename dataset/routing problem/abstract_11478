String theory builds on the great legacy of Yukawa and Tomonaga: New degrees
of freedom and control of the UV are two important themes. This talk will give
an overview of some of the progress and some of the unsolved problems that
characterize string theory today. It is divided into two parts: (1) Connecting
String Theory to the Real World; (2) Gauge Theory/String Theory Duality. Two
other major subjects, which I will omit, are Black Holes in String Theory and
The Impact of String Theory on Mathematics.
