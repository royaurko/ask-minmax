The prime detecting function (PDF) approach can be effective instrument in
the investigation of numbers. The PDF is constructed by recurrence sequence -
each successive prime adds a sieving factor in the form of PDF. With built-in
prime sieving features and properties such as simplicity,
integro-differentiability and configurable capability for a wide variety of
problems, the application of PDF leads to new interesting results. As an
example, in this exposition we present proofs of the infinitude of twin primes
and the first Hardy-Littlewood conjecture for prime pairs (the twin prime
number theorem). On this example one can see that application of PDF is
especially effective in investigation of asymptotic problems in combination
with the proposed method of test and probe functions.
