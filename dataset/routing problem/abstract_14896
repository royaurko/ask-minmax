This paper studies the kernelization complexity of graph coloring problems
with respect to certain structural parameterizations of the input instances. We
are interested in how well polynomial-time data reduction can provably shrink
instances of coloring problems, in terms of the chosen parameter. It is well
known that deciding 3-colorability is already NP-complete, hence parameterizing
by the requested number of colors is not fruitful. Instead, we pick up on a
research thread initiated by Cai (DAM, 2003) who studied coloring problems
parameterized by the modification distance of the input graph to a graph class
on which coloring is polynomial-time solvable; for example parameterizing by
the number k of vertex-deletions needed to make the graph chordal. We obtain
various upper and lower bounds for kernels of such parameterizations of
q-Coloring, complementing Cai's study of the time complexity with respect to
these parameters.
  Our results show that the existence of polynomial kernels for q-Coloring
parameterized by the vertex-deletion distance to a graph class F is strongly
related to the existence of a function f(q) which bounds the number of vertices
which are needed to preserve the NO-answer to an instance of q-List-Coloring on
F.
