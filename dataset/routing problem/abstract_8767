This paper is a continuation of Part I where the general setup was developed.
Here we discuss the general equivalence problem for geometric structures and
provide criteria for the equivalence, local and global, of transitive
structures. Cartan's Flag Systems illustrate the theory as a major example and,
finally, some attention though little is given to non-transitive structures
with regular orbits i.e., intransitivity classes.
