The problem of early thermalization of matter produced in relativistic
heavy-ion collisions at RHIC is discussed in the framework of a hybrid model
that consists of the transverse-hydrodynamics stage followed by the standard
perfect-fluid hydrodynamics stage and freeze-out. The two hydrodynamic regimes
are connected with the help of Landau matching conditions. A satisfactory
description of the soft hadronic observables is achieved. This indicates that
the early-thermalization problem and also the HBT puzzle may be to large extent
circumvented.
