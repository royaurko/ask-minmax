It is argued that QCD might solve the strong CP problem on its own. To test
this idea, a lattice simulation suggests itself. In view of the difficulty of
such a calculation we have, as a first step, investigated the problem in the
$CP^3$ model. The $CP^3$ model is in many respects similar to QCD. In this talk
I shall present some first results of our calculation. Among other things it is
shown that the model has a first order deconfining phase transition in $\theta$
and that the critical value of $\theta$ decreases towards zero as $\beta$ is
taken to infinity. This suggests that $\theta$ is tuned to zero in the
continuum limit.
