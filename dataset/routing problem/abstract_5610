Although whether P equals NP is an important, open problem in computer
science, and although Jaeger's 2008 paper, "Solving the P/NP Problem Under
Intrinsic Uncertainty" (arXiv:0811.0463) presents an attempt at tackling the
problem by discussing the possibility that all computation is uncertain to some
degree, there are a number of logical oversights present in that paper which
preclude it from serious consideration toward having resolved P-versus-NP.
There are several differences between the model of computation presented in
Jaeger's paper and the standard model, as well as several bold assumptions that
are not well supported in Jaeger's paper or in the literature. In addition, we
find several omissions of rigorous proof that ultimately weaken this paper to a
point where it cannot be considered a candidate solution to the P-versus-NP
problem.
