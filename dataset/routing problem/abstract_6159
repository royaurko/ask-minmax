Popular myths that cheaper memory, high-speed links and high-speed processors
will solve the problem of congestion in computer networks are shown to be
false. A simple definition for congestion based on supply and demand of
resources is proposed and is then used to classify various congestion schemes.
The issues that make the congestion problem a difficult one are discussed, and
then the architectural decisions that affect the design of a congestion scheme
are presented. It is argued that long-, medium- and short-term congestion
problems require different solutions. Some of the recent schemes are brifly
surveyed, and areas for further research are discussed.
