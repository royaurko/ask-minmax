I describe the current status of the solar neutrino problem, summarizing the
arguments that its resolution will require new particle physics. The phenomenon
of matter-enhanced neutrino oscillations is reviewed. I consider the
implications of current experiments -- including the SuperKamiokande
atmospheric and LSND measurements -- and the need for additional constraints
from SNO and other new detectors.
