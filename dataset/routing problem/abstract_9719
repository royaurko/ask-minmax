Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is a very popular access control model, for
long time investigated and widely deployed in the security architecture of
different enterprises. To implement RBAC, roles have to be firstly identified
within the considered organization. Usually the process of (automatically)
defining the roles in a bottom up way, starting from the permissions assigned
to each user, is called {\it role mining}. In literature, the role mining
problem has been formally analyzed and several techniques have been proposed in
order to obtain a set of valid roles.
  Recently, the problem of defining different kind of constraints on the number
and the size of the roles included in the resulting role set has been
addressed. In this paper we provide a formal definition of the role mining
problem under the cardinality constraint, i.e. restricting the maximum number
of permissions that can be included in a role. We discuss formally the
computational complexity of the problem and propose a novel heuristic.
Furthermore we present experimental results obtained after the application of
the proposed heuristic on both real and synthetic datasets, and compare the
resulting performance to previous proposals
