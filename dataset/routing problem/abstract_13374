We investigate the Pompeiu property for subsets of the real line, under no
assumption of connectedness. In particular we focus our study on finite unions
of bounded (disjoint) intervals, and we emphasize the different results
corresponding to the cases where the function in question is supposed to have
constant integral on all isometric images, or just on all the
translation-images of the domain. While no set of the previous kind enjoys the
Pompeiu property in the latter sense, we provide a necessary and sufficient
condition in order a union of two intervals to have the Pompeiu property in the
former sense, and we produce some examples to give an insight of the complexity
of the problem for three-interval sets.
