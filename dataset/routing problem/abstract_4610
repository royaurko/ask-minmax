In this paper, we consider an initial boundary value problem for Maxwell's
equations. For this hyperbolic type problem, we derive guaranteed and
computable upper bounds for the difference between the exact solution and any
pair of vector fields in the space-time cylinder that belongs to the
corresponding admissible energy class. For this purpose, we use a method
suggested earlier for the wave equation.
