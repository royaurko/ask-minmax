This paper describes a new exact algorithm for the Equitable Coloring
Problem, a coloring problem where the sizes of two arbitrary color classes
differ in at most one unit. Based on the well known DSatur algorithm for the
classic Coloring Problem, a new pruning criterion arising from equity
constraints is proposed and analyzed. The good performance of the algorithm is
shown through computational experiments over random and benchmark instances.
