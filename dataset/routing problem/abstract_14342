This note is mainly to point out, if needed, that uncertainty about models
and their parameters has little to do with a `paradox'. The proposed `solution'
is to formulate practical questions instead of seeking refuge into abstract
principles. (And, in order to be concrete, some details on how to calculate the
probability density functions of the chord lengths are provided, together with
some comments on simulations and an appendix on the inferential aspects of the
problem.)
