This paper introduces an effective memetic algorithm for the linear ordering
problem with cumulative costs. The proposed algorithm combines an order-based
recombination operator with an improved forward-backward local search procedure
and employs a solution quality based replacement criterion for pool updating.
Extensive experiments on 118 well-known benchmark instances show that the
proposed algorithm achieves competitive results by identifying 46 new upper
bounds. Furthermore, some critical ingredients of our algorithm are analyzed to
understand the source of its performance.
