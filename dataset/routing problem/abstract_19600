For an ordered array of critical volatile wetting droplets the formation of a
super lattice by an Ostwald-ripening like competition process is considered.
The underlying diffusion problem is treated within a quasistatic approximation
and to first order in the inverse droplets distance. The approach is rather
general but a square lattice and a triangular lattice are studied explicitly.
Dispersion relations for the super-lattice growth of these arrays are
calculated.
