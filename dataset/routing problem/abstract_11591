Let $k$ be a number field, and let $S$ be a finite set of maximal ideals of
the ring of integers of $k$. In his 1962 ICM address, Shafarevich asked if
there are only finitely many $k$-isomorphism classes of algebraic curves of a
fixed genus $g\ge 1$ with good reduction outside $S$. He verified this for
$g=1$ by reducing the problem to Siegel's theorem. Parshin extended this
argument to all hyperelliptic curves (cf. also the work of Oort). The general
case was settled by Faltings' celebrated work. In this note we give a short
proof of Shafarevich's conjecture for hyperelliptic curves, by reducing the
problem to the case $g=1$ using the Theorem of de Franchis plus standard facts
about discriminants of hyperelliptic equations.
