In this paper we classify up to affine equivalence all local tube
realizations of real hyperquadrics in C^n. We show that this problem can be
reduced to the classification, up to isomorphism, of commutative nilpotent real
and complex algebras. We also develop some structure theory for commutative
nilpotent algebras over arbitrary fields of characteristic zero.
