A very fundamental geometric problem on finite systems of spheres was
independently phrased by Kneser (1955) and Poulsen (1954). According to their
well-known conjecture if a finite set of balls in Euclidean space is
repositioned so that the distance between the centers of every pair of balls is
decreased, then the volume of the union (resp., intersection) of the balls is
decreased (resp., increased). In the first half of this paper we survey the
state of the art of the Kneser-Poulsen conjecture in Euclidean, spherical as
well as hyperbolic spaces with the emphases being on the Euclidean case. Based
on that it seems very natural and important to study the geometry of
intersections of finitely many congruent balls from the viewpoint of discrete
geometry in Euclidean space. We call these sets ball-polyhedra. In the second
half of this paper we survey a selection of fundamental results known on
ball-polyhedra. Besides the obvious survey character of this paper we want to
emphasize our definite intention to raise quite a number of open problems to
motivate further research.
