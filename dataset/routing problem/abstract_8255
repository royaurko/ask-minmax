This note examines a problem in enumerative and asymptotic combinatorics
involving the classical structure of integer compositions. What is sought is an
analysis on average and in distribution of the length of the longest run of
consecutive equal parts in a composition of size n. The problem was recently
posed by Herbert Wilf (see arXiv: 0906.5196).
