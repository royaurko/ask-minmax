The usual path integral formulation for scalar particles at finite density
involves a sign problem, making numerical simulation impractical. We present
alternative methods free of this difficulty. We apply these approaches to phi^4
theory in 2+1 dimensions, presenting preliminary numerical results for physical
quantities in the vicinity of the phase transition in the T-mu plane.
