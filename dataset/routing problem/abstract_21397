The Legendre type relation for the counting function of ordinary twin primes
is reworked in terms of the inverse of the Riemann zeta function. Its analysis
sheds light on the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function in
the critical strip and their links to primes and the twin prime problem.
