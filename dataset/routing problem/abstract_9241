We consider a mixed boundary-value problem for the Poisson equation in a
plane thick junction $\Omega_{\varepsilon}$ which is the union of a domain
$\Omega_0$ and a large number of $\varepsilon$-periodically situated thin rods.
The nonuniform Signorini conditions are given on the vertical sides of the thin
rods. The asymptotic analysis of this problem is made as $\varepsilon \to 0$,
i.e., when the number of the thin rods infinitely increases and their thickness
tends to zero. With the help of the integral identity method we prove the
convergence theorem and show that the nonuniform Signorini conditions are
transformed (as $\varepsilon \to 0$) in the limiting variational inequalities
in the region that is filled up by the thin rods in the limit passage. The
existence and uniqueness of the solution to this non-standard limit problem is
established. The convergence of the energy integrals is proved as well.
