Past research on probabilistic databases has studied the problem of answering
queries on a static database. Application scenarios of probabilistic databases
however often involve the conditioning of a database using additional
information in the form of new evidence. The conditioning problem is thus to
transform a probabilistic database of priors into a posterior probabilistic
database which is materialized for subsequent query processing or further
refinement. It turns out that the conditioning problem is closely related to
the problem of computing exact tuple confidence values.
  It is known that exact confidence computation is an NP-hard problem. This has
led researchers to consider approximation techniques for confidence
computation. However, neither conditioning nor exact confidence computation can
be solved using such techniques.
  In this paper we present efficient techniques for both problems. We study
several problem decomposition methods and heuristics that are based on the most
successful search techniques from constraint satisfaction, such as the
Davis-Putnam algorithm. We complement this with a thorough experimental
evaluation of the algorithms proposed. Our experiments show that our exact
algorithms scale well to realistic database sizes and can in some scenarios
compete with the most efficient previous approximation algorithms.
