We study the inverse problem of recovering Sturm-Liouville operators on the
half-line with a Bessel-type singularity inside the interval from the given
Weyl function. The corresponding uniqueness theorem is proved, a constructive
procedure for the solution of the inverse problem is provided, also necessary
and sufficient conditions for the solvability of the inverse problem are
obtained.
