Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are widely used in different domains of
applications, such as maritime navigation, museums visits and route planning,
as well as ecological, demographical and economical applications. Nowadays,
organizations need sophisticated and adapted GIS-based Decision Support System
(DSS) to get quick access to relevant information and to analyze data with
respect to geographic information, represented not only as spatial objects, but
also as maps.
  Several research works on GIS personalization was proposed: Face the great
challenge of developing both the theory and practice to provide personalization
GIS visualization systems. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of
literature on presented GIS personalization approaches. A benchmarking study of
GIS personalization methods is proposed. Several evaluation criteria are used
to identify the existence of trends as well as potential needs for further
investigations.
