We discuss several coin-weighing problems in which coins are known to be of
three different weights and only a balance scale can be used. We start with the
task of sorting coins when the pans of the scale can fit only one coin. We
prove that the optimal number of weighings for $n$ coins is $\lceil 3n/2\rceil
-2$. When the pans have an unlimited capacity, we can sort the coins in $n+1$
weighings. We also discuss variations of this problem, when there is exactly
one coin of the middle weight.
