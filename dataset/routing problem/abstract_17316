Although everything in computing industry moves faster including the
processor, memory speed, memory size, storage space etc. there is no
improvement in virus scanning time. Although the processing speed has
substantially increased, a typical full scanning is still taking several hours
for an average computer. There is a serious need to improve the scanning time.
  Contradiction is a stage of problem solving where the nature of the actual
problem is clearly explained in terms of at least two parameters, one improving
and another worsening. While emphasizing one parameter strengthens the system
position emphasizing another parameter weakens the system.
  In conventional methods a problem solver has to make a perfect balance
between these conflicting parameters, where the situation is neither too much
on one side nor too much on the other. The results of those methods, although
increase the speed of virus scanning, results in disadvantages like load on
processor, increase in false positives and compromise on security. The
objective of TRIZ is not to accept a tradeoff between the speed of scanning and
those other difficulties but to resolve the contradictions so that the speed of
scanning increases without compromising with security and other harmful
results.
