A decade ago, a beautiful paper by Wagner developed a ``toolkit'' that in
certain cases allows one to prove problems hard for parallel access to NP.
However, the problems his toolkit applies to most directly are not overly
natural. During the past year, problems that previously were known only to be
NP-hard or coNP-hard have been shown to be hard even for the class of sets
solvable via parallel access to NP. Many of these problems are longstanding and
extremely natural, such as the Minimum Equivalent Expression problem (which was
the original motivation for creating the polynomial hierarchy), the problem of
determining the winner in the election system introduced by Lewis Carroll in
1876, and the problem of determining on which inputs heuristic algorithms
perform well. In the present article, we survey this recent progress in raising
lower bounds.
