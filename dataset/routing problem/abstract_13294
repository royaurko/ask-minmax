Here we shall introduce the concept of harmonic balls/spheres in sub-domains
of $\R^n$, through a mean value property for a sub-class of harmonic functions
on such domains. In the complex plane, and for analytic functions, a similar
concept fails to exist due to the fact that analytic functions can not have
prescribed data on the boundary. Nevertheless, a two-phase version of the
problem does exists, and gives rise to the generalization of the well-known
Schwarz function to the case of two-phase Schwarz function.
  Our primary goal is to derive simple properties for these problems, and tease
the appetites of experts working on Schwarz function and related topics.
Hopefully these two concepts will provoke further study of the topic.
