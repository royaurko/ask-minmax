By the methods of the synthetic geometry we investigate properties of objects
generated from a complete quadrangle and a line, which lies in its plane. We
start with a problem from the book of Sharygin "Problems in Plane Geometry". We
generalize this problem with the help of Pappus, Desargues and Pascal's
Theorems and we discover new concurrent lines, collinear points, and conic
sections.
