This paper revisits the H\"{o}lder regularity of mild solutions of parabolic
stochastic Cauchy problems in Lebesgue spaces $L^p(\mathcal{O}),$ with $p\geq
2$ and $\mathcal{O}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ a bounded domain. We find conditions on
$p, \beta$ and $\gamma$ under which the mild solution has almost surely
trajectories in
$\mathcal{C}^\beta([0,T];\mathcal{C}^\gamma(\bar{\mathcal{O}})).$ These
conditions do not depend on the Cameron-Martin Hilbert space associated with
the driving cylindrical noise. The main tool of this study is a regularity
result for stochastic convolutions in M-type 2 Banach spaces by Z. Brze\'zniak
(Stoch. Stoch. Rep. Vol. 61, Iss. 3-4, 1997).
