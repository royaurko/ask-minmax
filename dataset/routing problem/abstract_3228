The two-dimensional layout optimization problem reinforced by the efficient
space utilization demand has a wide spectrum of practical applications.
Formulating the problem as a nonlinear minimization problem under planar
equality and/or inequality density constraints, we present a linear time
multigrid algorithm for solving correction to this problem. The method is
demonstrated on various graph drawing (visualization) instances.
