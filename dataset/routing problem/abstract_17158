Henri Poincar\'e formulated the mathematics of the Lorentz transformations,
known as the Poincar\'e group. He also formulated the Poincar\'e sphere for
polarization optics. It is shown that these two mathematical instruments can be
combined into one mathematical device which can address the internal space-time
symmetries of elementary particles, decoherence problems in polarization
optics, entropy problems, and Feynman's rest of the universe.
