The formation of stable dimers on top of terraces during epitaxial growth is
investigated in detail. In this paper we focus on mean-field theory, the
standard approach to study nucleation. Such theory is shown to be unsuitable
for the present problem, because it is equivalent to considering adatoms as
independent diffusing particles. This leads to an overestimate of the correct
nucleation rate by a factor N, which has a direct physical meaning: in average,
a visited lattice site is visited N times by a diffusing adatom. The dependence
of N on the size of the terrace and on the strength of step-edge barriers is
derived from well known results for random walks. The spatial distribution of
nucleation events is shown to be different from the mean-field prediction, for
the same physical reason. In the following paper we develop an exact treatment
of the problem.
