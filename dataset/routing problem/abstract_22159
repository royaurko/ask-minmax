We study the isoperimetric problem in product spaces equipped with the
uniform distance. Our main result is a characterization of isoperimetric
inequalities which, when satisfied on a space, are still valid for the product
spaces, up a to a constant which does not depend on the number of factors. Such
dimension free bounds have applications to the study of influences of
variables.
