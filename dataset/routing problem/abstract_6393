In this Comment on the above mentioned paper by F. E. Harris, A. M. Frolov,
and V. H. Smith, we briefly review our contributions to development of new
methods for solution of the Coulomb four-body problem. We show that our
research group, headed by Prof. T. K. Rebane, had a priority in using the fully
correlated exponential basis for variational calculations of four-body systems.
We also draw attention to the fact that our group subsequently implemented a
more advanced method, which uses highly efficient exponential-trigonometric
basis functions for solution of the same problem.
