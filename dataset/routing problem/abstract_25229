We study the problem of the emergence of cooperation in the spatial
Prisoner's Dilemma. The pioneering work by Nowak and May showed that large
initial populations of cooperators can survive and sustain cooperation in a
square lattice with imitate-the-best evolutionary dynamics. We revisit this
problem in a cost-benefit formulation suitable for a number of biological
applications. We show that if a fixed-amount reward is established for
cooperators to share, a single cooperator can invade a population of defectors
and form structures that are resilient to re-invasion even if the reward
mechanism is turned off. We discuss analytically the case of the invasion by a
single cooperator and present agent-based simulations for small initial
fractions of cooperators. Large cooperation levels, in the sustainability
range, are found. In the conclusions we discuss possible applications of this
model as well as its connections with other mechanisms proposed to promote the
emergence of cooperation.
