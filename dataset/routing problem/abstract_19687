This is a survey of four recent papers which deal with the relationship of
simple C*-algebras to the problem of computing the spectra of self-adjoint
operators in the general case, especially when the spectrum is not discrete. It
is an expanded version of a talk presented at the 50 year C*-algebra
celebration, held at the annual meeting of the AMS in San Antonio during
January, 1993.
