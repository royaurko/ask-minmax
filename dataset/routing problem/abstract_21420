In this paper we present some results on the variety of divisible
MV-algebras. Any free divisible MV-algebra is an algebra of continuous
piecewise linear functions with rational coefficients. Correspondingly,
Rational {\L}ukasiewicz logic is defined and its tautology problem is shown to
be co-NP-complete.
