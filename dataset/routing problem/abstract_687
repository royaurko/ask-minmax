A stochastic queueing network model with parameter-dependent service times
and routing mechanism, and its related performance measures are considered. An
estimate of performance measure gradient is proposed, and rather general
sufficient conditions for the estimate to be unbiased are given. A gradient
estimation algorithm is also presented, and its validity is briefly discussed.
