This paper investigates a variant of the Hamiltonian Cycle (HC) problem,
named the Parity Hamiltonian Cycle (PHC) problem: The problem is to find a
closed walk visiting each vertex odd number of times, instead of exactly once.
We show that the PHC problem is in P even when a closed walk is allowed to use
an edge at most z=4 times, by considering a T-join, which is a generalization
of matching. On the other hand, the PHC problem is NP-complete when z=3. In the
case of z=3 however, the problem is in P when an input graph is four-edge
connected, but it still remains NP-complete even when it is two-edge connected.
Thus, we are concerned with the hard case in detail, and give a simple
necessary and sufficient condition that a two-edge connected C>=5-free (or
P6-free) graph has a PHC. Note that the HC problem is known to be NP-complete
for those graph classes. This subject is motivated by a new approach to
connecting a hard problem HC and an easy problem T-join, by relaxing a
constraint of HC.
