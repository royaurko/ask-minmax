We analyse the 3-extremal holomorphic maps from the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$ to
the symmetrised bidisc $ \mathcal{G}$, defined to be the set $ \{(z+w,zw):
z,w\in\mathbb{D}\}$, with a view to the complex geometry and function theory of
$\mathcal{G}$. These are the maps whose restriction to any triple of distinct
points in $\mathbb{D}$ yields interpolation data that are only just solvable.
We find a large class of such maps; they are rational of degree at most 4. It
is shown that there are two qualitatively different classes of rational
$\mathcal{G}$-inner functions of degree at most 4, to be called {\em aligned}
and {\em caddywhompus} functions; the distinction relates to the cyclic
ordering of certain associated points on the unit circle. The aligned ones are
3-extremal.
  We describe a method for the construction of aligned rational
$\mathcal{G}$-inner functions; with the aid of this method we reduce the
solution of a 3-point interpolation problem for aligned holomorphic maps from
$\mathbb{D}$ to $\mathcal{G}$ to a collection of classical Nevanlinna-Pick
problems with mixed interior and boundary interpolation nodes. Proofs depend on
a form of duality for $\mathcal{G}$.
