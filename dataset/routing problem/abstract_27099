The task of allocating preventative resources to a computer network in order
to protect against the spread of viruses is addressed. Virus spreading dynamics
are described by a linearized SIS model and protection is framed by an
optimization problem which maximizes the rate at which a virus in the network
is contained given finite resources. One approach to problems of this type
involve greedy heuristics which allocate all resources to the nodes with large
centrality measures. We address the worst case performance of such greedy
algorithms be constructing networks for which these greedy allocations are
arbitrarily inefficient. An example application is presented in which such a
worst case network might arise naturally and our results are verified
numerically by leveraging recent results which allow the exact optimal solution
to be computed via geometric programming.
