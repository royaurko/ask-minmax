In the wide area master-slave PLC (powerline communication) system, the
source node cannot reach the destination node without packet relay. Due to the
time-variable attenuation in the powerline, the communication distance cannot
be defined. Two kind of dynamic repeater algorithms are developed, dynamic
source routing and flooding based routing. In this paper, we use analytic
approach to compare the performance of those two routing protocols. We give
formulas to calculate the average duration of a polling cycle for each
protocols. Then we present simulation results to bolster the results of our
analysis. We use three metrics, which are bandwidth consumed for routing
signaling, normalized routing load and average duration of a polling cycle to
evaluate those routing protocols.
