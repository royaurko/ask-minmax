We consider the linearized elasticity system in a multidomain of the three
dimensional space. This multidomain is the union of a horizontal plate, with
fixed cross section and small thickness "h", and of a vertical beam with fixed
height and small cross section of radius "r". The lateral boundary of the plate
and the top of the beam are assumed to be clamped. When "h" and "r" tend to
zero simultaneously, with "r" much greater than the square of "h", we identify
the limit problem. This limit problem involves six junction conditions.
