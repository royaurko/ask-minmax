In this paper, we provide a lower bound for an area of the convex hull of
points and a rectangle in a plane. We then apply this estimate to establish a
lower bound for a universal cover problem. We showed that a convex universal
cover for a unit length curve has area at least 0.232239. In addition, we show
that a convex universal cover for a unit closed curve has area at least
0.0879873.
