Two major challenges of numeric analytic continuation---restoring the
spectral density, $s(\omega)$, from the corresponding Matsubara correlator,
$g(\tau)$---are (i) producing the most smooth/featureless answer for
$s(\omega)$ without compromising the error bars on $g(\tau)$ and (ii)
quantifying possible deviations of the produced result from the actual answer.
We introduce the method of consistent constraints that solves both problems.
