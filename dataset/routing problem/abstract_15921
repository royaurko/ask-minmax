We establish universality of local eigenvalue correlations in unitary random
matrix ensembles (1/Z_n) |\det M|^{2\alpha} e^{-n\tr V(M)} dM near the origin
of the spectrum. If V is even, and if the recurrence coefficients of the
orthogonal polynomials associated with |x|^{2\alpha} e^{-nV(x)} have a regular
limiting behavior, then it is known from work of Akemann et al., and Kanzieper
and Freilikher that the local eigenvalue correlations have universal behavior
described in terms of Bessel functions. We extend this to a much wider class of
confining potentials V. Our approach is based on the steepest descent method of
Deift and Zhou for the asymptotic analysis of Riemann-Hilbert problems. This
method was used by Deift et al. to establish universality in the bulk of the
spectrum. A main part of the present work is devoted to the analysis of a local
Riemann-Hilbert problem near the origin.
