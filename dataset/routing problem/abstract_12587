We interpret magnetic billiards as Finsler ones and describe an analog of the
string construction for magnetic billiards. Finsler billiards for which the law
"angle of incidence equals angle of reflection" are described. We characterize
the Finsler metrics in the plane whose geodesics are circles of a fixed radius.
This is a magnetic analog of Hilbert's fourth problem asking to describe the
Finsler metrics whose geodesics are straight lines.
