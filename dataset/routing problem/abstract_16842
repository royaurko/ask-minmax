In a recent series of papers, the class of energy-conserving Runge-Kutta
methods named Hamiltonian BVMs (HBVMs) has been defined and studied. Such
methods have been further generalized for the efficient solution of general
conservative problems, thus providing the class of Line Integral Methods
(LIMs). In this paper we derive a further extension, which we name Enhanced
Line Integral Methods (ELIMs), more tailored for Hamiltonian problems, allowing
for the conservation of multiple invariants of the continuous dynamical system.
The analysis of the methods is fully carried out and some numerical tests are
reported, in order to confirm the theoretical achievements.
