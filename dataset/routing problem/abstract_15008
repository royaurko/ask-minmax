A weighted automaton is functional if any two accepting runs on the same
finite word have the same value. In this paper, we investigate functional
weighted automata for four different measures: the sum, the mean, the
discounted sum of weights along edges and the ratio between rewards and costs.
On the positive side, we show that functionality is decidable for the four
measures. Furthermore, the existential and universal threshold problems, the
language inclusion problem and the equivalence problem are all decidable when
the weighted automata are functional. On the negative side, we also study the
quantitative extension of the realizability problem and show that it is
undecidable for sum, mean and ratio. We finally show how to decide whether the
language associated with a given functional automaton can be defined with a
deterministic one, for sum, mean and discounted sum. The results on
functionality and determinizability are expressed for the more general class of
functional group automata. This allows one to formulate within the same
framework new results related to discounted sum automata and known results on
sum and mean automata. Ratio automata do not fit within this general scheme and
different techniques are required to decide functionality.
