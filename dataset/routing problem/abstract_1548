We examined the effects of inhomogeneity on the dynamics and structural
properties using Boolean networks. Two different power-law rank outdegree
distributions were embedded to determine the role of hubs. The degree of
randomness and coherence of the binary sequence in the networks were measured
by entropy and mutual information, depending on the number of outdegrees and
types of Boolean functions for the hub. With a large number of outdegrees, the
path length from the hub reduces as well as the effects of Boolean function on
the hub are more prominent. These results indicate that the hubs play important
roles in networks' dynamics and structural properties. By comparing the effect
of the skewness of the two different power-law rank distributions, we found
that networks with more uniform distribution exhibit shorter average path
length and higher event probability of coherence but lower degree of coherence.
Networks with more skewed rank distribution have complementary properties.
These results indicate that highly connected hubs provide an effective route
for propagating their signals to the entire network.
