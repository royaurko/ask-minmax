This thesis examines three problems of the quark model, split between two
general areas. The general areas are: 1) models of meson decay ($^3P_0$ and
flux-tube breaking), 2) final state interactions (FSI's).
  The three specific problems are: 1) identification of the $f_4(2220)$ state,
2) determination of the mixing angle between the $K_1(1270)$ and $K_1(1400)$
mesons, 3) examination of FSI's in the reaction $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow \pi
\pi$ near threshold.
  A more complete abstract is included in the thesis.
