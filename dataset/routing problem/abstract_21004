In this paper we consider the existence of complete intersection points of
type $(a,b,c)$, on the generic degree $d$ surface of $\PP^3$. For any choice of
$a, b, c$ we resolve the existence question asymptotically, i.e. for all $d \gg
0$. For small values of $a, b, c$ we resolve the existence problem completely.
