We present a master equation approach to the \emph{narrow escape time} (NET)
problem, i.e. the time needed for a particle contained in a confining domain
with a single narrow opening, to exit the domain for the first time. We
introduce a finite transition probability, $\nu$, at the narrow escape window
allowing the study of the imperfect trapping case. Ranging from 0 to $\infty$,
$\nu$ allowed the study of both extremes of the trapping process: that of a
highly deficient capture, and situations where escape is certain ("perfect
trapping" case). We have obtained analytic results for the basic quantity
studied in the NET problem, the \emph{mean escape time} (MET), and we have
studied its dependence in terms of the transition (desorption) probability over
(from) the surface boundary, the confining domain dimensions, and the finite
transition probability at the escape window. Particularly we show that the
existence of a global minimum in the NET depends on the `imperfection' of the
trapping process. In addition to our analytical approach, we have implemented
Monte Carlo simulations, finding excellent agreement between the theoretical
results and simulations.
