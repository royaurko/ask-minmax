We consider a minimization problem that combines the Dirichlet energy with
the nonlocal perimeter of a level set, namely $$ \int_\Om |\nabla
u(x)|^2\,dx+\Per\Big(\{u > 0\},\Om \Big),$$ with $\sigma\in(0,1)$. We obtain
regularity results for the minimizers and for their free boundaries $\p
\{u>0\}$ using blow-up analysis. We will also give related results about
density estimates, monotonicity formulas, Euler-Lagrange equations and
extension problems.
