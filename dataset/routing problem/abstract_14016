For one-dimensional linear kinetic equations analytical solutions of problems
about moderately strong evaporation (condensation), when frequency of
collisions of molecules is constant, are received . The equation and
distribution function are linearize concerning the absolute Maxwellian, given
far from a wall. Quantities of of temperature and concentration jumps are
found. Distributions of concentration, mass velocity and temperature are
constructed.
