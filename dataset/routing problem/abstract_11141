This article proposes the first known algorithm that achieves a
constant-factor approximation of the minimum length tour for a Dubins' vehicle
through $n$ points on the plane. By Dubins' vehicle, we mean a vehicle
constrained to move at constant speed along paths with bounded curvature
without reversing direction. For this version of the classic Traveling
Salesperson Problem, our algorithm closes the gap between previously
established lower and upper bounds; the achievable performance is of order
$n^{2/3}$.
