T. Riviere proved an energy quantization for Yang-Mills fields defined on
n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, when $n$ is larger than the critical
dimension 4. More precisely, he proved that the defect measure of a weakly
converging sequence of Yang-Mills fields is quantized, provided the $W^{2,1}$
norm of their curvature is uniformly bounded. In the present paper, we prove a
similar quantization phenomenon for the Yamabe problem in a bounded domain
$\Omega$ of $R^n$.
