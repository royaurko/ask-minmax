A successor to the standard hot big-bang cosmology is emerging. It greatly
extends the highly successful hot big-bang model. A key element of the New
Standard Cosmology is dark energy, the causative agent for accelerated
expansion. Dark energy is just possibly the most important problem in all of
physics. The only laboratory up to the task of studying dark energy is the
Universe itself.
