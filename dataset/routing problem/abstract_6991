Scientists from the OPERA experiment have measured neutrinos supposedly
travelling at a velocity faster than light contrary to the theory of
relativity. Even when the measurements are precise, the interpretation of this
problem is being misunderstood. Here it is very easily solved and explained
within the theory of relativity itself proving that neutrinos are not
travelling faster than the speed of light and the early time arrival is due to
the the presence of a gravitational field.
