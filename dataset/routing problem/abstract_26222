We discuss the recently developed bosonic dynamical mean-field (B-DMFT)
framework, which maps a bosonic lattice model onto the selfconsistent solution
of a bosonic impurity model with coupling to a reservoir of normal and
condensed bosons. The effective impurity action is derived in several ways: (i)
as an approximation to the kinetic energy functional of the lattice problem,
(ii) using a cavity approach, and (iii) by using an effective medium approach
based on adding a one-loop correction to the selfconsistently defined
condensate. To solve the impurity problem, we use a continuous-time Monte Carlo
algorithm based on a sampling of a perturbation expansion in the hybridization
functions and the condensate wave function. As applications of the formalism we
present finite temperature B-DMFT phase diagrams for the bosonic Hubbard model
on a 3d cubic and 2d square lattice, the condensate order parameter as a
function of chemical potential, critical exponents for the condensate, the
approach to the weakly interacting Bose gas regime for weak repulsions, and the
kinetic energy as a function of temperature.
