This work is devoted to the study of a nonlocal-in-time evolutional problem
for the first order differential equation in Banach space. Our primary
approach, although stems from the convenient technique based on the reduction
of a nonlocal problem to its classical initial value analogue, uses more
advanced analysis. That is a validation of the correctness in definition of the
general solution representation via the Dunford-Cauchy formula. Such approach
allows us to reduce the given existence problem to the problem of locating
zeros of a certain entire function. It results in the necessary and sufficient
conditions for the existence of a generalized (mild) solution to the given
nonlocal problem. Aside of that we also present new sufficient conditions which
in the majority of cases generalize existing results.
