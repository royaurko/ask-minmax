Gr\"obner bases, in their noncommutative version, and word reversing are
methods for solving the word problem of a presented monoid, and both rely on
iteratively completing the initial list of relations. Simple examples may
suggest to conjecture that both completion procedures are closely related. Here
we disprove this conjecture by exhibiting families of presentations for which
they radically differ.
