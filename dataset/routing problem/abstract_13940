We consider the existence problem for a semi-cyclic holey group divisible
design of type (n,m^t) with block size 3, which is denoted by a 3-SCHGDD of
type (n,m^t). When t is odd and n\neq 8 or t is doubly even and t\neq 8, the
existence problem is completely solved; when t is singly even, many infinite
families are obtained. Applications of our results to two-dimensional balanced
sampling plans and optimal two-dimensional optical orthogonal codes are also
discussed.
