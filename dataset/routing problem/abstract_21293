We examine the evolution of a holographic cosmological model with future
event horizon as the infrared cut-off and dark matter and dark energy do not
evolve independently $-$ there is interaction between them. The basic evolution
equations are reduced to an autonomous system and corresponding phase space is
analyzed.
