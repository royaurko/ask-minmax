The Dirichlet-to-Neumann map associated to an elliptic partial differential
equation becomes multivalued when the underlying Dirichlet problem is not
uniquely solvable. The main objective of this paper is to present a systematic
study of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map and its inverse, the Neumann-to-Dirichlet
map, in the framework of linear relations in Hilbert spaces. Our treatment is
inspired by abstract methods from extension theory of symmetric operators,
utilizes the general theory of linear relations and makes use of some deep
results on the regularity of the solutions of boundary value problems on
bounded Lipschitz domains.
