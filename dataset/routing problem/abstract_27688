We exhibit two symmetries of one-dimensional Newtonian mechanics whereby a
solution is built from the history of another solution via a generally
nonlinear and complex potential-dependent transformation of the time. One
symmetry intertwines the square roots of the kinetic and potential energies and
connects solutions of the same dynamical problem (the potential is an invariant
function). The other symmetry connects solutions of different dynamical
problems (the potential is a scalar function). The existence of corresponding
conserved quantities is examined using Noethers theorem and it is shown that
the invariant-potential symmetry is correlated with energy conservation. In the
Hamilton-Jacobi picture the invariant-potential transformation provides an
example of a field-dependent symmetry in point mechanics. It is shown that this
transformation is not a symmetry of the Schroedinger equation.
