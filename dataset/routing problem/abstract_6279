In this paper, we consider the problem of prescribing the scalar curvature
under minimal boundary conditions on the standard four dimensional half sphere.
 We provide an Euler-Hopf type criterion for a given function to be a scalar
curvature to a metric conformal to the standard one. Our proof involves the
study of critical points at infinity of the associated variational problem.
