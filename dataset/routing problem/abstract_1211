We have developed a new experimental setup specifically designed for
measuring thermal conductivity on technical superconductors in the range of
temperatures from 3 to 330 K in magnetic fields up to 21 T. Three Nb3Sn wires,
produced by the powder in tube technique, the bronze route and the internal tin
restacked rod process, respectively, have been investigated. We show that, due
to the complexity of the architecture of these wires, direct measurement of
thermal conductivity is required for a correct estimation of thermal stability
in superconducting magnets.
