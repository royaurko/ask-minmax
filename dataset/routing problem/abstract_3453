We show the equivalence of the Number Partition Problem and the two processor
scheduling problem. We establish a priori bounds on the completion times for
the scheduling problem which are tighter than Graham's but almost on par with a
posteriori bounds of Coffman and Sethi. We conclude the paper with a
characterization of the asymptotic behavior of the scheduling problem which
relates to the spread of the processing times and the number of jobs.
