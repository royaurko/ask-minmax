Anaphora resolution is one of the major problems in natural language
processing. It is also one of the important tasks in machine translation and
man/machine dialogue. We solve the problem by using surface expressions and
examples. Surface expressions are the words in sentences which provide clues
for anaphora resolution. Examples are linguistic data which are actually used
in conversations and texts. The method using surface expressions and examples
is a practical method. This thesis handles almost all kinds of anaphora: i. The
referential property and number of a noun phrase ii. Noun phrase direct
anaphora iii. Noun phrase indirect anaphora iv. Pronoun anaphora v. Verb phrase
ellipsis
