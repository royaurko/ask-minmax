We study the existence of analogue nonstationary spherically symmetric black
holes. The prime example is the acoustic model (cf. [V], [U]). We consider also
a more general class of metrics that could be useful in other physical models
of analogue black and white holes.
  We give examples of the appearance of black holes and of disappearance of
white holes. We also discuss the relation between the apparent and the event
horizons for the case of analogue black holes. In the end we study the inverse
problem of determination of black or white holes by boundary measurements for
the spherically symmetric nonstationary metrics.
