We present strongly stable semi-discrete finite difference approximations to
the quarter space problem (x>0, t>0) for the first order in time, second order
in space wave equation with a shift term. We consider space-like (pure outflow)
and time-like boundaries, with either second or fourth order accuracy. These
discrete boundary conditions suggest a general prescription for boundary
conditions in finite difference codes approximating first order in time, second
order in space hyperbolic problems, such as those that appear in numerical
relativity. As an example we construct boundary conditions for the
Nagy-Ortiz-Reula formulation of the Einstein equations coupled to a scalar
field in spherical symmetry.
