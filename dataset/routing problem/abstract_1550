In 2001, PHENIX measured particle correlations of identical charged pions and
kaons at mid-rapidity in Au-Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200GeV. Bertsch-Pratt
radius parameters of pion pairs are studied for 9 kT regions from 0.2 to 2.0
GeV/c and for 9 selections of collision centralities. The pion radius
parameters are consistent with the result at sqrt(s_NN)=130GeV, and the ratio
Rout/Rside is below 1 in all <kT> ranges up to 1.2 GeV/c. The radius parameters
from charged kaon correlations are compared with those of pions.
