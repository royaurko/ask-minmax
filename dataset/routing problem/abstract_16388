We study the problem of detection of a high-dimensional signal function in
the white Gaussian noise model. As well as a smoothness assumption on the
signal function, we assume an additive sparse condition on the latter. The
detection problem is expressed in terms of a nonparametric hypothesis testing
problem and it is solved according to the asymptotical minimax approach. The
minimax test procedures are adaptive in the sparsity parameter for high
sparsity case. We extend to the functional case the known results in the
detection of sparse high-dimensional vectors. In particular, our asymptotic
detection boundaries are derived from the same asymptotic relations as in the
vector case.
