Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p > 0$. We
consider the problem of lifting $p$-cyclic covers of $\Proj_k$ as $p$-cyclic
covers of the projective line over some DVR under the condition that the wild
monodromy is maximal. We answer positively the question for covers birational
to $w^ p-w=tR(t)$ for some additive polynomial $R(t)$.
