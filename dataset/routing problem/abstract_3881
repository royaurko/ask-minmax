In this article, we consider the problem of finding the support of an
inhomogenous possibly anisotropic inclusion in a background of constant
electric conductivity from the electrical impedance tomography data at the
boundary of a bounded body. The article discusses the linear sampling method
applied to this problem. A practical algorithm for solving this problem is
suggested.
