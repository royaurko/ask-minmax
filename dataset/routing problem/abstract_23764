We consider the {\em Deligne-Simpson problem (DSP) (resp. the weak DSP): Give
necessary and sufficient conditions upon the choice of the $p+1$ conjugacy
classes $c_j\subset gl(n,{\bf C})$ or $C_j\subset GL(n,{\bf C})$ so that there
exist irreducible $(p+1)$-tuples (resp. $(p+1)$-tuples with trivial
centralizers) of matrices $A_j\in c_j$ with zero sum or of matrices $M_j\in
C_j$ whose product is $I$.} The matrices $A_j$ (resp. $M_j$) are interpreted as
matrices-residua of Fuchsian linear systems (resp. as monodromy matrices of
regular linear systems) of differential equations with complex time. In the
paper we give sufficient conditions for solvability of the DSP in the case when
one of the matrices is with distinct eigenvalues.
