We study the asymptotic behaviour near extinction of positive solutions of
the Cauchy problem for the fast diffusion equation with a subcritical exponent.
We show that separable solutions are stable in some suitable sense by finding a
class of functions which belong to their domain of attraction. For solutions in
this class we establish optimal rates of convergence to separable solutions.
