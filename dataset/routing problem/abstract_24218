In this paper, we study the influence of the selective pressure on the
performance of cellular genetic algorithms. Cellular genetic algorithms are
genetic algorithms where the population is embedded on a toroidal grid. This
structure makes the propagation of the best so far individual slow down, and
allows to keep in the population potentially good solutions. We present two
selective pressure reducing strategies in order to slow down even more the best
solution propagation. We experiment these strategies on a hard optimization
problem, the quadratic assignment problem, and we show that there is a value
for of the control parameter for both which gives the best performance. This
optimal value does not find explanation on only the selective pressure,
measured either by take over time and diversity evolution. This study makes us
conclude that we need other tools than the sole selective pressure measures to
explain the performances of cellular genetic algorithms.
