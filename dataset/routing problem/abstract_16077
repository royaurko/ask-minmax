This work deals with the dynamics of inflation in the context of a
scalar-vector-tensor theory of gravity exhibiting spontaneous Lorentz violation
at early times. We describe a first-order formalism which we use to obtain new
exact Lorentz violating inflationary solutions for a broad family of models,
some in the absence of a potential for the inflaton field. Our results show
that different conditions are required to solve the horizon and flatness
problems. In particular, we find a necessary condition for inflation to provide
a solution to both problems and we show that in inflationary models with no
inflaton potential a period of superinflation might be necessary to solve the
flatness problem.
