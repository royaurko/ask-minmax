We study the Plancherel--Rotach asymptotics of four families of orthogonal
polynomials, the Chen--Ismail polynomials, the Berg-Letessier-Valent
polynomials, the Conrad--Flajolet polynomials I and II. All these polynomials
arise in indeterminate moment problems and three of them are birth and death
process polynomials with cubic or quartic rates. We employ a difference
equation asymptotic technique due to Z. Wang and R. Wong. Our analysis leads to
a conjecture about large degree behavior of polynomials orthogonal with respect
to solutions of indeterminate moment problems.
