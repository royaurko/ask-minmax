In this paper, we first construct a nonconforming finite element pair for the
incompressible Stokes problem on quadrilateral grids, and then construct a
discrete Stokes complex associated with that finite element pair. The finite
element spaces involved consist of piecewise polynomials only, and the
divergence-free condition is imposed in a primal formulation. Combined with
some existing results, these constructions can be generated onto grids that
consist of both triangular and quadrilateral cells.
