Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) allow vehicles to form a self-organized
network without any fixed infrastructure. VANETs have received wide attention
and numerous research issues have been identified in the recent time. The
design and implementation of efficient and scalable routing protocols for
VANETs is a challenging task due to high dynamics and mobility constraints. In
this paper, we have proposed D-LAR (Directional-Location Aided Routing), is an
extension of Location Aided Routing (LAR) with Directional Routing (DIR)
capability. D-LAR is a greedy approach based-position based routing protocol to
forward packet to the node present in request zone within the transmission
range of the source node as most suitable next-hop node. We have justified the
feasibility of our proposed protocol for VANET.
