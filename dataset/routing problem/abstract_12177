This review paper is devoted to the theory of orbits. We start with the
discussion of the Newtonian problem of motion then we consider the relativistic
problem of motion, in particular the PN approximation and the further
gravitomagnetic corrections. Finally by a classification of orbits in
accordance with the conditions of motion, we calculate the gravitational waves
luminosity for different types of stellar encounters and orbits.
