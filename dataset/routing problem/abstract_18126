This paper proposes a greedy heuristic named as Big step greedy heuristic and
investigates the application of Big step greedy heuristic for maximum
k-coverage problem. Greedy algorithms construct the solution in multiple steps,
the classical greedy algorithm for maximum k-coverage problem, in each step
selects one set that contains the greatest number of uncovered elements. The
Big step greedy heuristic, in each step selects p (1 <= p <= k) sets such that
the union of selected p sets contains the greatest number of uncovered elements
by evaluating all possible p-combinations of given sets. When p=k Big step
greedy algorithm behaves like exact algorithm that computes optimal solution by
evaluating all possible k-combinations of given sets. When p=1 it behaves like
the classical greedy algorithm.
