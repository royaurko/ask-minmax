In the reduced one-dimensional description of the adsorption on the
wedge-shaped substrate the mid-point interface height serves as the order
parameter. We point at the ambiguity which appears in the transfer-matrix
approach to this problem. We also propose how to avoid this problem by
introducing the appropriate order parameter.
