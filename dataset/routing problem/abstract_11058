We solve the two-particle s-wave scattering problem for ultracold atom gases
confined in arbitrary quasi-one-dimensional trapping potentials, allowing for
two different atom species. As a consequence, the center-of-mass and relative
degrees of freedom do not factorize. We derive bound-state solutions and obtain
the general scattering solution, which exhibits several resonances in the 1D
scattering length induced by the confinement. We apply our formalism to two
experimentally relevant cases: (i) interspecies scattering in a two-species
mixture, and (ii) the two-body problem for a single species in a non-parabolic
trap.
