We propose maximum likelihood estimation for learning Gaussian graphical
models with a Gaussian (ell_2^2) prior on the parameters. This is in contrast
to the commonly used Laplace (ell_1) prior for encouraging sparseness. We show
that our optimization problem leads to a Riccati matrix equation, which has a
closed form solution. We propose an efficient algorithm that performs a
singular value decomposition of the training data. Our algorithm is
O(NT^2)-time and O(NT)-space for N variables and T samples. Our method is
tailored to high-dimensional problems (N gg T), in which sparseness promoting
methods become intractable. Furthermore, instead of obtaining a single solution
for a specific regularization parameter, our algorithm finds the whole solution
path. We show that the method has logarithmic sample complexity under the
spiked covariance model. We also propose sparsification of the dense solution
with provable performance guarantees. We provide techniques for using our
learnt models, such as removing unimportant variables, computing likelihoods
and conditional distributions. Finally, we show promising results in several
gene expressions datasets.
