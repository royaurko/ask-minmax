We investigate the large-time behavior of three types of initial-boundary
value problems for Hamilton-Jacobi Equations with nonconvex Hamiltonians. We
consider the Neumann or oblique boundary condition, the state constraint
boundary condition and Dirichlet boundary condition. We establish general
convergence results for viscosity solutions to asymptotic solutions as time
goes to infinity via an approach based on PDE techniques. These results are
obtained not only under general conditions on the Hamiltonians but also under
weak conditions on the domain and the oblique direction of reflection in the
Neumann case.
