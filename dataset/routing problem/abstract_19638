We express the finite 3D Dimer partition function as a linear combination of
determinants of oriented adjacency matrices, and the finite 3D Ising partition
sum as a linear combination of products over aperiodic closed walks. The
methodology we use is embedding of cubic lattice on 2D surfaces of large genus.
