Dynamics of the hybrid systems of aerial cable-ways is investigated. The
eigenvalue problems are considered for such hybrid systems with different
assumptions. An overview of different methods for eigenvalue problems is given.
In the research, the method of the normal fundamental systems is applied, which
turns out to be very effective for the considered problems. Changes of
dynamical characteristics of the systems depending on the controlled parameter
are studied.
