We propose a method for computation of stable and unstable sets associated to
hyperbolic equilibria of nonautonomous ODEs and for computation of specific
type of connecting orbits in nonautonomous singular ODEs. We apply the method
to a certain a singular nonautonomous real Ginzburg-Landau type equation, which
that arises from the problem of formation of spots in the Swift-Hohenberg
equation.
