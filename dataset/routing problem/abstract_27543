In this paper we present the new DUNE-ALUGrid module. This module contains a
major overhaul of the sources from the ALUgrid library and the binding to the
DUNE software framework. The main changes include user defined load balancing,
parallel grid construction, and an redesign of the 2d grid which can now also
be used for parallel computations. In addition many improvements have been
introduced into the code to increase the parallel efficiency and to decrease
the memory footprint.
  The original ALUGrid library is widely used within the DUNE community due to
its good parallel performance for problems requiring local adaptivity and
dynamic load balancing. Therefore, this new model will benefit a number of DUNE
users. In addition we have added features to increase the range of problems for
which the grid manager can be used, for example, introducing a 3d tetrahedral
grid using a parallel newest vertex bisection algorithm for conforming grid
refinement. In this paper we will discuss the new features, extensions to the
DUNE interface, and explain for various examples how the code is used in
parallel environments.
