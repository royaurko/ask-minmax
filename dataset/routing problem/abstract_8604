We present a complete finite axiomatization of the unrestricted implication
problem for inclusion and conditional independence atoms in the context of
dependence logic. For databases, our result implies a finite axiomatization of
the unrestricted implication problem for inclusion, functional, and embedded
multivalued dependencies in the unirelational case.
