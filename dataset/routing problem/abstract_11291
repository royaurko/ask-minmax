On the basis of the semiclassical equations for quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and
Yang-Mills equation, the generalized kinetic equation for waves with regard to
its interaction is obtained. The physical mechanisms defining nonlinear
scattering of a plasmon by QGP particles are analysed. The problem on a
connection of nonlinear Landau damping rate of longitudinal oscillation with
damping rate, obtained on the basis of hard thermal loops approximation, is
considered.
