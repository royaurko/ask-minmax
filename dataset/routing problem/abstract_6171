A knowledge base is redundant if it contains parts that can be inferred from
the rest of it. We study the problem of checking whether a CNF formula (a set
of clauses) is redundant, that is, it contains clauses that can be derived from
the other ones. Any CNF formula can be made irredundant by deleting some of its
clauses: what results is an irredundant equivalent subset (I.E.S.) We study the
complexity of some related problems: verification, checking existence of a
I.E.S. with a given size, checking necessary and possible presence of clauses
in I.E.S.'s, and uniqueness. We also consider the problem of redundancy with
different definitions of equivalence.
