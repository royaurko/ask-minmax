Mean-payoff games play a central role in quantitative synthesis and
verification. In a single-dimensional game a weight is assigned to every
transition and the objective of the protagonist is to assure a non-negative
limit-average weight. In the multidimensional setting, a weight vector is
assigned to every transition and the objective of the protagonist is to satisfy
a boolean condition over the limit-average weight of each dimension, e.g.,
$\LimAvg(x_1) \leq 0 \vee \LimAvg(x_2)\geq 0 \wedge \LimAvg(x_3) \geq 0$. We
recently proved that when one of the players is restricted to finite-memory
strategies then the decidability of determining the winner is inter-reducible
with Hilbert's Tenth problem over rationals (a fundamental long-standing open
problem). In this work we allow arbitrary (infinite-memory) strategies for both
players and we show that the problem is undecidable.
