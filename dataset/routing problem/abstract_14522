In this paper, we consider a transmission problem in a bounded domain with a
viscoelastic term and a delay term. Under appropriate hypothesis on the
relaxation function and the relationship between the weight of the damping and
the weight of the delay, we prove the well-posedness result by using
Faedo-Galerkin method. By introducing suitable Lyaponov functionals, we
establish a general decay result, from which the exponential and polynomial
types of decay are only special cases.
