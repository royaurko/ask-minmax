Many applications like pointer analysis and incremental compilation require
maintaining a topological ordering of the nodes of a directed acyclic graph
(DAG) under dynamic updates. All known algorithms for this problem are either
only analyzed for worst-case insertion sequences or only evaluated
experimentally on random DAGs. We present the first average-case analysis of
online topological ordering algorithms. We prove an expected runtime of O(n^2
polylog(n)) under insertion of the edges of a complete DAG in a random order
for the algorithms of Alpern et al. (SODA, 1990), Katriel and Bodlaender (TALG,
2006), and Pearce and Kelly (JEA, 2006). This is much less than the best known
worst-case bound O(n^{2.75}) for this problem.
