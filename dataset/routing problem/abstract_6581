We study the symmetry properties of the weak positive solutions to a class of
quasi-linear elliptic problems having a variational structure. On this basis,
the asymptotic behaviour of global solutions of the corresponding parabolic
equations is also investigated. In particular, if the domain is a ball, the
elements of the $\omega$-limit set are nonnegative radially symmetric solutions
of the stationary problem.
