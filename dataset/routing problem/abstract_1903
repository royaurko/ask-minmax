We propose a feasible route to engineer one and two dimensional time reversal
invariant (TRI) topological superconductors (SC) via proximity effects between
nodeless extended s wave iron-based SC and semiconductors with large Rashba
spin-orbit interactions. At the boundary of a TRI topological SC, there emerges
a Kramers pair of Majorana edge (bound) states. For a Josephson pi-junction we
predict a Majorana quartet that is protected by mirror symmetry and leads to a
mirror fractional Josephson effect. We analyze the evolution of Majorana pair
in Zeeman fields, as the SC undergoes a symmetry class change as well as
topological phase transitions, providing an experimental signature in tunneling
spectroscopy. We briefly discuss the realization of this mechanism in candidate
materials and the possibility of using s and d wave SC and weak topological
insulators.
