High-performance single-wall carbon nanotube field-effect transistors
(SWNT-FETs) are fabricated using directed assembly and mass-produced carbon
nanotubes (CNTs). These FETs exhibit operating characteristics comparable to
state-of-the-art devices, and the process provides a route to large-scale
functional CNT circuit assembly that circumvents problems inherent in processes
relying on chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Furthermore, the integration of
hydrophobic self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) in the device structure eliminates
the primary source of gating hysteresis in SWNT-FETs, which leads to
hysteresis-free FET operation while exposing unmodified nanotube surfaces to
ambient air.
