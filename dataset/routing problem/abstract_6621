We address two closely related problems associated with the singlet scalars'
potential that are often present in supersymmetric U(1)' models, especially
those which maintain the gauge unification of the MSSM in a simple way. The
first is the possibility of an accidental global symmetry which results in a
light Goldstone boson. The second is the problem of generating a vacuum
expectation value for more than one field without reintroducing the $\mu$
problem. We give sufficient conditions for addressing both issues and provide a
concrete example to generate them.
