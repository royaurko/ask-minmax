We discuss two types of defects in two-dimensional lattices, namely (1)
translational dislocations and (2) defects produced by a rotation of the
lattice in a half-space.
  For Lipschitz-continuous and $\Z^2$-periodic potentials, we first show that
translational dislocations produce spectrum inside the gaps of the periodic
problem; we also give estimates for the (integrated) density of the associated
surface states. We then study lattices with a small angle defect where we find
that the gaps of the periodic problem fill with spectrum as the defect angle
goes to zero. To introduce our methods, we begin with the study of dislocation
problems on the real line and on an infinite strip. Finally, we consider
examples of muffin tin type. Our overview refers to results in [HK1, HK2].
