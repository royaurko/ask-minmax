In this paper, we consider multistopping problems for finite discrete time
sequences $X_1,...,X_n$. $m$-stops are allowed and the aim is to maximize the
expected value of the best of these $m$ stops. The random variables are neither
assumed to be independent not to be identically distributed. The basic
assumption is convergence of a related imbedded point process to a continuous
time Poisson process in the plane, which serves as a limiting model for the
stopping problem. The optimal $m$-stopping curves for this limiting model are
determined by differential equations of first order. A general approximation
result is established which ensures convergence of the finite discrete time
$m$-stopping problem to that in the limit model. This allows the construction
of approximative solutions of the discrete time $m$-stopping problem. In
detail, the case of i.i.d. sequences with discount and observation costs is
discussed and explicit results are obtained.
