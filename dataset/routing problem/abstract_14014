In this paper, we mainly study the Cauchy problem of the
Euler-Nernst-Planck-Possion ($ENPP$) system. We first establish local
well-posedness for the Cauchy problem of the $ENPP$ system in Besov spaces.
Then we present a blow-up criterion of solutions to the $ENPP$ system.
Moreover, we prove that the solutions of the
Navier-Stokes-Nernst-Planck-Possion system converge to the solutions of the
$ENPP$ system as the viscosity $\nu$ goes to zero, and that the convergence
rate is at least of order ${\nu}^\frac{1}{2}$.
