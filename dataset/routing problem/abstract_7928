In this paper we solve a problem, originally raised by Grothendieck, on the
transfer of Cohen-Macaulayness to tensor products of algebras over a field. As
a prelude to this, we investigate the grade for some specific types of ideals
that play a primordial role within the ideal structure of such constructions.
