In this paper, we show that the concept of sigma-convergence associated to
stochastic processes can tackle the homogenization of stochastic partial
differential equations. In this regard, the homogenization problem for a
stochastic nonlinear partial differential equation is studied. Using some deep
compactness results such as the Prokhorov and Skorokhod theorems, we prove that
the sequence of solutions of this problem converges in probability towards the
solution of an equation of the same type. To proceed with, we use a suitable
version of sigma-convergence method, the sigma-convergence for stochastic
processes, which takes into account both the deterministic and random
behaviours of the solutions of the problem. We apply the homogenization result
to some concrete physical situations such as the periodicity, the almost
periodicity, the weak almost periodicity, and others.
