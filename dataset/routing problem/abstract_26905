Several recent misconceptions about the measure problem in inflation and the
nature of inflationary attractors are addressed. We show that within the
Hamiltonian system of flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmology
coupled to a massive scalar field, the focussing of the Liouville measure on
attractor solutions is brought about by a spread in a gauge degree of freedom -
the spatial volume. Using this we show how the Liouville measure formulated on
a surface of constant Hubble rate induces a probability distribution function
on surfaces of other Hubble rates, and the attractor behaviour is seen through
the focussing of this function on a narrow range of physical observables. One
can conclude then that standard techniques from Hamiltonian dynamics suffice to
provide a satisfactory description of attractor solutions and the measure
problem.
