Here we propose and demonstrate an all-optical wavelength-routing approach
which uses a tuning mechanism based upon the optical gradient force in a
specially-designed nano-optomechanical system. The resulting
mechanically-compliant "spiderweb" resonantor realizes seamless wavelength
routing over a range of 3000 times the intrinsic channel width, with a tuning
efficiency of 309-GHz/mW, a switching time of less than 200-ns, and 100%
channel-quality preservation over the entire tuning range. These results
indicate the potential for radiation pressure actuated devices to be used in a
variety of photonics applications, such as channel routing/switching,
buffering, dispersion compensation, pulse trapping/release, and widely tunable
lasers.
