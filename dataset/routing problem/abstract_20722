The problem of approximating/tracking the value of a Wiener process is
considered. The discretization points are placed at times when the value of the
process differs from the approximation by some amount, here denoted by eta. It
is found that the limiting difference, as eta goes to 0, between the
approximation and the value of the process normalized with eta converges in
distribution to a triangularly distributed random variable.
