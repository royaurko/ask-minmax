We develop a Monte Carlo scheme for sampling series of Feynman diagrams for
the proper self-energy which are self-consistently expressed in terms of
renormalized particle propagators. This approach is used to solve the problem
of a single spin-down fermion resonantly interacting with the Fermi gas of
spin-up particles. Though the original series based on bare propagators are
sign-alternating and divergent one can still determine the answer behind them
by using two strategies (separately or together): (i) using proper series
re-summation techniques, and (ii) introducing renormalized propagators which
are defined in terms of the simulated proper self-energy, i.e. making the
entire scheme self-consistent. Our solution is important for understanding the
phase diagram and properties of the BCS-BEC crossover in the strongly
imbalanced regime. On the technical side, we develop a generic sign-problem
tolerant method for exact numerical solution of polaron-type models, and,
possibly, of the interacting many-body Hamiltonians.
