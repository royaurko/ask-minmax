The aim of this paper is to rewrite the Fokker - Planck equation according to
transformation of space coordinates. This is nontrivial problem, because
transformation of space coordinates induces transformation of velocities. We
can use covariant, contravariant or physical velocity components as independent
variables in curvilinear coordinate system. These 3 possibilities are
considered in this paper and 3 kinds of Fokker - Planck equation in curvilinear
coordinates are formulated.
