Results on the problem of stabilizing a nonlinear continuous-time system by a
finite number of control or measurement values are presented. The basic tool is
a discontinuous version of the so-called semi-global backstepping lemma. We
derive robust practical stabilizability results by quantized and ternary
controllers and apply them to some significant control problems.
