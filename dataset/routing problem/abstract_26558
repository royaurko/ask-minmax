We study the fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{\sigma/2}$ on the
$n$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^n$, $n\geq1$. First, we present a general
extension problem that describes \textit{any} fractional power $L^\gamma$,
$\gamma>0$, where $L$ is a general nonnegative selfadjoint operator defined in
an $L^2$-space. This generalizes to all $\gamma>0$ and to a large class of
operators the previous known results by Caffarelli and Silvestre. In particular
it applies to the fractional Laplacian on the torus. The extension problem is
used to prove interior and boundary Harnack's inequalities for
$(-\Delta)^{\sigma/2}$, when $0<\sigma<2$. We deduce regularity estimates on
H\"older, Lipschitz and Zygmund spaces. Finally, we obtain the pointwise
integro-differential formula for the operator. Our method is based on the
semigroup language approach.
