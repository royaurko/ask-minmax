We study frequency linear-time temporal logic (fLTL) which extends the
linear-time temporal logic (LTL) with a path operator $G^p$ expressing that on
a path, certain formula holds with at least a given frequency p, thus relaxing
the semantics of the usual G operator of LTL. Such logic is particularly useful
in probabilistic systems, where some undesirable events such as random failures
may occur and are acceptable if they are rare enough.
  Frequency-related extensions of LTL have been previously studied by several
contributors, where mostly the logic is equipped with an extended "until" and
"globally" operator, leading to undecidability of most interesting problems.
  For the variant we study, we are able to establish fundamental decidability
results. We show that for Markov chains, the problem of computing the
probability with which a given fLTL formula holds has the same complexity as
the analogous problem for LTL. We also show that for Markov decision processes
the problem becomes more delicate, but when restricting the frequency bound $p$
to be 1 and negations not to be outside any $G^p$ operator, we can compute the
maximum probability of satisfying the fLTL formula. This can be again performed
with the same time complexity as for the ordinary LTL formulas.
