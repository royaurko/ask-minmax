We study the dynamical evolution of Chern-band systems after subjecting them
to local quenches. For open-boundary systems, we show for half-filling that the
chiral nature of edge states is manifested in the time-dependent chiral
response to local density quenches on the edge. In the presence of power-law
traps, we show how to mimic the half-filling situation by choosing the
appropriate number of fermions depending on the trap size, and explore chiral
responses of edges to local quenches in such a configuration. We find that
perturbations resulting from the quenches propagate at different group
velocities depending on the bulk band gap. Our results provide different routes
to check dynamically the non-trivial nature of Chern bands.
