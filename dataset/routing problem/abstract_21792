In this article, we show that a technique for showing well-posedness results
for evolutionary equations in the sense of [13] established in [16] applies to
a broader class of non-autonomous integro-differential-algebraic equations.
Using the concept of evolutionary mappings we prove that the respective
solution operators do not depend on certain parameters describing the
underlying spaces in which the well-posedness results are established.
