Due to strong absorption of the incident light, the media with high
refractive index are considered restrictive for applications in photonic
crystals (PhCs). The possibility to resolve this problem by optical saturation
effectively minimizing the absorption of the PhC medium is discussed. Such
approach might be promising for the significant broadening of the photonic
band-gap.
