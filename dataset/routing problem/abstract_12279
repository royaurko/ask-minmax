We consider the problem of unique identification of dielectric coefficients
for gratings and sound speeds for wave guides from scattering data. We prove
that the "propagating modes" given for all frequencies uniquely determine these
coefficients. The gratings may contain conductors as well as dielectrics and
the boundaries of the conductors are also determined by the propagating modes.
