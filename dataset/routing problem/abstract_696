This paper presents path loss model along with framework for probability
distribution function for VANETs. Furthermore, we simulate three routing
protocols Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV), Optimized Link State
Routing (OLSR) and Dynamic MANET On-demand (DYMO) in NS-2 to evaluate and
compare their performance using two Mac-layer Protocols 802.11 and 802.11p. A
novel approach of this work is modifications in existing parameters to achieve
high efficiency. After extensive simulations, we observe that DSDV out performs
with 802.11p while DYMO gives best performance with 802.11.
