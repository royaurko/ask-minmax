W. B. Jordan's conclusion that the quadruple principal value integral in
problem 89-2 vanishes does not hold. The error sneaks in through a contribution
of a subintegral which impedes some sign symmetry with respect to the master
parameter (the Fermi radius) and which was overlooked in the published
solution. In summary, the original problem of solving the quadruple integral
remains unsolved.
