We construct the deformation functor associated with a pair of morphisms of
differential graded Lie algebras, and use it to study infinitesimal
deformations of holomorphic maps of compact complex manifolds. In particular,
using L-infinity structures, we give an explicit description of the
differential graded Lie algebra that controls this problem.
