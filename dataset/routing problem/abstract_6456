We construct the solution of the Riemann problem for the shallow water
equations with discontinuous topography. The system under consideration is
non-strictly hyperbolic and does not admit a fully conservative form, and we
establish the existence of two-parameter wave sets, rather than wave curves.
The selection of admissible waves is particularly challenging. Our construction
is fully explicit, and leads to formulas that can be implemented numerically
for the approximation of the general initial-value problem.
