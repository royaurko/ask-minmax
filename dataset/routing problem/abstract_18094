We propose a new primal-dual splitting method for solving composite
inclusions involving Lipschitzian, and parallel-sum-type monotone operators.
Our approach extends the framework in \cite{Siopt4} to a more general class of
monotone inclusions in a nontrivial fashion. The main idea is to represent the
solution set of both the primal and dual problems using their associated
Kuhn-Tucker set, and then develop a projected method to successively
approximate a feasible point of the Kuhn-Tucker set. We propose a splitting
algorithm based on the resolvent of each maximally monotone operator to
construct a primal-dual sequence that weakly converges to a solution of the
original problem. The key feature of our method is that it only employes the
resolvent of each monotone operator separately, which is different from
existing methods in the literature. As a byproduct, our algorithm can be
specialized to solve composite convex minimization problems that uses the
proximal-operator of each objective component independently, and is equipped
with a weakly convergence guarantee.
