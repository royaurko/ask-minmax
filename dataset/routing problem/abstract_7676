A priori dimension reduction is a widely adopted technique for reducing the
computational complexity of stationary inverse problems. In this setting, the
solution of an inverse problem is parameterized by a low-dimensional basis that
is often obtained from the truncated Karhunen-Loeve expansion of the prior
distribution. For high-dimensional inverse problems equipped with smoothing
priors, this technique can lead to drastic reductions in parameter dimension
and significant computational savings.
  In this paper, we extend the concept of a priori dimension reduction to
non-stationary inverse problems, in which the goal is to sequentially infer the
state of a dynamical system. Our approach proceeds in an offline-online
fashion. We first identify a low-dimensional subspace in the state space before
solving the inverse problem (the offline phase), using either the method of
"snapshots" or regularized covariance estimation. Then this subspace is used to
reduce the computational complexity of various filtering algorithms - including
the Kalman filter, extended Kalman filter, and ensemble Kalman filter - within
a novel subspace-constrained Bayesian prediction-and-update procedure (the
online phase). We demonstrate the performance of our new dimension reduction
approach on various numerical examples. In some test cases, our approach
reduces the dimensionality of the original problem by orders of magnitude and
yields up to two orders of magnitude in computational savings.
