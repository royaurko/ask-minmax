The main problem addressed here is to decide whether it is possible or not to
go from a given position on a peg-solitaire board to another one. No
non-trivial sufficient conditions are known, but tests have been devised to
show impossibility. We expose the way these tests work in a unified formalism
and provide a new test which is strictly stronger than all previous ones.
