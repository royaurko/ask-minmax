The notion of a rough two-dimensional (convex) body is introduced, and to
each rough body there is assigned a measure on $\TTT^3$ describing billiard
scattering on the body. The main result is characterization of the set of
measures generated by rough bodies. This result can be used to solve various
problems of least aerodynamical resistance.
