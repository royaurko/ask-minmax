We consider 3-periodic orbits in an elliptic billiard. Numerical experiments
conducted by Dan Reznik have shown that the locus of the centers of inscribed
circles of the corresponding triangles is an ellipse. We prove this fact by the
complexification of the problem coupled with the complex law or rfelection.
