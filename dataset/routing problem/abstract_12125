In this article we study a problem related to the first passage and inverse
first passage time problems for Brownian motions originally formulated by
Jackson, Kreinin and Zhang (2009). Specifically, define $\tau_X = \inf\{t>0:W_t
+ X \le b(t) \}$ where $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion, then given a
boundary function $b:[0,\infty) \to \RR$ and a target measure $\mu$ on
$[0,\infty)$, we seek the random variable $X$ such that the law of $\tau_X$ is
given by $\mu$. We characterize the solutions, prove uniqueness and existence
and provide several key examples associated with the linear boundary.
