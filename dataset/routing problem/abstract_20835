This note gives two examples of surfaces with normal crossing singularities.
In the first example the canonical ring is not finitely generated. In the
second, the canonical line bundle is not ample but its pull back to the
normalization is ample. The latter answers in the negative a problem left
unresolved in [EGA,III.2.6.2] and raised again by Viehweg.
