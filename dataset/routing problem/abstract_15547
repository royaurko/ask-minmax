The study of capillary wave scattering by a circular region with different
interfacial properties from the rest of an otherwise homogeneous interface is
motivated by experiments on wave attenuation at a monolayer covered air-water
interface where domains of one surface phase are dispersed in a second surface
phase. Here the scattering function is calculated for an incident wave of
frequency $\omega$ (wavevector $k_0$) scattering from an isolated circular
domain of radius $a$ with surface tension $\sigma_{1}$ which is imbedded in an
otherwise infinite interface of surface tension $\sigma_{0}$. The underlying
fluid is treated as irrotational and the three-dimensional flow problem
coupling the heterogeneous surface to the underlying liquid is reduced to a set
of dual integral equations, which are solved numerically. With this solution
the scattering amplitudes and the total scattering cross sections are
calculated as a function of the surface tension ratio $\sigma_{0}/\sigma_{1}$
and incident wavenumber $k_0 a$. The analogous problem of a discontinuous
change in bending rigidity is also considered and the solution to the complete
viscous problem is outlined in an appendix. Experimental implications of these
results are discussed.
