We explore the possibility that supersymmetry breaking is mediated to the
Standard Model sector through the interactions of a generalized axion multiplet
that gains a F-term expectation value. Using an effective field theory
framework we enumerate the most general possible set of axion couplings and
compute the Standard Model sector soft-supersymmetry-breaking terms. Unusual,
non-minimal spectra, such as those of both natural and split supersymmetry are
easily implemented. We discuss example models and low-energy spectra, as well
as implications of the particularly minimal case of mediation via the QCD axion
multiplet. We argue that if the Peccei-Quinn solution to the strong-CP problem
is realized in string theory then such axion-mediation is generic, while in a
field theory model it is a natural possibility in both DFSZ- and KSVZ-like
regimes. Axion mediation can parametrically dominate gravity-mediation and is
also cosmologically beneficial as the constraints arising from axino and
gravitino overproduction are reduced. Finally, in the string context, axion
mediation provides a motivated mechanism where the UV completion naturally
ameliorates the supersymmetric flavor problem.
