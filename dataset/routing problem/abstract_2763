The vulnerability of the Internet has been demonstrated by prominent IP
prefix hijacking events. Major outages such as the China Telecom incident in
2010 stimulate speculations about malicious intentions behind such anomalies.
Surprisingly, almost all discussions in the current literature assume that
hijacking incidents are enabled by the lack of security mechanisms in the
inter-domain routing protocol BGP. In this paper, we discuss an attacker model
that accounts for the hijacking of network ownership information stored in
Regional Internet Registry (RIR) databases. We show that such threats emerge
from abandoned Internet resources (e.g., IP address blocks, AS numbers). When
DNS names expire, attackers gain the opportunity to take resource ownership by
re-registering domain names that are referenced by corresponding RIR database
objects. We argue that this kind of attack is more attractive than conventional
hijacking, since the attacker can act in full anonymity on behalf of a victim.
Despite corresponding incidents have been observed in the past, current
detection techniques are not qualified to deal with these attacks. We show that
they are feasible with very little effort, and analyze the risk potential of
abandoned Internet resources for the European service region: our findings
reveal that currently 73 /24 IP prefixes and 7 ASes are vulnerable to be
stealthily abused. We discuss countermeasures and outline research directions
towards preventive solutions.
