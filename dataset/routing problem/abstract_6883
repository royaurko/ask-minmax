We consider a number of boundary value problems involving the $p$-Laplacian.
The model case is $-\Delta_p u=V|u|^{p-2}u$ for $u\in W_0^{1,2}(D)$ with $D$ a
bounded domain in ${\bf R}^n$. We derive necessary conditions for the existence
of nontrivial solutions. These conditions usually involve a lower bound for a
product of powers of the norm of $V$, the measure of $D$, and a sharp Sobolev
constant. In most cases, these inequalities are best possible. Applications to
non-linear eigenvalue problems are also discussed.
