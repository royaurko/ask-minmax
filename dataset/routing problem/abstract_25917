We consider well-balanced schemes for the following 1D scalar conservation
law with source term: d_t u + d_x f(u) + z'(x) b(u) = 0. More precisely, we are
interested in the numerical approximation of the initial boundary value problem
for this equation. While our main concern is a convergence result, we also have
to extend Otto's notion of entropy solutions to conservation laws with a source
term. To obtain uniqueness, we show that a generalization, the so-called
entropy process solution, is unique and coincides with the entropy solution. If
the initial and boundary data are essentially bounded, we can establish
convergence to the entropy solution. Showing that the numerical solutions are
bounded we can extract a weak*-convergent subsequence. Identifying its limit as
an entropy process solution requires some effort as we cannot use Kruzkov-type
entropy pairs here. We restrict ourselves to the Engquist-Osher flux and
identify the numerical entropy flux for an arbitrary entropy pair. By the
uniqueness result, the scheme then approximates the entropy solution and a
result by Vovelle then guarantees that the convergence is strong in L^p for
finite p.
