In this work we deal with degenerate parabolic equations with three lines of
degeneration. Using "a-b-c" method we prove the uniqueness theorems defining
conditions to parameters. We show nontrivial solutions for considered problems,
when uniqueness conditions to parameters, participating in the equations are
not fulfilled.
