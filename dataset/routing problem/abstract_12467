In this paper, we present an approach to search result clustering, using
partitioning of underlying link graph. We define the notion of "query-induced
subgraph" and formulate the problem of search result clustering as a problem of
efficient partitioning of given subgraph into topic-related clusters. Also, we
propose a novel algorithm for approximative partitioning of such graph, which
results in cluster quality comparable to the one obtained by deterministic
algorithms, while operating in more efficient computation time, suitable for
practical implementations. Finally, we present a practical clustering search
engine developed as a part of this research and use it to get results about
real-world performance of proposed concepts.
