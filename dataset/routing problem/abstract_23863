Let K<x,y> be the free associative algebra of rank 2 over an algebraically
closed constructive field of any characteristic. We present an algorithm which
decides whether or not two elements in K<x,y> are equivalent under an
automorphism of K<x,y>. A modification of our algorithm solves the problem
whether or not an element in K<x,y> is a semiinvariant of a nontrivial
automorphism. In particular, it determines whether or not the element has a
nontrivial stabilizer in Aut K<x,y>.
  An algorithm for equivalence of polynomials under automorphisms of C[x,y] was
presented by Wightwick. Another, much simpler algorithm for automorphic
equivalence of two polynomials in K[x,y] for any algebraically closed
constructive field K was given by Makar-Limanov, Shpilrain, and Yu. In our
approach we combine an idea of the latter three contributors with an idea from the
unpubished thesis of Lane used to describe automorphisms which stabilize
elements of K<x,y>. This also allows us to give a simple proof of the
corresponding result for K[x,y] obtained by Makar-Limanov, Shpilrain, and Yu.
