A significant challenge in nature-inspired algorithmics is the identification
of specific characteristics of problems that make them harder (or easier) to
solve using specific methods. The hope is that, by identifying these
characteristics, we may more easily predict which algorithms are best-suited to
problems sharing certain features. Here, we approach this problem using fitness
landscape analysis. Techniques already exist for measuring the "difficulty" of
specific landscapes, but these are often designed solely with evolutionary
algorithms in mind, and are generally specific to discrete optimisation. In
this paper we develop an approach for comparing a wide range of continuous
optimisation algorithms. Using a fitness landscape generation technique, we
compare six different nature-inspired algorithms and identify which methods
perform best on landscapes exhibiting specific features.
