We show that every irreducible representation in the discrete automorphic
spectrum of GL(n) admits a non vanishing mixed (Whittaker-symplectic) period
integral. The analog local problem is a study of models first considered by
Klyachko over a finite field. Locally, we show that for a p-adic field F every
irreducible, unitary representation of GL(n,F) has a Klyachko model.
