We examine possibility to design an efficient solving algorithm for problems
of the class \np. It is introduced a classification of \np problems by the
property that a partial solution of size $k$ can be extended into a partial
solution of size $k+1$ in polynomial time. It is defined an unique class
problems to be worth to search an efficient solving algorithm. The problems,
which are outside of this class, are inherently exponential. We show that the
Hamiltonian cycle problem is inherently exponential.
