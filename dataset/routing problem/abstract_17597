First, we present a method to obtain upper bounds on covering numbers. As
applications of this method, we reprove and generalize results of Rogers on
economically covering Euclidean $n$-space (resp. the sphere) with translates
(resp. rotated images) of a (spherically) convex body, or more generally, any
measurable set. Using the same method, we sharpen an estimate by
Artstein--Avidan and Slomka on covering a bounded set by translates of another.
  The key idea, which makes our proofs rather simple, is an algorithmic result
of Lov\'asz as opposed to the probabilistic approach taken by others.
  Next we consider the illumination problem (the problem of covering a convex
body by translates of its interior). By a probabilistic argument, we show that
arbitrarily close to the Euclidean ball there is a centrally symmetric convex
body of illumination number exponentially large in the dimension.
