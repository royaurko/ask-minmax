In this paper we study the Gevrey regularity for the weak solutions to the
Cauchy problem of the non-cutoff spatially homogeneous Botlzmann equation for
the Maxwellian molecules model with the singularity exponent $s\in (0,1)$. We
establish that any weak solution belongs to the Gevrey spaces for any positive
time.
