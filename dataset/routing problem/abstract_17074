The metric dimension of a graph $G$ is the size of a smallest subset $L
\subseteq V(G)$ such that for any $x,y \in V(G)$ there is a $z \in L$ such that
the graph distance between $x$ and $z$ differs from the graph distance between
$y$ and $z$. Even though this notion has been part of the literature for almost
40 years, the computational complexity of determining the Metric Dimension of a
graph is still very unclear. Essentially, we only know the problem to be
NP-hard for general graphs, to be polynomial-time solvable on trees, and to
have a $\log n$-approximation algorithm for general graphs. In this paper, we
show tight complexity boundaries for the Metric Dimension problem. We achieve
this by giving two complementary results. First, we show that the Metric
Dimension problem on bounded-degree planar graphs is NP-complete. Then, we give
a polynomial-time algorithm for determining the metric dimension of outerplanar
graphs.
