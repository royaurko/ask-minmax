In this paper we study general $l_p$ regularized unconstrained matrix
minimization problems. In particular, we first introduce a class of first-order
stationary points for them. And we show that the first-order stationary points
introduced in related work for an $l_p$ regularized $vector$ minimization
problem are equivalent to those of an $l_p$ regularized $matrix$ minimization
reformulation. We also establish that any local minimizer of the $l_p$
regularized matrix minimization problems must be a first-order stationary
point. Moreover, we derive lower bounds for nonzero singular values of the
first-order stationary points and hence also of the local minimizers for the
$l_p$ matrix minimization problems. The iterative reweighted singular value
minimization (IRSVM) approaches are then proposed to solve these problems in
which each subproblem has a closed-form solution. We show that any accumulation
point of the sequence generated by these methods is a first-order stationary
point of the problems. In addition, we study a nonmontone proximal gradient
(NPG) method for solving the $l_p$ matrix minimization problems and establish
its global convergence. Our computational results demonstrate that the IRSVM
and NPG methods generally outperform some existing state-of-the-art methods in
terms of solution quality and/or speed. Moreover, the IRSVM methods are
slightly faster than the NPG method.
