In this paper we present a pure algebraic construction of the normal
factorization of multimode squeezed states and calculate their inner products.
This procedure allows one to orthonormalize bases generated by squeezed states.
We calculate several correct representations of the normalizing constant for
the normal factorization, discuss an analogue of the Maslov index for squeezed
states, and show that the Jordan decomposition is a useful mathematical tool
for problems with degenerate Hamiltonians. As an application of this theory we
consider a non-trivial class of squeezing problems which are solvable in any
dimension.
