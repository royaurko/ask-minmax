We examine the cosmology of the two recently proposed scenarios for a five
dimensional universe with localized gravity. We find that the scenario with a
non-compact fifth dimension is potentially viable, while the scenario which
might solve the hierarchy problem predicts a contracting universe, leading to a
variety of cosmological problems.
