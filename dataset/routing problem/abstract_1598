We report on the creation of heterospecies bosonic molecules, associated from
an ultracold Bose-Bose mixture of 41K and 87Rb, by using a resonantly modulated
magnetic field close to two Feshbach resonances. We measure the binding energy
of the weakly bound molecular states versus the Feshbach field and compare our
results to theoretical predictions. We observe the broadening and asymmetry of
the association spectrum due to thermal distribution of the atoms, and a
frequency shift occurring when the binding energy depends nonlinearly on the
Feshbach field. A simple model is developed to quantitatively describe the
association process. Our work marks an important step forward in the
experimental route towards Bose-Einstein condensates of dipolar molecules.
