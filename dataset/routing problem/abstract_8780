Motivated by recent work on ordinal embedding (Kleindessner and von Luxburg,
2014), we derive large sample consistency results and rates of convergence for
the problem of embedding points based on triple or quadruple distance
comparisons. We also consider a variant of this problem where only local
comparisons are provided. Finally, inspired by (Jamieson and Nowak, 2011), we
bound the number of such comparisons needed to achieve consistency.
