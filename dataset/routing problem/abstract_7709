We have studied numerically the frequency distribution $\rho (n)$ of the n-th
neighbour along the optimal tour in the Euclidean travelling salesman problem
for N cities, in dimensions d=2 and d=3. We find there is no significant
dependence of $\rho (n)$ on either the number of cities N or the dimension d.
