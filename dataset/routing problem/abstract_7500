The flickering of the light of fluorescent lamps (FL), whose basic frequency,
100 Hz, is close to that of the micro-saccadic (the eye-muscles' tremor
component) eye movement, is a severe problem for autists (autistic humans), a
problem for newborn babies, for people after some traumatic accidents, and for
some 10% of otherwise absolutely normal humans. Taking the line of a
"system-terms" discussion of the vision-disturbance problem, the present work
provides a constructive framework for investigating the problem. Using the
results of light intensity measurements and some simple analytical models for
the instantaneous light-intensity function, and analyzing the role of the
coincidence (closeness) of the frequencies of the ripple of and the micro
saccades, we suggest a block-diagram for the biological vision control system.
We also show that a singularity of the waveform of, which is typical for most
FL, may be important for brain control of the eye tremor. The latter conclusion
is supported by a simulation of the image intensity on retina.
