Nonlocal problems for higher-order elliptic operators in dihedral and plane
angles are considered. The Green formula is obtained, which leads to adjoint
problems that take the form of nonlocal transmission problems in dihedral and
plane angles. This allows us to establish necessary conditions of Fredholm
solvability and sufficient conditions of one-valued solvability for nonlocal
problems in dihedral angles.
