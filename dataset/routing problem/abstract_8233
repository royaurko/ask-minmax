This article describes the extension of recent methods for a posteriori error
estimation such as dual-weighted residual methods to node-centered finite
volume discretizations of second order elliptic boundary value problems
including upwind discretizations. It is shown how different sources of errors,
in particular modeling errors and discretization errors, can be estimated with
respect to a user-defined output functional.
