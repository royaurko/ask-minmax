We synthesized bulk polycrystalline samples of RECoAsO (RE=La, Nd and Sm) by
solid state reaction route in an evacuated sealed quartz tube. All these
compounds are crystallized in a tetragonal structure with space group P4/nmm.
The Co, in these compounds is in itinerant ferromagnetic state with its
paramagnetic moment above 1.5 microB and the same orders ferromagnetically (FM)
with small saturation moment of around 0.20 microB below say 80K. This bulk
intrinsic magnetism of Co changes dramatically when nonmagnetic La is changed
by magnetic Sm and Nd. Although the itinerant ferromagnetism occurs below
80-100K with small saturation moment, typical anti-ferromagnetic (AFM)
transitions (TN1, TN2) are observed at 57K and 45K for Sm and at 69K and 14K
for Nd. The transition of Co spins from FM to AFM, for magnetic Sm and Nd in
RECoAsO is both field and temperature dependent. For applied fields below
100Oe, both TN1 and TN2 are seen, with intermediate fields below 1-2kOe only
TN1 and above say 5kOe the AFM transition is not observed. This is evidenced in
isothermal magnetization (MH) plots as well. It is clear that Sm/Nd magnetic
moments interact with the ordered Co spins in adjacent layer and thus
transforms the FM ordering to AFM. All the studied compounds are metallic in
nature, and their magneto-transport R(T)H follows the temperature and field
dependent FM-AFM transition of ordered Co spins.
