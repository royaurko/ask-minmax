We study the classical c\to \infty limit of the Virasoro conformal blocks. We
point out that the classical limit of the simplest nontrivial null-vector
decoupling equation on a sphere leads to the Painleve VI equation. This gives
the explicit representation of generic four-point classical conformal block in
terms of the regularized action evaluated on certain solution of the Painleve
VI equation. As a simple consequence, the monodromy problem of the Heun
equation is related to the connection problem for the Painleve VI.
