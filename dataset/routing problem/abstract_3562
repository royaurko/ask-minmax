The debts' clearing problem is about clearing all the debts in a group of n
entities (persons, companies etc.) using a minimal number of money transaction
operations. The problem is known to be NP-hard in the strong sense. As for many
intractable problems, techniques from the field of artificial intelligence are
useful in finding solutions close to optimum for large inputs. An evolutionary
algorithm for solving the debts' clearing problem is proposed.
