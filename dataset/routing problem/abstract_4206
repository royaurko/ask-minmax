The famous Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem seeks collections of mutually
disjoint sets of non-negative integers having equal sums of like powers. In
this paper we present a new proof of the solution to this problem by deriving a
generalization of the product generating function formula for the classical
Prouhet-Thue-Morse sequence.
