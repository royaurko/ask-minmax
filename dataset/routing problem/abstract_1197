We report on theoretical studies of electronic transport in the archetypical
molecular hybrid formed by DNA wrapped around single-walled carbon nanotubes
(CNTs). Using a Green's function formalism in a $\pi$-orbital tight-binding
representation, we investigate the role that spin-orbit interactions play on
the CNT in the case of the helicoidal electric field induced by the polar
nature of the adsorbed DNA molecule. We find that spin polarization of the
current can take place in the absence of magnetic fields, depending strongly on
the direction of the wrapping and length of the helicoidal field. These
findings open new routes for using CNTs in spintronic devices.
