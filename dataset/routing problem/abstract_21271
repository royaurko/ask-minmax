We study the Dirichlet boundary value problem for equations with absorption
of the form $-\Delta u+g\circ u=\mu$ in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset R^N$
where $g$ is a continuous odd monotone increasing function. Under some
additional assumptions on $g$, we present necessary and sufficient conditions
for existence when $\mu$ is a finite measure. We also discuss the notion of
solution when the measure $\mu$ is positive and blows up on a compact subset of
$\Gw$.
