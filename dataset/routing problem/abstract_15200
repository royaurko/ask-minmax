If V and W are varieties of algebras such that any V-algebra A has a reduct
U(A) in W, there is a forgetful functor U: V->W that acts by A |-> U(A) on
objects, and identically on homomorphisms. This functor U always has a left
adjoint F: W->V by general considerations. One calls F(B) the V-algebra freely
generated by the W-algebra B. Two problems arise naturally in this broad
setting. The description problem is to describe the structure of the V-algebra
F(B) as explicitly as possible in terms of the structure of the W-algebra B.
The recognition problem is to find conditions on the structure of a given
V-algebra A that are necessary and sufficient for the existence of a W-algebra
B such that F(B) is isomorphic to A. Building on and extending previous work on
MV-algebras freely generated by finite distributive lattices, in this paper we
provide solutions to the description and recognition problems in case V is the
variety of MV-algebras, W is the variety of Kleene algebras, and B is finitely
generated--equivalently, finite. The proofs rely heavily on the Davey-Werner
natural duality for Kleene algebras, on the representation of finitely
presented MV-algebras by compact rational polyhedra, and on the theory of bases
of MV-algebras.
