The Cosmological Constant problem can be solved once we require that the full
standard Einstein Hilbert lagrangian, gravity plus matter, is multiplied by a
total derivative. We analyze such a picture writing the total derivative as the
covariant gradient of a new vector field (b_mu). The dynamics of this b_mu
field can play a key role in the explanation of the present cosmological
acceleration of the Universe.
