The gauge problem in the so-called strong-field approximation (SFA)
describing atomic or molecular systems exposed to intense laser fields is
investigated. Introducing a generalized gauge and partitioning of the
Hamiltonian it is demonstrated that the S-matrix expansion obtained in the SFA
depends on both gauge and partitioning in such a way that two gauges always
yield the same S-matrix expansion, if the partitioning is properly chosen.
