Fix a marked surface $S$ and finite generating set $X$ of Mod($S$). We show
that if a word in $X^*$ corresponds to a pseudo-Anosov mapping class then then
there is a certificate proving this that can be verified in polynomial time.
From this we show that "deciding if a word corresponds to a periodic /
reducible / pseudo-Anosov mapping class" and that "deciding if two words
correspond to conjugate mapping classes" are problems in $\textbf{NP} \cap
\textbf{co-NP}$. A version of this algorithm has been implemented as part of
flipper.
