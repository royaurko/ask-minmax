We report a novel synthesis route of homogeneously manganese-doped titanium
dioxide nanotubes in a broad concentration range. The scroll-type trititanate
(H(2)Ti(3)O(7)) nanotubes prepared by hydrothermal synthesis were used as
precursors. Mn2+ ions were introduced by an ion exchange method resulting
Mn(x)H(2-x)Ti(3)O(7). In a subsequent heat-treatment they were transformed into
Mn(y)Ti(1-y)O(2) where y=x/(3+x). The state and the local environment of the
Mn2+ ions in the precursor and final products were studied by Electron Spin
Resonance (ESR) technique. It was found that the Mn2+ ions occupy two
positions: the first having an almost perfect cubic symmetry while the other is
in a strongly distorted octahedral site. The ratio of the two Mn2+ sites is
independent of the doping level and amounts to 15:85 in Mn(x)H(2-x)Ti(3)O(7)
and to 5:95 in Mn(y)Ti(1-y)O(2). SQUID magnetometry does not show long-range
magnetic order in the homogeneously Mn2+-doped nanotubes.
