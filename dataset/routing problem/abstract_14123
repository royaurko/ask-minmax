Based on previous results of Jiang, Nien and the third contributor, we prove that
any two minimax unitarizable supercuspidals of GL_N that have the same depth
and central character admit a special pair of Whittaker functions. This result
gives a new reduction towards a final proof of Jacquet's conjecture on the
local converse problem for GL_N. As a corollary of our result, we prove
Jacquet's conjecture for GL_N, when N is prime.
