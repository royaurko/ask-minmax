In this paper we introduce a novel family of decision lists consisting of
highly interpretable models which can be learned efficiently in a greedy
manner. For discrimination tasks our model reduces to a sparse disjunction of
features. We show on simulated data that the proposed model family is easy to
train and exemplify its usability by identifying problem symptoms in a
manufacturing process.
