Character posing is of interest in computer animation. It is difficult due to
its dependence on inverse kinematics (IK) techniques and articulate property of
human characters . To solve the IK problem, classical methods that rely on
numerical solutions often suffer from the under-determination problem and can
not guarantee naturalness. Existing data-driven methods address this problem by
learning from motion capture data. When facing a large variety of poses
however, these methods may not be able to capture the pose styles or be
applicable in real-time environment. Inspired from the low-rank motion
de-noising and completion model in \cite{lai2011motion}, we propose a novel
model for character posing based on sparse coding. Unlike conventional
approaches, our model directly captures the pose styles in Euclidean space to
provide intuitive training error measurements and facilitate pose synthesis. A
pose dictionary is learned in training stage and based on it natural poses are
synthesized to satisfy users' constraints . We compare our model with existing
models for tasks of pose de-noising and completion. Experiments show our model
obtains lower de-noising and completion error. We also provide User
Interface(UI) examples illustrating that our model is effective for interactive
character posing.
