We develop a model of an electrorheological fluid such that the fluid is
considered as an anisotropic one with the viscosity depending on the second
invariant of the rate of strain tensor, on the module of the vector of electric
field strength, and on the angle between the vectors of velocity and electric
field. We study general problems on the flow of such fluids at nonhomogeneous
mixed boundary conditions, wherein values of velocities and surface forces are
given on different parts of the boundary. We consider the cases where the
viscosity function is continuous and singular, equal to infinity, when the
second invariant of the rate of strain tensor is equal to zero. In the second
case the problem is reduced to a variational inequality. By using the methods
of a fixed point, monotonicity, and compactness, we prove existence results for
the problems under consideration. Some efficient methods for numerical solution
of the problems are examined.
