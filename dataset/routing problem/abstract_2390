The well-known Eulerian path problem can be solved in polynomial time (more
exactly, there exists a linear time algorithm for this problem). In this paper,
we model the problem using a string matching framework, and then initiate an
algorithmic study on a variant of this problem, called the (2,1)-STRING-MATCH
problem (which is actually a generalization of the Eulerian path problem).
Then, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for the (2,1)-STRING-MATCH
problem, which is the most important result of this paper. Specifically, we get
a lower bound of Omega(n), and an upper bound of O(n^{2}).
