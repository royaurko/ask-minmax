We study the problem of matrix Lie algebra conjugacy. Lie algebras arise
centrally in areas as diverse as differential equations, particle physics,
group theory, and the Mulmuley--Sohoni Geometric Complexity Theory program. A
matrix Lie algebra is a set L of matrices such that $A, B\in L$ implies $AB -
BA \in L$. Two matrix Lie algebras are conjugate if there is an invertible
matrix $M$ such that $L_1 = M L_2 M^{-1}$.
  We show that certain cases of Lie algebra conjugacy are equivalent to graph
isomorphism. On the other hand, we give polynomial-time algorithms for other
cases of Lie algebra conjugacy, which allow us to essentially derandomize a
recent result of Kayal on affine equivalence of polynomials. Affine equivalence
is related to many complexity problems such as factoring integers, graph
isomorphism, matrix multiplication, and permanent versus determinant.
  Specifically, we show:
  Abelian Lie algebra conjugacy is equivalent to the code equivalence problem,
and hence is as hard as graph isomorphism.
  Abelian Lie algebra conjugacy of $n \times n$ matrices can be solved in
poly(n) time when the Lie algebras have dimension O(1).
  Semisimple Lie algebra conjugacy is equivalent to graph isomorphism. A Lie
algebra is semisimple if it is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras.
  Semisimple Lie algebra conjugacy of $n \times n$ matrices can be solved in
polynomial time when the Lie algebras consist of only $O(\log n)$ simple direct
summands.
  Conjugacy of completely reducible Lie algebras---that is, a direct sum of an
abelian and a semisimple Lie algebra---can be solved in polynomial time when
the abelian part has dimension O(1) and the semisimple part has $O(\log n)$
simple direct summands.
