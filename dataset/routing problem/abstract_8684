We consider the stability issue of the inverse conductivity problem for a
conformal class of anisotropic conductivities in terms of the local
Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. We extend here the stability result obtained by
Alessandrini and Vessella in Advances in Applied Mathematics 35:207-241, where
the contributors considered the piecewise constant isotropic case.
