The method of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) has been widely studied
and implemented for a large variety of problems, ranging from astrophysics to
fluid dynamics and elasticity problems in solids. However, the method is known
to have several deficiencies and discrepancies in comparison with traditional
mesh-based codes. In particular, there has been a discussion about its ability
to reproduce the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability in shearing flows. Several
contributors reported that they were able to reproduce correctly the instability by
introducing some improvements to the algorithm. In this contribution, we
compare the results of Read et al. (2010) implementation of the SPH algorithm
with the original Gadget-2 N-body/SPH code.
