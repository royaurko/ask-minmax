In a recent paper (quant-ph/0102133) Chen, Liang, Li and Huang suggest a
necessary and sufficient separability criterion, which is supposedly practical
in judging the separability of any mixed state. In this note we briefly
recapitulate their main result and show that it is a reformulation of the
problem rather than a practical criterion.
