The complexity of a reasoning task over a graphical model is tied to the
induced width of the underlying graph. It is well-known that the conditioning
(assigning values) on a subset of variables yields a subproblem of the reduced
complexity where instantiated variables are removed. If the assigned variables
constitute a cycle-cutset, the rest of the network is singly-connected and
therefore can be solved by linear propagation algorithms. A w-cutset is a
generalization of a cycle-cutset defined as a subset of nodes such that the
subgraph with cutset nodes removed has induced-width of w or less. In this
paper we address the problem of finding a minimal w-cutset in a graph. We
relate the problem to that of finding the minimal w-cutset of a
treedecomposition. The latter can be mapped to the well-known set multi-cover
problem. This relationship yields a proof of NP-completeness on one hand and a
greedy algorithm for finding a w-cutset of a tree decomposition on the other.
Empirical evaluation of the algorithms is presented.
