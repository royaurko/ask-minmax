We prove the existence of unique solutions to the Dirichlet boundary value
problems for linear second-order uniformly parabolic operators in either
divergence or non-divergence form with boundary blowup low-order coefficients.
The domain is possibly time varying, non-smooth, and satisfies the exterior
measure condition.
