We demonstrate phase sensitivity in a horizontally guided,
acceleration-sensitive atom interferometer with a momentum separation of 80hk
between its arms. A fringe visibility of 7% is observed. Our coherent pulse
sequence accelerates the cold cloud in an optical waveguide, an inherently
scalable route to large momentum separation and high sensitivity. We maintain
coherence at high momentum separation due to both the transverse confinement
provided by the guide, and our use of optical delta-kick cooling on our
cold-atom cloud. We also construct a horizontal interferometric gradiometer to
measure the longitudinal curvature of our optical waveguide.
