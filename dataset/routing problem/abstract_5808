We study control problems for linear systems in the behavioral framework. Our
focus is a class of regular controllers that are equivalent to the canonical
controller. The canonical controller is a particular controller that is
guaranteed to be a solution whenever a solution exists. However, it has been
shown that in most cases, the canonical controller is not regular. The main
result of the paper is a parametrization of all regular controllers that are
equivalent to the canonical controller. The parametrization is then used to
solve two control problems. The first problem is related to designing a regular
controller that uses as few control channels as possible. The second problem is
to design a regular controller that satisfies a predefined input-output
partitioning constraint. In both problems, based on the parametrization, we
present algorithms that does the controller design.
