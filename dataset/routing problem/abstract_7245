Exceptional points are values of the spectral parameter for which the
homogeneous Faddeev scattering problem has a non-trivial solution. We study the
existence/absence of exceptional points for small perturbations of conductive
potentials of arbitrary shape and show that problems with absorbing potentials
do not have exceptional points in a neighborhood of the origin. A criterion for
existence of exceptional points is given.
