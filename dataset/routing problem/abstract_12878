The increasing popularity of automated tools for software and hardware
verification puts ever increasing demands on the underlying decision
procedures. This paper presents a framework for distributed decision procedures
(for first-order problems) based on Craig interpolation. Formulas are
distributed in a lazy fashion, i.e., without the use of costly decomposition
algorithms. Potential models which are shown to be incorrect are reconciled
through the use of Craig interpolants. Experimental results on challenging
propositional satisfiability problems indicate that our method is able to
outperform traditional solving techniques even without the use of additional
resources.
