We study the problem of finding the most mutually correlated arms among many
arms. We show that adaptive arms sampling strategies can have significant
advantages over the non-adaptive uniform sampling strategy. Our proposed
algorithms rely on a novel correlation estimator. The use of this accurate
estimator allows us to get improved results for a wide range of problem
instances.
