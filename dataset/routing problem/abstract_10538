We are interested in the finite element solution of elliptic problems with a
right-hand side of the single layer distribution type. Such problems arise when
one aims at accounting for a physical hypersurface (or line, for bi-dimensional
problem), but also in the context of fictitious domain methods, when one aims
at accounting for the presence of an inclusion in a domain (in that case the
support of the distribution is the boundary of the inclusion). The most popular
way to handle numerically the single layer distribution in the finite element
context is to spread it out by a regularization technique. An alternative
approach consists in approximating the single layer distribution by a
combination of Dirac masses. As the Dirac mass in the right hand side does not
make sense at the continuous level, this approach raises particular issues. The
object of the present paper is to give a theoretical background to this
approach. We present a rigorous numerical analysis of this approximation, and
we present two examples of application of the main result of this paper. The
first one is a Poisson problem with a single layer distribution as a right-hand
side and the second one is another Poisson problem where the single layer
distribution is the Lagrange multiplier used to enforce a Dirichlet boundary
condition on the boundary of an inclusion in the domain. Theoretical analysis
is supplemented by numerical experiments in the last section.
