A knowledge of nonpertubative propagators is often needed when the standard
perturbative methods are not applicable. An example of this is the bound state
problem in field theory. While a nonperturbative result is valuable by itself,
it is also an important guide for those who work on developing phenomenological
models for the nonperturbative problem. The Feynman-Schwinger representation
approach provides a convenient framework for calculating nonperturbative
propagators. In this paper we provide an algorithm for computing 1,2, and 3
body bound states with the inclusion of all self energies, vertex corrections,
ladder and crossed ladder exchanges. The calculation is done in the quenched
approximation by ignoring the matter loops. We provide simulation results for
1,2 and 3-body states.
