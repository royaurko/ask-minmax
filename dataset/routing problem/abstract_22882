How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made
intrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our
heads? How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated
solely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but
other meaningless symbols? The problem is analogous to trying to learn Chinese
from a Chinese/Chinese dictionary alone. A candidate solution is sketched:
Symbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic
representations of two kinds: (1) "iconic representations," which are analogs
of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2)
"categorical representations," which are learned and innate feature-detectors
that pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their
sensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event
categories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical
representations. Higher-order (3) "symbolic representations," grounded in these
elementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership
relations (e.g., "An X is a Y that is Z").
