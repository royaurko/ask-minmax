Alternative theories of relativistic rotation considered viable as of 2004
are compared in the light of experiments reported in 2005. En route, the
contentious issue of simultaneity choice in rotation is resolved by showing
that only one simultaneity choice, the one possessing continuous time, gives
rise, via the general relativistic equation of motion, to the correct Newtonian
limit Coriolis acceleration. In addition, the widely dispersed argument
purporting Lorentz contraction in rotation and the concomitant curved surface
of a rotating disk is analyzed and argued to be lacking for more than one
reason. It is posited that not by theoretical arguments, but only via
experiment can we know whether such effect exists in rotation or not.
  The Coriolis/simultaneity correlation, and the results of the 2005
experiments, support the Selleri theory as being closest to the truth, though
it is incomplete in a more general applicability sense, because it does not
provide a global metric. Two alternatives, a modified Klauber approach and a
Selleri-Klauber hybrid, are presented which are consistent with recent
experiment and have a global metric, thereby making them applicable to rotation
problems of all types.
