Many bioinformatics problems, such as sequence alignment, gene prediction,
phylogenetic tree estimation and RNA secondary structure prediction, are often
affected by the "uncertainty" of a solution; that is, the probability of the
solution is extremely small. This situation arises for estimation problems on
high-dimensional discrete spaces in which the number of possible discrete
solutions is immense. In the analysis of biological data or the development of
prediction algorithms, this uncertainty should be handled carefully and
appropriately. In this review, I will explain several methods to combat this
uncertainty, presenting a number of examples in bioinformatics. The methods
include (i) avoiding point estimation, (ii) maximum expected accuracy (MEA)
estimations, and (iii) several strategies to design a pipeline involving
several prediction methods. I believe that the basic concepts and ideas
described in this review will be generally useful for estimation problems in
various areas of bioinformatics.
