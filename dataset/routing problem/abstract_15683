We review a few off-the-beaten-track ideas in cosmology. They solve a variety
of fundamental problems; also they are fun. We start with a description of
non-singular dilaton cosmology. In these scenarios gravity is modified so that
the Universe does not have a singular birth. We then present a variety of ideas
mixing string theory and cosmology. These solve the cosmological problems
usually solved by inflation, and furthermore shed light upon the issue of the
number of dimensions of our Universe. We finally review several aspects of the
varying speed of light theory. We show how the horizon, flatness, and
cosmological constant problems may be solved in this scenario. We finally
present a possible experimental test for a realization of this theory: a test
in which the Supernovae results are to be combined with recent evidence for
redshift dependence in the fine structure constant.
