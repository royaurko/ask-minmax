We describe extended inflation and its typical problems. We then briefly
review essential features of Kaluza-Klein theory, and show that it leads to a
scenario of inflationary cosmology in four dimensions. The problem of stable
compactification of extra spatial dimensions is discussed. The requirements for
successful extended inflation lead to constraints on the parameters of higher
dimensional models.
