The question of exclusion region construction in new phenomenon searches has
been causing considerable discussions for many years and yet no clear
mathematical definition of the problem has been stated so far. In this paper we
formulate the problem in mathematical terms and propose a solution to the
problem within the framework of statistical tests. The proposed solution avoids
problems of the currently used procedures.
