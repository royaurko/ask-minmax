Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) are special forms of Mobile Ad-Hoc
Networks (MANETs) that allows vehicles to communicate together in the absence
of fixed infrastructure.In this type of network beaconing is the means used to
discover the nodes in its eighborhood.For routing protocol successful delivery
of beacons containing speed, direction and position of a car is extremely
important.Otherwise, routing information should not be modified/manipulated
during transmission without detection, in order to ensure the routing
information, messages must be signed and provided with a certificate to attest
valid network participants. In this work we present a beaconing protocol with
key exchange to prepare the generation of a signature to protect the routing
information protocol 'Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing'.
