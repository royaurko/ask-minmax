Coevolution is a powerful tool in evolutionary computing that mitigates some
of its endemic problems, namely stagnation in local optima and lack of
convergence in high dimensionality problems. Since its inception in 1990, there
are multiple articles that have contributed greatly to the development and
improvement of the coevolutionary techniques. In this report we review some of
those landmark articles dwelving in the techniques they propose and how they
fit to conform robust evolutionary algorithms
