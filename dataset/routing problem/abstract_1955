It was shown in previous works the existence of weakly chaotic orbits in the
plutino population that diffuse very slowly. These orbits correspond to
long-term plutino escapers and then represent the plutinos that are escaping
from the resonance at present. In this paper we perform numerical simulations
in order to explore the dynamical evolution of plutinos recently escaped from
the resonance. The numerical simulations were divided in two parts. In the
first one we evolved 20,000 test particles in the resonance in order to detect
and select the long-term escapers. In the second one, we numerically integrate
the selected escaped plutinos in order to study their dynamical post escaped
behavior. Our main results include the characterization of the routes of escape
of plutinos and their evolution in the Centaur zone. We obtained a present rate
of escape of plutinos between 1 and 10 every 10 years. The escaped plutinos
have a mean lifetime in the Centaur zone of 108 Myr and their contribution to
the Centaur population would be a fraction of less than 6 % of the total
Centaur population. In this way, escaped plutinos would be a secondary source
of Centaurs.
