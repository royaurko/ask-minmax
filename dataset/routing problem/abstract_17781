We study the problem of actuator and sensor placement in a linear advection
partial differential equation (PDE). The problem is motivated by its
application to actuator and sensor placement in building systems for the
control and detection of a scalar quantity such as temperature and
contaminants. We propose a gramian based approach to the problem of actuator
and sensor placement. The special structure of the advection PDE is exploited
to provide an explicit formula for the controllability and observability
gramian in the form of a multiplication operator. The explicit formula for the
gramian, as a function of actuator and sensor location, is used to provide test
criteria for the suitability of a given sensor and actuator location.
Furthermore, the solution obtained using gramian based criteria is interpreted
in terms of the flow of the advective vector field. In particular, the almost
everywhere stability property of the advective vector field is shown to play a
crucial role in deciding the location of actuators and sensors. Simulation
results are performed to support the main results of this paper.
