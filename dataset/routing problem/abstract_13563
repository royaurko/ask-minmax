We present a new method for the nonlinear approximation of the solution
manifolds of parameterized nonlinear evolution problems, in particular in
hyperbolic regimes with moving discontinuities. Given the action of a Lie group
on the solution space, the original problem is reformulated as a partial
differential algebraic equation system by decomposing the solution into a group
component and a spatial shape component, imposing appropriate algebraic
constraints on the decomposition. The system is then projected onto a reduced
basis space. We show that efficient online evaluation of the scheme is possible
and study a numerical example showing its strongly improved performance in
comparison to a scheme without freezing.
