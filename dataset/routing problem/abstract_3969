We discuss several classes of linear second order initial-boundary value
problems, where damping terms appear in the main wave equation as well as in
the dynamic boundary condition. We investigate their well-posedness and
describe some qualitative properties of their solutions, including boundedness,
stability, or almost periodicity. In particular, we are able to characterize
the analyticity of certain $C_0$-semigroups associated to such problems.
Applications to several problems on domains and networks are shown.
