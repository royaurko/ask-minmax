In this work a local projection stabilization method is proposed to solve a
fictitious domain problem. The method adds a suitable fluctuation term to the
formulation thus rendering the natural space for the Lagrange multiplier
stable. Stability and convergence are proved and these results are illustrated
by a numerical experiment.
