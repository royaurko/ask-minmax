This work introduces a multidimensional generalization of the maximum
bisection problem. A mixed integer linear programming formulation is proposed
with the proof of its correctness. The numerical tests, made on the randomly
generated graphs, indicates that the multidimensional generalization is more
difficult to solve than the original problem.
