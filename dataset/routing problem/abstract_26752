We study inverse problems F(f) = g with perturbed right hand side g^{obs}
corrupted by so-called impulsive noise, i.e. noise which is concentrated on a
small subset of the domain of definition of g. It is well known that
Tikhonov-type regularization with an L^1 data fidelity term yields
significantly more accurate results than Tikhonov regularization with classical
L^2 data fidelity terms for this type of noise. The purpose of this paper is to
provide a convergence analysis explaining this remarkable difference in
accuracy. Our error estimates significantly improve previous error estimates
for Tikhonov regularization with L^1-fidelity term in the case of impulsive
noise. We present numerical results which are in good agreement with the
predictions of our analysis.
