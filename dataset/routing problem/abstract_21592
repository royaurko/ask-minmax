We consider the problem of the convergence of the so-called Le Page series in
the Skohorod space $\bbD^d=\bbD([0,1],\bbR^d)$ and provide a simple criterion
based on the moments of the increments of the random process involved in the
series. This provides a simple sufficient condition for the existence of an
$\alpha$-stable distribution on $\bbD^d$ with given spectral measure.
