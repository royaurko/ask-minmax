In this paper we extend the notion of a Lorentz cone. We call a closed convex
set isotone projection set with respect to a pointed closed convex cone if the
projection onto the set is isotone (i.e., monotone) with respect to the order
defined by the cone. We determine the isotone projection sets with respect to
an extended Lorentz cone. In particular a Cartesian product between an
Euclidean space and any closed convex set in another Euclidean space is such a
set. We use this property to find solutions of general mixed complementarity
problems in an iterative way.
