This paper investigates the visual servoing problem for robotic systems with
uncertain kinematic, dynamic, and camera parameters. We first present the
passivity properties associated with the overall kinematics of the system, and
then propose two passivity-based adaptive control schemes to resolve the visual
tracking problem. One scheme employs the adaptive inverse-Jacobian-like
feedback, and the other employs the adaptive transpose Jacobian feedback. With
the Lyapunov analysis approach, it is shown that under either of the proposed
control schemes, the image-space tracking errors converge to zero irrespective
of the invertibility of the estimated depth. Numerical simulations are
performed to show the tracking performance of the proposed adaptive
controllers.
