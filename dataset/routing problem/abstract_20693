In this paper, the weak convergence of impulsive recurrent process with
Markov switching in the scheme of Levy approximation is proved. For the
relative compactness, a method proposed by R. Liptser for semimartingales is
used with a modification, where we apply a solution of a singular perturbation
problem instead of an ergodic theorem.
