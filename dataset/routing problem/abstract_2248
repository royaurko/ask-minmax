In WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) every sensor node sensed the data and
transmit it to the CH (Cluster head) or BS (Base Station). Sensors are randomly
deployed in unreachable areas, where battery replacement or battery charge is
not possible. For this reason, Energy conservation is the important design goal
while developing a routing and distributed protocol to increase the lifetime of
WSN. In this paper, an enhanced energy efficient distributed protocol for
heterogeneous WSN have been reported. EMEEDP is proposed for heterogeneous WSN
to increase the lifetime of the network. An efficient algorithm is proposed in
the form of flowchart and based on various clustering equation proved that the
proposed work accomplishes longer lifetime with improved QOS parameters
parallel to MEEP. A WSN implemented and tested using Raspberry Pi devices as a
base station, temperature sensors as a node and xively.com as a cloud. Users
use data for decision purpose or business purposes from xively.com using
internet.
