In this work we compare two semidiscrete schemes for the solution of
hyperbolic conservation laws, namely the relaxation and the Kurganov Tadmor
central scheme. We are particularly interested in their behavior under small
time steps, in view of future applications to convection diffusion problems.
The schemes are tested on two benchmark problems, with one space variable.
