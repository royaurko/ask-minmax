The equilibrium statistical mechanics of a d dimensional ``oriented''
manifold in an N+d dimensional random medium are analyzed in d=4-epsilon
dimensions. For N=1, this problem describes an interface pinned by impurities.
For d=1, the model becomes identical to the directed polymer in a random
medium. Here, we generalize the functional renormalization group method used
previously to study the interface problem, and extract the behavior in the
double limit epsilon small and N large, finding non-analytic corrections in
1/N. For short-range disorder, the interface width scales as a power law of the
width. We calculate the roughness exponent characterizing this power law for
small epsilon and large N, as well as other properties of the phase. We also
analyze the behavior for disorder with long-range correlations, as is
appropriate for interfaces in random field systems, and study the crossover
between the two regimes.
