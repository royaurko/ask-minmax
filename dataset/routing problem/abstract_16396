The simple assembly line balancing problem (SALBP) concerns the assignment of
tasks with pre-defined processing times to work stations that are arranged in a
line. Hereby, precedence constraints between the tasks must be respected. The
optimization goal of the SALBP-2 version of the problem concerns the
minimization of the so-called cycle time, that is, the time in which the tasks
of each work station must be completed.
  In this work we propose to tackle this problem with an iterative search
method based on beam search. The proposed algorithm is able to obtain optimal,
respectively best-known, solutions in 283 out of 302 test cases. Moreover, for
9 further test cases the algorithm is able to produce new best-known solutions.
These numbers indicate that the proposed iterative beam search algorithm is
currently a state-of-the-art method for the SALBP-2.
