We present algorithmic and complexity results concerning computations with
one and two real algebraic numbers, as well as real solving of univariate
polynomials and bivariate polynomial systems with integer coefficients using
Sturm-Habicht sequences.
  Our main results, in the univariate case, concern the problems of real root
isolation (Th. 19) and simultaneous inequalities (Cor.26) and in the bivariate,
the problems of system real solving (Th.42), sign evaluation (Th. 37) and
simultaneous inequalities (Cor. 43).
