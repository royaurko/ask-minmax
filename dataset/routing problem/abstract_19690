The notion of analyticity is studied in the context of hypercomplex numbers.
A critical review of the problems arising from the conventional approach is
given. We describe a local analyticity condition which yields the desired type
of hypercomplex solutions. The result is the definition of a generalized
complex analyticity to hypercomplex space.
