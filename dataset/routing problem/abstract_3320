In this paper we study the problem of wave propagation in a 3-D optical
fiber. The goal is to obtain a solution for the time-harmonic field caused by a
source in a cylindrically symmetric waveguide. The geometry of the problem,
corresponding to an open waveguide, makes the problem challenging. To solve it,
we construct a transform theory which is a nontrivial generalization of a
method for solving a 2-D version of this problem given by Magnanini and
Santosa.\cite{MS}
  The extension to 3-D is made complicated by the fact that the resulting
eigenvalue problem defining the transform kernel is singular both at the origin
and at infinity. The singularities require the investigation of the behavior of
the solutions of the eigenvalue problem. Moreover, the derivation of the
transform formulas needed to solve the wave propagation problem involves
nontrivial calculations.
  The paper provides a complete description on how to construct the solution to
the wave propagation problem in a 3-D optical waveguide with cylindrical
symmetry. A follow-up article will study the particular cases of a step-index
fiber and of a coaxial waveguide. In those cases we will obtain concrete
formulas for the field and numerical examples.
