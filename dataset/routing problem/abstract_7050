In this work we are concerned with the problem of link scheduling for
throughput maximization in wireless networks that employ a cooperative amplify
and forward (AF) protocol. To address this problem first we define the
signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) expression for the complete
cooperative AF-based transmission. Next, we formulate the problem of link
scheduling as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that uses as a constraint
the developed SINR expression. The proposed formulation is motivated by the
observation that the aggregate interference that affects a single cooperative
transmission can be decomposed into two separate SINR constraints. Results for
the optimal solution and a polynomial time approximation algorithm are also
presented.
