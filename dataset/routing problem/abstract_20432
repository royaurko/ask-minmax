This historical note is mainly based on a relatively unknown paper published
by Albert Einstein in Revista de la Universidad Nacional de Tucuman in 1941.
Taking the ideas of this work as a leitmotiv, we review the discussions about
the particle problem in the theory of gravitation within the historical context
by means of the study of seminal works on the subject. The revision shows how
the digressions regarding the structure of matter and the concise problem of
finding regular solutions of the pure field equations turned out to be
intrinsically unified in the beginning of the programme towards a final theory
of fields.
  The mentioned paper (Einstein, 1941a) represents the basis of the one written
by the same contributor in collaboration with Wolfgang Pauli in 1943, in which, by
following analogous lines, the proof of the non-existence of regular
particle-type solutions was generalized to the case of cilyndrical geometries
in Kaluza-Klein theory (Einstein & Pauli, 1943). Besides, other generalizations
were subsequently presented.
  The (non)-existence of such solutions in classical unified field theory was
undoubtedly an important criterion leading Einstein's investigations. This
aspect was gathered with expertness by Jeroen van Dongen in a recent work,
though restricting the scope to the particular case of investigations on
Kaluza-Klein theory (van Dongen, 2002). Here, we discuss the particle problem
within a more general context, presenting in this way a complement to previous
reviews.
