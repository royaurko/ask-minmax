We develop a rigorous formalism for the description of the kinetic evolution
of infinitely many hard spheres. On the basis of the kinetic cluster expansions
of cumulants of groups of operators of finitely many hard spheres the nonlinear
kinetic Enskog equation and its generalizations are justified. It is
established that for initial states which are specified in terms of
one-particle distribution functions the description of the evolution by the
Cauchy problem of the BBGKY hierarchy and by the Cauchy problem of the
generalized Enskog kinetic equation together with a sequence of explicitly
defined functionals of a solution of stated kinetic equation is an equivalent.
For the initial-value problem of the generalized Enskog equation the existence
theorem is proved in the space of integrable functions.
