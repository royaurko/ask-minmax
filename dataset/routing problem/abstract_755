The sensor nodes in a Wireless Sensor Network are generally constrained with
limited power supply. Efficient power management is a must for any sensor
network to keep the sensor nodes in the network to be operational for a longer
period of time this increasing the lifetime of the sensor network. Hierarchy
based routing enables the sensor networks to be deployed in larger areas. In
this paper we present a hierarchical cluster based routing protocol which
improves the scalability as the data travels from one cluster level to another
covering a greater amount of distance and increases the lifetime of the
wireless sensor network by distributing the power dissipation load evenly among
all the sensor nodes within the network. Also the time delay in case of
critical data to be received by the Base Station has also been lowered.
