We discuss an object from algebraic topology, Hopf invariant, and reinterpret
it in terms of the $\phi$-mapping topological current theory. The main purpose
in this paper is to present a new theoretical framework which can directly give
the relationship between Hopf invariant and the linking numbers of the higher
dimensional submanifolds of Euclidean space $R^{2n-1}$.
  For the sake of this purpose we introduce a topological tensor current which
can naturally deduce the $(n-1)$ dimensional topological defect in $R^{2n-1}$
space. If these $(n-1)$ dimensional topological defects are closed oriented
submanifolds of $R^{2n-1}$, they are just the $(n-1)$ dimensional knots. The
linking number of these knots is well defined. Using the inner structure of the
topological tensor current, the relationship between Hopf invariant and the
linking numbers of the higher dimensional knots can be constructed.
