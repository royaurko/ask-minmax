We study the inverse problem for the so-called operators with energy
depending potentials. In particular, we study spectral operators with quadratic
dependance on the spectral parameter. The corresponding hierarchy of integrable
equations includes the Kaup-Bousinesq equation. We formulate the inverse
problem as a Riemann-Hilbert problem with a Z2 reduction group. The soliton
solutions are explicitly obtained.
