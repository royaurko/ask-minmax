A three-dimensional unilateral contact problem for articular cartilage layers
is considered in the framework of the biphasic cartilage model. The articular
cartilages bonded to subchondral bones are modeled as biphasic materials
consisting of a solid phase and a fluid phase. It is assumed that the
subchondral bones are rigid and shaped like elliptic paraboloids. The obtained
analytical solution is valid over long time periods and can be used for
increasing loading conditions.
