We show numerically that the lowest eigenmodes of the 2-dimensional
Laplace-operator with SU(2) gauge couplings are strongly localized. A
connection is drawn to the Anderson-Localization problem. A new Multigrid
algorithm, capable to deal with these modes, shows no critical slowing down for
this problem.
