A large-scale service system with multiple customer classes and multiple
server pools is considered, with the mean service time depending both on the
customer class and server pool. The allowed activities (routing choices) form a
tree (in the graph with vertices being both customer classes and server pools).
We study the behavior of the system under a {\em Leaf Activity Priority} (LAP)
policy, introduced in [17]. An asymptotic regime is considered, where the
arrival rate of customers and number of servers in each pool tend to infinity
in proportion to a scaling parameter $r$, while the overall system load remains
strictly subcritical. We prove tightness of diffusion-scaled (centered at the
equilibrium point and scaled down by $r^{-1/2}$) invariant distributions. As a
consequence, we obtain a limit interchange result: the limit of
diffusion-scaled invariant distributions is equal to the invariant distribution
of the limiting diffusion process.
