We consider the problem of minimizing costs in the generation unit commitment
problem, a cornerstone in electric power system operations, while enforcing an
N-k-e reliability criterion. This reliability criterion is a generalization of
the well-known $N$-$k$ criterion, and dictates that at least $(1-e_ j)$
fraction of the total system demand must be met following the failures of $k$
or fewer system components. We refer to this problem as the
Contingency-Constrained Unit Commitment problem, or CCUC. We present a
mixed-integer programming formulation of the CCUC that accounts for both
transmission and generation element failures. We propose novel cutting plane
algorithms that avoid the need to explicitly consider an exponential number of
contingencies. Computational studies are performed on several IEEE test systems
and a simplified model of the Western US interconnection network, which
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods relative to current
state-of-the-art.
