Rectangular matrix solutions of the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equation (dNLS) are considered on a semi-strip. Evolution of the corresponding
Weyl function is described in terms of the initial-boundary conditions. Then
initial condition is recovered from the boundary conditions. Thus, solutions of
dNLS are recovered from the boundary conditions.
