Feedback or closed-loop control allows dynamical systems to increase their
performance up to a limit imposed by the second law of thermodynamics. It is
expected that within this limit, the system performance increases as the
controller uses more information about the system. However, despite the
relevant progresses made recently, a general and complete formal development to
justify this statement using information theory is still lacking. We present
here the state-of-the-art and the main open problems that include aspects of
the redundancy of correlated operations of feedback control and the continuous
operation of feedback control. Complete answers to these questions are required
to firmly establish the thermodynamics of feedback controlled systems. Other
relevant open questions concern the implications of the theoretical results for
the limitations in the performance of feedback controlled flashing ratchets,
and for the operation and performance of nanotechnology devices and biological
systems.
