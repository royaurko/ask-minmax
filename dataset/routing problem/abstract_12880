The weak Galerkin finite element method is a novel numerical method that was
first proposed and analyzed by Wang and Ye for general second order elliptic
problems on triangular meshes. The goal of this paper is to conduct a
computational investigation for the weak Galerkin method for various model
problems with more general finite element partitions. The numerical results
confirm the theory established by Wang and Ye. The results also indicate that
the weak Galerkin method is efficient, robust, and reliable in scientific
computing.
