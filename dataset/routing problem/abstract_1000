A two step solid state reaction route has been presented to synthesize
monophasic cobalt tellurate (Co3TeO6, CTO) using Co3O4 and TeO2 as starting
reagents. During synthesis, initial ingredient Co3O4 is found better than CoO
in circumventing the intermediate Co5TeO8 or CoTeO3 phases. High resolution
Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction has been used to probe different phases present
in synthesized CTO and to achieve its single phase. Further, XANES studies near
Co K and Te L-edge reveal mixed oxidation states of Co (i.e. Co2+ and Co3+) and
+VI valence state of Te respectively, which is also confirmed with XPS. Charge
imbalance due to different oxidation states of the Co-ions has been observed to
be compensated by plausible Te-cations vacancy. Enhanced multiferroic
properties like effective magnetic moment (JAP 116, (2014)) have been
correlated with the present synthesis route.
