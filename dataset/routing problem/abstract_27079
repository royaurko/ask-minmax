We are now on the verge of the next technical revolution - robots are going
to invade our lives. However, to interact with humans or to be incorporated
into a human "collective" robots have to be provided with some human-like
cognitive abilities. What does it mean? - nobody knows. But robotics research
communities are trying hard to find out a way to cope with this problem.
Meanwhile, despite abundant funding these efforts did not lead to any
meaningful result (only in Europe, only in the past ten years, Cognitive
Robotics research funding has reached a ceiling of 1.39 billion euros). In the
next ten years, a similar budget is going to be spent to tackle the Cognitive
Robotics problems in the frame of the Human Brain Project. There is no reason
to expect that this time the result will be different. I would like to try to
explain why I'm so unhappy about this.
