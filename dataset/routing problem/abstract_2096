Improving transport current has been the primary issue for practical
application of superconducting wires and tapes. However, the porous nature of
powder-in-tube (PIT) processed iron-based superconducting tapes is thought to
be one of the important reasons for the low Jc values. In this work, the
superconducting core density of ex-situ Sr0.6K0.4Fe2As2 tapes was significantly
improved by employing a simple hot pressing as an alternative route for final
sintering. At 4.2 K, the transport Jc values showed excellent values of
5.1x10^4 A/cm^2 at 10 T and 4.3x10^4 A/cm^2 at 14 T, respectively, which attain
the Jc level desired for practical applications. Moreover, the Jc values
exhibited extremely weak magnetic field dependence. These results clearly
demonstrate that PIT pnictide wire conductors are very promising for high field
magnet applications.
