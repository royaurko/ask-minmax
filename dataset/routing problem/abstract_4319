The introduction of Fuzzy Relational Equations (FREs) has made problems that
were unsolvable using algebraic linear equations into solvable ones. FREs have
been applied to problemsin medicine, industry, transportation and all types of
social problems where the data is an unsupervised one. Yet, FREs lack the
capacity to tackle problems where an element of indeterminacy is involved. This
book develops the new concept of Neutrosophic Relational Equations (NREs) that
have the capacity to analyze problems with indeterminacy. Here, earlier models
on FREs are analyzed and new NRE models, with practical applications, are
presented.
