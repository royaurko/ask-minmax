The dimension datum of a closed subgroup of a compact Lie group is the
sequence of invariant dimensions of irreducible representations by restriction.
In this article we classify closed connected subgroups with equal dimension
data or linearly dependent dimension data. This classification should have
applications to the isospectral geometry and automorphic form theory. We also
study the equality/linear dependence of not necessarily connected subgroups of
unitary group acting irreducibly on the natural representation.
