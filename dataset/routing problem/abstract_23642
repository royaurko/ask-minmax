Definition. Let J be a period-2 unitary operator (some people say J is
reflection operator or reflection symmetry) and U be a linear operator.
  If U^*JU = J (resp. U^*JU >= J) then U is said to be J-isometry (resp.
J-noncontraction).
  If U^*JU >= J and UJU^* >= J) then U is said to be J-binoncontraction).
  Theorem. If every J-isometry has nontrivial positive invariant subspace then
every J-noncontraction has such a subspace.
  Theorem. If every J-binoncontractive J-isometry has maximal positive
invariant subspace then every J-noncontraction has such a subspace.

But in that time the presented construtions and theorems seemed to be rather
curious observations. Now the situattion is changing (see e.g. math.DS/9908169)
