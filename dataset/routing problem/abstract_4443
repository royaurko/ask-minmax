We show enough evidence that a structured version of Adiabatic Quantum
Computation (AQC) is efficient for most satisfiability problems. More
precisely, when the success probability is fixed beforehand, the computational
resources grow subexponentially in the number of qubits. Our study focuses on
random satisfiability and exact cover problems, developing a multi-step
algorithm that solves clauses one by one. Relating the computational cost to
classical properties of the problem, we collect significant statistics with up
to N=140 qubits, around the phase transitions, which is where the hardest
problems appear.
