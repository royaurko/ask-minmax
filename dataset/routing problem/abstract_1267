In this work we investigated the phase formation and structural ordering of
Ba$_{3}$B$^{'}$Nb$_{2}$O$_{9}$ (B$^{'}$ $=$ Ca and Zn) perovskite powders
obtained by a modified polymeric precursor route using X-ray powder diffraction
and Raman spectroscopy. We obtained single phase complex perovskites at 900
$^o$C. Williamson-Hall analysis and scanning electron microscopy showed that
the powders have crystallites and particles of nanometric size.
