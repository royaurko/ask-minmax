We establish sharp regularity and Fredholm theorems for the
\bar{\partial}_b-Neumann problem on domains satisfying some non-generic
geometric conditions. We use these domains to construct explicit examples of
bad behaviour of the Kohn Laplacian: it is not always hypoelliptic up to the
boundary, its partial inverse is not compact and it is not globally
subelliptic.
