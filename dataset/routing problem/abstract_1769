We present a progress overview focused on the recent theoretical and
experimental advances in the area of soliton manipulation in optical lattices.
Optical lattices offer the possibility to engineer and to control the
diffraction of light beams in media with periodically-modulated optical
properties, to manage the corresponding reflection and transmission bands, and
to form specially designed defects. Consequently, they afford the existence of
a rich variety of new families of nonlinear stationary waves and solitons, lead
to new rich dynamical phenomena, and offer novel conceptual opportunities for
all-optical shaping, switching and routing of optical signals encoded in
soliton formats. In this overview, we consider reconfigurable optically-induced
lattices as well as waveguide arrays made in suitable nonlinear materials. We
address both, one-dimensional and multi-dimensional geometries. We specially
target the new possibilities made possible by optical lattices induced by a
variety of existing non-diffracting light patterns, we address nonlinear
lattices and soliton arrays, and we briefly explore the unique features
exhibited by light propagation in defect modes and in random lattices, an area
of current topical interest and of potential cross-disciplinary impact.
