Integral deferred correction (IDC) methods have been shown to be an efficient
way to achieve arbitrary high order accuracy and possess good stability
properties. In this paper, we construct high order operator splitting schemes
using the IDC procedure to solve initial value problems (IVPs). We present
analysis to show that the IDC methods can correct for both the splitting and
numerical errors, lifting the order of accuracy by $r$ with each correction,
where $r$ is the order of accuracy of the method used to solve the correction
equation. We further apply this framework to solve partial differential
equations (PDEs). Numerical examples in two dimensions of linear and nonlinear
initial-boundary value problems are presented to demonstrate the performance of
the proposed IDC approach.
