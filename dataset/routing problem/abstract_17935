We prove the existence of an almost full measure set of $(3n-2)$--dimensional
quasi periodic motions in the planetary problem with $(1+n)$ masses, with
eccentricities arbitrarily close to the Levi-Civita limiting value and
relatively high inclinations. This solves a question posed by V. I. Arnold in
the 60s and extends previous results, where smallness of eccentricities and
inclinations was assumed. The proof exploits nice parity properties of a new
set of coordinates for the planetary problem, which reduces completely the
number of degrees of freedom for the system (in particular, its degeneracy due
to rotations) and, moreover, is well fitted to its reflection invariance. It
allows the explicit construction of an associated close to be integrable
system, replacing Birkhoff normal form, common tool of previous literature.
