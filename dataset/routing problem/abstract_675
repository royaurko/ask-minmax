We identify a scalable, practical route to fabricating a superconducting
diode. The device relies for its function on the barrier to flux vortex entry
being reduced at the substrate interface of a superconducting pinning enhanced
YBa2Cu3O7-d nano-composite film. We show that these composite systems provide a
practical route to fabricating a useful superconducting diode and demonstrate
the rectification of an alternating current.
