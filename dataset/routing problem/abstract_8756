The paper deals with studying a connection of the Littlewood--Offord problem
with estimating the concentration functions of some symmetric infinitely
divisible distributions. Some multivariate generalizations of results of Arak
(1980) are given. They show a connection of the concentration function of the
sum with the arithmetic structure of supports of distributions of independent
random vectors for arbitrary distributions of summands.
