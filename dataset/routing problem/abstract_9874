This paper is about reachability analysis in a restricted subclass of
multi-pushdown automata. We assume that the control states of an automaton are
partially ordered, and all transitions of an automaton go downwards with
respect to the order. We prove decidability of the reachability problem, and
computability of the backward reachability set. As the main contribution, we
identify relevant subclasses where the reachability problem becomes
NP-complete. This matches the complexity of the same problem for
communication-free vector addition systems, a special case of stateless
multi-pushdown automata.
