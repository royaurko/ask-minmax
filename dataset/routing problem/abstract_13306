We consider a problem of multi-product scheduling in production. Each product
can be produced by a family of alternative multi-machine technologies.
Multi-machine technologies require more than one machine at the same time. A
sequence dependent setup time is needed between different technologies. We
formulate a mixed integer linear programming model for the general case of the
problem and for the case, when the setup times satisfy the triangle inequality.
The proposed models are experimentally tested on randomly generated instances.
