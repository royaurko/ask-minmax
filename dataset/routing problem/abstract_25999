We introduce a fast algorithm for computing sparse Fourier transforms
supported on smooth curves or surfaces. This problem appear naturally in
several important problems in wave scattering and reflection seismology. The
main observation is that the interaction between a frequency region and a
spatial region is approximately low rank if the product of their radii are
bounded by the maximum frequency. Based on this property, equivalent sources
located at Cartesian grids are used to speed up the computation of the
interaction between these two regions. The overall structure of our algorithm
follows the recently-introduced butterfly algorithm. The computation is further
accelerated by exploiting the tensor-product property of the Fourier kernel in
two and three dimensions. The proposed algorithm is accurate and has an $O(N
\log N)$ complexity. Finally, we present numerical results in both two and
three dimensions.
