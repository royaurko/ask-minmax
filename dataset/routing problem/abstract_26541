For the past few decades, man has been trying to create an intelligent
computer which can talk and respond like he can. The task of creating a system
that can talk like a human being is the primary objective of Automatic Speech
Recognition. Various Speech Recognition techniques have been developed in
theory and have been applied in practice. This paper discusses the problems
that have been encountered in developing Speech Recognition, the techniques
that have been applied to automate the task, and a representation of the core
problems of present day Speech Recognition by using Fuzzy Mathematics.
