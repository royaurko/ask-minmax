The QSAT problem is the quantified version of the SAT problem. We show the
existence of a threshold effect for the phase transition associated with the
satisfiability of random quantified extended 2-CNF formulas. We consider
boolean CNF formulas of the form $\forall X \exists Y \varphi(X,Y)$, where $X$
has $m$ variables, $Y$ has $n$ variables and each clause in $\varphi$ has one
literal from $X$ and two from $Y$. For such formulas, we show that the
threshold phenomenon is controlled by the ratio between the number of clauses
and the number $n$ of existential variables. Then we give the exact location of
the associated critical ratio $c^{*}$. Indeed, we prove that $c^{*}$ is a
decreasing function of $ \alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the limiting value of $m /
\log (n)$ when $n$ tends to infinity.
