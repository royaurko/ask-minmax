Research on multi-agent planning has been popular in recent years. While
previous research has been motivated by the understanding that, through
cooperation, multi-agent systems can achieve tasks that are unachievable by
single-agent systems, there are no formal characterizations of situations where
cooperation is required to achieve a goal, thus warranting the application of
multi-agent systems. In this paper, we provide such a formal discussion from
the planning aspect. We first show that determining whether there is required
cooperation (RC) is intractable is general. Then, by dividing the problems that
require cooperation (referred to as RC problems) into two classes -- problems
with heterogeneous and homogeneous agents, we aim to identify all the
conditions that can cause RC in these two classes. We establish that when none
of these identified conditions hold, the problem is single-agent solvable.
Furthermore, with a few assumptions, we provide an upper bound on the minimum
number of agents required for RC problems with homogeneous agents. This study
not only provides new insights into multi-agent planning, but also has many
applications. For example, in human-robot teaming, when a robot cannot achieve
a task, it may be due to RC. In such cases, the human teammate should be
informed and, consequently, coordinate with other available robots for a
solution.
