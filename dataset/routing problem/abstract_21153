Previous contributors have shown how to build FM-indexes efficiently in external
memory, but querying them efficiently remains an open problem. Searching
na\"{i}vely for a pattern $P$ requires (\Theta (|P|)) random access. In this
paper we show how, by storing a few small auxiliary tables, we can access data
only in the order in which they appear on disk, which should be faster.
