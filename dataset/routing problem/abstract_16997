This article describes a formal strategy of geometric complexity theory (GCT)
to resolve the {\em self referential paradox} in the $P$ vs. $NP$ and related
problems. The strategy, called the {\em flip}, is to go for {\em explicit
proofs} of these problems. By an explicit proof we mean a proof that constructs
proof certificates of hardness that are easy to verify, construct and decode.
The main result in this paper says that (1) any proof of the arithmetic
implication of the $P$ vs. $NP$ conjecture is close to an explicit proof in the
sense that it can be transformed into an explicit proof by proving in addition
that arithmetic circuit identity testing can be derandomized in a blackbox
fashion, and (2) stronger forms of these arithmetic hardness and
derandomization conjectures together imply a polynomial time algorithm for a
formidable explicit construction problem in algebraic geometry. This may
explain why these conjectures, which look so elementary at the surface, have
turned out to be so hard.
