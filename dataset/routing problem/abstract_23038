This work is based on the approach developed by J.~Dorfmeister, F.~Pedit and
H.~Wu [GANG and KITCS preprint, Report KITCS94-4-1] to construct maps
$\Phi:D\rightarrow R^3$, $D$ being the unit disk in $C$, whose images are
surfaces of constant mean curvature. They start from certain meromorphic one
forms, so called meromorphic potentials, which take values in a twisted loop
algebra over $su(2)$. The contributors give necessary and sufficient conditions on
the meromorphic potential for the constructed map $\Phi$ to be an immersion.
This revision corrects several misprints and minor TeX problems.
