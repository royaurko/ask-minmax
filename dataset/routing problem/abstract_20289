Distortion maps allow one to solve the Decision Diffie-Hellman problem on
subgroups of points on the elliptic curve. In the case of ordinary elliptic
curves over finite fields, it is known that in most cases there are no
distortion maps. In this article we characterize the existence of distortion
maps in the remaining cases.
