Using kinetic equation in the relaxation approximation (RTA), we investigate
a flow generated by an infinite plate oscillating with frequency $\omega$.
Geometrical simplicity of the problem allows a solution in the entire range of
dimensionless frequency variation $0\leq \omega \tau\leq \infty$, where $\tau$
is a properly defined relaxation time. A transition from viscoelastic behavior
of Newtonian fluid ($\omega\tau\to 0$) to purely elastic dynamics in the limit
$\omega\tau\to \infty$ is discovered.
  The relation of the derived solutions to microfluidics (high-frequency
micro-resonators) is demonstrated on an example of a "plane oscillator .
