The classical problem of self-energy divergence was studied in the framework
of Lagrangian formulation of Relativistic Mechanics. The conclusion was made
that a revision of mass-energy concept is needed for the development of
singularity-free gravitational and electromagnetic field theory. Perspectives
of the development of unified field theory are discussed.
