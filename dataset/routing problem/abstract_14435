In this paper, a new kind of soft sets related with some common decision
making problems in real life called central soft sets is introduced. Properties
of some basic operations on central soft sets are shown. It is investigated
that some classic operations between soft sets can be obtained by central soft
sets with selecting different central sets. We initiate the concepts of an
evaluation system for a parameters set and its optional solutions. An algorithm
is presented to solve such decision making problems.
