For the planning of large pedestrian facilities, the movement of pedestrians
in various situations has to be modelled. Many tools for pedestrian planning
are based on cellular automata (CA), discrete in space and time, some use self
driven pargticles (SDP), continuous in space and time. It is common experience
that CA have problems with modelling sharp bends in wide corridors. They tend
to move the pedestrians to the innermost lanes far too strongly, thereby
reducing the capacity of the facility. With SDP, the problem seems to be less
pronounced but still present. With CA, we compare the performance of two
standard shortest distance based static floors on 90 and 180 degree bends with
a newly defined one. For SDP, we demonstrate how variations in the modeling of
the momentary destination of the agents influence trajectories and capacity.
