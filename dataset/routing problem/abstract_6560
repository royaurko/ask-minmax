We review the history of analytical approaches to particle production from
external strong fields in QED and QCD, and numerical studies of the back
reaction problem for the electric field in QED. We discuss the formulation of
the backreaction problem for the chromoelectric field in QCD both in leading
and next to leading order in flavor large-N QCD.
