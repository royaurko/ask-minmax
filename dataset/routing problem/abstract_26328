The study proposes a framework of ONTOlogy-based Group Decision Support
System (ONTOGDSS) for decision process which exhibits the complex structure of
decision-problem and decision-group. It is capable of reducing the complexity
of problem structure and group relations. The system allows decision makers to
participate in group decision-making through the web environment, via the
ontology relation. It facilitates the management of decision process as a
whole, from criteria generation, alternative evaluation, and opinion
interaction to decision aggregation. The embedded ontology structure in
ONTOGDSS provides the important formal description features to facilitate
decision analysis and verification. It examines the software architecture, the
selection methods, the decision path, etc. Finally, the ontology application of
this system is illustrated with specific real case to demonstrate its
potentials towards decision-making development.
