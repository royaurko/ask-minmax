We develop a cut finite element method for a second order elliptic coupled
bulk-surface model problem. We prove a priori estimates for the energy and
$L^2$ norms of the error. Using stabilization terms we show that the resulting
algebraic system of equations has a similar condition number as a standard
fitted finite element method. Finally, we present a numerical example
illustrating the accuracy and the robustness of our approach.
