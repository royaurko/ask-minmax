Circumscription is a representative example of a nonmonotonic reasoning
inference technique. Circumscription has often been studied for first order
theories, but its propositional version has also been the subject of extensive
research, having been shown equivalent to extended closed world assumption
(ECWA). Moreover, entailment in propositional circumscription is a well-known
example of a decision problem in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy.
This paper proposes a new Boolean Satisfiability (SAT)-based algorithm for
entailment in propositional circumscription that explores the relationship of
propositional circumscription to minimal models. The new algorithm is inspired
by ideas commonly used in SAT-based model checking, namely counterexample
guided abstraction refinement. In addition, the new algorithm is refined to
compute the theory closure for generalized close world assumption (GCWA).
Experimental results show that the new algorithm can solve problem instances
that other solutions are unable to solve.
