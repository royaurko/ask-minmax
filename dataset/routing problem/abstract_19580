We discuss the problem of broken time reversal symmetry near grain boundaries
in a d-wave superconductor based on a Ginzburg-Landau theory. It is shown that
such a state can lead to fractional vortices on the grain boundary. Both
analytical and numerical results show the structure of this type of state.
