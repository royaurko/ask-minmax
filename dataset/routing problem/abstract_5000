Most parameterized complexity classes are defined in terms of a parameterized
version of the Boolean satisfiability problem (the so-called weighted
satisfiability problem). For example, Downey and Fellow's W-hierarchy is of
this form. But there are also classes, for example, the A-hierarchy, that are
more naturally characterised in terms of model-checking problems for certain
fragments of first-order logic.
  Downey, Fellows, and Regan were the first to establish a connection between
the two formalisms by giving a characterisation of the W-hierarchy in terms of
first-order model-checking problems. We improve their result and then prove a
similar correspondence between weighted satisfiability and model-checking
problems for the A-hierarchy and the W^*-hierarchy. Thus we obtain very uniform
characterisations of many of the most important parameterized complexity
classes in both formalisms.
  Our results can be used to give new, simple proofs of some of the core
results of structural parameterized complexity theory.
