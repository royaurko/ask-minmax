In this paper, we study self-expanding solutions for mean curvature flows and
applications to minimal cones in Euclidean space. For an embedded mean convex
(but not area-minimizing) cone $C$ pointing into a domain $\Omega$ with
$\partial\Omega=C$, there is a unique smooth complete embedded
$\mathbf{E}$-minimizing self-expander $M$ with positive mean curvature in
$\Omega$. Further, $\Omega$ is foliated by a mean curvature flow $\mathcal{M}:
t\in(0,\infty)\rightarrow\sqrt{t}M$, where the perturbation $\sqrt{t}M$
converges to $C$ as $t\rightarrow0$ in the Hausdorff distance. As a result, for
embedded minimal but not area-minimizing cones we can give an affirmative
answer to a problem arisen by Lawson [7]. From the existence of self-expanders
with boundaries, we give a negative answer to a problem arisen by Hardt [21].
With uniqueness results for self-expanders, we resolve an open problem raised
by Ilmanen-White in [31] via dropping the area-minimizing hypothesis. Namely,
we show that the density of a topologically nontrivial minimal but not
area-minimizing hypercone with an isolated singularity must be greater than
$\sqrt{2}$, which is the best possible constant independent of dimension for
minimal cones.
