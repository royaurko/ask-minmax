We first review the cosmological constant problem, and then mention a
conjecture of Feynman according to which the general relativistic theory of
gravity should be reformulated in such a way that energy does not couple to
gravity. We point out that our recent unification of gravitation and
electromagnetism through a symmetric tensor has the property that the free
electromagnetic energy and the vacuum energy do not contribute explicitly to
the curvature of spacetime just like the free gravitational energy. Therefore
in this formulation of general relativity, the vacuum energy density has its
very large value today as in the early universe, while the cosmological
constant does not exist at all.
