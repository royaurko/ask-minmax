We develop a mathematical model for a three-phase free boundary problem in
one dimension that involves the interactions between gas, water and ice. The
dynamics are driven by melting of the ice layer, while the pressurized gas also
dissolves within the meltwater. The model incorporates a Stefan condition at
the water-ice interface along with Henry's law for dissolution of gas at the
gas-water interface. We employ a quasi-steady approximation for the phase
temperatures and then derive a series solution for the interface positions. A
non-standard feature of the model is an integral free boundary condition that
arises from mass conservation owing to changes in gas density at the gas-water
interface, which makes the problem non-self-adjoint. We derive a two-scale
asymptotic series solution for the dissolved gas concentration, which because
of the non-self-adjointness gives rise to a Fourier series expansion in
eigenfunctions that do not satisfy the usual orthogonality conditions.
Numerical simulations of the original governing equations are used to validate
the series approximations.
