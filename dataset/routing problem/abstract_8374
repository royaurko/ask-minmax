We prove that the problem of determination of factor gauge groups given the
rank of the gauge group at any given vacuum in the Landscape is in the
computational complexity class NPC. This extends a result of Denef and Douglas
on the computational complexity of determination of the value of the
cosmological constant in the Landscape.
