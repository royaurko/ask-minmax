Finding equilibria of the finite size Kuramoto model amounts to solving a
nonlinear system of equations, which is an important yet challenging problem.
We translate this into an algebraic geometry problem and use numerical methods
to find all of the equilibria for various choices of coupling constants K,
natural frequencies, and on different graphs. We note that for even modest
sizes (N ~ 10-20), the number of equilibria is already more than 100,000. We
analyze the stability of each computed equilibrium as well as the configuration
of angles. Our exploration of the equilibrium landscape leads to unexpected and
possibly surprising results including non-monotonicity in the number of
equilibria, a predictable pattern in the indices of equilibria,
counter-examples to popular conjectures, multi-stable equilibrium landscapes,
scenarios with only unstable equilibria, and multiple distinct extrema in the
stable equilibrium distribution as a function of the number of cycles in the
graph.
