The evolution of an initially prepared distribution of micron sized colloidal
particles, trapped at a fluid interface and under the action of their mutual
capillary attraction, is analyzed by using Brownian dynamics simulations. At a
separation \lambda\ given by the capillary length of typically 1 mm, the
distance dependence of this attraction exhibits a crossover from a logarithmic
decay, formally analogous to two-dimensional gravity, to an exponential decay.
We discuss in detail the adaption of a particle-mesh algorithm, as used in
cosmological simulations to study structure formation due to gravitational
collapse, to the present colloidal problem. These simulations confirm the
predictions, as far as available, of a mean-field theory developed previously
for this problem. The evolution is monitored by quantitative characteristics
which are particularly sensitive to the formation of highly inhomogeneous
structures. Upon increasing \lambda\ the dynamics show a smooth transition from
the spinodal decomposition expected for a simple fluid with short-ranged
attraction to the self-gravitational collapse scenario.
