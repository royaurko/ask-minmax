Challenging problems of modern engineering education and a role of
information technology are reviewed. An importance of simulation of real world
physical problems in both graduate and lifelong/corporate education is
discussed. It is proposed to integrate the hypermedia theory courseware with
industrial strength simulation software. As a proof of the concept an
educational environment "Heat and Mass Transfer in Advanced Semiconductor
Technology" has been developed.
