This note describes two problems related to the digital implementation of
control laws in the infinite dimensional family of matching control laws,
namely state estimation and sampled data induced error. The entire family of
control laws is written for an inverted pendulum cart. Numerical simulations
which include sampled data and a state estimator are presented for one of the
control laws in this family.
