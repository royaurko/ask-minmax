In this paper we provide algorithms faster than O*(2^n) for several
NP-complete domination-type problems. More precisely, we provide: an algorithm
for CAPACITATED DOMINATING SET that solves it in O(1.89^n), a branch-and-reduce
algorithm solving LARGEST IRREDUNDANT SET in O(1.9657^n) time and a simple
iterative-DFS algorithm for SMALLEST INCLUSION-MAXIMAL IRREDUNDANT SET that
solves it in O(1.999956^n) time.
  We also provide an exponential approximation scheme for CAPACITATED
DOMINATING SET. All algorithms require polynomial space. Despite the fact that
the discussed problems are quite similar to the DOMINATING SET problem, we are
not aware of any published algorithms solving these problems faster than the
obvious O*(2^n) solution prior to this paper.
