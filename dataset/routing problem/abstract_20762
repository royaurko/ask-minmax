In this paper we produce families of complete non compact Riemannian metrics
with positive constant $\sigma_k$-curvature by performing the connected sum of
a finite number of given $n$-dimensional Delaunay type solutions, provided $2
\leq 2k < n$. The problem is equivalent to solve a second order fully nonlinear
elliptic equation.
