In this paper we study inverse boundary value problems with partial data for
the magnetic Schr\"odinger operator. In the case of an infinite slab in $R^n$,
$n\ge 3$, we establish that the magnetic field and the electric potential can
be determined uniquely, when the Dirichlet and Neumann data are given either on
the different boundary hyperplanes of the slab or on the same hyperplane. This
is a generalization of the results of [41], obtained for the Schr\"odinger
operator without magnetic potentials. In the case of a bounded domain in $R^n$,
$n\ge 3$, extending the results of [2], we show the unique determination of the
magnetic field and electric potential from the Dirichlet and Neumann data,
given on two arbitrary open subsets of the boundary, provided that the magnetic
and electric potentials are known in a neighborhood of the boundary.
Generalizing the results of [31], we also obtain uniqueness results for the
magnetic Schr\"odinger operator, when the Dirichlet and Neumann data are known
on the same part of the boundary, assuming that the inaccessible part of the
boundary is a part of a hyperplane.
