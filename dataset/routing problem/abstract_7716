We show that the question whether a term is typable is decidable for type
systems combining inclusion polymorphism with parametric polymorphism provided
the type constructors are at most unary. To prove this result we first reduce
the typability problem to the problem of solving a system of type inequations.
The result is then obtained by showing that the solvability of the resulting
system of type inequations is decidable.
