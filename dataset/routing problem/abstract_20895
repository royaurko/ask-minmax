In this paper, we present two classes of Bayesian approaches to the
two-sample problem. Our first class of methods extends the Bayesian t-test to
include all parametric models in the exponential family and their conjugate
priors. Our second class of methods uses Dirichlet process mixtures (DPM) of
such conjugate-exponential distributions as flexible nonparametric priors over
the unknown distributions.
