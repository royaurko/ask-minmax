The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an important component in today's IP
network infrastructure. As the main routing protocol of the Internet, clear
understanding of its dynamics is crucial for configuring, diagnosing and
debugging Internet routing problems. Despite the increase in the services that
BGP provide such as MPLS VPNs, there is no much progress achieved in automating
the BGP management tasks. In this paper we discuss some of the problems
encountered by network engineers when managing BGP networks. We also describe
some of the open source tools and methods that attempt to resolve these issues.
Then we present some of the features that, if implemented, will ease BGP
management related tasks.
