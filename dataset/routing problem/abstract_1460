We propose an extended Hubbard model on a 2D Kagome lattice with an
additional ring-exchange term. The particles can be either bosons or spinless
fermions . At a special filling fraction of 1/6 the model is analyzed in the
lowest non-vanishing order of perturbation theory. Such ``undoped'' model is
closely related to the Quantum Dimer Model. We show how to arrive at an exactly
soluble point whose ground state manifold is the extensively degenerate
``d-isotopy space'', a necessary precondition for for a certain type of
non-Abelian topological order. Near the ``special'' values, $d = 2 \cos
\pi/(k+2)$, this space is expected to collapse to a stable topological phase
with anyonic excitations closely related to SU(2) Chern-Simons theory at level
k.
