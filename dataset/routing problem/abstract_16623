The covering radius problem is a question in coding theory concerned with
finding the minimum radius $r$ such that, given a code that is a subset of an
underlying metric space, balls of radius $r$ over its code words cover the
entire metric space. Klapper introduced a code parameter, called the
multicovering radius, which is a generalization of the covering radius. In this
paper, we introduce an analogue of the multicovering radius for permutation
codes (cf. Keevash and Ku, 2006) and for codes of perfect matchings (cf. Aw and
Ku, 2012). We apply probabilistic tools to give some lower bounds on the
multicovering radii of these codes. In the process of obtaining these results,
we also correct an error in the proof of the lower bound of the covering radius
that appeared in Keevash and Ku (2006). We conclude with a discussion of the
multicovering radius problem in an even more general context, which offers room
for further research.
