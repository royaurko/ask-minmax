We investigate the effective potential for Abelian Maxwell--Chern--Simons
systems. The calculations follow an alternate approach, recently proposed as a
gauge invariant formulation of the effective potential, constructed in terms of
a gauge invariant order parameter. We compare the results with another
investigation, obtained within a standard route of calculating the effective
potential.
