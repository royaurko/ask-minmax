The paper is devoted to the study of asymptotic behavior of solutions for
nonlocal elliptic problems in weighted spaces. We deal with the most difficult
case where the support of nonlocal terms intersects with the boundary of a
plane bounded domain. In this situation, a general form of the asymptotics is
investigated and coefficients in the asymptotics are calculated.
