We review some of our work regarding search which has been motivated by a
variety of applications in engineering and technology, including traffic
routing and security in communication networks, explosive mine detection and
removal, tactical operations as well as emergency management. We develop the
basic mathematical model representing N searchers that proceed independently,
and which can be affected by destruction or loss, and time-outs. An approach
based on Laplace transform is then developed for the case where the success of
the search requires that k out of the N searchers be successful, and we
estimate the amount of energy expended and the number of searchers that are
required to conduct a successful search in time B, provided B is large.
Finally, we present an iterative numerical solution approach that allows us to
analyse the search time and the energy needed to find an object when the search
space is non-homogeneous.
