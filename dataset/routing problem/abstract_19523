We review the cosmological evidence for a low matter density universe and a
cosmological constant or dynamical vacuum energy and address the cosmolog$
coincidence problem: why is the matter density about one-half the vacuum energy
{\em now}. This is reasonble, following the anthropic argument of Efstathiou
and of Martel, Schapiro & Weinberg.
