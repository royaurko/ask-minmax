In this paper, we show that several extension of Banach contraction
principle, can be easily derived from the Caristi's theorem is one of the
useful generalization of Banach contraction principle in the setting of the
complete metric spaces. Moreover, some partial answers to some known open
problems are given via Caristi's corollaries. Finally, existence of bounded
solutions of a functional equation is studied to support our results.
