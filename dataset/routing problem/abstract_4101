The inverse problem which arises in the Camassa--Holm equation is revisited
for the class of discrete densities. The method of solution relies on the use
of orthogonal polynomials. The explicit formulas are obtained directly from the
analysis on the real axis without any additional transformation to a "string"
type boundary value problem known from prior works.
