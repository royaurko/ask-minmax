Our goal is to develop a limit approach for a class of problems in additive
combinatorics that is analogous to the limit theory of dense graph sequences.
We introduce metric, convergence and limit objects for functions on groups and
for measurable functions on compact abelian groups. As an application we find
exact minimizers for densities of linear configurations of complexity $1$.
