We consider the implications of solar matter density random noise upon
resonant neutrino conversion. The evolution equation describing MSW-like
conversion is derived in the framework of the Schr\"odinger approach. We study
quantitatively their effect upon both large and small mixing angle MSW
solutions to the solar neutrino problem. This is carried out both for the
active-active $\nu_e \ra \nu_{\mu,\tau}$ as well as active-sterile $\nu_e \ra
\nu_s$ conversion channels. We find that the small mixing MSW solution is much
more stable (especially in $\Delta m^2$) than the large mixing solution. The
possible existence of solar matter density noise at the few percent level could
be tested at future solar neutrino experiments, especially Borexino.
