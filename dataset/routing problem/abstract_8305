In this short paper we will show, via elementary arguments, the equivalence
of the Twin Prime Conjecture to a problem which might be simpler to prove. Some
conclusions are drawn, and it is shown that proving the Twin Prime Conjecture
is equivalent to proving that there cannot be an infinite string of consecutive
natural numbers satisfying some specified equations.
