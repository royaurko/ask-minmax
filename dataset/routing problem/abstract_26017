Over the last few years, more and more heuristic decision making techniques
have been inspired by nature, e.g. evolutionary algorithms, ant colony
optimisation and simulated annealing. More recently, a novel computational
intelligence technique inspired by immunology has emerged, called Artificial
Immune Systems (AIS). This immune system inspired technique has already been
useful in solving some computational problems. In this keynote, we will very
briefly describe the immune system metaphors that are relevant to AIS. We will
then give some illustrative real-world problems suitable for AIS use and show a
step-by-step algorithm walkthrough. A comparison of AIS to other well-known
algorithms and areas for future work will round this keynote off. It should be
noted that as AIS is still a young and evolving field, there is not yet a fixed
algorithm template and hence actual implementations might differ somewhat from
the examples given here.
