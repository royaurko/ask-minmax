The present investigation concerns a disc of varying thickness of whose
flexural stiffness $D$ varies with the radius $r$ according to the law $D=D_0 
r^m$, where $D_0$ and $m$ are constants. The problem of finding boundary
conditions for fastening this disc, which are inaccessible to direct
observation, from the natural frequencies of its axisymmetric flexural
oscillations is considered. The problem in question belongs to the class of
inverse problems and is a completely natural problem of identification of
boundary conditions. The search for the unknown conditions for fastening the
disc is equivalent to finding the span of the vectors of unknown conditions
coefficients. It is shown that this inverse problem is well posed. Two theorems
on the uniqueness and a theorem on stability of the solution of this problem
are proved, and a method for establishing the unknown conditions for fastening
the disc to the walls is indicated. An approximate formula for determining the
unknown conditions is obtained using first three natural frequencies. The
method of approximate calculation of unknown boundary conditions is explained
with the help of three examples of different cases for the fastening the disc
(rigid clamping, free support, elastic fixing).
