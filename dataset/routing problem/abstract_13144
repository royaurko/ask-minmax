Motivated by recent results on the Waring problem for polynomial rings and
representation of monomial as sum of powers of linear forms, we consider the
problem of presenting monomials of degree kd as sums of k-th powers of forms of
degree d. We produce a general bound on the number of summands for any number
of variables which we refine in the two variables case. We completely solve the
k=3 case for monomials in two and three variables.
