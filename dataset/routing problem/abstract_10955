We investigate the problem of how to obtain the force field between atoms of
an experimentally determined structure. We show how this problem can be
efficiently solved, even at finite temperature, where the position of the atoms
differs substantially from the ground state. We apply our method to systems
modeling proteins and demonstrate that the correct potentials can be recovered
even in the presence of thermal noise.
