The problem of the construction of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian structures
starting from two first order equations of motion is presented. This new
approach requires the knowledge of one (time independent) constant of motion
for the dynamical system only. The Hamiltonian and Lagrangian structures are
constructed, the Hamilton Jacobi equation is then written and solved and the
second (time dependent) constant of the motion for the problem is explicitly
exhibited.
