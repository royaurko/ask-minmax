In this paper, the photon stationary transport equation has been extended
from $\mathbb{R}^3$ to $\mathbb{C}^3$. A solution of the inverse problem is
obtained on a hyper-sphere and a hyper-cylinder as X-ray and Radon transform,
respectively. We show that these results can be transformed into each other and
they agree with known results.
