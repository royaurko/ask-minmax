A notion of alternating timed automata is proposed. It is shown that such
automata with only one clock have decidable emptiness problem over finite
words. This gives a new class of timed languages which is closed under boolean
operations and which has an effective presentation. We prove that the
complexity of the emptiness problem for alternating timed automata with one
clock is non-primitive recursive. The proof gives also the same lower bound for
the universality problem for nondeterministic timed automata with one clock. We
investigate extension of the model with epsilon-transitions and prove that
emptiness is undecidable. Over infinite words, we show undecidability of the
universality problem.
