Two problems are posed that involve the star-invariant subspace $K^p_\theta$
(in the Hardy space $H^p$) associated with an inner function $\theta$. One of
these asks for a characterization of the extreme points of the unit ball in
$K^\infty_\theta$, while the other concerns the Fermat equation $f^n+g^n=h^n$
in $K^p_\theta$.
