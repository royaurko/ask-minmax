Incremental SAT and QBF solving potentially yields improvements when
sequences of related formulas are solved. An application program that employs
an incremental approach to a problem is usually tailored towards some specific
solver and decomposes the problem into several incremental solver calls
generated directly within the application. This hinders the independent
comparison of different incremental solvers, particularly when the application
program is not available. To remedy this situation, we present an approach to
automated benchmarking of incremental SAT and QBF solvers. Given a collection
of formulas in (Q)DIMACS format generated incrementally by an application
program, our approach automatically translates the formulas into instructions
to import and solve a formula by an incremental SAT/QBF solver. The result of
the translation is a program which replays the incremental solver calls defined
by the formulas in the collection. The program can be configured to include any
SAT/QBF solver which implements a minimal API similar to IPASIR, which has
recently been proposed for the Incremental Library Track of the SAT Race 2015.
Our approach allows to evaluate incremental solvers independently from the
application program that was used to generate the formulas. We illustrate our
approach by different hardware verification problems for SAT and QBF solvers.
