The Busemann-Petty problem asks whether origin-symmetric convex bodies in
$\mathbb{R}^n$ with smaller central hyperplane sections necessarily have
smaller $n$-dimensional volume. It is known that the answer is affirmative if
$n\le 4$ and negative if $n\ge 5$. In this article we modify the assumptions of
the original Busemann-Petty problem to guarantee the affirmative answer in all
dimensions.
