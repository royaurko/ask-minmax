The detection problem in statistical signal processing can be succinctly
formulated: Given m (possibly) signal bearing, n-dimensional signal-plus-noise
snapshot vectors (samples) and N statistically independent n-dimensional
noise-only snapshot vectors, can one reliably infer the presence of a signal?
This problem arises in the context of applications as diverse as radar, sonar,
wireless communications, bioinformatics, and machine learning and is the
critical first step in the subsequent signal parameter estimation phase.
  The signal detection problem can be naturally posed in terms of the sample
generalized eigenvalues. The sample generalized eigenvalues correspond to the
eigenvalues of the matrix formed by "whitening" the signal-plus-noise sample
covariance matrix with the noise-only sample covariance matrix. In this article
we prove a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample generalized eigenvalue based
detection of signals in arbitrarily colored noise when there are relatively few
signal bearing and noise-only samples.
  Numerical simulations highlight the accuracy of our analytical prediction and
permit us to extend our heuristic definition of the effective number of
identifiable signals in colored noise. We discuss implications of our result
for the detection of weak and/or closely spaced signals in sensor array
processing, abrupt change detection in sensor networks, and clustering
methodologies in machine learning.
