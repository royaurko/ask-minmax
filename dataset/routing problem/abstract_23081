We study the problem of detecting, and infering astrophysical information
from, gravitational waves from a pulsating neutron star. We show that the fluid
f and p-modes, as well as the gravitational-wave w-modes may be detectable from
sources in our own galaxy, and investigate how accurately the frequencies and
damping rates of these modes can be infered from a noisy gravitational-wave
data stream. Based on the conclusions of this discussion we propose a strategy
for revealing the supranuclear equation of state using the neutron star
fingerprints: the observed frequencies of an f and a p-mode. We also discuss
how well the source can be located in the sky using observations with several
detectors.
