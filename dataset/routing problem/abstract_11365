The proper description of hadronic decays of baryon resonances has been a
long standing problem in soliton models for baryons. In this talk I present a
solution to this problem in the three flavor Skyrme model that is consistent
with large-Nc consistency conditions. As an application I discuss hadronic
pentaquark decays and show that predictions based on axial current matrix
elements are erroneous.
