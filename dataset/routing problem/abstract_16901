The Kontsevich integral $Z$ associates to each braid $b$ (or more generally
knot $k$) invariants $Z_i(b)$ lying in finite dimensional vector spaces, for $i
= 0, 1, 2, ...$. These values are not yet known, except in special cases. The
inverse problem is that of determining $b$ from its invariants $Z_i(b)$.
  In this paper we study the case of braids on two strands, which is already
sufficient to produce interesting and unexpected mathematics. In particular, we
find connections with number theory, numerical analysis and field theory in
physics. However, we will carry this study out with an eye to the more general
case of braids on $n$ strands. We expect that solving the inverse problem even
for $n=3$ will present real difficulties. Most of the concepts in this paper
also apply to knots, but to simplify the exposition we will rarely mention
this.
  The organisation and bulk of the writing of this paper predates its most
significant results. We hope later to present better and develop further these
results.
