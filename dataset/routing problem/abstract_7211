After publishing his recent paper in SIAM J. Appl. Math, 74, 392-410, 2014
the contributor has realized that actually he has addressed in that paper, for the
first time, a long standing open question being unaware about this. This
question is about the uniqueness of a 3-d inverse scattering problem without
the phase information. Thus, it makes sense in the current paper to explicitly
make the latter statement and to formulate corresponding uniqueness theorems.
