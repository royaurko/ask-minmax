We study consistency properties of surrogate loss functions for general
multiclass learning problems, defined by a general multiclass loss matrix. We
extend the notion of classification calibration, which has been studied for
binary and multiclass 0-1 classification problems (and for certain other
specific learning problems), to the general multiclass setting, and derive
necessary and sufficient conditions for a surrogate loss to be calibrated with
respect to a loss matrix in this setting. We then introduce the notion of
convex calibration dimension of a multiclass loss matrix, which measures the
smallest `size' of a prediction space in which it is possible to design a
convex surrogate that is calibrated with respect to the loss matrix. We derive
both upper and lower bounds on this quantity, and use these results to analyze
various loss matrices. In particular, we apply our framework to study various
subset ranking losses, and use the convex calibration dimension as a tool to
show both the existence and non-existence of various types of convex calibrated
surrogates for these losses. Our results strengthen recent results of Duchi et
al. (2010) and Calauzenes et al. (2012) on the non-existence of certain types
of convex calibrated surrogates in subset ranking. We anticipate the convex
calibration dimension may prove to be a useful tool in the study and design of
surrogate losses for general multiclass learning problems.
