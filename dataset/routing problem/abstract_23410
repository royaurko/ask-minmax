Supersymmetric grand unified models based on the gauge group SO(10) are
especially attractive in light of recent data on neutrino masses. The simplest
SO(10) SUSY GUT models predict unification of third generation Yukawa couplings
in addition to the usual gauge coupling unification. Recent surveys of Yukawa
unified SUSY GUT models predict an inverted scalar mass hierarchy in the
spectrum of sparticle masses if the superpotential mu term is positive. In
general, such models tend to predict an overabundance of dark matter in the
universe. We survey several solutions to the dark matter problem in Yukawa
unified supersymmetric models. One solution-- lowering the GUT scale mass value
of first and second generation scalars-- leads to u_R and c_R squark masses in
the 90-120 GeV regime, which should be accessible to Fermilab Tevatron
experiments. We also examine relaxing gaugino mass universality which may solve
the relic density problem by having neutralino annihilations via the Z or h
resonances, or by having a wino-like LSP.
