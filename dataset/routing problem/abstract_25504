We discuss the spectral problem for integrable superstrings on generically
twisted AdS_5 x S^5, meaning all its orbifolds and TsT transformed versions. We
explicitly give the asymptotic description of these theories through a twisted
transfer matrix, and carefully match the geometric deformations with twists
allowed by integrability. We then discuss the mirror TBA equations that
describe these theories at finite size. This unifies the treatment of various
specific deformations previously considered in this setting, and extends it to
completely general twists.
