We follow up on our previous work [C. Le Bris, F. Legoll and A. Lozinski,
Chinese Annals of Mathematics 2013] where we have studied a multiscale finite
element (MsFEM) type method in the vein of the classical Crouzeix-Raviart
finite element method that is specifically adapted for highly oscillatory
elliptic problems. We adapt the approach to address here a multiscale problem
on a perforated domain. An additional ingredient of our approach is the
enrichment of the multiscale finite element space using bubble functions. We
first establish a theoretical error estimate. We next show that, on the problem
we consider, the approach we propose outperforms all dedicated existing
variants of MsFEM we are aware of.
