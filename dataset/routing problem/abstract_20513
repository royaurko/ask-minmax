The relativistic problem of spinless particle subject to a Kratzer potential
is analyzed. Bound state solutions for the s-wave are found by separating the
Klein-Gordon equation in two parts, unlike the similar works in the literature,
which provides one to see explicitly the relativistic contributions, if any, to
the solution in the non-relativistic limit.
