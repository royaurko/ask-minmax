The problem of two electrons in a two-dimensional random potential is
addressed numerically. Specifically, the role of the Coulomb interaction
between electrons on localization is investigated by writing the Hamiltonian on
a localized basis and diagonalizing it exactly. The result of that procedure is
discussed in terms of level statistics, and the expectation value of the
electron-electron separation.
