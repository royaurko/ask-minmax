The mobility problem for suspension of spherical particles immersed in an
arbitrary flow of a viscous, incompressible fluid is considered in the regime
of low Reynolds numbers. The scattering series which appears in the mobility
problem is simplified. The simplification relies on the reduction of the number
of types of single-particle scattering operators appearing in the scattering
series. In our formulation there is only one type of single-particle scattering
operator.
