Explaining the well established observation that the expansion rate of the
universe is apparently accelerating is one of the defining scientific problems
of our age. Within the standard model of cosmology, the repulsive 'dark energy'
supposedly responsible has no explanation at a fundamental level, despite many
varied attempts. A further important dilemma in the standard model is the
Lithium problem, which is the substantial mismatch between the theoretical
prediction for 7-Li from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the value that we observe
today. This observation is one of the very few we have from along our past
worldline as opposed to our past lightcone. By releasing the untested
assumption that the universe is homogeneous on very large scales, both apparent
acceleration and the Lithium problem can be easily accounted for as different
aspects of cosmic inhomogeneity, without causing problems for other
cosmological phenomena such as the cosmic microwave background. We illustrate
this in the context of a void model.
