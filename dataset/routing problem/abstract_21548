We consider the inverse spectral problem for periodic Jacobi matrices in
terms of the vertical slits on the quasi-momentum domain plus the Dirichlet
eigenvalues, i.e., the Marchenko-Ostrovsky mapping. Moreover, we show that the
gradients of the Dirichlet eigenvalues and of the so-called norming constants
are linear independent.
