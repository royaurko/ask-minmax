We consider the problem of estimating a function $s$ on $[-1,1]^{k}$ for
large values of $k$ by looking for some best approximation by composite
functions of the form $g\circ u$. Our solution is based on model selection and
leads to a very general approach to solve this problem with respect to many
different types of functions $g,u$ and statistical frameworks. In particular,
we handle the problems of approximating $s$ by additive functions, single and
multiple index models, neural networks, mixtures of Gaussian densities (when
$s$ is a density) among other examples. We also investigate the situation where
$s=g\circ u$ for functions $g$ and $u$ belonging to possibly anisotropic
smoothness classes. In this case, our approach leads to a completely adaptive
estimator with respect to the regularity of $s$.
