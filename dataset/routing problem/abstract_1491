A concept of backward-wave bianisotropic composite medium matched to free
space is suggested. It is based on the use of a uniaxial bianisotropic
structure embedded into a matrix with negative effective permittivity. Since
bianisotropy is easier to achieve in the optical range than artificial
magnetism, this concept is prospective for optical backward-wave metamaterials.
As an example of possible realizations, a microwave Omega-composite combined
with a wire lattice is analytically studied.
