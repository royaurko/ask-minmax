A system of equations of the reaction-diffusion type is studied in the
framework of both the direct and the inverse prolongation structure. We find
that this system allows an incomplete prolongation Lie algebra, which is used
to find the spectral problem and a whole class of nonlinear field equations
containing the original ones as a special case.
