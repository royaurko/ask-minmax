Proper ferroelectricity in ABO3 perovskite oxides appears to be incompatible
with the presence of d electrons at the B-cation, a phenomenon which has been
dubbed the "d0 rule" and remains to be fully understood. Through
first-principles calculations of the LaBO3 series, where B is a d0 - d8 cation
from the 3d-block, we find that increasing the d orbital occupation initially
removes the tendency for a polar distortion. However, remarkably, for high spin
d5 - d7 and d8 cations a strong ferroelectric instability is recovered. This
effect is explained in terms of the reduced p - d energy gap to the right of
the 3d-block, and in terms of increased p - d vibronic coupling via the
sigma-bonded axial d eg orbitals. Possible routes to overcome the d0 rule are
discussed, particularly with regard to competing centrosymmetric distortions.
Finally, we demonstrate that if a magnetic ferroelectric phase can be
stabilized, for d5 - d7 B-cations a remarkably strong magnetoelectric coupling
exists via the multiferroic crossover effect, whereby switching the spin state
strongly affects the ferroelectric polarization, and potentially, manipulation
of the polarization with an externally applied electric field could induce a
spin state transition.
