The limiting resolution in optical interferometry is set by the number of
photons used, with the functional dependence determined by the state of light
that is prepared. We consider the problem of measuring the rotation of a beam
of light about an optical axis and show how the limiting resolution depends on
the total number of quanta of orbital angular momentum carried by the light
beam.
