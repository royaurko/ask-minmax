In a nongeometrical interpretation of gravity, the metric
$g_{\mu\nu}(x)=\eta_{\mu\nu}+\Phi_{\mu\nu}(x)$ is interpreted as an {\em
effective} metric, whereas $\Phi_{\mu\nu}(x)$ is interpreted as a fundamental
gravitational field, propagated in spacetime which is actually flat. Some
advantages and disadvantages of such an interpretation are discussed. The main
advantage is a natural resolution of the flatness problem.
