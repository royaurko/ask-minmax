We study the problem of existence of F-structures on compact complex
surfaces, giving a complete classification modulo the gap in the classification
of surfaces of class VII. We then use these results to study the minimal
entropy problem for compact complex surfaces. For instance we prove that
compact Kahler surfaces of Kodaira number different from 2 have minimal entropy
0, and such a surface admits a metric with entropy 0 if and only if it is the
complex projective space, a ruled surface of genus 0 or 1, a complex torus or a
hyperelliptic surface. The key result we use to prove this, is a new
topological obstruction to the existence of metrics with vanishing topological
entropy. Finally we show that these results fit perfectly into Wall's study of
geometric structures on compact complex surfaces.
