We discuss pedagogical problems associated with the conventional approach in
teaching relativity and the potential value of "Lorentzian route to relativity"
for addressing these pedagogical problems. We think that Lorentzian approach
may be valuable part of an introduction to relativity but the historical route
should be followed up to its end. It must namely include Einstein's application
of Occam's razor in reinterpreting Lorentz transformations kinematically and
the discussion of the central role of the evolution from Lorentz's "local time"
to relativity of simultaneity. We discuss also what Occam's razor is not and
why it should not cut "too deeply or too permanently". Some misleading remarks
in relativity text books concerning for example Kennedy Thorndike experiment
and Trouton-Noble experiment indicate the not uncommon lack of awareness about
the degree observational equivalence between prerelativistic (Lorentzian) and
relativistic viewpoints as far as special relativistic experiments are
considered.
