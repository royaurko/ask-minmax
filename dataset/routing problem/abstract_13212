In this paper we consider several facility location problems with
applications to cost and social welfare optimization, when the area map is
encoded as a binary (0,1) mxn matrix. We present algorithmic solutions for all
the problems. Some cases are too particular to be used in practical situations,
but they are at least a starting point for more generic solutions.
