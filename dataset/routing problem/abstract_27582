In 2013, Abo and Wan studied the analogue of Waring's problem for systems of
skew-symmetric forms and identified several defective systems. Of particular
interest is when a certain secant variety of a Segre-Grassmann variety is
expected to fill the natural ambient space, but is actually a hypersurface.
Algorithms implemented in Bertini are used to determine the degrees of several
of these hypersurfaces, and representation-theoretic descriptions of their
equations are given. We answer Problem 6.5 [Abo-Wan2013], and confirm their
speculation that each member of an infinite family of hypersurfaces is
minimally defined by a (known) determinantal equation. While led by numerical
evidence, we provide non-numerical proofs for all of our results.
