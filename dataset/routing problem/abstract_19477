Heterogenous cellular networks (HCN) introduce small cells within the
transmission range of a macrocell. For the efficient operation of HCNs it is
essential that the high power macrocell shuts off its transmissions for an
appropriate amount of time in order for the low power small cells to transmit.
This is a mechanism that allows time-domain resource partitioning (TDRP) and is
critical to be optimized for maximizing the throughput of the complete HCN. In
this paper, we investigate video communication in HCNs when TDRP is employed.
After defining a detailed system model for video streaming in such a HCN, we
consider the problem of maximizing the experienced video quality at all the
users, by jointly optimizing the TDRP for the HCN, the rate allocated to each
specific user, and the selected video quality transmitted to a user. The
NP-hard problem is solved with a primal-dual approximation algorithm that
decomposes the problem into simpler subproblems, making them amenable to fast
well-known solution algorithms. Consequently, the calculated solution can be
enforced in the time scale of real-life video streaming sessions. This last
observation motivates the enhancement of the proposed framework to support
video delivery with dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH). Our extensive
simulation results demonstrate clearly the need for our holistic approach for
improving the video quality and playback performance of the video streaming
users in HCNs.
