Input-output, growth-decay, production-consumption type situations abound in
many practical problems. When the input and output variables are independently
gamma distributed, various aspects of the residual effect are already tackled
by the contributor. Matrix-variate analogues, their connections to quadratic and
bilinear forms, matrix-variate Whittaker functions, and many properties of
such matrix-variate functions, in the real as well as complex case, are
discussed here.
