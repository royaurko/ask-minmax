The Press-Schechter(PS) formalism for the mass function of the collapsed
objects are reanalyzed. The factor of two in the Press-Schechter formalism is
argued to be correct in the sharp $k$-space filter even when we use the
another approach proposed by Jedamzik(1994) in the cloud-in-cloud problem,
which is different from the previous approach by Peacock & Heavens(1990) and
Bond et al.(1991). The spatial correlation of the density fluctuations,
however, had been neglected in the cloud-in-cloud problem. The effects of this
spatial correlation is analyzed by using the Jedamzik formalism and it is found
that this effect alter the PS mass function especially on larger mass scales.
Furthermore the exact formula of deriving mass function is shown. We also find
that the probability of the overlap of the collapsed objects can be neglected
on very small mass scales while it might not be neglected on other mass scales.
