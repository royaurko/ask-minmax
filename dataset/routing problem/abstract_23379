We point out that supersymmetric warped geometry can provide a solution to
the SUSY flavor problem, while generating hierarchical Yukawa couplings. In
supersymmetric theories in a slice of AdS_5 with the Kaluza-Klein scale M_KK
much higher than the weak scale, if all visible fields originate from 5D bulk
fields and supersymmetry breaking is mediated by the bulk radion superfield
and/or some brane chiral superfields, potentially dangerous soft scalar masses
and trilinear $A$ parameters at M_KK can be naturally suppressed compared to
the gaugino masses by small warp factor. We present simple models yielding
phenomenologically interesting patterns of soft parameters in this framework.
