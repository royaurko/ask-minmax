In a recent paper, Parikh and Boyd describe a method for solving a convex
optimization problem, where each iteration involves evaluating a proximal
operator and projection onto a subspace. In this paper we address the critical
practical issues of how to select the proximal parameter in each iteration, and
how to scale the original problem variables, so as the achieve reliable
practical performance. The resulting method has been implemented as an
open-source software package called POGS (Proximal Graph Solver), that targets
multi-core and GPU-based systems, and has been tested on a wide variety of
practical problems. Numerical results show that POGS can solve very large
problems (with, say, more than a billion coefficients in the data), to modest
accuracy in a few tens of seconds. As just one example, a radiation treatment
planning problem with around 100 million coefficients in the data can be solved
in a few seconds, as compared to around one hour with an interior-point method.
