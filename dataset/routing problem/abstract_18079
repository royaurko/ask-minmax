Mapping reads on references is a central task in numerous genomic studies.
Since references are mainly extracted from assembly graphs, it is of high
interest to map efficiently on such structures. In this work we formally define
this problem and provide a first theoretical and practical study toward this
direction when the graph is a de Bruijn Graph. We show that the problem is
NP-Complete and we propose simple and efficient heuristics with a prototype
implementation called BGREAT that handle real world instances of the problem
with moderate resources. It achieves to map millions reads per CPU hour on a
complex human de Bruijn graph. Results show that mapping on graphs enables to
map up to 22\% more reads than mapping on assembled sequences. BGREAT
