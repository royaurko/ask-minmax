We present an interval-based approach for parameter identification in
structural static inverse problems. The proposed inverse formulation exploits
the Interval Finite Element Method (IFEM) combined with adjoint-based
optimization. The inversion consists of a two-step algorithm: first, an
estimate of the parameters is obtained by means of a deterministic iterative
solver. Then, the algorithm switches to the interval extension of the previous
solver, using the deterministic estimate of the parameters as an initial guess.
The iterations are terminated based on a new containment-stopping criterion,
which is intrinsic to intervals. Various numerical examples show that the
proposed method provides guaranteed interval enclosures of the parameters.
