The Periodic Anderson Model (PAM) in the $U\to\infty$ limit has been studied
in a previous work employing the cumulant expansion with the hybridization as
perturbation (M. S. Figueira, M. E. Foglio and G. G. Martinez, Phys. Rev. B
\textbf{50}, 17933 (1994)). When the total number of electrons $N_{t}$ is
calculated as a function of the chemical potential $\mu$ in the ``Chain
Approximation'' (CHA), there are three values of the chemical potential $\mu$
for each $N_{t}$ in a small interval of $N_{t}$ at low $T$ (M. S Figueira, M. E
Foglio, Physica A 208 (1994)). We have recently introduced the ``X-boson''
method, inspired in the slave boson technique of Coleman, that solves the
problem of non conservation of probability (completeness) in the CHA as well as
removing the spurious phase transitions that appear with the slave boson method
in the mean field approximation. In the present paper we show that the X-boson
method solves also the problem of the multiple roots of $N_{t}(\mu)$ that
appear in the CHA.
