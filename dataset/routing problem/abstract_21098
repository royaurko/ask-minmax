We resolve a question of Bramson and Griffeath by showing that the expected
capture time of four independent Brownian predators pursuing one Brownian prey
on a line is finite. Our main tool is an eigenvalue estimate for a particular
spherical domain, which we obtain by a coning construction and domain
perturbation.
