We study the problem of computing all Pareto-optimal journeys in a public
transit network regarding the two criteria of arrival time and number of
transfers taken. We take a novel approach, focusing on trips and transfers
between them, allowing fine-grained modeling. Our experiments on the
metropolitan network of London show that the algorithm computes full 24-hour
profiles in 70 ms after a preprocessing phase of 30 s, allowing fast queries in
dynamic scenarios.
