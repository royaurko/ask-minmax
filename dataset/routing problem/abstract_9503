This monograph concerns linear and nonlinear Dirichlet problems involving
$L^1$ data and more generally measure data, based on Stampacchia's definition
of weak solution. We explain some of the main tools: linear regularity theory,
maximum principles, Kato's inequality, method of sub and supersolutions, and
the Perron method. The nonlinear Dirichlet problem need not have a solution for
every finite measure. We give characterizations of measures for which the
problem has a solution with polynomial and exponential nonlinearities in
connection with capacities and Hausdorff measures. Finally, we give a different
approach to study the concept of reduced measure introduced by Brezis, Marcus
and Ponce.
