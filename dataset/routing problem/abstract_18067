The $k$-set agreement problem is a generalization of the classical consensus
problem in which processes are permitted to output up to $k$ different input
values. In a system of $n$ processes, an $m$-obstruction-free solution to the
problem requires termination only in executions where the number of processes
taking steps is eventually bounded by $m$. This family of progress conditions
generalizes wait-freedom ($m=n$) and obstruction-freedom ($m=1$). In this
paper, we prove upper and lower bounds on the number of registers required to
solve $m$-obstruction-free $k$-set agreement, considering both one-shot and
repeated formulations. In particular, we show that repeated $k$ set agreement
can be solved using $n+2m-k$ registers and establish a nearly matching lower
bound of $n+m-k$.
