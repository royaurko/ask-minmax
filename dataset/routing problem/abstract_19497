We present the distribution of virial masses for nearby galaxy clusters, as
obtained from a data-set of 75 clusters, each having at least 20 galaxy members
with measured redshifts within 1 Abell radius. After having accounted for
problems of incompleteness of the data-set, we fitted a power-law to the
cluster mass distribution.
