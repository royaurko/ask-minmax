Our goal is to classify all generically transitive actions of commutative
unipotent groups on flag varieties up to conjugation. We establish relationship
between this problem and classification of multiplications with certain
properties on Lie algebra representations. Then we classify multiplications
with the desired properties and solve the initial classification problem.
