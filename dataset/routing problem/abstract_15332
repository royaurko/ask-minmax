Using data from a large laboratory experiment on problem solving in which we
varied the structure of 16-person networks we investigate how an organization's
network structure may be constructed to optimize performance in complex
problem-solving tasks. Problem solving involves both search for information and
search for theories to make sense of that information. We show that the effect
of network structure is opposite for these two equally important forms of
search. Dense clustering encourages members of a network to generate more
diverse information, but it also has the power to discourage the generation of
diverse theories: clustering promotes exploration in information space, but
decreases exploration in solution space. Previous research, tending to focus on
only one of those two spaces, had produced inconsistent conclusions about the
value of network clustering. By adopting an experimental platform on which
information was measured separately from solutions, we were able to reconcile
past contradictions and clarify the effects of network clustering on
performance. The finding both provides a sharper tool for structuring
organizations for knowledge work and reveals the challenges inherent in
manipulating network structure to enhance performance, as the communication
structure that helps one aspect of problem solving may harm the other.
