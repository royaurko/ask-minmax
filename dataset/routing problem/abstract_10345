Quantum steering refers to the possibility for Alice to remotely steer Bob's
state by performing local measurements on her half of a bipartite system. Two
necessary ingredients for steering are entanglement and incompatibility of
Alice's measurements. In particular, it has been recently proven that for the
case of pure states of maximal Schmidt rank the problem of steerability for
Bob's assemblage is equivalent to the problem of joint measurability for Alice
observables. We show that such an equivalence holds in general, namely, the
steerability of any assemblage can always be formulated as a joint
measurability problem, and vice versa. We use this connection to introduce
steering inequalities from joint measurability criteria and develop quantifiers
for the incompatibility of measurements.
