A group G is a vGBS group if it admits a decomposition as a finite graph of
groups with all edge and vertex groups finitely generated and free abelian. We
prove that the multiple conjugacy problem is solvable between two n-tuples A
and B of elements of G whenever the elements of A does not generate an elliptic
subgroup. When the edge and vertex groups are infinite cyclic, i.e. G is a
Generalized Baumslag-Solitar group, we prove that the multiple conjugacy
problem is fully solvable.
