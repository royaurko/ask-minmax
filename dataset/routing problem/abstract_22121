We examine periodic solutions to an initial boundary value problem for a
Liouville equation with sign-changing weight. A representation formula is
derived both for singular and nonsingular boundary data, including data arising
from fractional linear maps. In the case of singular boundary data we study the
effects the induced singularity has on the interior regularity of solutions.
Regularity criteria are also found for a generalized form of the equation.
