We consider the Cauchy problem for the Chern-Simons-Dirac system on
$\mathbb{R}^{1+1}$ with initial data in $H^s$. Almost optimal local
well-posedness is obtained. Moreover, we show that the solution is global in
time, provided that initial data for the spinor component has finite charge, or
$L^2$ norm.
