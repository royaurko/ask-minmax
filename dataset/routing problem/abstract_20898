A Gaussian elimination form of inverse iteration within the complex
coordinate approach is shown to produce a simple uniform method of finding both
real bound state energies and complex resonant state energies for several
problems which have been treated by a variety of methods in the literature. The
energy shift method for expectation values is shown to be a useful diagnostic
tool.
