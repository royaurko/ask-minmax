We study the Horn problem in the context of algebraic codes on a smooth
projective curve defined over a finite field, reducing the problem to the
representation theory of the special linear group $SL(2,F_q)$. We characterize
the coefficients that appear in the Kronecker product of symmetric functions in
terms of Gromov-Witten invariants of the Hilbert scheme of points in the plane.
In addition we classify all the algebraic codes defined over the rational
normal curve.
