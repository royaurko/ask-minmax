Mixed boundary value problems for the Navier-Stokes system in a polyhedral
domain are considered. Different boundary conditions (in particular, Dirichlet,
Neumann, slip conditions) are prescribed on the faces of a polyhedron. The
contributors obtain regularity results for weak solutions in weighted (and
non-weighted) L_p Sobolev and H\"older spaces.
