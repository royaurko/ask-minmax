In this paper, we consider Steiner forest and its generalizations,
prize-collecting Steiner forest and k-Steiner forest, when the vertices of the
input graph are points in the Euclidean plane and the lengths are Euclidean
distances. First, we present a simpler analysis of the polynomial-time
approximation scheme (PTAS) of Borradaile et al. [12] for the Euclidean Steiner
forest problem. This is done by proving a new structural property and modifying
the dynamic programming by adding a new piece of information to each dynamic
programming state. Next we develop a PTAS for a well-motivated case, i.e., the
multiplicative case, of prize-collecting and budgeted Steiner forest. The ideas
used in the algorithm may have applications in design of a broad class of
bicriteria PTASs. At the end, we demonstrate why PTASs for these problems can
be hard in the general Euclidean case (and thus for PTASs we cannot go beyond
the multiplicative case).
