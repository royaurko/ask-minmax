We study superparticle spectra in the superconformal flavor scenario with
non-universal gaugino masses. The non-universality of gaugino masses can lead
to the wino-like or higgsino-like neutralino LSP. Furthermore, it is shown that
the parameter space for the higgsino-like LSP includes the region where the
fine-tuning problem can be improved. The degeneracy of soft scalar masses
squared does not drastically change by taking ratios of gaugino masses of order
one. The degeneracy of scalar masses for squarks and left-handed sleptons would
be good to avoid the FCNC problem but that of right-handed slepton masses is
weak. However, the overall size of right-handed slepton masses become larger
when the bino becomes heavier. It is also pointed out that such region can be
realized, and thus, that would be favorable to avoid the FCNC problem for soft
scalar masses as well as A-terms.
