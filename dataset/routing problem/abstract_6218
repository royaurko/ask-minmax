We review some approaches to the quark-lepton mass problem. The ideas of
mass-protection and approximate chiral flavour symmetries as a framework for
resolving the mass hierarchy problem are presented. Dynamical calculations of
the top quark and Higgs particle masses, based on infra-red fixed points and
the so-called multiple point principle respectively, are discussed. We also
consider mass matrix texture and the neutrino mass puzzle.
