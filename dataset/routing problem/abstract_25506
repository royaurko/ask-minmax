The article addresses morphological approaches to design of modular systems.
The following methods are briefly described: (i) basic version of morphological
analysis (MA), (ii) modification of MA as method of closeness to ideal
point(s), (iii reducing of MA to linear programming, (iv) multiple choice
problem, (v) quadratic assignment problem, (vi) Pareto-based MA (i.e.,
revelation of Pareto-efficient solutions), (vii) Hierarchical Morphological
Multicriteria Design (HMMD) approach, and (viii) Hierarchical Morphological
Multicriteria Design (HMMD) approach based on fuzzy estimates. The
above-mentioned methods are illustrated by schemes, models, and illustrative
examples. An additional realistic example (design of GSM network) is presented
to illustrate main considered methods.
