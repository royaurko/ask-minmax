The Minimum Sum Coloring Problem (MSCP) is a generalization of the well-known
vertex coloring problem. Due to its theoretical and practical relevance, the
MSCP attracts increasing attention. The only existing review on the problem
dates back to 2004 and mainly covers the history of the MSCP and the
theoretical developments on specific graphs. In recent years, the field has
witnessed significant progresses on practical solution algorithms. The purpose
of this review is to provide a comprehensive inspection of the most recent and
representative MSCP algorithms. To be informative, we identify the general
framework followed by these algorithms and the key ingredients that make them
successful. By classifying the main search strategies and putting forward the
critical elements of the reviewed methods, we wish to encourage future
development of more powerful methods and motivate new applications.
