In this work we propose and study a three field mixed formulation for solving
the Stokes problem with Tresca-type non-linear boundary conditions. Two
Lagrange multipliers are used to enforce div(u)=0 constraint and to regularize
the energy functional. The resulting problem is discretised using "P1
bubble/P1-P1" finite elements. Error estimates are derived and several
numerical studies are achieved.
