Main problems of magnetic storm prediction and causes of low efficiency of
medium-term prognosis are discussed. It is supposed, that possible way of their
solving is searching for poor-investigated features of solar wind (for
instance, solar wind density behavior before storms). The necessity of
investigation not only severe storms and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), but
origin of moderate and weak storms is shown. Examples of successful
investigations in this direction are given.
