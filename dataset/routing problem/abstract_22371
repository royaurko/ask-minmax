The Douglas-Rachford algorithm is a simple yet effective method for solving
convex feasibility problems. However, if the underlying constraints are
inconsistent, then the convergence theory is incomplete. We provide convergence
results when one constraint is an affine subspace. As a consequence, we extend
a result by Spingarn from halfspaces to general closed convex sets admitting
least-squares solutions.
