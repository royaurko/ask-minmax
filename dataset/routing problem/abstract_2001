The polycrystalline Bi1-xHoxFeO3 (x=0, 0.05, 0.1) compounds were synthesized
by conventional solid-state route. Rietveld refinement reveals that all the
compounds were stabilized in rhombohedral structure with R3c (IUCr No. 161)
space group. A competing ferro and anti-ferro magnetic interaction was observed
in Ho-substituted compounds. A change in the Fe-O-Fe bond-angle and Fe-O bond
distance increase the Neel Transition temperature with increasing Ho
concentration. The appearance of peak in imaginary part of impedance (Z") for
each concentration and shifting of this peak with temperature towards higher
frequency side indicated that the presence of electric relaxations. Correlated
Barrier Hopping model (CBH) was employed to explain the frequency and
temperature dependence of ac conductivity and the mechanism of transport in the
material BFO and Ho substituted BFO. Density of states near Fermi level was
calculated by using the ac conductivity data.
