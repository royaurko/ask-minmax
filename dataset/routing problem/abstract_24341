In this paper we investigate the 2-Selmer rank in families of quadratic
twists of elliptic curves over arbitrary number fields. We give sufficient
conditions on an elliptic curve so that it has twists of arbitrary 2-Selmer
rank, and we give lower bounds for the number of twists (with bounded
conductor) that have a given 2-Selmer rank. As a consequence, under appropriate
hypotheses we can find many twists with trivial Mordell-Weil group, and
(assuming the Shafarevich-Tate conjecture) many others with infinite cyclic
Mordell-Weil group. Using work of Poonen and Shlapentokh, it follows from our
results that if the Shafarevich-Tate conjecture holds, then Hilbert's Tenth
Problem has a negative answer over the ring of integers of every number field.
