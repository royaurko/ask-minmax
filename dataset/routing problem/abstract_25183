We analyze spectral graph theory based image segmentation algorithms and show
there is a natural connection with edge preserving filtering. Based on this
connection we show that the normalized cut algorithm is equivalent to repeated
application of bilateral filtering. Then, using this interpretation we present
and implement a fast normalized cut algorithm. Experiments show that our
implementation can solve the original optimization problem with a 10x-100x
speedup. Furthermore, we show this connection makes possible a new model for
segmentation called conditioned normalized cut that easily incorporates image
patches in color and demonstrate how this problem can be solved with edge
preserving filtering.
