These notes are intended to be an introduction to the use of approximately
holomorphic techniques in almost contact and contact geometry. We develop the
setup of the approximately holomorphic geometry. Once done, we sketch the
existence of the two main geometric decompositions available for an almost
contact or contact manifold: open books and Lefschetz pencils. The use of the
two decompositions for the problem of existence of contact structures is
mentioned.
