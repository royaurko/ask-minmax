In this paper we offer an alternate route for investigating soliton solutions
in hydrogen-bonded chains. This is done by examining a class of systems of two
coupled real scalar fields. We show that this route allows investigating
several models for hydrogen-bonded chains in a unified manner. We also show how
to investigate interesting issues, in particular the one concerning classical
or linear stability of solitonic solutions.
