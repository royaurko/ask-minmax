The problem about a body in a three dimensional infinite channel is
considered in the framework of the theory of linear water-waves. The body has a
rough surface characterized by a small parameter $\epsilon>0$ while the
distance of the body to the water surface is also of order $\epsilon$. Under a
certain symmetry assumption, the accumulation effect for trapped mode
frequencies is established, namely, it is proved that, for any given $d>0$ and
integer $N>0$, there exists $\epsilon(d,N)>0$ such that the problem has at
least $N$ eigenvalues in the interval $(0,d)$ of the continuous spectrum in the
case $\epsilon\in(0,\epsilon(d,N)) $. The corresponding eigenfunctions decay
exponentially at infinity, have finite energy, and imply trapped modes.
