In this paper we examine the existence of bicomplexied inverse
Laplacetransform as an extension of its complexied inverse version within
theregion of convergence of bicomplex Laplace transform. In this course weuse
the idempotent representation of bicomplex-valued functions as pro-jections on
the auxiliary complex spaces of the components of bicomplexnumbers along two
orthogonal,idempotent hyperbolic directions.
