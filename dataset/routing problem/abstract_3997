We review some aspects of recurrence in topological dynamics and focus on two
open problems. The first is an old one concerning the relation between Poincare
and Birkhoff recurrence; the second, due to Boshernitzan, is about moving
recurrence. We provide a partial answer to a topological version of the moving
recurrence problem.
