In this paper, we show that the problem of determining whether one player can
force a win in a multiplayer version of the children's card game War is
PSPACE-hard. The same reduction shows that a related problem, asking whether a
player can survive k rounds, is PSPACE-complete when k is polynomial in the
size of the input.
