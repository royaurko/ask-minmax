We study the Banach algebras of bounded holomorphic functions on the unit
disk whose boundary values, having, in a sense, the weakest possible
discontinuities, belong to the algebra of semi-almost periodic functions on the
unit circle. The latter algebra contains as a special case an algebra
introduced by Sarason in connection with some problems in the theory of
Toeplitz operators.
