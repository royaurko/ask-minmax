We analyze the rectified motion of a Brownian particle in a confined
environment. We show the emergence of strong cooperativity between the inherent
rectification of the ratchet mechanism and the entropic bias of the
fluctuations caused by spatial confinement. Net particle transport may develop
even in situations where separately the ratchet and the geometric restrictions
do not give rise to particle motion. The combined rectification effects can
lead to bidirectional transport depending on particle size, resulting in a new
route for segregation. The reported mechanism can be used to control transport
in mesostructures and nanodevices in which particles move in a reduced space.
