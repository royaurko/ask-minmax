We present the problem of finding comparable researchers for any given
researcher. This problem has many motivations. Firstly, know thyself. The
answers of where we stand among research community and who we are most alike
may not be easily found by existing evaluations of ones' research mainly based
on citation counts. Secondly, there are many situations where one needs to find
comparable researchers e.g., for reviewing peers, constructing programming
committees or compiling teams for grants. It is often done through an ad hoc
and informal basis. Utilizing the large scale scholarly data accessible on the
web, we address the problem of automatically finding comparable researchers. We
propose a standard to quantify the quality of research output, via the quality
of publishing venues. We represent a researcher as a sequence of her
publication records, and develop a framework of comparison of researchers by
sequence matching. Several variations of comparisons are considered including
matching by quality of publication venue and research topics, and performing
prefix matching. We evaluate our methods on a large corpus and demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methods through examples. In the end, we identify several
promising directions for further work.
