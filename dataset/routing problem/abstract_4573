The integration of fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic into scheduling is a
rather new aspect with growing importance for manufacturing applications,
resulting in various unsolved aspects. In the current paper, we investigate an
improved local search technique for fuzzy scheduling problems with fitness
plateaus, using a multi criteria formulation of the problem. We especially
address the problem of changing job priorities over time as studied at the
Sherwood Press Ltd, a Nottingham based printing company, who is a collaborator
on the project.
