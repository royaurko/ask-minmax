In an unpublished paper by Richard Montgomery, the contributor claimed to prove
the existence of shape space Figure-$8$ solutions of the Newtonian three body
problem with two equal masses (they look like a figure $8$'s in the shape
space, that is different from the famous Figure-$8$ solution proved by
Chenciner and Montgomery). However there is an error in the proof and the
problem is still open. In this paper, based on a new local deformation result,
we prove the existence of such solutions in weak force potential, $1<\alpha <2$
and in Newtonian potential under an extra condition.
  This result can be seen as a small step in the program of realizing (reduced)
syzygy sequences in the three body problem that were proposed by Montgomery.
