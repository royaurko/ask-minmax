The infra-red attractive force of the bulk gauge interactions is applied to
soften the supersymmetric flavor problem in the orbifold SU(5) GUT of Kawamura.
Then this force aligns in the infra-red regime the soft supersymmetry breaking
terms out of their anarchical disorder at a fundamental scale, in such a way
that flavor-changing neutral currents as well as dangerous CP-violating phases
are suppressed at low energies. It is found that this dynamical alignment is
sufficiently good compared with the current experimental bounds, as long as the
diagonalization matrices of the Yukawa couplings are CKM-like.
