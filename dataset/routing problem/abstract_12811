We discuss a new solution, admitting the existence of dS_{4} branes, in
five-dimensional Brans-Dicke theory. It is shown that, due to a special form of
a bulk scalar field potential, for certain values of the model parameters the
effective cosmological constant can be made small on the brane, where the
hierarchy problem of gravitational interaction is solved. We also discuss new
stabilization mechanism which is based on the use of auxiliary fields.
