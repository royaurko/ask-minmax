In this paper we study the nonlinear Dirichlet problem involving
p(x)-Laplacian (hemivariational inequality) with nonsmooth potential. By using
nonsmooth critical point theory for locally Lipschitz functionals due to Chang
and the properties of variational Sobolev spaces, we establish conditions which
ensure the existence of solution for our problem.
