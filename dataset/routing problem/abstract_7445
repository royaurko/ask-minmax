This review is dedicated to some recent results on Weyl theory, inverse
problems, evolution of the Weyl functions and applications to integrable wave
equations in a semistrip and quarter-plane. For overdetermined initial-boundary
value problems, we consider some approaches, which help to reduce the number of
the initial-boundary conditions. The interconnections between dynamical and
spectral Dirac systems, between response and Weyl functions are studied as
well.
