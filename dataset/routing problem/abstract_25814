Let $A$ be an algebra of bounded smooth functions on the interior of a
compact set in the plane. We study the following problem: if
$f,f_1,\dots,f_n\in A$ satisfy $|f|\leq \sum_{j=1}^n |f_j|$, does there exist
$g_j\in A$ and a constant $N\in\N$ such that $f^N=\sum_{j=1}^n g_j f_j$? A
prominent role in our proofs is played by a new space, $C_{\dbar, 1}(K)$, which
we call the algebra of $\dbar$-smooth functions.
  In the case $n=1$, a complete solution is given for the algebras $A^m(K)$ of
functions holomorphic in $K^\circ$ and whose first $m$-derivatives extend
continuously to $\ov{K^\circ}$. This necessitates the introduction of a special
class of compacta, the so-called locally L-connected sets.
  We also present another constructive proof of the Nullstellensatz for $A(K)$,
that is only based on elementary $\dbar$-calculus and Wolff's method.
