The set of common numerical and analytical problems is introduced in the form
of the generalized multidimensional discrete Poisson equation. It is shown that
its solutions with square-summable discrete derivatives are unique up to a
constant. The proof uses the Fourier transform as the main tool. The necessary
condition for the existence of the solution is provided.
