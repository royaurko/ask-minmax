We answer a long-standing open question by proving in ordinary set theory,
ZFC, that the Kaplansky test problems have negative answers for
aleph_1-separable abelian groups of cardinality aleph_1. In fact, there is an
aleph_1-separable abelian group M such that M is isomorphic to M oplus M oplus
M but not to M oplus M .
