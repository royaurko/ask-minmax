Wireless Sensors Networks (WSNs) have a big application in heterogeneous
networks. In this paper, we propose and evaluate Advanced Low-Energy Adaptive
Clustering Hierarchy (Ad-LEACH) which is static clustering based heterogeneous
routing protocol. The complete network field is first divided into static
clusters and then in each cluster separate Ad-LEACH protocol is applied. Our
proposed protocol is inherited from LEACH with a cluster head selection
criteria of Distributed Energy-Efficient Clustering (DEEC). This enables
Ad-LEACH to cope with the heterogeneous nature of nodes. Due to small static
clusters, each node reduces its broadcast message power because it only has to
cover a small area. We perform simulations in MATLAB to check the efficiency of
Ad-LEACH. The Simulation results show that Ad-LEACH outperforms LEACH and DEEC
in energy efficiency as well as throughput.
