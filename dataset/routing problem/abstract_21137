In this paper a concentration inequality is proved for the deviation in the
ergodic theorem in the case of discrete time observations of diffusion
processes. The proof is based on the geometric ergodicity property for
diffusion processes. As an application we consider the nonparametric pointwise
estimation problem for the drift coefficient under discrete time observations.
