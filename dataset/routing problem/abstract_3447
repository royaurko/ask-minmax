Initial boundary value problem on a half-line for the Modified KdV equation
is considered with the boundary conditions equal to zero at the origin and
initial condition chosen arbitrary decreasing rapidly enough and this problem
is plunged into the scheme of the inverse scattering method. Here the inverse
scattering problem is reduced to the Riemann problem on a system of rays on the
complex plane.
