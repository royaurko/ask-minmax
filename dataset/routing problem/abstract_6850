To explore possibilities of avoiding coincidence problem in $f(R)$ gravity we
consider models in Einstein conformal frame which are equivalent to Einstein
gravity with a minimally coupled scalar field. As the conformal factor
determines the coupling term and hence the interaction between matter and dark
energy, the function $f(R)$ can in principle be determined by choosing an
appropriate function for the deceleration parameter only. Possible behavior of
$f(R)$ to avoid coincidence problem are investigated in two such cases.
