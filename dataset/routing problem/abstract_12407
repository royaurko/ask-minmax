A multi-dimensional extension of the structural default model with firms'
values driven by diffusion processes with Marshall-Olkin-inspired correlation
structure is presented. Semi-analytical methods for solving the forward
calibration problem and backward pricing problem in three dimensions are
developed. The model is used to analyze bilateral counterparty risk for credit
default swaps and evaluate the corresponding credit and debt value adjustments.
