Is it true that the left and the right uniformities on a topological group
coincide as soon as every left uniformly continuous real valued function is
right uniformly continuous? This question is known as Itzkowitz's problem, and
it is still open. We show that the generalization of the problem to homogeneous
factor-spaces of topological groups has a negative answer.
