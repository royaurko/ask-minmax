The eigenvalue problem for 3x3 octonionic Hermitian matrices contains some
surprises, which we have reported elsewhere. In particular, the eigenvalues
need not be real, there are 6 rather than 3 real eigenvalues, and the
corresponding eigenvectors are not orthogonal in the usual sense. The
nonassociativity of the octonions makes computations tricky, and all of these
results were first obtained via brute force (but exact) Mathematica
computations. Some of them, such as the computation of real eigenvalues, have
subsequently been implemented more elegantly; others have not. We describe here
the use of Mathematica in analyzing this problem, and in particular its use in
proving a generalized orthogonality property for which no other proof is known.
