We construct a complete set of quasi-local integrals of motion for the
many-body localized phase of interacting fermions in a disordered potential.
The integrals of motion can be chosen to have binary spectrum $\{0,1\}$, thus
constituting exact quasiparticle occupation number operators for the Fermi
insulator. We map the problem onto a non-Hermitian hopping problem on a lattice
in operator space. We show how the integrals of motion can be built, under
certain approximations, as a convergent series in the interaction strength. An
estimate of its radius of convergence is given, which also provides an estimate
for the many-body localization-delocalization transition. Finally, we discuss
how the properties of the operator expansion for the integrals of motion imply
the presence or absence of a finite temperature transition.
