The revenue maximization problem of service provider is considered and
different pricing schemes to solve the above problem are implemented. The
service provider can choose an apt pricing scheme subjected to limited
resources, if he knows the utility function and identity of the user. The
complete price differentiation can achieve a large revenue gain but has high
implementation complexity. The partial price differentiation scheme to overcome
the high implementational complexity of complete price differentiation scheme
is also studied. A polynomial- time algorithm is designed for partial price
differentiation scheme that can compute the optimal partial differentiation
prices. The willingness of the users to pay is also considered while designing
price differentiation schemes.
