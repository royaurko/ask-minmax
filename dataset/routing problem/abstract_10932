In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. E 57, p. 1550 (1998)] we demonstrated that the
symmetries of the evolution equation and the target state have a profound
effect on the selection of the admissible control parameters. In the present
paper we extend these results to the case of time-periodic target states and
inexact symmetries. We also argue that the problem of phase space
reconstruction is affected by the presence of symmetries similarly to the
control problem.
