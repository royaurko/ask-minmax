A problem of the definition of the heat transported in thermomagnetic
phenomena has been well realized in the late sixties, but not solved up to
date. Ignoring this problem, numerous recent theories grossly overestimate the
thermomagnetic coefficients in strongly interacting systems. Here we develop a
gauge-invariant microscopic approach, which shows that the heat transfer should
include the energy of the interaction between electrons and a magnetic field.
We also demonstrate that the surface currents induced by the magnetic field
transfer the charge in the Nernst effect, but do not transfer the heat in the
Ettingshausen effect. Only with these two modifications of the theory, the
physically measurable thermomagnetic coefficients satisfy the Onsager relation.
We critically revised the Gaussian fluctuation model above the superconducting
transition and show that the gauge invariance uniquely relates thermomagnetic
phenomena in the Fermi liquid with the particle-hole asymmetry.
