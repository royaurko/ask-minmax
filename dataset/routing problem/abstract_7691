The 3:1 mean-motion resonance of the planar elliptic restricted three body
problem (Sun-Jupiter-asteroid) is considered. The double numeric averaging is
used to obtain the evolutionary equations which describe the long-term behavior
of the asteroid's argument of pericentre and eccentricity. The existence of the
adiabatic chaos area in the system's phase space is shown.
