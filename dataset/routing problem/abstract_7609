It has long been known that cylindrical algebraic decompositions (CADs) can
in theory be used for robot motion planning. However, in practice even the
simplest examples can be too complicated to tackle. We consider in detail a
"Piano Mover's Problem" which considers moving an infinitesimally thin piano
(or ladder) through a right-angled corridor.
  Producing a CAD for the original formulation of this problem is still
infeasible after 25 years of improvements in both CAD theory and computer
hardware. We review some alternative formulations in the literature which use
differing levels of geometric analysis before input to a CAD algorithm. Simpler
formulations allow CAD to easily address the question of the existence of a
path. We provide a new formulation for which both a CAD can be constructed and
from which an actual path could be determined if one exists, and analyse the
CADs produced using this approach for variations of the problem.
  This emphasises the importance of the precise formulation of such problems
for CAD. We analyse the formulations and their CADs considering a variety of
heuristics and general criteria, leading to conclusions about tackling other
problems of this form.
