Spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency are two critical issues in
designing wireless networks. Through dynamic spectrum access, cognitive radios
can improve the spectrum efficiency and capacity of wireless networks. On the
other hand, radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting has emerged as a promising
technique to supply energy to wireless networks and thereby increase their
energy efficiency. Therefore, to achieve both spectrum and energy efficiencies,
the secondary users in a cognitive radio network (CRN) can be equipped with the
RF energy harvesting capability and such a network can be referred to as an
RF-powered cognitive radio network. In this article, we provide an overview of
the RF-powered CRNs and discuss the challenges that arise for dynamic spectrum
access in these networks. Focusing on the tradeoff among spectrum sensing, data
transmission, and RF energy harvesting, then we discuss the dynamic channel
selection problem in a multi-channel RF-powered CRN. In the RF-powered CRN, a
secondary user can adaptively select a channel to transmit data when the
channel is not occupied by any primary user. Alternatively, the secondary user
can harvest RF energy for data transmission if the channel is occupied. The
optimal channel selection policy of the secondary user can be obtained by
formulating a Markov decision process (MDP) problem. We present some numerical
results obtained by solving this MDP problem.
