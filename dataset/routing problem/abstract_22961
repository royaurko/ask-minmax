In this paper consistency problems for multi-factor jump-diffusion models,
where the jump parts follow multivariate point processes are examined. First
the gap between jump-diffusion models and generalized Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM)
models is bridged. By applying the drift condition for a generalized
arbitrage-free HJM model, the consistency condition for jump-diffusion models
is derived. Then we consider a case in which the forward rate curve has a
separable structure, and obtain a specific version of the general consistency
condition. In particular, a necessary and sufficient condition for a
jump-diffusion model to be affine is provided. Finally the Nelson-Siegel type
of forward curve structures is discussed. It is demonstrated that under
regularity condition, there exists no jump-diffusion model consistent with the
Nelson-Siegel curves.
