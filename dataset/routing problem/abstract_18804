Reversible jump MCMC (RJ-MCMC) sampling techniques, which allow to jointly
tackle model selection and parameter estimation problems in a coherent Bayesian
framework, have become increasingly popular in the signal processing literature
since the seminal paper of Andrieu and Doucet (IEEE Trans. Signal Process.,
47(10), 1999). Crucial to the implementation of any RJ-MCMC sampler is the
computation of the so-called Metropolis-Hastings-Green (MHG) ratio, which
determines the acceptance probability for the proposed moves.
  It turns out that the expression of the MHG ratio that was given in the paper
of Andrieu and Doucet for "Birth-or-Death" moves---the simplest kind of
trans-dimensional move, used in virtually all applications of RJ-MCMC to signal
decomposition problems---was erroneous. Unfortunately, this mistake has been
reproduced in many subsequent papers dealing with RJ-MCMC sampling in the
signal processing literature.
  This note discusses the computation of the MHG ratio, with a focus on the
case where the proposal kernel can be decomposed as a mixture of simpler
kernels, for which the MHG ratio is easy to compute. We provide sufficient
conditions under which the MHG ratio of the mixture can be deduced from the MHG
ratios of the elementary kernels of which it is composed. As an application, we
consider the case of Birth-or-Death moves, and provide a corrected expression
for the erroneous ratio in the paper of Andrieu and Doucet.
