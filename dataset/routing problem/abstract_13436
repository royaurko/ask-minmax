This paper addresses the problem of mapping natural language sentences to
lambda-calculus encodings of their meaning. We describe a learning algorithm
that takes as input a training set of sentences labeled with expressions in the
lambda calculus. The algorithm induces a grammar for the problem, along with a
log-linear model that represents a distribution over syntactic and semantic
analyses conditioned on the input sentence. We apply the method to the task of
learning natural language interfaces to databases and show that the learned
parsers outperform previous methods in two benchmark database domains.
