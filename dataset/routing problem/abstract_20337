The B\"{a}cklund transformations between the constrained dispersionless KP
hierarchy (cdKPH) and the constrained dispersionless mKP hieararchy (cdmKPH)
and between the dispersionless KP hieararchy with self-consistent sources
(dKPHSCS) and the dispersionless mKP hieararchy with self-consistent sources
(dmKPHSCS) are constructed. The auto-B\"{a}cklund transformations for the
cdmKPH and for the dmKPHSCS are also formulated.
