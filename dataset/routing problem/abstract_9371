We introduce and analyze a natural algorithm for multi-venue exploration from
censored data, which is motivated by the Dark Pool Problem of modern
quantitative finance. We prove that our algorithm converges in polynomial time
to a near-optimal allocation policy; prior results for similar problems in
stochastic inventory control guaranteed only asymptotic convergence and
examined variants in which each venue could be treated independently. Our
analysis bears a strong resemblance to that of efficient exploration/
exploitation schemes in the reinforcement learning literature. We describe an
extensive experimental evaluation of our algorithm on the Dark Pool Problem
using real trading data.
