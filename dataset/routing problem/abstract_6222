Although the cosmological constant has primarily cosmological consequences,
its smallness poses one of the basic problems in particle physics. Various
attempts have been made to explain this mystery, but no satisfactory solution
has been found yet. The appearance of extra dimensions in the framework of
brane world systems seems to provide some new ideas to address this problem
form a different point of view. We shall discuss some of these new approaches
and see whether or not they lead to an improvement of the situation. We shall
conclude that we are still far from a solution of the problem.
