The three-dimensional equations for the compressible flow of liquid crystals
are considered. An initial-boundary value problem is studied in a bounded
domain with large data. The existence and large-time behavior of a global weak
solution are established through a three-level approximation, energy estimates,
and weak convergence for the adiabatic exponent $\gamma>\frac32$.
