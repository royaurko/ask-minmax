This paper presents the current possible applications of Dynamical Systems in
Engineering. The applications of chaos, fractals have proven to be an exciting
and fruitful endeavor. These applications are highly diverse ranging over such
fields as Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering. Dynamical Systems
theory describes general patterns found in the solution of systems of nonlinear
equations. The theory focuses upon those equations representing the change of
processes in time. This paper offers the issue of applying dynamical systems
methods to a wider circle of Engineering problems. There are three components
to our approach: ongoing and possible applications of Fractals, Chaos Theory
and Dynamical Systems. Some basic and useful computer simulation of Dynamical
System related problems have been shown also.
