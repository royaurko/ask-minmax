The paper addresses the problem of locating sensors with a circular field of
view so that a given line segment is under full surveillance, which is termed
as the Disc Covering Problem on a Line. The cost of each sensor includes a
fixed component, and a variable component that is proportional to the
field-of-view area. When only one type of sensor or, in general, one type of
disc, is available, then a simple polynomial algorithm solves the problem. When
there are different types of sensors in terms of fixed and variable costs, the
problem becomes NP-hard. A branch-and-bound algorithm as well as an efficient
heuristic are developed. The heuristic very often obtains the optimal solution
as shown in extensive computational testing.
