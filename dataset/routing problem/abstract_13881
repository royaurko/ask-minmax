This paper investigates the computational complexity of deciding whether the
vertices of a graph can be partitioned into a disjoint union of cliques and a
triangle-free subgraph. This problem is known to be $\NP$-complete on arbitrary
graphs. We show that this problem remains $\NP$-complete even when restricted
to planar graphs and perfect graphs.
