We address the long-standing problem of computing the region of attraction
(ROA) of a target set (e.g., a neighborhood of an equilibrium point) of a
controlled nonlinear system with polynomial dynamics and semialgebraic state
and input constraints. We show that the ROA can be computed by solving an
infinite-dimensional convex linear programming (LP) problem over the space of
measures. In turn, this problem can be solved approximately via a classical
converging hierarchy of convex finite-dimensional linear matrix inequalities
(LMIs). Our approach is genuinely primal in the sense that convexity of the
problem of computing the ROA is an outcome of optimizing directly over system
trajectories. The dual infinite-dimensional LP on nonnegative continuous
functions (approximated by polynomial sum-of-squares) allows us to generate a
hierarchy of semialgebraic outer approximations of the ROA at the price of
solving a sequence of LMI problems with asymptotically vanishing conservatism.
This sharply contrasts with the existing literature which follows an
exclusively dual Lyapunov approach yielding either nonconvex bilinear matrix
inequalities or conservative LMI conditions. The approach is simple and readily
applicable as the outer approximations are the outcome of a single semidefinite
program with no additional data required besides the problem description.
