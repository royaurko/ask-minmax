Our main goal is to describe the integral kernel of the dbar-Neumann operator
on certain non-smooth domains, the so-called Henkin-Leiterer domains. We do so
by explicitly constructing an integral kernel which accounts for the main
mapping properties of the operator. We use our calculations to derive $L^p$
estimates.
