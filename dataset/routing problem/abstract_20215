A distinguished variety is a variety that exits the bidisk through the
distinguished boundary. We show that Ando's inequality for commuting matrix
contractions can be sharpened to looking at the maximum modulus on a
distinguished variety, not the whole bidisk. We show that uniqueness sets for
extremal Pick problems on the bidisk always contain a distinguished variety.
