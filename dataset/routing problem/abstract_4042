We discuss the frequent pattern mining problem in a general setting. From an
analysis of abstract representations, summarization and frequent pattern
mining, we arrive at a generalization of the problem. Then, we show how the
problem can be cast into the powerful language of algorithmic information
theory. This allows us to formulate a simple algorithm to mine for all frequent
patterns.
