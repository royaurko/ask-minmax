In this brief presentation, we would like to present our attempts of
detecting chirality and mutations from Chern-Simons gauge theory. The results
show that the generalised knot invariants, obtained from Chern-Simons gauge
theory, are more powerful than Jones, HOMFLYPT and Kauffman polynomials.
However the classification problem of knots and links is still an open
challenging problem.
