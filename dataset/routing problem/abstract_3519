This is a first attempt to organize a list of some open problems on three
closely related topics: (i) The limiting behavior of single and multiple
ergodic averages, (ii) Single and multiple recurrence properties of measure
preserving systems, and (iii) Universal patterns, meaning, patterns that can be
found in every set of integers with positive upper density, and related
problems on higher dimensions. The list of problems is greatly influenced by my
personal interests and is by no means meant to be a comprehensive list of open
problems in the area widely known as ergodic Ramsey theory.
