In the 60's, Knuth introduced stack-sorting and serial compositions of
stacks. In particular, one significant question arise out of the work of Knuth:
how to decide efficiently if a given permutation is sortable with 2 stacks in
series? Whether this problem is polynomial or NP-complete is still unanswered
yet. In this article we introduce 2-stack pushall permutations which form a
subclass of 2-stack sortable permutations and show that these two classes are
closely related. Moreover, we give an optimal O(n^2) algorithm to decide if a
given permutation of size n is 2-stack pushall sortable and describe all its
sortings. This result is a step to the solve the general 2-stack sorting
problem in polynomial time.
