In minimal trinification models light neutrino masses can be generated via a
radiative see-saw mechanism, where the masses of the right-handed neutrinos
originate from loops involving Higgs and fermion fields at the unification
scale. This mechanism is absent in models aiming at solving or ameliorating the
hierarchy problem, such as low-energy supersymmetry, since the large
seesaw-scale disappears. In this case, neutrino masses need to be generated via
a TeV-scale mechanism. In this paper, we investigate an inverse seesaw
mechanism and discuss some phenomenological consequences.
