The naturalness criterion applied to the cosmological constant implies a
new-physics threshold at 10^-3 eV. Either the naturalness criterion fails, or
this threshold does not influence particle dynamics at higher energies. It has
been suggested that the Higgs naturalness problem may follow the same fate. We
investigate this possibility and, abandoning the hierarchy problem, we use
unification and dark matter as the only guiding principles. The model recently
proposed by Arkani-Hamed and Dimopoulos emerges as a very interesting option.
We study it in detail, analysing its structure, and the conditions for
obtaining unification and dark matter.
