The dynamics of a folded protein is studied in water and glycerol at a series
of temperatures below and above their respective dynamical transition. The
system is modeled in two distinct states whereby the protein is decoupled from
the bulk solvent at low temperatures, and communicates with it through a
vicinal layer at physiological temperatures. A linear viscoelastic model
elucidates the less-than-expected increase in the relaxation times observed in
the backbone dynamics of the protein. The model further explains the increase
in the flexibility of the protein once the transition takes place and the
differences in the flexibility under the different solvent environments.
Coupling between the vicinal layer and the protein fluctuations is necessary to
interpret these observations. The vicinal layer is postulated to form once a
threshold for the volumetric fluctuations in the protein to accommodate
solvents of different sizes is reached. Compensation of entropic-energetic
contributions from the protein-coupled vicinal layer quantifies the scaling of
the dynamical transition temperatures in various solvents. The protein adapts
different conformational routes for organizing the required coupling to a
specific solvent, which is achieved by adjusting the amount of conformational
jumps in the surface-group dihedrals.
