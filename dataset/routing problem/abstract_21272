In this note we reduce the problem of geodesic connectedness in a wide class
of G\"odel type spacetimes to the search of critical points of a functional
naturally involved in the study of geodesics in standard static spacetimes.
Then, by using some known accurate results on the latter, we improve previous
results on the former.
