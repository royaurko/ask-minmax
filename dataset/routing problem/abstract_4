Two-way relaying is a promising technique to improve network throughput.
However, how to apply it to a wireless network remains an unresolved issue.
Particularly, challenges lie in the joint design between the physical layer and
the routing protocol. Applying an existing routing protocol to a two-way relay
network can easily compromise the advantages of two-way relaying. Considering
routing path selection and two-way relaying together can be formulated as a
network optimization problem, but it is usually NP-hard. In this paper, we take
a different approach to study routing path selection for two-way relay
networks. Instead of solving the joint optimization problem, we study the
fundamental characteristics of a routing path consisting of multihop two-way
relaying nodes. Information theoretical analysis is carried out to derive
bandwidth efficiency and energy efficiency of a routing path in a two-way relay
network. Such analysis provides a framework of routing path selection by
considering bandwidth efficiency, energy efficiency and latency subject to
physical layer constraints such as the transmission rate, transmission power,
path loss exponent, path length, and the number of relays. This framework
provides insightful guidelines on routing protocol design of a two-way relay
network. Our analytical framework and insights are illustrated by extensive
numerical results.
