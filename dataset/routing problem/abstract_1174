We discuss the degeneration limits of d=4 superconformal indices that relate
Seiberg duality for the d=4 N=1 SQCD theory to Aharony and Giveon-Kutasov
dualities for d=3 N=2 SQCD theories. On a mathematical level we argue that this
3d/4d connection entails a new set of non-standard degeneration identities
between hyperbolic hypergeometric integrals. On a physical level we propose
that such degeneration formulae provide a new route to the still illusive
Seiberg dualities for d=3 N=2 SQCD theories with SU(N) gauge group.
