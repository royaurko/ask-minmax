Human mobility patterns are complex and distinct from one person to another.
Nevertheless, motivated by tremendous potential benefits of modeling such
patterns in enabling new mobile services and technologies, researchers have
attempted to capture salient characteristics of human mobility. In this short
survey paper, we review some of the major techniques for modeling humans'
co-location, as well as predicting human location and trajectory. Further, we
review one of the most important application areas of such models, namely,
routing in delay-tolerant networks.
