"How much c.e. sets could cover a given set?" in this paper we are going to
answer this question. Also, in this approach some old concepts come into a new
arrangement. The major goal of this article is to introduce an appropriate
definition for this purpose. Introduction In Computability Theory (Recursion
Theory) in the first step we wish to recognize the sets which could be
enumerated by Turing machines (equivalently, algorithms) and in the next step
we will compare these sets by some reasonable order (Like Turing degree). Also
sometimes with some extra information (Oracles) a class of non c.e. sets show
the same behavior as c.e. sets (Post hierarchy and related theorems). Here we
try another approach: "Let A be an arbitrary set and we wish to recognize how
much this set might be covered by a c.e. set?" Although in some sense this
approach could be seen in some definitions of Recursion Theory, but at the best
of our knowledge it didn't considered as an approach yet, even though it is
able to shed a light on some subjects of Computability of sets. Defining this
approach is not quite straightforward and there are some obstacles to define
them. To overcome these difficulties we modify the definitions. We have an
alternative problem here when we consider recursive sets and not c.e. sets. In
this case, the problem would be: "Let A be an arbitrary set and we wish to know
that how much this set might be covered by a recursive Set?" Here, we try the
first definition and the first problem.
