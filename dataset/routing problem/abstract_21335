I give a brief overview of the resolution of the apparent problem of
reconciling time symmetric microscopic dynamic with time asymmetric equations
describing the evolution of macroscopic variables. I then show how the large
deviation function of the stationary state of the microscopic system can be
used as a Lyapunov function for the macroscopic evolution equations.
