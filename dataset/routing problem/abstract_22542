The capture and gradual inspiral of stellar mass objects by a massive black
hole at the centre of a galaxy has been proposed as one of the most promising
source of gravitational radiation to be detected by LISA. Unfortunately rate
estimates for this process suffer from many uncertainties. Here we report on
the use of our newly developed Monte Carlo stellar dynamics code to tackle this
problem. We present results from simple galactic nuclei models that demonstrate
the high potential of our approach and point out the aspects of the problem
where an improved treatment seems desirable.
