We classify compact 2-connected homogeneous spaces with the same rational
cohomology as a product of spheres. This classification relies on spectral
sequences, homotopy theory, and representation theory. We then apply this
classification to two geometric problems. The first problem is the
classification of all isoparametric hypersurfaces which admit a transitive
isometry group on at least one focal manifold. This generalizes the
classification of homogeneous isoparametric hypersurfaces by Hsiang and Lawson
and gives a new, independent proof of their result. Secondly, we classify
certain compact highly connected Tits buildings which admit a vertex transitive
automorphism group. Such buildings arise as compactifications of symmetric
spaces as well as from isoparametric submanifolds. This extends the recent
classification of all compact connected Tits buildings which admit a chamber
transitive automorphism group by Grundhofer, Knarr, and the contributor.
