We study the BGK approximation to first-order scalar conservation laws with a
flux which is discontinuous in the space variable. We show that the Cauchy
Problem for the BGK approximation is well-posed and that, as the relaxation
parameter tends to 0, it converges to the (entropy) solution of the limit
problem.
