In this paper we outline a general method for finding well-posed boundary
value problems for linear equations of mixed elliptic and hyperbolic type,
which extends previous techniques of Berezanskii, Didenko, and Friedrichs. This
method is then used to study a particular class of fully nonlinear mixed type
equations which arise in applications to differential geometry.
