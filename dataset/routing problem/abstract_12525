This paper surveys recent work in applying ideas from graphical models and
message passing algorithms to solve large scale regularized regression
problems. In particular, the focus is on compressed sensing reconstruction via
ell_1 penalized least-squares (known as LASSO or BPDN). We discuss how to
derive fast approximate message passing algorithms to solve this problem.
Surprisingly, the analysis of such algorithms allows to prove exact
high-dimensional limit results for the LASSO risk.
  This paper will appear as a chapter in a book on `Compressed Sensing' edited
by Yonina Eldar and Gitta Kutyniok.
