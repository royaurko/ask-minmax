After briefly reviewing the good agreement between large-scale observations
and the predictions of the now-standard CDM theory and problems with the MOND
alternative, I summarize several of the main areas of possible disagreement
between theory and observation: galaxy centers, dark matter substructure,
angular momentum, and the sequence of cosmogony, updating earlier reviews [1].
All of these issues are sufficiently complicated that it is not yet clear how
serious they are, but there is at least some reason to think that the problems
will be resolved through a deeper understanding of the complicated
"gastrophysics" of star formation and feedback from supernovae and AGN.
