We construct the Runge-Lenz vector and symmetry algebra of rational
Calogero-Coulomb problem, formulated in terms of Dunkl operators. We find that
they are proper deformations of their Coulomb counterpart. Together with
similar correspondence between the Calogero-oscillator and oscillator models,
this observation permits to claim that most of properties of Coulomb and
oscillator systems can be lifted to their Calogero-extended analogs by the
proper replacement of momenta by Dunkl momenta operators.
