We present an algorithm based on maximum likelihood for the estimation and
renormalization (marginalization) of exponential densities. The moment-matching
problem resulting from the maximization of the likelihood is solved as an
optimization problem using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. In the case of
renormalization, the moments needed to set up the moment-matching problem are
evaluated using Swendsen's renormalization method. We focus on the
renormalization version of the algorithm, where we demonstrate its use by
computing the critical temperature of the two-dimensional Ising model. Possible
applications of the algorithm are discussed.
