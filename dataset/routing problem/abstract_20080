This is the text of an expository talk given at the May 1997 Detroit meeting
of the American Mathematical Society. It is a tale of a famous football player
and a subtle problem he posed about the uniform convergence of Dirichlet
series. Hiding in the background is the theory of analytic functions of an
infinite number of variables.
