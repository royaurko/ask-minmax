Dielectric relaxation spectra of block polymers containing sequential type-A
dipoles are considered. Spectra of a specific set of block copolymers can be
combined to isolate the dynamic cross-correlation between the motions of two
distinct parts of the same polymer chain. Unlike past treatments of this
problem, no model is assumed for the underlying polymer dynamics.
