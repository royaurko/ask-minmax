In this paper, we prove that there exists a unique solution to the Dirichlet
boundary value problem for a general class of semilinear second order elliptic
partial differential equations. Our approach is probabilistic. The theory of
Dirichlet processes and backward stochastic differential equations play a
crucial role.
