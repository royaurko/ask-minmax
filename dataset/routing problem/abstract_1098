The multiphoton ionization and photoelectron spectra of magnesium were
studied at laser intensities of up to 6x10^{13} Wcm^{-2} using 150 fs laser
pulses of a wavelength of 400 nm. The results indicated that a variety of
different ionization mechanisms played a role in both types of spectra. A
theoretical model describing the processes is presented and the routes to
ionization are identified. The work demonstrates the significance of the
two-electron nature of the atom in interpreting the experimental results.
