Group-level cognitive states are widely observed in human social systems, but
their discussion is often ruled out a priori in quantitative approaches. In
this paper, we show how reference to the irreducible mental states and
psychological dynamics of a group is necessary to make sense of large scale
social phenomena. We introduce the problem of mental boundaries by reference to
a classic problem in the evolution of cooperation. We then provide an explicit
quantitative example drawn from ongoing work on cooperation and conflict among
Wikipedia editors, showing how some, but not all, effects of individual
experience persist in the aggregate. We show the limitations of methodological
individualism, and the substantial benefits that come from being able to refer
to collective intentions, and attributions of cognitive states of the form
"what the group believes" and "what the group values".
