We find polynomial-time solutions to the word problem for free-by-cyclic
groups, the word problem for automorphism groups of free groups, and the
membership problem for the handlebody subgroup of the mapping class group. All
of these results follow from observing that automorphisms of the free group
strongly resemble straight line programs, which are widely studied in the
theory of compressed data structures. In an effort to be self-contained we give
a detailed exposition of the necessary results from computer science.
