Low-cost sensing gloves for reconstruction posture provide measurements which
are limited under several regards. They are generated through an imperfectly
known model, are subject to noise, and may be less than the number of Degrees
of Freedom (DoFs) of the hand. Under these conditions, direct reconstruction of
the hand posture is an ill-posed problem, and performance can be very poor.
This paper examines the problem of estimating the posture of a human hand
using(low-cost) sensing gloves, and how to improve their performance by
exploiting the knowledge on how humans most frequently use their hands. To
increase the accuracy of pose reconstruction without modifying the glove
hardware - hence basically at no extra cost - we propose to collect, organize,
and exploit information on the probabilistic distribution of human hand poses
in common tasks. We discuss how a database of such an a priori information can
be built, represented in a hierarchy of correlation patterns or postural
synergies, and fused with glove data in a consistent way, so as to provide a
good hand pose reconstruction in spite of insufficient and inaccurate sensing
data. Simulations and experiments on a low-cost glove are reported which
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
