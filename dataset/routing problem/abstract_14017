We study a crack lying along an imperfect interface in an anisotropic
bimaterial. A method is devised where known weight functions for the perfect
interface problem are used to obtain singular integral equations relating the
tractions and displacements for both the in-plane and out-of-plane fields. The
integral equations for the out-of-plane problem are solved numerically for
orthotropic bimaterials with differing orientations of anisotropy and for
different extents of interfacial imperfection. These results are then compared
with finite element computations.
