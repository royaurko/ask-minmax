It is well known that a Toeplitz operator is invertible if and only if its
symbols admits a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorization, where the factors satisfy
certain conditions. A similar result holds also for singular integral
operators. More general, the dimension of the kernel and cokernel of Toeplitz
or singular integral operators which are Fredholm can be expressed in terms of
the partial indices of an associated Wiener-Hopf factorization problem.
  In this paper we establish corresponding results for Toeplitz + Hankel
operators and singular integral operators with flip under the assumption that
the generating functions are sufficiently smooth. We are led to a slightly
different factorization problem, in which so-called characteristic pairs
instead of the partial indices appear. These pairs provide the relevant
information about the dimension of the kernel and cokernel and thus answer the
invertibility problem.
