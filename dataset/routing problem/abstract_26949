Adaptive networks are suitable for decentralized inference tasks, e.g., to
monitor complex natural phenomena. Recent research works have intensively
studied distributed optimization problems in the case where the nodes have to
estimate a single optimum parameter vector collaboratively. However, there are
many important applications that are multitask-oriented in the sense that there
are multiple optimum parameter vectors to be inferred simultaneously, in a
collaborative manner, over the area covered by the network. In this paper, we
employ diffusion strategies to develop distributed algorithms that address
multitask problems by minimizing an appropriate mean-square error criterion
with $\ell_2$-regularization. The stability and convergence of the algorithm in
the mean and in the mean-square sense is analyzed. Simulations are conducted to
verify the theoretical findings, and to illustrate how the distributed strategy
can be used in several useful applications related to spectral sensing, target
localization, and hyperspectral data unmixing.
