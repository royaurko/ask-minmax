This is a companion paper of a recent one, entitled {\sl Integral
concentration of idempotent trigonometric polynomials with gaps}. New results
of the present work concern $L^1$ concentration, while the above mentioned
paper deals with $L^p$-concentration.
  Our aim here is two-fold. At the first place we try to explain methods and
results, and give further straightforward corollaries. On the other hand, we
push forward the methods to obtain a better constant for the possible
concentration (in $L^1$ norm) of an idempotent on an arbitrary symmetric
measurable set of positive measure. We prove a rather high level
$\gamma_1>0.96$, which contradicts strongly the conjecture of Anderson et al.
that there is no positive concentration in $L^1$ norm.
  The same problem is considered on the group $\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z}$, with
$q$ say a prime number. There, the property of absolute integral concentration
of idempotent polynomials fails, which is in a way a positive answer to the
conjecture mentioned above. Our proof uses recent results of B. Green and S.
Konyagin on the Littlewood Problem.
