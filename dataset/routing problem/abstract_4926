We consider a geometric inverse problems associated with interior
measurements: Assume that on a closed Riemannian manifold $(M, h)$ we can make
measurements of the point values of the heat kernel on some open subset $U
\subset M$. Can these measurements be used to determine the whole manifold $M$
and metric $h$ on it? In this paper we analyze the stability of this
reconstruction in a class of $n$-dimensional manifolds which may collapse to
lower dimensions. In the Euclidean space, stability results for inverse
problems for partial differential operators need considerations of operators
with non-smooth coefficients. Indeed, operators with smooth coefficients can
approximate those with non-smooth ones. For geometric inverse problems, we can
encounter a similar phenomenon: to understand stability of the solution of
inverse problems for smooth manifolds, we should study the question of
uniqueness for the limiting non-smooth case. Moreover, it is well-known, that a
sequence of smooth $n$-dimensional manifolds can collapse to a non-smooth space
of lower dimension. To analyze the stability of inverse problem in a class of
smooth manifolds with bounded sectional curvature and diameter, we study
properties of the spaces which occur as limits of these collapsed manifolds and
study uniqueness of inverse problems on collapsed manifolds. Combining these,
we obtain stability results for inverse problems in the class of smooth
manifolds with bounded sectional curvature and diameter.
