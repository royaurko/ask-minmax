We extend our framework for 3D radiative transfer calculations with a
non-local operator splitting methods along (full) characteristics to spherical
and cylindrical coordinate systems. These coordinate systems are better suited
to a number of physical problems than Cartesian coordinates. The scattering
problem for line transfer is solved via means of an operator splitting (OS)
technique. The formal solution is based on a full characteristics method. The
approximate $\Lambda$ operator is constructed considering nearest neighbors
exactly. The code is parallelized over both wavelength and solid angle using
the MPI library. We present the results of several test cases with different
values of the thermalization parameter for the different coordinate systems.
The results are directly compared to 1D plane parallel tests. The 3D results
agree very well with the well-tested 1D calculations.
