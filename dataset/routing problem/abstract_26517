In a book embedding the vertices of a graph are placed on the "spine" of a
"book" and the edges are assigned to "pages" so that edges on the same page do
not cross. In the Partitioned 2-page Book Embedding problem egdes are
partitioned into two sets E_1 and E_2, the pages are two, the edges of E_1 are
assigned to page 1, and the edges of E_2 are assigned to page 2. The problem
consists of checking if an ordering of the vertices exists along the spine so
that the edges of each page do not cross. Hong and Nagamochi give an
interesting and complex linear time algorithm for tackling Partitioned 2-page
Book Embedding based on SPQR-trees. We show an efficient implementation of this
algorithm and show its effectiveness by performing a number of experimental
tests. Because of the relationships between Partitioned 2-page Book Embedding
and clustered planarity we yield as a side effect an implementation of a
clustered planarity testing where the graph has exactly two clusters.
