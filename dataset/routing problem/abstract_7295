In our ongoing work, we use constraint automata to compile protocol
specifications expressed as Reo connectors into efficient executable code,
e.g., in C. We have by now studied this automata based compilation approach
rather well, and have devised effective solutions to some of its problems.
Because our approach is based on constraint automata, the approach, its
problems, and our solutions are in fact useful and relevant well beyond the
specific case of compiling Reo. In this short paper, we identify and analyze
two such rather unexpected problems.
