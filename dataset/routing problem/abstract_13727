We establish the existence of weak solutions of a nonlinear radiation-type
boundary value problem for elliptic equation on divergence form with
discontinuous leading coefficient. Quantitative estimates play a crucial role
on the real applications. Our objective is the derivation of explicit
expressions of the involved constants in the quantitative estimates, the
so-called absolute or universal bounds. The dependence on the leading
coefficient and on the size of the spatial domain is precise.This work shows
that the expressions of those constants are not so elegant as we might expect.
