Since Organizations have recognized that knowledge constitutes a valuable
intangible asset for creating and sustaining competitive advantages, knowledge
sharing has a vital role in present society. It is an activity through which
information is exchanged among people through different media. Many problems
face the area of knowledge sharing and knowledge reuse. Currently, knowledge
sharing between entities is achieved in a very ad-hoc fashion, lacking proper
understanding of the meaning of the data. Ontologies can potentially solve
these problems by facilitating knowledge sharing and reuse through formal and
real-world semantics. Ontologies, through formal semantics, are
machine-understandable. A computer can process data, annotated with references
to ontologies, and through the knowledge encapsulated in the ontology, deduce
facts from the original data. The date fruit is the most enduring symbol of the
Sultanate's rich heritage. Creating ontology for dates will enrich the farming
group and research scholars in the agro farm area.
