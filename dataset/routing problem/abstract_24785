We present numerical results for pure SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in four
space-time dimensions using a novel algorithm based on dually transformed
variables. The simulation makes use of a recently derived O(j^4) algorithm for
the dual vertex amplitude and a dual Metropolis algorithm that generalizes the
one recently developed for three dimensions. The dual algorithm is validated
against the equivalent model using conventional variables over a range of
couplings, spin cut-offs, and lattice sizes. We consider a lattice size up to
8x8x8x8, where the problem of negative amplitudes renders the simulation
results excessively noisy even at a relatively low beta (starting at about
beta=1.8). In conclusion, we survey some approaches to addressing the sign
problem in this context and increasing the efficiency of dual computations
within this approach.
