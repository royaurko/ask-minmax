A crucial problem for many results and tools about bigraphs and bigraphical
reactive systems is bigraph embedding. An embedding is more informative than a
bigraph matching, since it keeps track of the correspondence between the
various components of the redex (guest) within the agent (host). In this paper,
we present an algorithm for computing embeddings based on a reduction to a
constraint satisfaction problem. This algorithm, that we prove to be sound and
complete, has been successfully implemented in LibBig, a library for
manipulating bigraphical reactive systems. This library can be used for
implementing a wide range of tools, and it can be adapted to various extensions
of bigraphs.
