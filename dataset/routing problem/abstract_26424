Researchers in the biological sciences nowadays often encounter the curse of
high-dimensionality, which many previously developed statistical models fail to
overcome. To tackle this problem, sufficient dimension reduction aims to
estimate the central subspace (CS), in which all the necessary information
supplied by the covariates regarding the response of interest is contained.
Subsequent statistical analysis can then be made in a lower-dimensional space
while preserving relevant information. Oftentimes studies are interested in a
certain transformation of the response (the induced response), instead of the
original one, whose corresponding CS may vary. When estimating the CS of the
induced response, existing dimension reduction methods may, however, suffer the
problem of inefficiency. In this article, we propose a more efficient two-stage
estimation procedure to estimate the CS of an induced response. This approach
is further extended to the case of censored responses. An application for
combining multiple biomarkers is also illustrated. Simulation studies and two
data examples provide further evidence of the usefulness of the proposed
method.
