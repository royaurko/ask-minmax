We study analytically the initial value problem for a charged massless
scalar-field on a Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime. Using the technique of
spectral decomposition we extend recent results on this problem. Following the
no-hair theorem we reveal the dynamical physical mechanism by which the charged
hair is radiated away. We show that the charged perturbations decay according
to an inverse power-law behaviour at future timelike infinity and along future
null infinity. Along the future outer horizon we find an oscillatory inverse
power-law relaxation of the charged fields. We find that a charged black hole
becomes ``bald'' slower than a neutral one, due to the existence of charged
perturbations. Our results are also important to the study of mass-inflation
and the stability of Cauchy horizons during a dynamical gravitational collapse
of charged matter in which a charged black-hole is formed.
