Basic problems of the semiclassical microscopic modelling of strongly
interactingsystems are discussed within the framework of Quantum Molecular
Dynamics (QMD). This model allows to study the influence of several types of
nucleonic interactions on a large variety of observables and phenomena
occurring in heavy ion collisions at relativistic energies.It is shown that the
same predictions can be obtained with several -- numerically completely
different and independently written -- programs as far as the same model
parameters are employed and the same basic approximations are made. Many
observables are robust against variations of the details of the model
assumptions used. Some of the physical results, however, depend also on rather
technical parameters like the preparation of the initial configuration in phase
space. This crucial problem is connected with the description of the ground
state of single nuclei,which differs among the various approaches. An outlook
to an improved molecular dynamics scheme for heavy ion collisions is given.
