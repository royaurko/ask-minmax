In randomly deployed networks, such as sensor networks, an important problem
for each node is to discover its \textit{neighbor} nodes so that the
connectivity amongst nodes can be established. In this paper, we consider this
problem by incorporating the physical layer parameters in contrast to the most
of the previous work which assumed a collision channel. Specifically, the pilot
signals that nodes transmit are successfully decoded if the strength of the
received signal relative to the interference is sufficiently high. Thus, each
node must extract signal parameter information from the superposition of an
unknown number of received signals. This problem falls naturally in the purview
of random set theory (RST) which generalizes standard probability theory by
assigning \textit{sets}, rather than values, to random outcomes. The
contributions in the paper are twofold: first, we introduce the realistic
effect of physical layer considerations in the evaluation of the performance of
\textit{logical} discovery algorithms; such an introduction is necessary for
the accurate assessment of how an algorithm performs. Secondly, given the
\textit{double} uncertainty of the environment (that is, the lack of knowledge
of the number of neighbors along with the lack of knowledge of the individual
signal parameters), we adopt the viewpoint of RST and demonstrate its advantage
relative to classical matched filter detection method.
