We report an unconventional and promising route to self-assemble distributed
superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor (S-F-S) Josephson Junctions on single
crystal [100] MgO. These structures consist of [110] epitaxial nano-plaquettes
of Fe covered with superconducting NbN films of varying thickness. The S-F-S
structures are characterized by strong magnetoresistance (MR) anisotropy for
the in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. The stronger in-plane MR
suggests decoherence of S-F-S junctions whose critical current follows a
(1-T/Tc) and (1-T/Tc)1/2 dependence for T Tc and T<<Tc respectively, in
accordance with the theory of supercurrent transport in such junctions.
