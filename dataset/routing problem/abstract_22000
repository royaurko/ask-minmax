We study the problem of finding, in a real algebraic matrix group, the matrix
closest to a given data matrix. We do so from the algebro-geometric perspective
of Euclidean distance degrees. We recover several classical results; and among
the new results that we prove is a formula for the Euclidean distance degree of
special linear groups.
