Consider the problem of nonparametric two-sample mean testing, where we have
access to i.i.d. samples from two multivariate distributions and wish to test
whether they have the same mean. We propose a \textit{sequential} test for this
problem suitable for data-rich, memory-constrained situations. It is novel in
several ways: it takes linear time and constant space to compute on the fly,
and has robust high-dimensional statistical performance, including basically
the same power guarantee (for a given false positive rate) as a batch/offline
version of the test with the same computational constraints. Most notably, it
has a distinct computational advantage over the batch test, because it accesses
only as many samples as are required -- its stopping time is adaptive to the
unknown difficulty of the problem.
  We analyze the test and prove these properties in a rigorously finite-sample
fashion, using a novel uniform empirical Bernstein version of the law of the
iterated logarithm (LIL), which may be of independent interest and allows
analysis of sequential tests in a general framework. We demonstrate how to
extend our ideas to nonparametric homogeneity and independence testing, and
make a case for their even broader applicability.
