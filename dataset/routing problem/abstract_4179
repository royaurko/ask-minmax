Making use of the Whittaker-Shannon interpolation formula with shifted
sampling points, we propose in this paper a well-posed semi-discretization of
the stationary Wigner equation with inflow BCs. The convergence of the
solutions of the discrete problem to the continuous problem is then analysed,
providing certain regularity of the solution of the continuous problem.
