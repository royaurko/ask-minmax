Theory of electrical spin injection from a ferromagnetic (FM) metal into a
normal (N) conductor is presented. We show that tunnel contacts (T) can
dramatically increase spin injection and solve the problem of the mismatch in
the conductivities of a FM metal and a semiconductor microstructure. We also
present explicit expressions for the spin-valve resistance of FM-T-N- and
FM-T-N-T-FM-junctions with tunnel contacts at the interfaces and show that the
resistance includes both positive and negative contributions (Kapitza
resistance and injection conductivity, respectively).
