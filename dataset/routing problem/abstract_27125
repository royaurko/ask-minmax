In this work we study the spectral density of products of Wishart diluted
random matrices of the form $X(1)\cdots X(M)(X(1)\cdots X(M))^T$ using the
Edwards-Jones trick to map this problem into a system of interacting particles
with random couplings on a multipartite graph. We apply the cavity method to
obtain recursive relations in typical instances from which to obtain the
spectral density. As this problem is fairly rich, we start by reporting in part
I a lengthy analysis for the case of dense matrices. Here we derive that the
spectral density is a solution of a polynomial equation of degree $M+1$ and
obtain exact expressions of it for $M=1$, $2$ and $3$. For general $M$, we are
able to find the exact expression of the spectral density only when all the
matrices $X(t)$ for $t=1,\ldots, M$ are square. We also make some observations
for general $M$, based admittedly on some weak numerical evidence, which we
expect to be correct.
