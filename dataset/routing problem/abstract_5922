We consider parameterised subgraph-counting problems of the following form:
given a graph G, how many k-tuples of its vertices have a given property? A
number of such problems are known to be #W[1]-complete; here we substantially
generalise some of these existing results by proving hardness for two large
families of such problems. We demonstrate that it is #W[1]-hard to count the
number of k-vertex subgraphs having any property where the number of distinct
edge-densities of labelled subgraphs that satisfy the property is o(k^2). In
the special case that the property in question depends only on the number of
edges in the subgraph, we give a strengthening of this result which leads to
our second family of hard problems.
