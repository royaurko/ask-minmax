We review probabilistic approaches to the Gross-Pitaevskii theory describing
interacting dilute systems of particles. The main achievement are large
deviations principles for the mean occupation measure of a large system of
interacting Brownian motions in a trapping potential. The corresponding rate
functions are given as variational problems whose solution provide effective
descriptions of the infinite system.
