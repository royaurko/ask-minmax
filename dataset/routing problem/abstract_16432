An (encoded) decision problem is a pair (E, F) where E=words that encode
instances of the problem, F=words to be accepted. We use "strings" in a
technical sense. With an NP problem (E, F) we associate the "logogram" of F
relative to E, which conveys structural information on E, F, and how F is
embedded in E. The kernel Ker(P) of a program P that solves (E, F) consists of
those strings in the logogram that are used by P. There are relations between
Ker(P) and the complexity of P. We develop an application to SAT that relies
upon a property of internal independence of SAT. We show that SAT cannot have
in its logogram strings serving as collective certificates. As consequence, all
programs that solve SAT have same kernel.
