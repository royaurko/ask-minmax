We introduce two variants of computation tree logic CTL based on team
semantics: an asynchronous one and a synchronous one. For both variants we
investigate the computational complexity of the satisfiability as well as the
model checking problem. The satisfiability problem is shown to be
EXPTIME-complete. Here it does not matter which of the two semantics are
considered. For model checking we prove a PSPACE-completeness for the
synchronous case, and show P-completeness for the asynchronous case.
Furthermore we prove several interesting fundamental properties of both
semantics.
