In this paper, we propose a maximum margin classifier that deals with
uncertainty in data input. Specifically, we reformulate the SVM framework such
that each input training entity is not solely a feature vector representation,
but a multi-dimensional Gaussian distribution with given probability density,
i.e., with a given mean and covariance matrix. The latter expresses the
uncertainty. We arrive at a convex optimization problem, which is solved in the
primal form using a gradient descent approach. The resulting classifier, which
we name SVM with Gaussian Sample Uncertainty (SVM-GSU), is tested on synthetic
data, as well as on the problem of event detection in video using the
large-scale TRECVID MED 2014 dataset, and the problem of image classification
using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. Experimental results verify the
effectiveness of the proposed classifier.
