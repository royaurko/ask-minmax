Homogenous graphitic nanofibres (GNFs) have been synthesised by heat
treatment of electrospun polyacrylonitrile in dimethylsulphoxide, offering a
new solution route of low toxicity to manufacture sub-60 nm diameter GNFs.
Fibre beading resulting from the spinning of low-concentration polymer
solutions can be reduced with the addition of surfactant or sodium chloride.
Characterisation techniques including X-ray diffraction, scanning- and
transmission electron microscopy have been used to quantify the effect of the
graphitisation process, by heat treatment up to 3000 deg. C, on the weight,
diameter and structural morphology of the nanofibres. The GNFs have an
entangled micro-fibril structure with graphitic ordering of up to 40 graphene
layers after treatment at 3000 deg. C. There is little difference in the degree
of graphitisation of GNFs prepared with a 250 deg. C oxidation step compared
with those prepared without, but oxidised GNFs retain more of their original
mass after heating under argon flow.
