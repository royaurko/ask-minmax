We analyze how chirality can generate pulling optical forces and left-handed
torques by cross-coupling linear-to-angular momenta between the light field and
the chiral object. In the dipolar regime, we reveal that such effects can
emerge from a competition between non-chiral and chiral contributions to
dissipative optical forces and torques, a competition balanced by the strength
of chirality of the object. We extend the analysis to large chiral spheres
where the interplay between chirality and multipolar resonances can give rise
to a break of symmetry that flips the signs of both optical forces and torques.
