We introduce a formulation of the initial and boundary value problem for
nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws posed on a differential manifold endowed
with a volume form, possibly with a boundary; in particular, this includes the
important case of Lorentzian manifolds. Only limited regularity is assumed on
the geometry of the manifold. For this problem, we establish the existence and
uniqueness of an L1 semi-group of weak solutions satisfying suitable entropy
and boundary conditions.
