We propose simple heuristics for the assembly line worker assignment and
balancing problem. This problem typically occurs in assembly lines in sheltered
work centers for the disabled. Different from the classical simple assembly
line balancing problem, the task execution times vary according to the assigned
worker. We develop a constructive heuristic framework based on task and worker
priority rules defining the order in which the tasks and workers should be
assigned to the workstations. We present a number of such rules and compare
their performance across three possible uses: as a stand-alone method, as an
initial solution generator for meta-heuristics, and as a decoder for a hybrid
genetic algorithm. Our results show that the heuristics are fast, they obtain
good results as a stand-alone method and are efficient when used as a initial
solution generator or as a solution decoder within more elaborate approaches.
