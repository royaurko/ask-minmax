One of the main debated astrophysical problems is the role of the AGN
feedback in galaxy formation. It is known that massive black holes have a
profound effect on the formation and evolution of galaxies, but how black holes
and galaxies communicate is still an unsolved problem. For Radio Galaxies,
feedback studies have mainly focused on jet/cavity systems in the most massive
and X-ray luminous galaxy clusters. The recent high-resolution detection of
warm absorbers in some Broad Line Radio Galaxies allow us to investigate the
interplay between the nuclear engine and the surrounding medium from a
different perspective. We report on the detection of warm absorbers in two
Broad Line Radio Galaxies, 3C 382 and 3C 390.3, and discuss the physical and
energetic properties of the absorbing gas. Finally, we attempt a comparison
between radio-loud and radio-quiet outflows.
