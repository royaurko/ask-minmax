Discrete abstractions of continuous and hybrid systems have recently been the
topic of great interest from both the control systems and the computer science
communities, because they provide a sound mathematical framework for analysing
and controlling embedded systems. In this paper we give a further contribution
to this research line, by addressing the problem of symbolic control design of
nonlinear systems with infinite states specifications, modelled by differential
equations. We first derive the symbolic controller solving the control design
problem, given in terms of discrete abstractions of the plant and the
specification systems. We then present an algorithm which integrates the
construction of the discrete abstractions with the design of the symbolic
controller. Space and time complexity analysis of the proposed algorithm is
performed and a comparison with traditional approaches currently available in
the literature for symbolic control design, is discussed. Some examples are
included, which show the interest and applicability of our results.
