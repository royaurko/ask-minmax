Over the last several years, experiments have conclusively demonstrated that
neutrinos are massive and that they mix. There is now direct evidence for
$\nu_e$s from the Sun transforming into other active flavors while en route to
the Earth. The disappearance of reactor $\bar{\nu}_e$s, predicted under the
assumption of neutrino oscillation, has also been observed. In this paper,
recent results from solar and reactor neutrino experiments and their
implications are reviewed. In addition, some of the future experimental
endeavors in solar and reactor neutrinos are presented.
