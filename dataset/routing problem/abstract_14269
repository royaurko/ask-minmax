In this article we consider numeric palindromes as a component of a
pythagorean triple. We first show that there are infinitely many non-primitive
pythagorean triples that contains (i) a single numeric palindrome as a
component, (ii) two numeric palindromes as a component and (iii) three numeric
palindromes as a component. We then focus on numeric palindromes in primitive
pythagorean triples. Open problem related to the topic was also given.
