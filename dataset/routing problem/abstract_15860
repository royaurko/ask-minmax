This paper is dedicated to the study of deformations of coassociative 4-folds
in a G_2 manifold which have conical singularities. We stratify the types of
deformations allowed into three problems. The main result for each problem
states that the moduli space is locally homeomorphic to the kernel of a smooth
map between smooth manifolds. In each case, the map in question can be
considered as a projection from the infinitesimal deformation space onto the
obstruction space. Thus, when there are no obstructions the moduli space is a
smooth manifold. Furthermore, we calculate a lower bound on the expected
dimension of the moduli space. Finally we show that, in weakening the condition
on the G_2 structure of the ambient 7-manifold, there is a generic smoothness
result for the moduli spaces of deformations corresponding to our second and
third problems.
