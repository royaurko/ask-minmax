The stable marriage problem has been introduced in order to describe a
complex system where individuals attempt to optimise their own satisfaction,
subject to mutually conflicting constraints. Due to the potential large
applicability of such model to describe all the situation where different
objects has to be matched pairwise, the statistical properties of this model
have been extensively studied. In this paper we present a generalization of
this model, introduced in order to take into account the presence of
correlations in the lists and the effects of distance when the player are
supposed to be represented by a position in space.
