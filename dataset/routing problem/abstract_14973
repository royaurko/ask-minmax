An $L_{p}$-theory of divergence and non-divergence form elliptic and
parabolic equations is presented. The main coefficients are supposed to belong
to the class $VMO_{x}$, which, in particular, contains all functions
independent of $x$. Weak uniqueness of the martingale problem associated with
such equations is obtained.
