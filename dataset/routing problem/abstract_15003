We consider the problem of calibration and the GREG method as suggested and
studied in Deville and Sarndal (1992). We show that a GREG type estimator is
typically not minimal variance unbiased estimator even asymptotically. We
suggest a similar estimator which is unbiased but is asymptotically with a
minimal variance.
