The purpose of this paper is to establish a geometric scattering result for a
conformally invariant nonlinear wave equation on an asymptotically simple
spacetime. The scattering operator is obtained via trace operators at null
infinities. The proof is achieved in three steps. A priori linear estimates are
obtained via an adaptation of the Morawetz vector field in the Schwarzschild
spacetime and a method used by H\"ormander for the Goursat problem. A
well-posedness result for the characteristic Cauchy problem on a light cone at
infinity is then obtained. This requires a control of the nonlinearity uniform
in time which comes from an estimates of the Sobolev constant and a decay
assumption on the nonlinearity of the equation. Finally, the trace operators on
conformal infinities are built and used to define the conformal scattering
operator.
