Feature selection is a pattern recognition approach to choose important
variables according to some criteria to distinguish or explain certain
phenomena. There are many genomic and proteomic applications which rely on
feature selection to answer questions such as: selecting signature genes which
are informative about some biological state, e.g. normal tissues and several
types of cancer; or defining a network of prediction or inference among
elements such as genes, proteins, external stimuli and other elements of
interest. In these applications, a recurrent problem is the lack of samples to
perform an adequate estimate of the joint probabilities between element states.
A myriad of feature selection algorithms and criterion functions are proposed,
although it is difficult to point the best solution in general. The intent of
this work is to provide an open-source multiplataform graphical environment to
apply, test and compare many feature selection approaches suitable to be used
in bioinformatics problems.
