Contact Riemannian manifolds, whose complex structures are not necessarily
integrable, are generalization of pseudohermitian manifolds in CR geometry. The
Tanaka-Webster-Tanno connection plays the role of the Tanaka-Webster connection
of a pseudohermitian manifold. Conformal transformations and the Yamabe problem
are also defined naturally in this setting. By constructing the special frames
and the normal coordinates on a contact Riemannian manifold, we prove that if
the complex structure is not integrable, its Yamabe invariant on a contact
Riemannian manifold is always less than the Yamabe invariant of the Heisenberg
group. So the Yamabe problem on a contact Riemannian manifold is always
solvable.
