A distance constraint satisfaction problem is a constraint satisfaction
problem (CSP) whose constraint language consists of relations that are
first-order definable over $(\Bbb Z,succ)$, i.e., over the integers with the
successor function. Our main result says that every distance CSP is in Ptime or
NP-complete, unless it can be formulated as a finite domain CSP in which case
the computational complexity is not known in general.
