The problem of charged polymer chains (polyelectrolytes) as they adsorb on a
planar surface is addressed theoretically. We review the basic mechanisms and
theory underlying polyelectrolyte adsorption on a single surface in two
situations: adsorption of a single charged chain, and adsorption from a bulk
solution in $\theta$ solvent conditions. The behavior of flexible and
semi-rigid chains is discussed separately and is expressed as function of the
polymer and surface charges, ionic strength of the solution and polymer bulk
concentration. We mainly review mean-field results and briefly comment about
fluctuation effects. The phenomenon of polyelectrolyte adsorption on a planar
surface as presented here is of relevance to the stabilization of colloidal
suspensions. In this respect we also mention calculations of the inter-plate
force between two planar surfaces in presence of polyelectrolyte. Finally, we
comment on the problem of charge overcompensation and its implication to
multi-layers formation of alternating positive and negative polyelectrolytes on
planar surfaces and colloidal particles.
