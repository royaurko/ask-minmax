Low frequency gravitational wave detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer
Space Antenna (LISA), will have to contend with large foregrounds produced by
millions of compact galactic binaries in our galaxy. While these galactic
signals are interesting in their own right, the unresolved component can
obscure other sources. The science yield for the LISA mission can be improved
if the brighter and more isolated foreground sources can be identified and
regressed from the data. Since the signals overlap with one another we are
faced with a ``cocktail party'' problem of picking out individual conversations
in a crowded room. Here we present and implement an end-to-end solution to the
galactic foreground problem that is able to resolve tens of thousands of
sources from across the LISA band. Our algorithm employs a variant of the
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, which we call the Blocked Annealed
Metropolis-Hastings (BAM) algorithm. Following a description of the algorithm
and its implementation, we give several examples ranging from searches for a
single source to searches for hundreds of overlapping sources. Our examples
include data sets from the first round of Mock LISA Data Challenges.
