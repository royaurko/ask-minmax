An uniqueness theorem for the inverse problem in the case of a second-order
equation defined on the interval [0,1] when the boundary forms contain
combinations of the values of functions at the points 0 and 1 is proved. The
auxiliary eigenvalue problems in our theorem are chose in the same manner as in
Borg's uniqueness theorem are not as in that of Sadovni\v ci$\check \imath $'s.
So number of conditions in our theorem is less than that in Sadovni\v
ci$\check\imath$'s.
