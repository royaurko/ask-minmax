We use the standard multiple shooting method to solve a linear two point
boundary-value problem. To ensure that the solution obtained by combining the
partial solutions is continuous and satisfies the boundary conditions, we have
to solve a system of linear equations. Our idea is to first solve a bidiagonal
system related to the original system of linear equations, and then update it
with the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula. We study the feasibility, the
numerical stability and the running time of this method. The results are: The
method described above has the same stability problems like the well known
Condensing method. The running time analysis shows that the new method is
slower than the Condensing method. Therefore we recommend not to use the method
described in this article.
