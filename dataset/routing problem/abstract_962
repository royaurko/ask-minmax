Wireless sensor networks are appearing as an emerging need for mankind.
Though, Such networks are still in research phase however, they have high
potential to be applied in almost every field of life. Lots of research is done
and a lot more is awaiting to be standardized. In this work, cluster based
routing in wireless sensor networks is studied precisely. Further, we modify
one of the most prominent wireless sensor network's routing protocol "LEACH" as
modified LEACH (MODLEACH) by introducing \emph{efficient cluster head
replacement scheme} and \emph{dual transmitting power levels}. Our modified
LEACH, in comparison with LEACH out performs it using metrics of cluster head
formation, through put and network life. Afterwards, hard and soft thresholds
are implemented on modified LEACH (MODLEACH) that boast the performance even
more. Finally a brief performance analysis of LEACH, Modified LEACH (MODLEACH),
MODLEACH with hard threshold (MODLEACHHT) and MODLEACH with soft threshold
(MODLEACHST) is undertaken considering metrics of throughput, network life and
cluster head replacements.
