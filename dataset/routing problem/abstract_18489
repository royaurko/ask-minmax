We consider the Next to Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) which
provides a natural solution to the so-called mu problem by introducing a new
gauge-singlet superfield S. We realize that a new mechanism of neutrino mass
suppression, based on the R-parity violating bilinear terms mu_i L_i H_u mixing
neutrinos and higgsinos, arises within the NMSSM, offering thus an original
solution to the neutrino mass problem (connected to the solution for the mu
problem). We generate realistic (Majorana) neutrino mass values without
requiring any strong hierarchy amongst the fundamental parameters, in contrast
with the alternative models. In particular, the ratio |mu_i/mu| can reach about
10^-1, unlike in the MSSM where it has to be much smaller than unity. We check
that the obtained parameters also satisfy the collider constraints and internal
consistencies of the NMSSM. The price to pay for this new cancellation-type
mechanism of neutrino mass reduction is a certain fine tuning, which get
significantly improved in some regions of parameter space. Besides, we discuss
the feasibility of our scenario when the R-parity violating bilinear terms have
a common origin with the mu term, namely when those are generated via a VEV of
the S scalar component from the couplings lambda_i S L_i H_u. Finally, we make
comments on some specific phenomenology of the NMSSM in the presence of
R-parity violating bilinear terms.
