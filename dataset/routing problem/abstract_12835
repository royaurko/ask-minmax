In this section, we discuss some basic features of transverse momentum
dependent, or unintegrated, parton distribution functions. In particular, when
these correlation functions are combined in a factorization formulae with hard
processes beyond the simplest cases, there are basic problems with universality
and factorization. We discuss some of these problems as well as the
opportunities that they offer.
