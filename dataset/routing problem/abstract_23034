This work is motivated by the necessity to automate the discovery of
structure in vast and evergrowing collection of relational data commonly
represented as graphs, for example genomic networks. A novel algorithm, dubbed
Graphitour, for structure induction by lossless graph compression is presented
and illustrated by a clear and broadly known case of nested structure in a DNA
molecule. This work extends to graphs some well established approaches to
grammatical inference previously applied only to strings. The bottom-up graph
compression problem is related to the maximum cardinality (non-bipartite)
maximum cardinality matching problem. The algorithm accepts a variety of graph
types including directed graphs and graphs with labeled nodes and arcs. The
resulting structure could be used for representation and classification of
graphs.
