BDDC method is the most advanced method from the Balancing family of
iterative substructuring methods for the solution of large systems of linear
algebraic equations arising from discretization of elliptic boundary value
problems. In the case of many substructures, solving the coarse problem exactly
becomes a bottleneck. Since the coarse problem in BDDC has the same structure
as the original problem, it is straightforward to apply the BDDC method
recursively to solve the coarse problem only approximately. In this paper, we
formulate a new family of abstract Multispace BDDC methods and give condition
number bounds from the abstract additive Schwarz preconditioning theory. The
Multilevel BDDC is then treated as a special case of the Multispace BDDC and
abstract multilevel condition number bounds are given. The abstract bounds
yield polylogarithmic condition number bounds for an arbitrary fixed number of
levels and scalar elliptic problems discretized by finite elements in two and
three spatial dimensions. Numerical experiments confirm the theory.
