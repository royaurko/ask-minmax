We study numerical methods for the solution of general linear moment
problems, where the solution belongs to a family of nested subspaces of a
Hilbert space. Multi-level algorithms, based on the conjugate gradient method
and the Landweber--Richardson method are proposed that determine the "optimal"
reconstruction level a posteriori from quantities that arise during the
numerical calculations. As an important example we discuss the reconstruction
of band-limited signals from irregularly spaced noisy samples, when the actual
bandwidth of the signal is not available. Numerical examples show the
usefulness of the proposed algorithms.
