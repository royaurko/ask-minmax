After setting up a general model for supersymmetric classical mechanics in
more than one dimension we describe systems with centrally symmetric potentials
and their Poisson algebra. We then apply this information to the investigation
and solution of the supersymmetric Coulomb problem, specified by an 1/|x|
repulsive bosonic potential.
