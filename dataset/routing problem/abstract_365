In recent years there has been much interest in certain subcubes of
hypercubes, namely Fibonacci cubes and Lucas cubes (and their generalized
versions). In this article we consider online routing of linear permutations on
these cubes. The model of routing we use regards edges as bi-directional, and
we do not allow queues of length greater than one. Messages start out at
different vertices, and in movements synchronized with a clock, move to an
adjacent vertex or remain where they are, so that at the next stage there is
still exactly one message per vertex. This is the routing model we defined in
an earlier paper.
