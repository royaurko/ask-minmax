We discuss aspects of the hierarchy problem in effective theories with light
scalars and a large, physical ultraviolet (UV) cutoff. We make two main points:
(1) The (naive) fine-tuning observed in an effective theory does not
automatically imply that the UV completion is fine tuned. Instead, it gives a
type of upper bound on the severity of the actual tuning in the UV completion;
the actual tuning can be less severe than the naive tuning or even
non-existent. (2) Within an effective theory, there appear to be two types of
parameter relations that can alleviate the sensitivity of the scalar mass to
the cutoff --- relationships among dimensionless couplings or relationships
among dimensionful parameters. Supersymmetric models provide symmetry-motivated
examples of the former, while scale-invariant models give symmetry-motivated
examples of the latter.
