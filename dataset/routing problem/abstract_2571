When applying the Earth's natural pulse electromagnetic fields to geophysical
prospecting one should take into account characteristics of their spatial and
temporal variations. ENPEMF is known to include both pulses attributed to
atmospheric thunderstorms and pulses generated in the lithosphere by
mechanic-to-electric energy conversion in rocks. It is evident that the most
valuable information on the geophysical structure of a certain area is
obviously contained in pulses originated from this area. This article covers a
method of recording spatial variations of the Earth's natural pulse
electromagnetic fields which is able to take due account of spatial and
temporal variations of EM fields and suits to reveal crustal structural and
lithologic heterogeneities including hydrocarbon pools. We use a system of
several stations recording the ENPEMF concurrently to erase the temporal
variations from ENPEMF records and to sort out the pulses of local and remote
origin. Some stations are fixed (reference) and record only temporal variations
of EM fields. While the other stations are mobile and measure pulse
characteristics related to both spatial and temporal ENPEMF variations along
measurement routes crossing the area investigated. Spatial variations of EM
fields left after having deleted the temporal variations and pulses generated
out of the area investigate show the availability or the lack of geophysical
anomalies.
