The post-enrolment course timetabling (PE-CTT) is one of the most studied
timetabling problems, for which many instances and results are available. In
this work we design a metaheuristic approach based on Simulated Annealing to
solve the PE-CTT. We consider all the different variants of the problem that
have been proposed in the literature and we perform a comprehensive
experimental analysis on all the public instances available. The outcome is
that our solver, properly engineered and tuned, performs very well on all
cases, providing the new best known results on many instances and
state-of-the-art values for the others.
