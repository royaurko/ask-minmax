The calculations of nuclear matrix elements of $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay is a
challenge for nuclear physics. We are discussing here a model independent
method, which could allow to test the calculations. The method is based on the
factorization property of the nuclear matrix elements and requires observation
of neutrinoless double $\beta$-decay of several nuclei.
