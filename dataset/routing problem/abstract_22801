Based on the statistical dynamical mean field theory, we investigate, in a
generic model for a strongly coupled disordered electron-phonon system, the
competition between polaron formation and Anderson localization. The
statistical dynamical mean field approximation maps the lattice problem to an
ensemble of self-consistently embedded impurity problems. It is a probabilistic
approach, focusing on the distribution instead of the average values for
observables of interest. We solve the self-consistent equations of the theory
with a Monte-Carlo sampling technique, representing distributions for random
variables by random samples, and discuss various ways to determine mobility
edges from the random sample for the local Green function. Specifically, we
give, as a function of the `polaron parameters', such as adiabaticity and
electron-phonon coupling constants, a detailed discussion of the localization
properties of a single polaron, using a bare electron as a reference system.
