We report on the development of W-band (75-110 GHz) heterodyne receiver
technology for large-format astronomical arrays. The receiver system is
designed to be both mass-producible, so that the designs could be scaled to
thousands of receiver elements, and modular. Most of the receiver function-
ality is integrated into compact Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC)
amplifier-based multichip modules. The MMIC modules include a chain of InP MMIC
low-noise amplifiers, coupled-line bandpass filters and sub-harmonic Schottky
diode mixers. The receiver signals will be routed to and from the MMIC modules
on a multilayer high frequency laminate, which includes splitters, amplifiers,
and frequency doublers. A prototype MMIC module has exhibited a band-averaged
noise temperature of 41 K from 82-100 GHz and a gain of 29 dB at 15 K, which is
the state- of-the-art for heterodyne multi-chip modules.
