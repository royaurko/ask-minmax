This paper describes Postfix-GP system, postfix notation based Genetic
Programming (GP), for solving symbolic regression problems. It presents an
object-oriented architecture of Postfix-GP framework. It assists the user in
understanding of the implementation details of various components of
Postfix-GP. Postfix-GP provides graphical user interface which allows user to
configure the experiment, to visualize evolved solutions, to analyze GP run,
and to perform out-of-sample predictions. The use of Postfix-GP is demonstrated
by solving the benchmark symbolic regression problem. Finally, features of
Postfix-GP framework are compared with that of other GP systems.
