In this paper, we initiate the rigorous mathematical study of the problem of
impulsive gravitational spacetime waves. We construct such spacetimes as
solutions to the characteristic initial value problem of the Einstein vacuum
equations with a data curvature delta singularity. We show that in the
resulting spacetime, the delta singularity propagates along a characteristic
hypersurface, while away from that hypersurface the spacetime remains smooth.
Unlike the known explicit examples of impulsive gravitational spacetimes, this
work in particular provides the first construction of an impulsive
gravitational wave of compact extent and does not require any symmetry
assumptions. The arguments in the present paper also extend to the problem of
existence and uniqueness of solutions to a larger class of non-regular
characteristic data.
