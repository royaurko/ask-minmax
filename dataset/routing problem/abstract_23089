We present a three-parameter family of solutions to the stationary
axisymmetric Einstein equations that describe differentially rotating disks of
dust. They have been constructed by generalizing the Neugebauer-Meinel solution
of the problem of a rigidly rotating disk of dust. The solutions correspond to
disks with angular velocities depending monotonically on the radial coordinate;
both decreasing and increasing behaviour is exhibited. In general, the
solutions are related mathematically to Jacobi's inversion problem and can be
expressed in terms of Riemann theta functions. A particularly interesting
two-parameter subfamily represents Baecklund transformations to appropriate
seed solutions of the Weyl class.
