We present a brief overview of the regularizing transformations of the Kepler
problem and we relate the Euler transformation with the symplectic structure of
the phase space of the N-body problem. We show that any particular solution of
the N-body problem where two bodies have rectilinear dynamics can be
regularized by a linear symplectic transformation and the inclusion of the
Euler transformation into the group of symplectic local diffeomorphisms over
the phase space. As an application we regularize a particular configuration of
the circular N+2 Sitnikov problem.
