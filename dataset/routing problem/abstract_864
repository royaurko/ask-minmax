One of the limitations of wireless sensor nodes is their inherent limited
energy resource. Besides maximizing the lifetime of the sensor node, it is
preferable to distribute the energy dissipated throughout the wireless sensor
network in order to minimize maintenance and maximize overall system
performance. We investigate a new routing algorithm that uses diffusion in
order to achieve relatively even power dissipation throughout a wireless sensor
network by making good local decisions. We leverage from concepts of
peer-to-peer networks in which the system acts completely decentralized and all
nodes in the network are equal peers. Our algorithm utilizes the node load,
power levels, and spatial information in order to make the optimal routing
decision. According to our preliminary experimental results, our proposed
algorithm performs well according to its goals.
