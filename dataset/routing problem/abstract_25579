Bayesian priors offer a compact yet general means of incorporating domain
knowledge into many learning tasks. The correctness of the Bayesian analysis
and inference, however, largely depends on accuracy and correctness of these
priors. PAC-Bayesian methods overcome this problem by providing bounds that
hold regardless of the correctness of the prior distribution. This paper
introduces the first PAC-Bayesian bound for the batch reinforcement learning
problem with function approximation. We show how this bound can be used to
perform model-selection in a transfer learning scenario. Our empirical results
confirm that PAC-Bayesian policy evaluation is able to leverage prior
distributions when they are informative and, unlike standard Bayesian RL
approaches, ignore them when they are misleading.
