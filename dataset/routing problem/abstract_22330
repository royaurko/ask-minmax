We characterize bivariate natural exponential families having the diagonal of
the variance function of the form \[ \textrm{diag}
V(m_1,m_2)=\left(Am_1^2+am_1+bm_2+e,Am_2^2+cm_1+dm_2+f\right), \] with $A<0$
and $a,\ldots,f\in\mathbb{R}$. The solution of the problem relies on finding
the conditions under which a specific parametric family of functions consists
of Laplace transforms of some probability measures.
