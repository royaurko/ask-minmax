The kinetics of the multicomponent condensation after the instantaneous
creation of the metastable state is described analytically. Manydimensional
problem is reduced to the one-dimensional case. All the main characteristics of
the process are obtained analytically with the help of iteration procedure. As
the result the analytical theory for the decay of the metastable phase in
completely constructed for vapor with many components.
