Recent experiments have shown that transport properties of molecular-scale
devices can be reversibly altered by the surrounding solvent. Here, we use a
combination of first-principles calculations and experiment to explain this
change in transport properties through a shift in the local electrostatic
potential at the junction caused by nearby conducting and solvent molecules
chemically bound to the electrodes. This effect is found to alter the
conductance of bipyridine - gold junctions by more than 50%. Moreover, we
develop a general electrostatic model that quantitatively predicts the
relationship between conductance and the binding energies and dipoles of the
solvent and conducting molecules. Our work shows that solvent induced effects
are a viable route for controlling charge and energy transport at
molecular-scale interfaces.
