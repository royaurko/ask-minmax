Recently mobile agents are used to discover services in mobile ad-hoc network
(MANET) where agents travel through the network, collecting and sometimes
spreading the dynamically changing service information. But it is important to
investigate how reliable the agents are for this application as the
dependability issues(reliability and availability) of MANET are highly affected
by its dynamic nature.The complexity of underlying MANET makes it hard to
obtain the route reliability of the mobile agent systems (MAS); instead we
estimate it using Monte Carlo simulation. Thus an algorithm for estimating the
task route reliability of MAS (deployed for discovering services) is proposed,
that takes into account the effect of node mobility in MANET. That mobility
pattern of the nodes affects the MAS performance is also shown by considering
different mobility models. Multipath propagation effect of radio signal is
considered to decide link existence. Transient link errors are also considered.
Finally we propose a metric to calculate the reliability of service discovery
protocol and see how MAS performance affects the protocol reliability. The
experimental results show the robustness of the proposed algorithm. Here the
optimum value of network bandwidth (needed to support the agents) is calculated
for our application. However the reliability of MAS is highly dependent on link
failure probability.
