Recently, Byland and Scialom studied the evolution of the Bianchi I, the
Bianchi III and the Kantowski-Sachs universe on the basis of dynamical systems
methods (Phys. Rev. D57, 6065 (1998), gr-qc/9802043). In particular, they have
pointed out a problem to determine the stability properties of one of the
degenerate critical points of the corresponding dynamical system. Here we give
a solution, showing that this point is unstable both to the past and to the
future. We also discuss the asymptotic behavior of the trajectories in the
vicinity of another critical point.
