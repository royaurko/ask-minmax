Although the convergent close-coupling (CCC) method has achieved
unprecedented success in obtaining accurate theoretical cross sections for
electron-atom scattering, it generally fails to yield converged energy
distributions for ionization. Here we report converged energy distributions for
ionization of H(1s) by numerically integrating Schroedinger's equation subject
to correct asymptotic boundary conditions for the Temkin-Poet model collision
problem, which neglects angular momentum. Moreover, since the present method is
complete, we obtained convergence for all transitions in a single calculation.
Complete results, accurate to 1%, are presented for impact energies of 54.4 and
40.8 eV, where CCC results are available for comparison.
