This paper utilizes compartmental analysis and a statistical optimization
technique in order to reduce a compartmental model describing the metabolism of
labelled glucose in liver. Specifically, we first design a compartmental model
for the gut providing as output the tracer concentration in the portal vein.
This quantity is then used as one of the two input functions in a compartmental
model for the liver. This model, in turn, provides as output the tracer
coefficients quantitatively describing the effectiveness with which the
labelled glucose is transported between the different compartments. For both
models, the computation of the solutions for the inverse problems is performed
by means of an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm. The validation of the whole
process is realized by means of synthetic data simulated by solving the forward
problem of the compartmental system.
