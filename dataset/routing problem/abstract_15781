We compute conjugacy classes in maximal parabolic subgroups of the general
linear group. This computation proceeds by reducing to a ``matrix problem''.
Such problems involve finding normal forms for matrices under a specified set
of row and column operations. We solve the relevant matrix problem in small
dimensional cases. This gives us all conjugacy classes in maximal parabolic
subgroups over a perfect field when one of the two blocks has dimension less
than 6. In particular, this includes every maximal parabolic subgroup of
GL_n(k) for n < 12 and k a perfect field. If our field is finite of size q, we
also show that the number of conjugacy classes, and so the number of
characters, of these groups is a polynomial in $q$ with integral coefficients.
