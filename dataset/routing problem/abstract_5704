Inspired by recent work on convex formulations of clustering (Lashkari &
Golland, 2008; Nowozin & Bakir, 2008) we investigate a new formulation of the
Sparse Coding Problem (Olshausen & Field, 1997). In sparse coding we attempt to
simultaneously represent a sequence of data-vectors sparsely (i.e. sparse
approximation (Tropp et al., 2006)) in terms of a 'code' defined by a set of
basis elements, while also finding a code that enables such an approximation.
As existing alternating optimization procedures for sparse coding are
theoretically prone to severe local minima problems, we propose a convex
relaxation of the sparse coding problem and derive a boosting-style algorithm,
that (Nowozin & Bakir, 2008) serves as a convex 'master problem' which calls a
(potentially non-convex) sub-problem to identify the next code element to add.
Finally, we demonstrate the properties of our boosted coding algorithm on an
image denoising task.
