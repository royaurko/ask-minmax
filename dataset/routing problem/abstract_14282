We consider the problem of estimating the principal components of a
population correlation matrix from a limited number of measurement data. Using
a combination of random matrix and information-theoretic tools, we show that
all the eigenmodes of the sample correlation matrices are informative, and not
only the top ones. We show how this information can be exploited when prior
information about the principal component, such as whether it is localized or
not, is available by mapping the estimation problem onto the search for the
ground state of a spin-glass-like effective Hamiltonian encoding the prior.
Results are illustrated numerically on the spiked covariance model.
