Sensors used in applications such as agriculture, weather, etc., monitoring
physical parameters like soil moisture, temperature, humidity, will have to
sustain their battery power for long intervals of time. In order to accomplish
this, parameter which assists in reducing the consumption of power from battery
need to be attended to. One of the factors affecting the consumption of energy
is transmit and receive power. This energy consumption can be reduced by
avoiding unnecessary transmission and reception. Efficient routing techniques
and incorporating aggregation whenever possible can save considerable amount of
energy. Aggregation reduces repeated transmission of relative values and also
reduces lot of computation at the base station. In this paper, the benefits of
aggregation over direct transmission in saving the amount of energy consumed is
discussed. Routing techniques which assist aggregation are incorporated.
Aspects like transmission of average value of sensed data around an area of the
network, minimum value in the whole of the network, triggering of event when
there is low battery are assimilated.
