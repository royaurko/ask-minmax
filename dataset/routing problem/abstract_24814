In this paper, we study the performance of IPOP-saACM-ES, recently proposed
self-adaptive surrogate-assisted Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy. The algorithm was tested using restarts till a total number of
function evaluations of $10^6D$ was reached, where $D$ is the dimension of the
function search space. The experiments show that the surrogate model control
allows IPOP-saACM-ES to be as robust as the original IPOP-aCMA-ES and
outperforms the latter by a factor from 2 to 3 on 6 benchmark problems with
moderate noise. On 15 out of 30 benchmark problems in dimension 20,
IPOP-saACM-ES exceeds the records observed during BBOB-2009 and BBOB-2010.
