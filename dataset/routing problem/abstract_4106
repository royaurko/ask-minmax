In this work we study the inverse boundary value problem of determining the
refractive index in the acoustic equation. It is known that this inverse
problem is ill-posed. Nonetheless, we show that the ill-posedness decreases
when we increase the frequency and the stability estimate changes from
logarithmic type for low frequencies to a Lipschitz estimate for large
frequencies.
