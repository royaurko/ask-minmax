We solve the problem of computing characteristic numbers of rational space
curves with a cusp, where there may or may not be a condition on the node. The
solution is given in the form of effective recursions. We give explicit
formulas when the dimension of the ambient projective space is at most 5. Many
numerical examples are provided. A C++ program implementing most of the
recursions is available upon request
