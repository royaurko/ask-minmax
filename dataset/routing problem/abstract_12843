We show how sign problems in simulations of many-body systems can manifest
themselves in the form of heavy-tailed correlator distributions, similar to
what is seen in electron propagation through disordered media. We propose an
alternative statistical approach for extracting ground state energies in such
systems, illustrating the method with a toy model and with lattice data for
unitary fermions.
