Many past attempts to kill MOND have only strengthened the theory. Better
data on galaxy velocity curves clearly favor MOND (without fine-tuning) over
cold dark matter. The usual critism on the incompleteness of classical MOND has
spurred a Modified Relativity (MR) by Bekenstein. After outlining cosmology and
lensing in MOND, we review MOND on small scales. We point out some potential
problems of MOND in two-body relaxation and tidal truncation. We argue that the
tidal field in any MOND-like gravity theory predicts that the Roche lobe sizes
of a binary system are simply proportional to the binary baryonic mass ratio to
the power 1/3. An immediate application of this result is that the tidal field
and tidal truncation radii of million-star globular clusters and million-star
dwarf galaxies (e.g., the Milky Way satellites NGC2419 and Carina) would be
very similar because of the one-to-one relation between gravity and baryon
distribution. This prediction appears, however, inconsistent with the fact that
{\it all} globulars are truncated to much smaller sizes than {\it all} dwarf
galaxies. Whether tide is uniquely determined by baryons can also be used to
falsify any MOND-like gravity theory, whether classical or relativistic.
