Recently, based on a supersymmetric approach, new classes of conditionally
exactly solvable problems have been found, which exhibit a symmetry structure
characterized by non-linear algebras. In this paper the associated
``non-linear'' coherent states are constructed and some of their properties are
discussed in detail.
