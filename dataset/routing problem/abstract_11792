A precise variational solution to $N$=2--6-body problems is reported. The trial
wave functions are chosen to be combinations of correlated Gaussians, which
facilitate a fully analytical calculation of the matrix elements. The nonlinear
parameters of the trial function are selected by a stochastic method. Fermionic
and bosonic few-body systems are investigated for interactions of different
type. A comparison of the results with those available in the literature shows
that the method is both accurate and efficient.
