We introduce the notion of pseudohermitian k-curvature, which is a natural
extension of the Webster scalar curvature, on an orientable manifold endowed
with a strictly pseudoconvex pseudohermitian structure (referred here as a CR
manifold) and raise the k-Yamabe problem on a compact CR manifold. When k=1,
the problem was proposed and partially solved by Jerison and Lee for CR
manifolds non-locally CR-equivalent to the CR sphere. For k > 1, the problem
can be translated in terms of the study of a fully nonlinear equation of type
complex k-Hessian. We provide some partial answers related to the CR k-Yamabe
problem. We establish that its solutions with null Cotton tensor are critical
points of a suitable geometric functional constrained to pseudohermitian
structures of unit volume. Thanks to this variational property, we establish a
Obata type result for the problem and also compute the infimum of the
functional on the CR sphere. Furthermore, we show that this value is an upper
bound for the corresponding one on any compact CR manifolds and, assuming the
CR Yamabe invariant is positive, we prove that such an upper bound is only
attained for compact CR manifolds locally CR-equivalent to the CR sphere. In
the Riemannian field, recent advances have been produced in a series of
outstanding works.
