We report the structural and magnetoelectrical properties of
La$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$/BaTiO$_3$ perovskite superlattices grown on
(001)-oriented SrTiO$_3$ by the pulsed laser deposition technique. Magnetic
hysteresis loops together with temperature dependent magnetic properties
exhibit well-defined coercivity and magnetic transition temperature (T$_C$)
\symbol{126}140 K. $DC$ electrical studies of films show that the
magnetoresistance (MR) is dependent on the BaTiO$_3$ thickness and negative
$MR$ as high as 30% at 100K are observed. The $AC$ electrical studies reveal
that the impedance and capacitance in these films vary with the applied
magnetic field due to the magnetoelectrical coupling in these structures - a
key feature of multiferroics. A negative magnetocapacitance value in the film
as high as 3% per tesla at 1kHz and 100K is demonstrated, opening the route for
designing novel functional materials.
