We study the center problem for the class $\mathcal E_\Gamma$ of Abel
differential equations $\frac{dv}{dt}=a_1 v^2+a_2 v^3$, $a_1,a_2\in L^\infty
([0,T])$, such that images of Lipschitz paths $\tilde A:=\bigl(\int_0^\cdot
a_1(s)ds, \int_0^\cdot a_2(s)ds\bigr): [0,T]\rightarrow\mathbb R^2$ belong to a
fixed compact rectifiable curve $\Gamma$. Such a curve is called universal if
whenever an equation in $\mathcal E_\Gamma$ has center on $[0,T]$, this center
must be universal, i.e. all iterated integrals in coefficients $a_1, a_2$ of
this equation must vanish. We investigate some basic properties of universal
curves. Our main results include an algebraic description of a universal curve
in terms of a certain homomorphism of its fundamental group into the group of
locally convergent invertible power series with product being the composition
of series, explicit examples of universal curves and approximation of Lipschitz
triangulable curves by universal ones.
