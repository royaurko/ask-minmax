We continue the investigation of the dynamics of retrograde resonances
initiated in Morais & Giuppone (2012). After deriving a procedure to deduce the
retrograde resonance terms from the standard expansion of the three-dimensional
disturbing function, we concentrate on the planar problem and construct
surfaces of section that explore phase-space in the vicinity of the main
retrograde resonances (2/-1, 1/-1 and 1/-2). In the case of the 1/-1 resonance
for which the standard expansion is not adequate to describe the dynamics, we
develop a semi-analytic model based on numerical averaging of the unexpanded
disturbing function, and show that the predicted libration modes are in
agreement with the behavior seen in the surfaces of section.
