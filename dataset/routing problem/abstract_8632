We study the computational complexity of determining the Hausdorff distance
of two polytopes given in halfspace- or vertex-presentation in arbitrary
dimension. Subsequently, a matching problem is investigated where a convex body
is allowed to be homothetically transformed in order to minimize its Hausdorff
distance to another one. For this problem, we characterize optimal solutions,
deduce a Helly-type theorem and give polynomial time (approximation) algorithms
for polytopes.
