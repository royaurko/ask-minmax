Additivity of the minimal output entropy for the family of transpose
depolarizing channels introduced by Fannes et al. [quant-ph/0410195] is
considered. It is shown that using the method of our previous paper
[quant-ph/0403072] allows us to prove the additivity for the range of the
parameter values for which the problem was left open in [quant-ph/0410195].
Together with the result of [quant-ph/0410195], this covers the whole family of
transpose depolarizing channels.
