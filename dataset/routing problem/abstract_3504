This paper concerns the reconstruction of an anisotropic conductivity tensor
in an elliptic second-order equation from knowledge of the so-called power
density functionals. This problem finds applications in several coupled-physics
medical imaging modalities such as ultrasound modulated electrical impedance
tomography and impedance-acoustic tomography. We consider the linearization of
the nonlinear hybrid inverse problem. We find sufficient conditions for the
linearized problem, a system of partial differential equations, to be elliptic
and for the system to be injective. Such conditions are found to hold for a
lesser number of measurements than those required in recently established
explicit reconstruction procedures for the nonlinear problem.
