Uniform random generation of Latin squares is a classical problem. In this
paper we prove that both Latin squares and Sudoku designs are maximum cliques
of properly defined graphs. We have developed a simple algorithm for uniform
random sampling of Latin squares and Sudoku designs. It makes use of recent
tools for graph analysis. The corresponding SAS code is annexed.
