We investigate the KK-lifting problem for generalized dimension drop interval
algebras (with possibly different dimension drops at the endpoints). It turns
out that there exist KK-elements between two such algebras which preserve the
Dadarlat-Loring order structure on K-theory with coefficient, but fail to be
lifted to a homomorphism between the algebras.
