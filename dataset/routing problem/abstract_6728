The Harmonic Mapping Problem asks when there exists a harmonic homeomorphism
between two given domains. It arises in the theory of minimal surfaces and in
calculus of variations, specifically in hyperelasticity theory. We investigate
this problem for doubly connected domains in the plane, where it already
presents considerable challenge and leads to several interesting open
questions.
