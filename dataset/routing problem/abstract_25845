We study the \emph{maximum differential coloring problem}, where the vertices
of an $n$-vertex graph must be labeled with distinct numbers ranging from $1$
to $n$, so that the minimum absolute difference between two labels of any two
adjacent vertices is maximized. As the problem is \NPH for general
graphs~\cite{leung1984}, we consider planar graphs and subclasses thereof. We
initially prove that the maximum differential coloring problem remains \NPH,
even for planar graphs. Then, we present tight bounds for regular caterpillars
and spider graphs. Using these new bounds, we prove that the Miller-Pritikin
labeling scheme~\cite{miller89} for forests is optimal for regular caterpillars
and for spider graphs. Finally, we describe close-to-optimal differential
coloring algorithms for general caterpillars and biconnected triangle-free
outer-planar graphs.
