For the inclusion problem involving two maximal monotone operators, under the
metric subregularity of the composite operator, we derive the linear
convergence of the generalized proximal point algorithm and several splitting
algorithms, which include the over-relaxed forward-backward splitting
algorithm, the generalized Douglas-Rachford splitting method and Davis'
three-operator splitting algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this linear
convergence condition is much weaker than the existing ones that almost all
require the strong monotonicity of the composite operator. We also apply these
results to the duality of the linearly constrained two-block separable convex
minimization problem, and obtain the linear convergence of the over-relaxed
alternating minimization algorithm and the generalized alternating direction
method of multipliers under the metric subregularity of the subdifferential map
of the objective function, which is implied by its second-order growth.
