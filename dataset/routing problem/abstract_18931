In a recent publication, we derived the mesoscale continuum theory of
plasticity for multiple-slip systems of parallel edge dislocations, motivated
by the statistical-based nonlocal continuum crystal plasticity theory for
single-glide due to Yefimov et al. (2004b). In this dislocation field theory
(DiFT) the transport equations for both the total dislocation densities and
geometrically necessary dislocation densities on each slip system were obtained
from the Peach-Koehler interactions through both single and pair dislocation
correlations. The effect of pair correlation interactions manifested itself in
the form of a back stress in addition to the external shear and the
self-consistent internal stress. We here present the study of size effects in
single crystalline thin films with symmetric double slip using the novel
continuum theory. Two boundary value problems are analyzed: (1) stress
relaxation in thin films on substrates subject to thermal loading, and (2)
simple shear in constrained films. In these problems, earlier discrete
dislocation simulations had shown that size effects are born out of layers of
dislocations developing near constrained interfaces. These boundary layers
depend on slip orientations and applied loading but are insensitive to the film
thickness. We investigate stress response to changes in controlled parameters
in both problems. Comparisons with previous discrete dislocation simulations
are discussed.
