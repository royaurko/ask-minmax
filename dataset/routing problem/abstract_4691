We consider the inverse problem of recovering a potential by measuring the
response at a point to a source located at the same point and then varying the
point on the surface of a sphere. This is a similar to the inverse
back-scattering problem. We show that if the angular derivatives of the
difference of two potentials having the same data is controlled by the L^2 norm
of the difference of the potentials they must be equal. In particular this
shows injectivity of the inverse problem for radial potentials.
