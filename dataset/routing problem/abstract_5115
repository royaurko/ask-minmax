Although the traditional permute matrix coming along with Hopfield is able to
describe many common problems, it seems to have limitation in solving more
complicated problem with more constrains, like resource leveling which is
actually a NP problem. This paper tries to find a better solution for it by
using neural network. In order to give the neural network description of
resource leveling problem, a new description method called Augmented permute
matrix is proposed by expending the ability of the traditional one. An Embedded
Hybrid Model combining Hopfield model and SA are put forward to improve the
optimization in essence in which Hopfield servers as State Generator for the
SA. The experiment results show that Augmented permute matrix is able to
completely and appropriately describe the application. The energy function and
hybrid model given in this study are also highly efficient in solving resource
leveling problem.
