In this paper, we draw connections between ideal lattices and multivariate
polynomial rings over integers using Gr\"obner bases. Ideal lattices are ideals
in the residue class ring, $\mathbb{Z}[x]/\langle f \rangle$ (here $f$ is a
monic polynomial), and cryptographic primitives have been built based on these
objects. As ideal lattices in the univariate case are generalizations of cyclic
lattices, we introduce the notion of multivariate cyclic lattices and show that
multivariate ideal lattices are indeed a generalization of them. Based on
multivariate ideal lattices, we establish the existence of collision resistant
hash functions using Gr\"obner basis techniques. For the construction of hash
functions, we define a worst case problem, shortest substitution problem w.r.t.
an ideal in $\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$, and establish hardness results using
functional fields.
