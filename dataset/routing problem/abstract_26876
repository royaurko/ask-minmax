In order to get some insight in the intricacies of the Abraham-Minkowski
energy-momentum problem in phenomenological electrodynamics, we briefly analyze
eight different experimental situations in radiation optics. Six of the
experiments are already existing, while the remaining two are suggestions for
future endeavors. Among the first six, we distinguish between three which are
incapable of informing about photon momentum in a medium, and the remaining
three which are able to give us useful information. Our general conclusion is
that the Abraham-Minkowski "problem" is essentially a matter of convenience. In
actual physical situations it is the Minkowski expression which is most natural
alternative to employ. Also, in a canonical context, it is the Minkowski
energy-momentum tensor which is the most convenient alternative to work with,
as this tensor is divergence-free causing the total radiation momentum and
energy to make up a four-vector, although notably a spacelike one.
