We consider a communication system in which the outputs of a Markov source
are encoded and decoded in \emph{real-time} by a finite memory receiver, and
the distortion measure does not tolerate delays. The objective is to choose
designs, i.e. real-time encoding, decoding and memory update strategies that
minimize a total expected distortion measure. This is a dynamic team problem
with non-classical information structure [Witsenhausen:1971]. We use the
structural results of [Teneketzis:2004] to develop a sequential decomposition
for the finite and infinite horizon problems. Thus, we obtain a systematic
methodology for the determination of jointly optimal encoding decoding and
memory update strategies for real-time point-to-point communication systems.
