We discuss the fundamentals of the implicit moment method for Particle In
Cell (PIC) simulation as presently implemented in the CELESTE3D code. We
present the method in its fully electromagnetic and fully kinetic version. The
application of the method is to problems with multiple temporal and spatial
scales, common in all space, astrophysical and laboratory plasmas.
