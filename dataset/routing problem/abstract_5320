Purpose: Impact of science is one of the most important topics in
scientometrics. Recent developments show a fundamental change in impact
measurements from impact on science to impact on society. Approach: Since
impact measurement is currently in a state of far reaching changes, this paper
describes recent developments and facing problems in this area. For that the
results of key publications (dealing with impact measurement) are discussed.
Results: The paper discusses how impact is generally measured within science
and beyond (section 2), which effects impact measurements have on the science
system (section 3), and which problems are associated with impact measurement
(section 4). The problems associated with impact measurement constitute the
focus of this paper: Science is marked by inequality, random chance, anomalies,
the right to make mistakes, unpredictability, and a high significance of
extreme events, which might distort impact measurements. Originality: This
paper presents a thorough discussion of aspects which can lead to problems in
impact measurements. Scientometricians as the producer of impact scores and
decision makers as their consumers should be aware of these problems and should
consider them in the generation and interpretation of bibliometric results,
respectively.
