Dial a ride problems consist of a metric space (denoting travel time between
vertices) and a set of m objects represented as source-destination pairs, where
each object requires to be moved from its source to destination vertex. We
consider the multi-vehicle Dial a ride problem, with each vehicle having
capacity k and its own depot-vertex, where the objective is to minimize the
maximum completion time (makespan) of the vehicles. We study the "preemptive"
version of the problem, where an object may be left at intermediate vertices
and transported by more than one vehicle, while being moved from source to
destination. Our main results are an O(log^3 n)-approximation algorithm for
preemptive multi-vehicle Dial a ride, and an improved O(log t)-approximation
for its special case when there is no capacity constraint. We also show that
the approximation ratios improve by a log-factor when the underlying metric is
induced by a fixed-minor-free graph.
