The absolute neutrino masses and type of neutrino mass hierarchy are among
the main problems in neutrino physics. Top-quark mass is another topical
problem in particle physics. These problems extend the old puzzle of
electron-muon mass ratio close to the fine structure constant, which is still
not solved by known theory. Here I continue the search for a general flavor
pattern that may incorporate these problems. Relations between
neutrino/electron and electron/top-quark pole mass ratios are obtained from
supposition that realistic elementary particle dimensionless bare flavor
quantities are small deviated (measured by universal parameter e) from the
values of a stated flavor pattern (at e=0) and experimental data hints. With
the world average t-quark mass data the sum of QD-neutrino masses is estimated
(0.50 +- 0.003)eV in agreement with cosmological constraints and known
QD-neutrino mass estimations from experimental data on neutrino oscillation
mass-squared differences.
