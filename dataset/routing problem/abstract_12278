The cosmological constant problem represents an evident tension between our
present description of gravity and particle physics. Many solutions have been
proposed, but experimental tests are always difficult or impossible to perform
and present phenomenological investigations focus only on possible relations
with the dark energy, that is with the accelerating expansion rate of the
contemporary universe. Here I suggest that strange stars, if they exist, could
represent an interesting laboratory to investigate this puzzle, since their
equilibrium configuration is partially determined by the QCD vacuum energy
density.
