In the example of the Schr\"odinger/KdV equation we give elementary treatment
of the theory of finite-gap integration. The concept is equivalent to two kinds
of Liouvillian integrability: quadrature integrability of linear differential
equations with a parameter (spectral problem) and Liouville's integrability of
finite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems (stationary KdV--equations).
  Three key objects in this field: the new explicit formula for the
$\Psi$-function, trace formula and the Jacobi problem provide a complete
solution.
