These lecture notes introduce the Galerkin method to approximate solutions to
partial differential and integral equations. We begin with some analysis
background to introduce this method in a Hilbert Space setting, and
subsequently illustrate some computational examples with the help of a sample
matlab code. Finally, we use the Galerkin method to prove the existence of
solutions of a nonlinear boundary value problem.
