Artificial viscosity is needed in Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics to prevent
interparticle penetration, to allow shocks to form and to damp post shock
oscillations. Artificial viscosity may, however, lead to problems such as
unwanted heating and unphysical solutions. A modification of the standard
artificial viscosity recipe is proposed which reduces these problems. Some test
cases discussed.
