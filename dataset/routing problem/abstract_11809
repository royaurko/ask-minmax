In this paper we discuss the use of wavelet bases to solve the relativistic
three-body problem. Wavelet bases can be used to transform momentum-space
scattering integral equations into an approximate system of linear equations
with a sparse matrix. This has the potential to reduce the size of realistic
three-body calculations with minimal loss of accuracy. The wavelet method leads
to a clean, interaction independent treatment of the scattering singularities
which does not require any subtractions.
