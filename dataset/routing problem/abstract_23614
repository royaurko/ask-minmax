We prove a geometric refinement of Alexander duality for certain 2-complexes,
the so-called gropes, embedded into 4-space. This refinement can be roughly
formulated as saying that 4-dimensional Alexander duality preserves the
disjoint Dwyer filtration. In addition, we give new proofs and extended
versions of two lemmas of Freedman and Lin which are of central importance in
the A-B-slice problem, the main open problem in the classification theory of
topological 4-manifolds. Our methods are group theoretical, rather than using
Massey products and Milnor \mu-invariants as in the original proofs.
