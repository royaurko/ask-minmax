We revisit the problem of quark production in high energy heavy ion
collisions, at leading order in $\alpha_s$ in the color glass condensate
framework. In this first paper, we setup the formalism and express the quark
spectrum in terms of a set of mode functions of the Dirac equation. We
determine analytically their initial value in the Fock-Schwinger gauge on a
proper time surface $Q_s\tau_0\ll 1$, in a basis which makes manifest the boost
invariance properties of this problem. We also describe a statistical algorithm
to perform the sampling of the mode functions.
