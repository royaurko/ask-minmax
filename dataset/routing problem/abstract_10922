A new code for evaluation of light absorption and scattering by interstellar
dust grains is presented. The radiative transfer problem is solved using
ray-tracing algorithm in a self-consistent and highly efficient way. The code
demonstrates performance and accuracy similar or better than that of previously
published results, achieved using Monte-Carlo methods, with accuracy better
than ~ 3% for most cases. The intended application of the code is
spectrophotometric modelling of disk galaxies, however, it can be easily
adapted to other cases that require a detailed spatial evaluation of
scattering, such as circumstellar disks and shells containing both point and
distributed light sources.
