The Split algorithm is an essential building block for route-first
cluster-second heuristics and modern genetic algorithms for vehicle routing
problems. The recent survey of [Prins, Lacomme and Prodhon, Transport Res. C
(40), 179-200] lists more than 70 articles that use this technique. In the
vehicle routing literature, Split is usually assimilated to the search for a
shortest path in a directed acyclic graph $\mathcal{G}$ and solved in $O(nB)$
using Bellman's algorithm, where $n$ is the number of delivery points and $B$
is a bound on the number of customers per route, due to the capacity
constraints. Some linear-time algorithms are also known for this problem as a
consequence of a Monge property of $\mathcal{G}$. In this article, we highlight
a stronger property of this graph, leading to a simpler alternative algorithm
in $O(n)$. Experimentally, we observe that the approach is faster than the
classical Split for problem instances of practical size. We also extend the
method to deal with a limited fleet and soft capacity constraints.
