Evolutionary and swarm algorithms have found many applications in design
problems since todays computing power enables these algorithms to find
solutions to complicated design problems very fast. Newly proposed hybrid
algorithm, bat algorithm, has been applied for the design of microwave
microstrip couplers for the first time. Simulation results indicate that the
bat algorithm is a very fast algorithm and it produces very reliable results.
