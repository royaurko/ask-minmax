We consider the problem of computing upper and lower bounds on the price of a
European basket call option, given prices on other similar baskets. We focus
here on an interpretation of this program as a generalized moment problem.
Recent results by Berg & Maserick (1984), Putinar & Vasilescu (1999) and
Lasserre (2001) on harmonic analysis on semigroups, the K-moment problem and
its applications to optimization, allow us to derive tractable necessary and
sufficient conditions for the absence of static arbitrage between basket
straddles, hence between basket calls and puts.
