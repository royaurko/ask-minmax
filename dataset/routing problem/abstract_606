This paper examines the relationship between changes in telecommunications
provider concentration on international long distance routes and changes in
prices on those routes. Overall, decreased concentration is associated with
significantly lower prices to consumers of long distance services. However, the
relationship between concentration and price varies according to the type of
long distance plan considered. For the international flagship plans frequently
selected by more price-conscious consumers of international long distance,
increased competition on a route is associated with lower prices. In contrast,
for the basic international plans that are the default selection for consumers,
increased competition on a route is actually associated with higher prices.
Thus, somewhat surprisingly, price dispersion appears to increase as
competition increases.
