We propose that the late-time tail problem in the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN)
spacetime is dual to a tail problem in the Schwarzschild spacetime with a
different initial data set: at a fixed observation point the asymptotic decay
rate of the fields are equal. This duality is used to find the decay rate for
tails in RN. This decay rate is exactly as in Schwarzschild, including the case
of the extremely-charged RN spacetime (ERN). The only case where any deviation
from the Schwarzschild decay rate is found is the case of the tails along the
event horizon of an ERN spacetime, where the decay rate is the same as at
future null infinity. As observed at a fixed location, the decay rate in ERN is
the same as in Schwarzschild. We verify these expectations with numerical
simulations.
