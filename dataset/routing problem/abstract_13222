We discuss the possibility of solving the inverse problem of the cosmic-ray
electron/positron from decaying/annihilating dark matter, and show simple
analytic formulae to reconstruct the source spectrum of the electron/positron
from the observed flux. We also illustrate our approach by applying the
obtained formula to the just released Fermi data as well as the new HESS data.
