The Eady problem of baroclinic instability as applicable to quasi-geostrophic
oceanic flows with zero internal PV gradients is revisited by introducing a
mild slope and Ekman pumping on the lower boundary. The solution behaviour is
determined by the isopycnal slope relative to either the bottom slope or the
ratio of Ekman depth to horizontal wavenumber. Attention is paid to the
physical interpretation of the growing, decaying and stable disturbances, with
emphasis on the intimate connection between the quasigeostrophic edge waves and
Eady waves, and the role of the isopycnal slope for the stability properties as
opposed to the bottom density gradient. The disturbance structure is found to
be strongly influenced by the boundary conditions.
  For a sloping bottom boundary, the growth rate is enhanced for the most
unstable waves if the isopycnals tilt in the same direction as the bottom, but
in general non-standard boundary conditions tend to retard the growth of
disturbances. In particular, the existence of the long- and short-wave cutoffs
is found to be very sensitive to boundary conditions, both for the sloping
topography and the Ekman pumping. It is suggested that any cutoffs for the
growth rate in an Eady-like problem actually result from the chosen boundary
conditions. However, for a certain range of parameters, the maximum growth rate
is comparable to that found in the original Eady problem, which may explain the
fair success enjoyed by recent eddy parameterizations basing their timescale on
the Eady growth rate.
