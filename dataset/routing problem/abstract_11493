We will describe some results regarding the algorithmic nature of
homeomorphism problems for manifolds; in particular, the following theorem.
  Theorem 1: Every PL or smooth simply connected manifold M^n of dimension n
at least 5 can be recognized among simply connected manifolds. That is, there
is an algorithm to decide whether or not another simply connected manifold is
Top, PL or Diff isomorphic to M. Moreover, an analogous statement is true for
embeddings in codimension at least three: one can algorithmically recognize
any given embedding of one simply connected manifold in another up to
isomorphism of pairs, or up to isotopy, if the codimension of the embedding is
not two.
