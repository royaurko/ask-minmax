This paper aims at providing a survey on the problems that can be easily
addressed by cellular automata in bioinformatics. Some of the contributors have
proposed algorithms for addressing some problems in bioinformatics but the
application of cellular automata in bioinformatics is a virgin field in
research. None of the researchers has tried to relate the major problems in
bioinformatics and find a common solution. Extensive literature surveys were
conducted. We have considered some papers in various journals and conferences
for conduct of our research. This paper provides intuition towards relating
various problems in bioinformatics logically and tries to attain a common frame
work for addressing the same.
