This paper considers the problem of clustering a collection of unlabeled data
points assumed to lie near a union of lower-dimensional planes. As is common in
computer vision or unsupervised learning applications, we do not know in
advance how many subspaces there are nor do we have any information about their
dimensions. We develop a novel geometric analysis of an algorithm named sparse
subspace clustering (SSC) [In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern
Recognition, 2009. CVPR 2009 (2009) 2790-2797. IEEE], which significantly
broadens the range of problems where it is provably effective. For instance, we
show that SSC can recover multiple subspaces, each of dimension comparable to
the ambient dimension. We also prove that SSC can correctly cluster data points
even when the subspaces of interest intersect. Further, we develop an extension
of SSC that succeeds when the data set is corrupted with possibly
overwhelmingly many outliers. Underlying our analysis are clear geometric
insights, which may bear on other sparse recovery problems. A numerical study
complements our theoretical analysis and demonstrates the effectiveness of
these methods.
