There is a natural solution to the strong CP problem in the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model if it arises from a parity symmetric theory which
is spontaneously broken to MSSM at Planck, GUT or intermediate scales. The
strong CP phase is zero at the tree level and is not induced to two loops. The
SUSY phase problems are also solved. The universal soft SUSY breaking
parameters A, B, \mu, m_{1/2} are all automatically real and the only
additional CP violation effects of the low-energy MSSM are characterized by a
Hermitian squark mass matrix whose phases depend on the CKM phase. Cases with
non-universal boundary conditions are also considered.
