In this paper we present the extension of the results proposed in
\cite{Onofrei-S} and study the problem of active control of TM waves
propagating in a waveguide. The main goal is to cancel, in a prescribed near
field region, the longitudinal component of the electric field of an incoming
TM wave while having vanishingly small fields near the waveguide boundary. The
main analytical challenge is to design appropriate source functions for the
scalar Helmholtz equation so that the desired cancellation effect will be
obtained. We show the existence of a class of solutions to the problem and
provide numerical support of the results. Discussion on the feasibility of the
proposed approach as well as possible design strategies are offered.
