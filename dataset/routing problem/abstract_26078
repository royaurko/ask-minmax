We develop a macro-model of information retrieval process using Game Theory
as a mathematical theory of conflicts. We represent the participants of the
Information Retrieval process as a game of two abstract players. The first
player is the `intellectual crowd' of users of search engines, the second is a
community of information retrieval systems. In order to apply Game Theory, we
treat search log data as Nash equilibrium strategies and solve the inverse
problem of finding appropriate payoff functions. For that, we suggest a
particular model, which we call Alpha model. Within this model, we suggest a
method, called shifting, which makes it possible to partially control the
behavior of massive users.
  This Note is addressed to researchers in both game theory (providing a new
class of real life problems) and information retrieval, for whom we present new
techniques to control the IR environment.
