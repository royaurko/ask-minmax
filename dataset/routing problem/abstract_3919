We consider the Goursat problem in the plane for partial differential
operators whose principal part is the $p$th power of the standard Laplace
operator. The data is posed on a union of $2p$ distinct lines through the
origin. We show that the solvability of this Goursat problem depends on
Diophantine properties of the geometry of lines on which the data is posed.
