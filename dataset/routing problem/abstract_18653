Periodic and quasi-periodic solutions of the n-body problem can be found as
minimizers of the Lagrangian action functional restricted to suitable spaces of
symmetric paths. The main purpose of this paper is to develop a systematic
approach to the equivariant minimization for the three-body problem in the
three-dimensional space. First we give a finite complete list of symmetry
groups fit to the minimization of the action, with the property that any other
symmetry group can be reduced to be isomorphic to one of these representatives.
A second step is to prove that the resulting (local and global) symmetric
action-minimizers are always collisionless (when they are not already bound to
collisions). Furthermore, we prove some results addressed to the question
whether minimizers are planar or non-planar; as a consequence of the theory we
will give general criteria for a symmetry group to yield planar or homographic
minimizers (either homographic or not, as in the Chenciner-Montgomery eight
solution); on the other hand we will provide a rigorous proof of the existence
of some interesting one-parameter families of periodic and quasi-periodic
non-planar orbits. These include the choreographic Marchal's $P_{12}$ family
with equal masses -- together with a less-symmetric choreographic family (which
anyway probably coincides with the $P_{12}$).
