The periodic standing wave approach to binary inspiral assumes rigid rotation
of gravitational fields and hence helically symmetric solutions. To exploit the
symmetry, numerical computations must solve for ``helical scalars,'' fields
that are functions only of corotating coordinates, the labels on the helical
Killing trajectories. Here we present the formalism for describing linearized
general relativity in terms of helical scalars and we present solutions to the
mixed partial differential equations of the linearized gravity problem (and to
a toy nonlinear problem) using the adapted coordinates and numerical techniques
previously developed for scalar periodic standing wave computations. We argue
that the formalism developed may suffice for periodic standing wave
computations for post-Minkowskian computations and for full general relativity.
