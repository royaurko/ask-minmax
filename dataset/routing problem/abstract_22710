We introduce a general theoretical scheme for a class of phenomena
characterized by an extremal dynamics and quenched disorder. The approach is
based on a transformation of the quenched dynamics into a stochastic one with
cognitive memory and on other concepts which permit a mathematical
characterization of the self-organized nature of the avalanche type dynamics.
In addition it is possible to compute the relevant critical exponents directly
from the microscopic model. A specific application to Invasion Percolation is
presented but the approach can be easily extended to various other problems.
