In this paper we show the convergence of a semidiscrete time stepping
\theta-scheme on a time grid of variable length to the solution of parabolic
operator di?erential inclusion in the framework of evolution triple. The
multifunction is assumed to be strong-weak upper-semicontinuous and to have
nonempty, closed and convex values, while the quasilinear operator present in
the problem is required to be pseudomonotone, coercive and satisfy the
appropriate growth condition. The convergence of piecewise constant and
piecewise linear interpolants constructed on the solutions of time discrete
problems is shown. Under an additional assumption on the sequence of time grids
and regularity of quasilinear operator strong convergence results are obtained.
