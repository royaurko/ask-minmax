A key parameter underlying the existence of sonoluminescence (SL)is the time
relative to SL at which acoustic energy is radiated from the collapsed bubble.
Light scattering is one route to this quantity. We disagree with the statement
of Gompf and Pecha that -highly compressed water causes the minimum in
scattered light to occur 700ps before SL- and that this effect leads to an
overestimate of the bubble wall velocity. We discuss potential artifacts in
their experimental arrangement and correct their description of previous
experiments on Mie scattering.
