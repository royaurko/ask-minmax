We present a method for proving the existence of solutions to a class of one
dimensional variational problems. The method is demonstrated by two examples of
optimal interpolation problems which are motivated by engineering applications.
In each case we prove that the variational problem satisfies the Palais-Smale
condition and the existence of a minimal solution and lower bounds for the
number of stationary curves then follow.
