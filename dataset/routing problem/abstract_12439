We give a simple and entirely elementary proof of Gasper's theorem on the
Markov sequence problem for Jacobi polynomials. It is based on the spectral
analysis of an operator that arises in the study of a probabilistic model of
colliding molecules introduced by Marc Kac. In the process, we obtain some new
integral formulas for ratios of Jacobi polynomials that generalize Gasper's
product formula and a well known formula of Koornwinder.
