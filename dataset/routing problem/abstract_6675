The geography problem is usually stated for simply connected symplectic
4-manifolds. When the first cohomology is nontrivial, however, one can restate
the problem taking into account how close the symplectic manifold is to
satisfying the conclusion of the Hard Lefschetz Theorem, which is measured by a
nonnegative integer called the degeneracy. In this paper we include the
degeneracy as an extra parameter in the geography problem and show how to fill
out the geography of symplectic 4-manifolds with Kodaira dimension 1 for all
admissible triples.
