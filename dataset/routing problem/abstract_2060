Here we report on the structural, optical, electrical and magnetic properties
of Co-doped and (Co,Mo)-codoped SnO2 thin films deposited on r-cut sapphire
substrates by pulsed laser deposition. Substrate temperature during deposition
was kept at 500 C. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the undoped and doped
films are crystalline with predominant orientation along the [101] direction
regardless of the doping concentration and doping element. Optical studies
revealed that the presence of Mo reverts the blue shift trend observed for the
Co-doped films. For the Co and Mo doping concentrations studied, the
incorporation of Mo did not contribute to increase the conductivity of the
films or to enhance the ferromagnetic order of the Co-doped films.
