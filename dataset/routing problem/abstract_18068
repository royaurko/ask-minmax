In this work the problem of inferring interactions and fields for an Ising
neural network from given patterns under a local stability hypothesis (Gardner
problem) is addressed under a dual perspective. By means of duality arguments
an integer linear system is defined whose solution space is the dual of the
space of interactions and whose solutions represent mutually unstable patterns.
We propose and discuss Monte Carlo methods in order to find and remove unstable
patterns and uniformly sample the space of interactions thereafter. We
illustrate the problem on a set of real data and perform ensemble calculation
that shows how the emergence of phase dominated by unstable pattern can be
triggered in a non-linear discontinuous way.
