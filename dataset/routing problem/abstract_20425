The special problem of transport in 2-dimensional divergence-free stochastic
velocity fields is studied by developing a statistical approach, the nested
subensemble method. The nonlinear process of trapping determined by such fields
generates trajectory structures whose statistical characteristics are
determined. These structures strongly influence the transport.
