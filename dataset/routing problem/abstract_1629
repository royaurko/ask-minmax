We extended a previous qualitative study of the intermittent behaviour of a
chaotical nucleonic system, by adding a few quantitative analyses: of the
configuration and kinetic energy spaces, power spectra, Shannon entropies, and
Lyapunov exponents. The system is regarded as a classical "nuclear billiard"
with an oscillating surface of a 2D Woods-Saxon potential well. For the
monopole and dipole vibrational modes we bring new arguments in favour of the
idea that the degree of chaoticity increases when shifting the oscillation
frequency from the adiabatic to the resonance stage of the interaction. The
order-chaos-order-chaos sequence is also thoroughly investigated and we find
that, for the monopole deformation case, an intermittency pattern is again
found. Moreover, coupling between one-nucleon and collective degrees of freedom
is proved to be essential in obtaining chaotic states.
