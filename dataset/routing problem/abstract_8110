A classic problem in enumerative combinatorics is to count the number of
derangements, that is, permutations with no fixed point. Inspired by a recent
generalization to facet derangements of the hypercube by Gordon and McMahon, we
generalize this problem to enumerating derangements in the wreath product of
any finite cyclic group with the symmetric group. We also give q- and (q,
t)-analogs for cyclic derangements, generalizing results of Brenti and Gessel.
