Since genetic algorithm was proposed by John Holland (Holland J. H., 1975) in
the early 1970s, the study of evolutionary algorithm has emerged as a popular
research field (Civicioglu & Besdok, 2013). Researchers from various scientific
and engineering disciplines have been digging into this field, exploring the
unique power of evolutionary algorithms (Hadka & Reed, 2013). Many applications
have been successfully proposed in the past twenty years. For example,
mechanical design (Lampinen & Zelinka, 1999), electromagnetic optimization
(Rahmat-Samii & Michielssen, 1999), environmental protection (Bertini, Felice,
Moretti, & Pizzuti, 2010), finance (Larkin & Ryan, 2010), musical orchestration
(Esling, Carpentier, & Agon, 2010), pipe routing (Furuholmen, Glette, Hovin, &
Torresen, 2010), and nuclear reactor core design (Sacco, Henderson,
Rios-Coelho, Ali, & Pereira, 2009). In particular, its function optimization
capability was highlighted (Goldberg & Richardson, 1987) because of its high
adaptability to different function landscapes, to which we cannot apply
traditional optimization techniques (Wong, Leung, & Wong, 2009). Here we review
the applications of evolutionary algorithms in bioinformatics.
