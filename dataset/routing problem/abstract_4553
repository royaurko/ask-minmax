We study the nonhomogeneous boundary value problem for the Navier-Stokes
equations of steady motion of a viscous incompressible fluid in arbitrary
bounded multiply connected plane or axially-symmetric spatial domains. We prove
that this problem has a solution under the sole necessary condition of zero
total flux through the boundary. The problem was formulated by Jean Leray 80
years ago. The proof of the main result uses Bernoulli's law for a weak
solution to the Euler equations.
