An inaccessible control architecture caused an undesirable influence on a
UAV. The encountered noise in the performance was modeled using stochastic
methods and a corrective term was implemented on an external controller. Our
findings suggest that the sonar noise problem is unconventional may warrant the
development of a new methodology.
