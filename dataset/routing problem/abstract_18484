We propose a unification of some fine-tuning problems -- really in this
article only the problem of why the weak scale is so small in energy compared
to a presumed fundamental scale, being say the Planck scale -- by postulating
the zero or very small value of the cosmological constant not only for one but
for several vacua. This postulate corresponds to what we have called the
Multiple Point Principle, namely that there be many ``vacuum'' states with the
same energy density. We further assume that 6 top quarks and 6 anti-top quarks
can bind by Higgs exchange so strongly as to become tachyonic and form a
condensate. This gives rise to the possibility of having a phase transition
between vacua with and without such a condensate. The two vacua distinguished
by such a condensate will have the same cosmological constant provided the top
Yukawa coupling is about $1.1 \pm 0.2$, in good correspondence with the
experimental value. The further requirement that this value of the Yukawa
coupling, at the weak scale, be compatible with the existence of a third
vacuum, with a Higgs field expectation value of the order of the fundamental
scale, enforces a hierarchical scale ratio between the fundamental and weak
scales of order $10^{16}$ -- $10^{20}$.
