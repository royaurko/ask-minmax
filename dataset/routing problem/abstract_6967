The integration of reasoning and computation services across system and
language boundaries is a challenging problem of computer science. In this
paper, we use integration for the scenario where we have two systems that we
integrate by moving problems and solutions between them. While this scenario is
often approached from an engineering perspective, we take a foundational view.
Based on the generic declarative language MMT, we develop a theoretical
framework for system integration using theories and partial theory morphisms.
Because MMT permits representations of the meta-logical foundations themselves,
this includes integration across logics. We discuss safe and unsafe integration
schemes and devise a general form of safe integration.
