We discuss the local minimality of certain configurations for a nonlocal
isoperimetric problem used to model microphase separation in diblock copolymer
melts. We show that critical configurations with positive second variation are
local minimizers of the nonlocal area functional and, in fact, satisfy a
quantitative isoperimetric inequality with respect to sets that are
$L^1$-close. The link with local minimizers for the diffuse-interface
Ohta-Kawasaki energy is also discussed. As a byproduct of the quantitative
estimate, we get new results concerning periodic local minimizers of the area
functional and a proof, via second variation, of the sharp quantitative
isoperimetric inequality in the standard Euclidean case. As a further
application, we address the global and local minimality of certain lamellar
configurations.
