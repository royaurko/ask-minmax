Nowadays, routing proposals must deal with a panoply of heterogeneous
devices, intermittent connectivity, and the users' constant need for
communication, even in rather challenging networking scenarios. Thus, we
propose a Social-aware Content-based Opportunistic Routing Protocol, SCORP,
that considers the users' social interaction and their interests to improve
data delivery in urban, dense scenarios. Through simulations, using synthetic
mobility and human traces scenarios, we compare the performance of our solution
against other two social-aware solutions, dLife and Bubble Rap, and the
social-oblivious Spray and Wait, in order to show that the combination of
social awareness and content knowledge can be beneficial when disseminating
data in challenging networks.
