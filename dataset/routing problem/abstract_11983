We shortly recall the derivation of the Faddeev-Yakubovsky differential
equations and point out their main advantages. Then we give a review of the
numerical approaches used to solve the bound-state and scattering problems for
the three- and four-body systems based on these equations. A particular
attention is payed to the latest developments.
