In this paper we sketch some reflections on the pitfalls and inconsistencies
of the research program - currently dominant among the profession - aimed at
providing microfoundations to macroeconomics along a Walrasian perspective. We
argue that such a methodological approach constitutes an unsatisfactory answer
to a well-posed research question, and that alternative promising routes have
been long mapped out but only recently explored. In particular, we discuss a
recent agent-based, truly non-Walrasian macroeconomic model, and we use it to
envisage new challenges for future research.
