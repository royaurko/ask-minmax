The problem of constructing Bayesian optimal discriminating designs for a
class of regression models with respect to the T-optimality criterion
introduced by Atkinson and Fedorov (1975a) is considered. It is demonstrated
that the discretization of the integral with respect to the prior distribution
leads to locally T-optimal discrimination designs can only deal with a few
comparisons, but the discretization of the Bayesian prior easily yields to
discrimination design problems for more than 100 competing models. A new
efficient method is developed to deal with problems of this type. It combines
some features of the classical exchange type algorithm with the gradient
methods. Convergence is proved and it is demonstrated that the new method can
find Bayesian optimal discriminating designs in situations where all currently
available procedures fail.
