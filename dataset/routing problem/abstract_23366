We construct a four dimensional realization of a higher dimensional model,
Yukawa deflected gauge mediation, in which supersymmetry breaking is
communicated to the visible sector through both gauge and Yukawa interactions.
The reduction to four dimensions is achieved by `deconstructing' or
`latticizing' the extra dimension. Three sites (gauge groups) are sufficient to
reproduce the spectrum of the higher dimensional model. The characteristic
features of Yukawa deflected gauge mediation, in particular, alignment of
squarks and quarks, and a natural solution to the mu problem, carry over to the
deconstructed version of the model. We comment on the implications of our
results for a solution of the mu problem in the context of deconstructed
gaugino mediation.
