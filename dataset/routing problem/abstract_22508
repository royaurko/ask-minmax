The consideration of the N-body gravitational problem equations can give to
us some class of boundary-value problems defined on the "beem's" construction.
One can considere it as weak or so-called finite element method's approximation
with the linear function's basis. So there are time and coordinate dependent
beems as distances between points and unknown coordinate functions which are
defined on the beems. The possible sample from this class is simple Lalplas
equation where potential energy are maximal. Some computer simulations can give
to us symmetries on spherical coordinates (similar for well known mathematical
structures configurations like Pascal or Desargus configurations).But in other
hand, the consideration of the natural mass distribution can give to us
evidence of the physical reality of the similar structures on the star sphere.
Moreover, there are coupled invariancy for geometry and arithmetics.
