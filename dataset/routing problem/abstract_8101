We give a new solution to the local integrability problem for CR vector
bundles over strictly pseudoconvex real hypersurfaces of dimension seven or
greater. It is based on a KAM rapid convergence argument and avoids the
previous more difficult Nash-Moser methods. The solution is sharp as to
H\"older continuity.
