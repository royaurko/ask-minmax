The Nontrivial Projection Problem asks whether every finite-dimensional
normed space of dimension greater than one admits a well-bounded projection of
non-trivial rank and corank or, equivalently, whether every centrally symmetric
convex body (of arbitrary dimension greater than one) is approximately affinely
equivalent to a direct product of two bodies of non-trivial dimension. We show
that this is true "up to a logarithmic factor."
