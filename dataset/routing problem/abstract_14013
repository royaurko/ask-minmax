Finding the largest code with a given minimum distance is one of the most
basic problems in coding theory. In this paper, we study the linear programming
bound for codes in the Lee metric. We introduce refinements on the linear
programming bound for linear codes in the Lee metric, which give a tighter
bound for linear codes. We also discuss the computational aspects of the
problem and introduce a more compact program by the obtained refinements, and a
recursive method for computing the so-called Lee-numbers, which are important
in the computation of the linear programming bound.
