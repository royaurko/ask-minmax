We address the geometric Cauchy problem for surfaces associated to the
membrane shape equation describing equilibrium configurations of vesicles
formed by lipid bilayers. This is the Euler-Lagrange equation of the
Canham-Helfrich-Evans elastic curvature energy subject to constraints on the
enclosed volume and the surface area. Our approach uses the method of moving
frames and techniques from the theory of exterior differential systems.
