In this paper, we generalize the fuzzy Laplace transformation (FLT) for the
nth derivative of a fuzzy-valued function named as nth derivative theorem and
under the strongly generalized differentiability concept, we use it in an
analytical solution method for the solution of an nth order fuzzy initial value
problem (FIVP). This is a simple approach toward the solution of nth order
fuzzy initial value problem (FIVP) by the nth generalized (FLT) form, and then
we can use it to solve any order of FIVP. The related theorems and properties
are proved. The method is illustrated with the help of some examples. We use
MATLAB to evaluate the inverse Laplace transform.
