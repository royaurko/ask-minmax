In this paper there is proposed a generalized version of the SVM for binary
classification problems in the case of using an arbitrary transformation x ->
y. An approach similar to the classic SVM method is used. The problem is widely
explained. Various formulations of primal and dual problems are proposed. For
one of the most important cases the formulae are derived in detail. A simple
computational example is demonstrated. The algorithm and its implementation is
presented in Octave language.
