A recurrent state of the rotor-routing process on a finite sink-free graph
can be represented by a unicycle that is a connected spanning subgraph
containing a unique directed cycle. We distinguish between short cycles of
length 2 called "dimers" and longer ones called "contours". Then the
rotor-router walk performing an Euler tour on the graph generates a sequence of
dimers and contours which exhibits both random and regular properties. Imposing
initial conditions randomly chosen from the uniform distribution we calculate
expected numbers of dimers and contours and correlation between them at two
successive moments of time in the sequence. On the other hand, we prove that
the excess of the number of contours over dimers is an invariant depending on
planarity of the subgraph but not on initial conditions. In addition, we
analyze the mean-square displacement of the rotor-router walker in the
recurrent state.
