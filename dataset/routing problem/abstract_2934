It is well known that, in theory, the general secure multi-party computation
problem is solvable using circuit evaluation protocols. However, the
communication complexity of the resulting protocols depend on the size of the
circuit that expresses the functionality to be computed and hence can be
impractical. Hence special solutions are needed for specific problems for
efficiency reasons. The point inclusion problem in computational geometry is a
special multiparty computation and has got many applications. Previous
protocols for the secure point inclusion problem are not adequate. In this
paper we modify some known solutions to the point inclusion problem in
computational geometry to the frame work of secure two-party computation.
