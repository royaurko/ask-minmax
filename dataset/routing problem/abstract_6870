In a matroid secretary problem, one is presented with a sequence of objects
of various weights in a random order, and must choose irrevocably to accept or
reject each item. There is a further constraint that the set of items selected
must form an independent set of an associated matroid. Constant-competitive
algorithms (algorithms whose expected solution weight is within a constant
factor of the optimal) are known for many types of matroid secretary problems.
We examine the laminar matroid and show an algorithm achieving provably 0.053
competitive ratio.
