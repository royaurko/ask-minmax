Quantum field theory is assumed to be gauge invariant. However it is well
known that when certain quantities are calculated using perturbation theory the
results are not gauge invariant. The non-gauge invariant terms have to be
removed in order to obtain a physically correct result. In this paper we will
examine this problem and determine why a theory that is supposed to be gauge
invariant produces non-gauge invariant results.
