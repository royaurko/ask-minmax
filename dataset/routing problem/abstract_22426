Considering pure transmission scattering problems in piecewise constant
media, we derive an exact analytic formula for the spectrum of the
corresponding local multi-trace boundary integral operators in the case where
the geometrical configuration does not involve any junction point and all wave
numbers equal. We deduce from this the essential spectrum in the case where
wave numbers vary. Numerical evidences of these theoretical results are also
presented.
