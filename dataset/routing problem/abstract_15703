We present a discussion of the neutrino mass problem in the anti-grand
unification theory based on three family replicated copies of the Standard
Model gauge group (SMG). We consider two versions of the theory, with and
without right-handed neutrinos, and present order of magnitude fits to the 17
measured quark-lepton mass and mixing angle variables. In the model without
right-handed neutrinos, based on the gauge group $SMG^3\times U(1)_f$ and an
isotriplet Higgs, we obtain a good 4 parameter fit, but with a vacuum
oscillation solution to the solar neutrino problem. In the second model, based
on the gauge group $(SMG\times U(1)_{B-L})^3$, we obtain a good 5 parameter fit
using the usual right-handed neutrino see-saw mechanism to generate an LMA-MSW
solution to the solar neutrino problem. The CHOOZ mixing angle bound is easily
satisfied in the first model and is close to the predicted value in the second
model.
