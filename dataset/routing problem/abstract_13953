In this paper, we consider the slack due-window assignment model and study a
single machine scheduling problem of linear time-dependent deteriorating jobs
and a deteriorating maintenance activity. The cost for each job consists of
four components: earliness, tardiness, window location and window size. The
objective is to schedule the jobs and to assign the maintenance activity and
due-windows such that the total cost among all the jobs is minimized. A
polynomial-time algorithm with the running time not exceeding $O(n^2logn)$ to
give a solution to this problem is introduced, where $n$ is the number of jobs.
