In problems of lossy source/noisy channel coding with side information, the
theoretical bounds are achieved using "good" source/channel codes that can be
partitioned into "good" channel/source codes. A scheme that achieves optimality
in channel coding with side information at the encoder using independent
channel and source codes was outlined in previous works. In practice, the
original problem is transformed into a multiple-access problem in which the
superposition of the two independent codes can be decoded using successive
interference cancellation. Inspired by this work, we analyze the superposition
approach for source coding with side information at the decoder. We present a
random coding analysis that shows achievability of the Wyner-Ziv bound. Then,
we discuss some issues related to the practical implementation of this method.
