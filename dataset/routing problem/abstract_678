We attempt a classification of different colloidal gels based on
colloid-colloid interactions. We discriminate primarily between non-equilibrium
and equilibrium routes to gelation, the former case being slaved to
thermodynamic phase separation while the latter is individuated in the
framework of competing interactions and of patchy colloids. Emphasis is put on
recent numerical simulations of colloidal gelation and their connection to
experiments. Finally we underline typical signatures of different gel types, to
be looked in more details in experiments.
