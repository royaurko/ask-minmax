For a large class of vanilla contingent claims, we establish an explicit
F\"ollmer-Schweizer decomposition when the underlying is a process with
independent increments (PII) and an exponential of a PII process. This allows
to provide an efficient algorithm for solving the mean variance hedging
problem. Applications to models derived from the electricity market are
performed.
