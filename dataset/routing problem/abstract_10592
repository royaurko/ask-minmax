We consider the bipartite unconstrained 0-1 quadratic programming problem
(BQP01) which is a generalization of the well studied unconstrained 0-1
quadratic programming problem (QP01). BQP01 has numerous applications and the
problem is known to be MAX SNP hard. We show that if the rank of an associated
$m\times n$ cost matrix $Q=(q_{ij})$ is fixed, then BQP01 can be solved in
polynomial time. When $Q$ is of rank one, we provide an $O(n\log n)$ algorithm
and this complexity reduces to $O(n)$ with additional assumptions. Further, if
$q_{ij}=a_i+b_j$ for some $a_i$ and $b_j$, then BQP01 is shown to be solvable
in $O(mn\log n)$ time. By restricting $m=O(\log n),$ we obtain yet another
polynomially solvable case of BQP01 but the problem remains MAX SNP hard if
$m=O(\sqrt[k]{n})$ for a fixed $k$. Finally, if the minimum number of rows and
columns to be deleted from $Q$ to make the remaining matrix non-negative is
$O(\log n)$ then we show that BQP01 polynomially solvable but it is NP-hard if
this number is $O(\sqrt[k]{n})$ for any fixed $k$.
