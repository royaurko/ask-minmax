The inverse Galois problem is concerned with finding a Galois extension of a
field $K$ with given Galois group. In this paper we consider the particular
case where the base field is $K=\F_p(t)$. We give a conjectural formula for the
minimal number of primes, both finite and infinite, ramified in $G$-extensions
of $K$, and give theoretical and computational proofs for many cases of this
conjecture.
