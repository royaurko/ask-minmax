In this paper we address the problem to compute state dependent feedback
controls for path integral control problems. To this end we generalize the path
integral control formula and utilize this to construct parameterized state
dependent feedback controllers. In addition, we show a novel relation between
control and importance sampling: better control, in terms of control cost,
yields more efficient importance sampling, in terms of effective sample size.
The optimal control provides a zero-variance estimate.
