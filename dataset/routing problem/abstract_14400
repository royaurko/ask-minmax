We solve the noncommutative Noether's problem for the reflection groups by
showing that the skew ?eld of the invariants of the Weyl algebra under the
action of any reection group is a Weyl ?field, that is isomorphic to a skew
fi?eld of some Weyl algebra over a transcendental extension of the ground
fi?eld. We also extend this result to the invariants of the ring of
di?fferential operators on any dimensional torus.The results are applied to
obtain analogs of the Gelfand-Kirillov Conjecture for Cherednik algebras and
Galois algebras.
