The mad spectrum is the set of all cardinalities of infinite maximal almost
disjoint families on omega. We treat the problem to characterize those sets A
which, in some forcing extension of the universe, can be the mad spectrum. We
solve this problem to some extent. What remains open is the possible values of
min(A) and max(A).
