We provide evidence for five long-standing, basis-exchange conjectures for
matroids by proving them for the enormous class of sparse paving matroids. We
also explore the role that these matroids may play in the following problem: as
a function of the size of the ground set, what is the greatest number of cyclic
flats that a matroid can have?
