In this paper we are interested to consider mathematical ways to obtain
different phenomenological fluids from two-component Tachyonic scalar fields.
We consider interaction between components and investigate problem numerically.
Statefinder diagnostics and validity of the generalized second law of
thermodynamics performed and checked. We suppose that our Universe bounded by
Hubble horizon.
