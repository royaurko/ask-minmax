We examine the Maximum Independent Set Problem in an undirected graph. The
main result is that this problem can be considered as the solving the same
problem in a subclass of the weighted normal twin-orthogonal graphs. The
problem is formulated which is dual to the problem above. It is shown that, for
trivial twin-orthogonal graphs, any of its maximal independent set is also
maximum one.
