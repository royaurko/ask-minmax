In the generic CDM cosmogony, dark-matter halos emerge too lumpy and
centrally concentrated to host observed galactic disks. Moreover, disks are
predicted to be smaller than those observed. We argue that the resolution of
these problems may lie with a combination of the effects of protogalactic
disks, which would have had a mass comparable to that of the inner dark halo
and be plausibly non-axisymmetric, and of massive galactic winds, which at
early times may have carried off as many baryons as a galaxy now contains. A
host of observational phenomena, from quasar absorption lines and intracluster
gas through the G-dwarf problem point to the existence of such winds. Dynamical
interactions will homogenize and smooth the inner halo, and the observed disk
will be the relic of a massive outflow. The inner halo expanded after absorbing
energy and angular momentum from the ejected material. Observed disks formed at
the very end of the galaxy formation process, after the halo had been reduced
to a minor contributor to the central mass budget and strong radial streaming
of the gas had died down.
