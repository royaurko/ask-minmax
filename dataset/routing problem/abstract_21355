ProofPeer strives to be a system for cloud-based interactive theorem proving.
After illustrating why such a system is needed, the paper presents some of the
design challenges that ProofPeer needs to meet to succeed. Contexts are
presented as a solution to the problem of sharing proof state among the users
of ProofPeer. Chronicles are introduced as a way to organize and version
contexts.
