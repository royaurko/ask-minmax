The halting problem for Turing machines is decidable on a set of asymptotic
probability one. Specifically, there is a set B of Turing machine programs such
that (i) B has asymptotic probability one, so that as the number of states n
increases, the proportion of all n-state programs that are in B goes to one;
(ii) B is polynomial time decidable; and (iii) the halting problem H intersect
B is polynomial time decidable. The proof is sensitive to the particular
computational model.
