Considering the context of building management systems with wireless sensor
networks monitoring environmental features, this paper presents a proposal of a
Fuzzy Logic Based Routing Algorithm (FLBRA) to determine the cost of each link
and the identification of the best routes for packet forwarding. We describe
the parameters (Received Signal Strength Indicator - RSSI, Standard Deviation
of the RSSI and Packet Error Rate - PER) for the cost definition of each path,
the sequence of identifying best routes and the results obtained in simulation.
As expected in this proposal, the simulation results showed an increase in the
packet delivery rate compared to RSSI-based forward protocol (RBF).
