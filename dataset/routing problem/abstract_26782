Preconditioning of a linear system obtained from spectral discretization of
time-dependent PDEs often results in a full matrix which is expensive to
compute and store specially when the problem size increases. A matrix-free
implementation is usually applied to resolve this issue. In this framework,
preconditioning is typically challenging since the entries of the matrix are
not explicitly available. In this short note, we propose a statistical approach
to gradually create a preconditioner matrix by collecting the information
obtained from matrix-vector product in the Arnoldi loop of an unpreconditioned
Krylov subspace algorithm. The gathered information are then correlated using a
multiple regressors estimate where the error is assumed to be normally
distributed. This procedure yields a banded diagonal matrix which is then used
as a preconditioner in the next iterative solve. This is repeated between
iterative solves until a good preconditioner is constructed on fly. This
statistically iterative procedure is progressive since the fidelity of the
preconditioning matrix improves by adding more data obtained from matrix-vector
product during the entire solution procedure. The proposed algorithm is
validated for a sample implementation.
