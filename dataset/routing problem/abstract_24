In this paper, we consider the joint opportunistic routing and channel
assignment problem in multi-channel multi-radio (MCMR) cognitive radio networks
(CRNs) for improving aggregate throughput of the secondary users. We first
present the nonlinear programming optimization model for this joint problem,
taking into account the feature of CRNs-channel uncertainty. Then considering
the queue state of a node, we propose a new scheme to select proper forwarding
candidates for opportunistic routing. Furthermore, a new algorithm for
calculating the forwarding probability of any packet at a node is proposed,
which is used to calculate how many packets a forwarder should send, so that
the duplicate transmission can be reduced compared with MAC-independent
opportunistic routing & encoding (MORE) [11]. Our numerical results show that
the proposed scheme performs significantly better that traditional routing and
opportunistic routing in which channel assignment strategy is employed.
