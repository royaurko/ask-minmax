We study the stability for the direct acoustic scattering problem with
sound-hard scatterers with minimal regularity assumptions on the scatterers.
The main tool we use for this purpose is the convergence in the sense of Mosco.
  We obtain uniform decay estimates for scattered fields and we investigate how
a sound-hard screen may be approximated by thin sound-hard obstacles.
