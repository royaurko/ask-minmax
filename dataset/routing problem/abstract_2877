A broad range of inverse problems can be abstracted into the problem of
minimizing the sum of several convex functions in a Hilbert space. We propose a
proximal decomposition algorithm for solving this problem with an arbitrary
number of nonsmooth functions and establish its convergence. The algorithm
fully decomposes the problem in that it involves each function individually via
its own proximity operator. A significant improvement over the methods
currently in use in the area of inverse problems is that it is not limited to
two nonsmooth functions. Numerical applications to signal and image processing
problems are demonstrated.
