A lossy source coding problem is studied in which a source encoder
communicates with two decoders, one with and one without correlated side
information with an additional constraint on the privacy of the side
information at the uninformed decoder. Two cases of this problem arise
depending on the availability of the side information at the encoder. The set
of all feasible rate-distortion-equivocation tuples are characterized for both
cases. The difference between the informed and uninformed cases and the
advantages of encoder side information for enhancing privacy are highlighted
for a binary symmetric source with erasure side information and Hamming
distortion.
