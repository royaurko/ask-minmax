In this paper, we use entropy functions to characterise the set of
rate-capacity tuples achievable with either zero decoding error, or vanishing
decoding error, for general network coding problems. We show that when sources
are colocated, the outer bound obtained by Yeung, A First Course in Information
Theory, Section 15.5 (2002) is tight and the sets of zero-error achievable and
vanishing-error achievable rate-capacity tuples are the same. We also
characterise the set of zero-error and vanishing-error achievable rate capacity
tuples for network coding problems subject to linear encoding constraints,
routing constraints (where some or all nodes can only perform routing) and
secrecy constraints. Finally, we show that even for apparently simple networks,
design of optimal codes may be difficult. In particular, we prove that for the
incremental multicast problem and for the single-source secure network coding
problem, characterisation of the achievable set is very hard and linear network
codes may not be optimal.
