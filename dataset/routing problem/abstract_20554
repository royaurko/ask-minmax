The main objective of this addendum to the mentioned article by Park is to
provide some remarks on bifurcation theories for nonlinear partial differential
equations (PDE) and their applications to fluid dynamics problems. We only wish
to comment and list some related literatures, without any intention to provide
a complete survey.
