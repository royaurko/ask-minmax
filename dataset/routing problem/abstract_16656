Recently there has been some controversy in the literature concerning the
existence of a fermion sign problem in the $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetric
Yang--Mills (SYM) theories on the lattice. In this work, we address this issue
by conducting Monte Carlo simulations not only for $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ but also
for $\mathcal{N}=(8,8)$ SYM in two dimensions for the U(N) theories with N=2,
using the new ideas derived from topological twisting followed by geometric
discretization. Our results from simulations provide the evidence that these
theories do {\it not} suffer from a sign problem as the continuum limit is
approached. These results thus boost confidence that these new lattice
formulations can be used successfully to explore the nonperturbative aspects of
the four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory.
