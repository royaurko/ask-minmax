In this paper, a framework for experimental parameters in which Packet
Delivery Ratio (PDR), effect of link duration over End-to-End Delay (E2ED) and
Normalized Routing Overhead (NRO) in terms of control packets is analyzed and
modeled for Mobile Ad-Hoc NETworks (MANETs) and Vehicular Ad-Hoc NETworks
(VANETs) with the assumption that nodes (vehicles) are sparsely moving in two
different road. Moreover, this paper contributes the performance comparison of
one Proactive Routing Protocol; Destination Sequenced Distance vector (DSDV)
and two reactive protocols; DYnamic Source Routing (DSR) and DYnamic MANET
On-Demand (DYMO). A novel contribution of this work is enhancements in default
versions of selected routing protocols. Three performance parameters; PDR, E2ED
and NRO with varying scalabilities are measured to analyze the performance of
selected routing protocols with their original and enhanced versions. From
extensive simulations, it is observed that DSR outperforms among all three
protocols at the cost of delay. NS-2 simulator is used for simulation with
TwoRayGround propagation model to evaluate analytical results.
