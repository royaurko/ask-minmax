It is shown that the eigenvalue problem for the hermitian Wilson-Dirac
operator of for a uniform magnetic field in two dimensions can be reduced to
one-dimensional problem described by a relativistic analog of the Harper
equation. An explicit formula for the secular equations is given in term of a
set of polynomials. The spectrum exhibits a fractal structure in the infinite
volume limit. An exact result concerning the index theorem for the overlap
Dirac operator is obtained.
