We re-examine vacuum oscillation solutions of the solar neutrino problem
taking (a) the results on total rates, electron energy spectrum, and the
seasonal variations from the 708 day SuperKamiokande data and (b) those on
total rates from the Chlorine and Gallium experiments. Best fit values for the
mixing angle and mass splitting are found for oscillations to sequential and
sterile neutrinos and the 90% C.L. allowed regions are determined.
