This review covers hot cores in the context of high-mass star formation.
After giving an overview of chemical processes and diversity during high-mass
star formation, it reviews the `warm envelope' phase which probably precedes
the formation of hot cores. Some recent determinations of the cosmic-ray
ionization rate are discussed, as well as recent evidence for hot cores around
low-mass stars. Routes for future hot core research are outlined.
