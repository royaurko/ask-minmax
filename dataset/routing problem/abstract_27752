The method of characteristics is a key tool for studying consistency of
equations of motion; it allows issues such as predictability, maximal
propagation speed, superluminality, unitarity and acausality to be addressed
without requiring explicit solutions. We review this method and its application
to massive gravity theories to show the limitations of these models' physical
viability: Among their problems are loss of unique evolution, superluminal
signals, matter coupling inconsistencies and micro-acausality (propagation of
signals around local closed timelike/causal curves). We extend previous no-go
results to the entire three-parameter range of massive gravity theories. It is
also argued that bimetric models suffer a similar fate.
