In this issue we announce a fascinating series of works on the comparison of
various types of convergence of sequences of functions. Some of these
properties are provably related to some of the properties which were introduced
in the earlier issues of the SPM Bulletin, and many problems remain open.
Section 2, written by Lev Bukovsk\'y, contains a brief survey of some of the
major open problems in this area.
  This issue gives the first example of the importance of the transmission of
knowledge between the recipients of this bulletin: One of the announcements
implies a solution to one of the problems posed in an independent paper
announced here.  looking forward to receive more announcements from other
recipients and readers of the bulletin.
