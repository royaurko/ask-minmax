We present a deterministic near-linear time algorithm that computes the
edge-connectivity and finds a minimum cut for a simple undirected unweighted
graph G with n vertices and m edges. This is the first o(mn) time deterministic
algorithm for the problem. In near-linear time we can also construct the
classic cactus representation of all minimum cuts.
  The previous fastest deterministic algorithm by Gabow from STOC'91 took
~O(m+k^2 n), where k is the edge connectivity, but k could be Omega(n).
  At STOC'96 Karger presented a randomized near linear time Monte Carlo
algorithm for the minimum cut problem. As he points out, there is no better way
of certifying the minimality of the returned cut than to use Gabow's slower
deterministic algorithm and compare sizes.
  Our main technical contribution is a near-linear time algorithm that contract
vertex sets of a simple input graph G with minimum degree d, producing a
multigraph with ~O(m/d) edges which preserves all minimum cuts of G with at
least 2 vertices on each side.
  In our deterministic near-linear time algorithm, we will decompose the
problem via low-conductance cuts found using PageRank a la Brin and Page
(1998), as analyzed by Andersson, Chung, and Lang at FOCS'06. Normally such
algorithms for low-conductance cuts are randomized Monte Carlo algorithms,
because they rely on guessing a good start vertex. However, in our case, we
have so much structure that no guessing is needed.
