In this paper we illustrate an interesting example of low scale inflation
with an extremely large number of e-foldings. This realization can be
implemented easily in hybrid inflation model where usually inflation ends via
phase transition. However this phase transition can be so prolong that there is
a subsequent epoch of slow roll inflation governed by the dynamics of two
fields. This second bout of inflation can even resolve the $\eta$ problem which
plagues certain kind of inflationary models. However we also notice that for
extremely low scale inflation it is hard to obtain the right amplitude for the
scalar density perturbations. In this regard we invoke alternative mechanisms
for generating fluctuations. We also describe how to ameliorate the
cosmological moduli problem in this context.
