When providing directions to a place, web and mobile mapping services are all
able to suggest the shortest route. The goal of this work is to automatically
suggest routes that are not only short but also emotionally pleasant. To
quantify the extent to which urban locations are pleasant, we use data from a
crowd-sourcing platform that shows two street scenes in London (out of
hundreds), and a user votes on which one looks more beautiful, quiet, and
happy. We consider votes from more than 3.3K individuals and translate them
into quantitative measures of location perceptions. We arrange those locations
into a graph upon which we learn pleasant routes. Based on a quantitative
validation, we find that, compared to the shortest routes, the recommended ones
add just a few extra walking minutes and are indeed perceived to be more
beautiful, quiet, and happy. To test the generality of our approach, we
consider Flickr metadata of more than 3.7M pictures in London and 1.3M in
Boston, compute proxies for the crowdsourced beauty dimension (the one for
which we have collected the most votes), and evaluate those proxies with 30
participants in London and 54 in Boston. These participants have not only rated
our recommendations but have also carefully motivated their choices, providing
insights for future work.
