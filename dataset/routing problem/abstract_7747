In this paper (Part II), the so-called inverse problem is treated. This means
the question whether it is possible to define pre-radar charts, i.e. generating
functions in arbitrary space-times. This problem is subtle. A local general
constructive solution of it is presented. Sufficient conditions for the
existence of global solutions are given.
