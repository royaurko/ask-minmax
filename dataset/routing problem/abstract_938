Security remains as a major concern in the mobile ad hoc networks. This paper
presents a new protocol SD-AODV, which is an extension of the exiting protocol
AODV. The proposed protocol is made secure and dynamic against three main types
of routing attacks- wormhole attack, byzantine attack and blackhole attack.
SD-AODV protocol was evaluated through simulation experiments done on Glomosim
and performance of the network was measured in terms of packet delivery
fraction, average end-to-end delay, global throughput and route errors of a
mobile ad hoc network where a defined percentage of nodes behave maliciously.
Experimentally it was found that the performance of the network did not degrade
in the presence of the above said attacks indicating that the proposed protocol
was secure against these attacks.
