We formulate the problem of perception in the framework of information
theory, and prove that categorical perception is equivalent to the existence of
an observable that has the maximum possible information on the target of
perception. We call such an observable maximally informative. Regardless
whether categorical perception is real, maximally informative observables can
form the basis of a theory of perception. We conclude with the implications of
such a theory for the problem of speech perception.
