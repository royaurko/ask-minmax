This paper considers the problem of adaptive estimation of a non-homogeneous
intensity function from the observation of n independent Poisson processes
having a common intensity that is randomly shifted for each observed
trajectory. We show that estimating this intensity is a deconvolution problem
for which the density of the random shifts plays the role of the convolution
operator. In an asymptotic setting where the number n of observed trajectories
tends to infinity, we derive upper and lower bounds for the minimax quadratic
risk over Besov balls. Non-linear thresholding in a Meyer wavelet basis is used
to derive an adaptive estimator of the intensity. The proposed estimator is
shown to achieve a near-minimax rate of convergence. This rate depends both on
the smoothness of the intensity function and the density of the random shifts,
which makes a connection between the classical deconvolution problem in
nonparametric statistics and the estimation of a mean intensity from the
observations of independent Poisson processes.
