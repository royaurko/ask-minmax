In the paper, we discuss on the egg domains: $$
\Omega_a=\left\{\xi=(z,w)\in\bold C^{n+m}: \ z\in\bold C^n, \ w\in\bold C^m,
|z|^2+|w|^{2/a}<1\right\}, \qquad 0<a\le 2. $$ We show that Gleason's problem
can be solved in the weight Bergman space on theegg domains. The proof will
need the help of the recent work of the second named contributor on the weighted
Bergman projections on this kind of domain. As an application, we obtain a
multiplier theorem on the egg domains.
