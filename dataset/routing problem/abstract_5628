For a connected graph G=(V,E), a subset U of V is called a disconnected cut
if U disconnects the graph and the subgraph induced by U is disconnected as
well. We show that the problem to test whether a graph has a disconnected cut
is NP-complete. This problem is polynomially equivalent to the following
problems: testing if a graph has a 2K2-partition, testing if a graph allows a
vertex-surjective homomorphism to the reflexive 4-cycle and testing if a graph
has a spanning subgraph that consists of at most two bicliques. Hence, as an
immediate consequence, these three decision problems are NP-complete as well.
This settles an open problem frequently posed in each of the four settings.
