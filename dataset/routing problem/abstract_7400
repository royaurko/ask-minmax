Sexual reproductive behavior has a necessary social coordination component as
willing and capable partners must both be in the right place at the right time.
While there are many known social behavioral adaptations to support solutions
to this problem, we explore the possibility and likelihood of solutions that
rely only on non-social mechanisms. We find three kinds of social organization
that help solve this social coordination problem (herding, assortative mating,
and natal philopatry) emerge in populations of simulated agents with no social
mechanisms available to support these organizations. We conclude that the
non-social origins of these social organizations around sexual reproduction may
provide the environment for the development of social solutions to the same and
different problems.
