We consider approximation problems for tensor product and additive random
fields based on standard information in the average case setting. We also study
the probabilistic setting of the mentioned problem for tensor products. The
main question we are concerned with in this paper is ``How much do we loose by
considering standard information algorithms against those using general linear
information?'' For both types of the fields, the error of linear algorithms has
been studied in great detail. However, the power of standard information for
them was not addressed so far, which we do here. Our main conclusion is that in
most interesting cases there is no more than a logarithmic loss in
approximation error when information is being restricted to the standard one.
  The results are obtained by randomization techniques.
