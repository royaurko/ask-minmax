Non-convex constraints have recently proven a valuable tool in many
optimisation problems. In particular sparsity constraints have had a
significant impact on sampling theory, where they are used in Compressed
Sensing and allow structured signals to be sampled far below the rate
traditionally prescribed.
  Nearly all of the theory developed for Compressed Sensing signal recovery
assumes that samples are taken using linear measurements. In this paper we
instead address the Compressed Sensing recovery problem in a setting where the
observations are non-linear. We show that, under conditions similar to those
required in the linear setting, the Iterative Hard Thresholding algorithm can
be used to accurately recover sparse or structured signals from few non-linear
observations.
  Similar ideas can also be developed in a more general non-linear optimisation
framework. In the second part of this paper we therefore present related result
that show how this can be done under sparsity and union of subspaces
constraints, whenever a generalisation of the Restricted Isometry Property
traditionally imposed on the Compressed Sensing system holds.
