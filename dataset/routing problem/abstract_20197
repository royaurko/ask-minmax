We prove that the quasivariety of groups generated by finite and locally
indicable groups does not contain the class of periodic groups. This result is
related to (and inspired by) the solvability of equations over groups. The
proof uses the Feit-Thompson theorem on the solvability of finite groups of odd
order, Kostrikin-Zelmanov results on the restricted Burnside problem and
applies techninal details of a recent construction of weakly finitely presented
periodic groups.
