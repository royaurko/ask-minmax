Two sets of amorphous carbon materials prepared at different routes are
irradiated with swift (145 MeV) heavy ion (Ne6+). The structural parameters
like the size of ordered grains along c and a axis i.e. Lc & La, the average
spacing of the crystallographic planes (002) i.e. d002 and the fraction of the
amorphous phase of the unirradiated and the irradiated samples are estimated by
X-ray diffraction technique. The fraction of the amorphous phase is generally
found to increase with the irradiation dose for both sets of the samples. The
estimated and values are found to be almost unaffected by irradiation. The
estimated values of corroborate with the increase of disorder in both sets of
the samples with the increasing dose of irradiation. Keywords: X-ray
