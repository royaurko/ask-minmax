We present an analytical theory of thermonuclear X-ray burst atmosphere
structure. Newtonian gravity and diffusion approximation are assumed.
Hydrodynamic and thermodynamic profiles are obtained as a numerical solution of
the Cauchy problem for the first-order ordinary differential equation. We
further elaborate a combined approach to the radiative transfer problem which
yields the spectrum of the expansion stage of X-ray bursts in analytical form
where Comptonization and free-free absorption-emission processes are accounted
for and tau ~ r^{-2} opacity dependence is assumed. Relaxation method on an
energy opacity grid is used to simulate radiative diffusion process in order to
match analytical form of spectrum, which contains free parameter, to energy
axis. Numerical and analytical results show high similarity. All spectra
consist of a power-law soft component and diluted black-body hard tail. We
derive simple approximation formulae usable for mass-radius determination by
observational spectra fitting.
