We study the inverse spectral problem of reconstructing energy-dependent
Sturm-Liouville equations from their Dirichlet spectra and sequences of the
norming constants. For the class of problems under consideration, we give a
complete description of the corresponding spectral data, suggest a
reconstruction algorithm, and establish uniqueness of reconstruction. The
approach is based on connection between spectral problems for energy-dependent
Sturm-Liouville equations and for Dirac operators of special form.
