In an elegant paper, D. Nelson suggested a method to produce tetravalent
colloids based on a tetrahedral configuration created on the surface of a
spherical particle. It emerges from a two-dimensional nematic liquid crystal
placed on a sphere due to the presence of four 1/2 disclinations, i.e.,
topological defects in the orientational order. In this paper we show that such
a tetrahedral configuration also occurs in the wetting layers which form around
spheres dispersed in a liquid crystal above the nematic-isotropic phase
transition. Nematic wetting therefore offers an alternative route towards
tetravalent colloids.
