In the framework of the inverse problem of Dynamics we investigate the
compatibility between a two-parametric family of precessing orbits and
autonomous force fields. In a previous work, for a specific choice of the two
parameters in the precessing family of orbits, we obtained that if the family
is compatible with a central force, than this is derived from a Manev's type
potential. In this work we consider another choice of the parameters in the
two-parametric family of precessing orbits, for which we know that there is no
central force compatible and study its compatibility with an autonomous force
field.
