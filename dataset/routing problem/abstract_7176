In this research paper, the problem of optimization of a quadratic form over
the convex hull generated by the corners of hypercube is attempted and solved.
It is reasoned that under some conditions, the optimum occurs at the corners of
hypercube. Results related to the computation of global optimum stable state
(an NP hard problem) are discussed. An algorithm is proposed. It is hoped that
the results shed light on resolving the P not equal to NP problem.
