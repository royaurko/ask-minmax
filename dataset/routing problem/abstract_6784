Gecode is one of the most efficient libraries that can be used for constraint
solving. However, using it requires dealing with C++ programming details. On
the other hand several formats for representing constraint networks have been
proposed. Among them, XCSP has been proposed as a format based on XML which
allows us to represent constraints defined either extensionally or
intensionally, permits global constraints and has been the standard format of
the international competition of constraint satisfaction problems solvers. In
this paper we present a plug-in for solving problems specified in XCSP by
exploiting the Gecode solver. This is done by dynamically translating
constraints into Gecode library calls, thus avoiding the need to interact with
C++.
