Nash equilibrium is the most commonly-used notion of equilibrium in game
theory. However, it suffers from numerous problems. Some are well known in the
game theory community; for example, the Nash equilibrium of repeated prisoner's
dilemma is neither normatively nor descriptively reasonable. However, new
problems arise when considering Nash equilibrium from a computer science
perspective: for example, Nash equilibrium is not robust (it does not tolerate
``faulty'' or ``unexpected'' behavior), it does not deal with coalitions, it
does not take computation cost into account, and it does not deal with cases
where players are not aware of all aspects of the game. Solution concepts that
try to address these shortcomings of Nash equilibrium are discussed.
