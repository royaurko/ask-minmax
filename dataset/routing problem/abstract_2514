Micron-sized magnetic platelets in the flux closed vortex state are
characterized by an in-plane curling magnetization and a nanometer-sized
perpendicularly magnetized vortex core. Having the simplest non-trivial
configuration, these objects are of general interest to micromagnetics and may
offer new routes for spintronics applications. Essential progress in the
understanding of nonlinear vortex dynamics was achieved when low-field core
toggling by excitation of the gyrotropic eigenmode at sub-GHz frequencies was
established. At frequencies more than an order of magnitude higher vortex state
structures possess spin wave eigenmodes arising from the magneto-static
interaction. Here we demonstrate experimentally that the unidirectional vortex
core reversal process also occurs when such azimuthal modes are excited. These
results are confirmed by micromagnetic simulations which clearly show the
selection rules for this novel reversal mechanism. Our analysis reveals that
for spin wave excitation the concept of a critical velocity as the switching
condition has to be modified.
