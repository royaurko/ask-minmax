An argument is made to show that the singularity in the General Theory of
Relativity (GTR) is the expression of a non-Machian feature. It can be avoided
with a scale-invariant dynamical theory, a property lacking in GTR. It is
further argued that the global non-conservation of energy in GTR also results
from the lack of scale-invariance and the field formulation presented by
several contributors can only resolve the problem in part. A truly scale-invariant
theory is required to avoid these two problems in a more consistent approach
