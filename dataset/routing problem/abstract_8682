In this work, we prove the existence of least energy nodal solution for a
class of elliptic problem in both cases, bounded and unbounded domain, when the
nonlinearity has exponential critical growth in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Moreover, we
also prove a nonexistence result of least energy nodal solution for the
autonomous case in whole $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.
