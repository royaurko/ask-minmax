Two meta-evolutionary optimization strategies described in this paper
accelerate the convergence of evolutionary programming algorithms while still
retaining much of their ability to deal with multi-modal problems. The
strategies, called directional mutation and recorded step in this paper, can
operate independently but together they greatly enhance the ability of
evolutionary programming algorithms to deal with fitness landscapes
characterized by long narrow valleys. The directional mutation aspect of this
combined method uses correlated meta-mutation but does not introduce a full
covariance matrix. These new methods are thus much more economical in terms of
storage for problems with high dimensionality. Additionally, directional
mutation is rotationally invariant which is a substantial advantage over
self-adaptive methods which use a single variance per coordinate for problems
where the natural orientation of the problem is not oriented along the axes.
