Purpose: Parallel MRI (pMRI) and compressed sensing MRI (CS-MRI) have been
considered as two distinct reconstruction problems. Motivated by recent
breakthroughs such as SAKE (simultaneous autocalibrating and k-space
estimation) or LORAKS (Low-rank modelling of local k-space neighborhoods), an
annihilating filter based low-rank Hankel matrix approach (ALOHA) is proposed
as a general framework which unifies pMRI and CS-MRI as a weighted k-space
interpolation problem. Theory and Methods: Our framework exploits an
annihilating filter relationship originating from the sparsity in the transform
domain as well as from parallel acquisition physics. This results in a
rank-deficient Hankel structured matrix, whose missing data can be recovered
with a low rank structured matrix completion algorithm after a k-space
weighting. In particular, when the underlying image can be sparsified with a
wavelet transform, the low rank matrix completion problem can be solved with a
multi-scale pyramid resulting in efficient computation. Results: Experimental
results with in vivo data for single/multi-coil imaging as well as dynamic
imaging confirmed that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art
pMRI and CS-MRI. Conclusion: By reformulating the pMRI and CS-MRI as a weighted
k-space interpolation problem that can be solved using a low rank Hankel
structured matrix completion, the generalized ALOHA framework provides better
insight into MRI reconstruction problems.
