The large value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio in the cosmic microwave
background radiation reported by the BICEP2 collaboration gives strong impact
on models of supersymmetry (SUSY). The large ratio indicates inflation with a
high-energy scale and thus a high reheating temperature in general, and various
SUSY models suffer from the serious gravitino and Polonyi problems. In this
article, we discuss a class of the high-scale SUSY breaking models which are
completely free from those problems. With especially focusing on the dark
matter relic abundance, we examine how the BICEP2 result narrows down the
parameter space of the models, assuming the simplest chaotic inflation model.
We find that the mass of the dark matter is predicted to be less than about 1
TeV thanks to the non-thermal production in the early universe through the
decay of abundant gravitinos produced after the reheating process. We also
discuss implications in some details to dark matter searches at collider and
indirect dark matter detection experiments.
