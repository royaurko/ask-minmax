In this paper, we present path loss model for VANETs and simulate three
routing protocols; Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV), Optimized Link
State Routing (OLSR) and Dynamic MANET On-demand (DYMO) to evaluate and compare
their performance using NS-2. The main contribution of this work is enhancement
of existing techniques to achieve high efficiency of the underlying networks.
After extensive simulations in NS-2, we conclude that DSDV best performs with
802.11p while DYMO gives outstanding performance with 802.11.
