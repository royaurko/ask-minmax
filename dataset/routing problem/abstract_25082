We introduce a new probabilistic method for solving a class of impulse
control problems based on their representations as Backward Stochastic
Differential Equations (BSDEs for short) with constrained jumps. As an example,
our method is used for pricing Swing options. We deal with the jump constraint
by a penalization procedure and apply a discrete-time backward scheme to the
resulting penalized BSDE with jumps. We study the convergence of this numerical
method, with respect to the main approximation parameters: the jump intensity
$\lambda$, the penalization parameter $p > 0$ and the time step. In particular,
we obtain a convergence rate of the error due to penalization of order
$(\lambda p)^{\alpha - \frac{1}{2}}, \forall \alpha \in \left(0,
\frac{1}{2}\right)$. Combining this approach with Monte Carlo techniques, we
then work out the valuation problem of (normalized) Swing options in the Black
and Scholes framework. We present numerical tests and compare our results with
a classical iteration method.
