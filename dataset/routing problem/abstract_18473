We reconsider the problems of cosmological inflation in effective
supergravity theories. A singlet field in a hidden sector is demonstrated to
yield an acceptable inflationary potential, without fine tuning. In the
simplest such model, the requirement of generating the microwave background
anisotropy measured by COBE fixes the inflationary scale to be about $10^{14}$
GeV, implying a reheat temperature of order $10^{5}$ GeV. This is low enough to
solve the gravitino problem but high enough to allow baryogenesis after
inflation. Such consistency requires that the generation of gravitational waves
be negligible and that the spectrum of scalar density perturbations depart
significantly from scale-invariance, thus improving the fit to large-scale
structure in an universe dominated by cold dark matter. We also consider the
problems associated with gravitino production through inflaton decay and with
other weakly coupled fields such as the moduli encountered in (compactified)
string theories.
