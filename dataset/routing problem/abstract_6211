We discuss a simple predictive solution to the solar neutrino problem based
on maximal vacuum neutrino oscillations. The solution can be motivated by the
exact parity symmetric model which predicts that the neutrino mass eigenstates
are maximal mixtures of ordinary and mirror weak eigenstates (if neutrinos are
massive). We show that this proposed solution to the solar neutrino problem is
in reasonable agreement with the experiments, and that in the near future this
scheme may be either ruled out or tested more precisely as statistics improve
for the SAGE and GALLEX experiments. Predictions are also given for the
upcoming Superkamiokande, SNO and Borexino experiments.
