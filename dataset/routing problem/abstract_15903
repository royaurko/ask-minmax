Veronese webs are rich geometric structures with deep relationships to
various domains of mathematics. The PDEs which determine the Veronese web are
overdetermined if dim >3, but in the case dim =3 they reduce to a special
flavor of a non-linear wave equation. The symmetries embedded in the definition
of a Veronese web reveal themselves as B\"acklund--Darboux transformations
between these non-linear wave equations.
  On the other hand, the twistor transform identifies Veronese webs with moduli
spaces of rational curves on certain complex surfaces. These moduli spaces can
be described in terms of the non-linear Riemann problem. This reduces solutions
of these non-linear wave equations to the non-linear Riemann problem.
  We examine these relationships in the particular case of 3-dimensional
Veronese webs, simultaneously investigating how these notions relate to general
notions of geometry of webs.
