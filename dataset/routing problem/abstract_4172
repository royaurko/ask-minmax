We show that polar codes can be used to achieve the rate-distortion functions
in the problem of hierarchical source coding also known as the successive
refinement problem. We also analyze the distributed version of this problem,
constructing a polar coding scheme that achieves the rate distortion functions
for successive refinement with side information.
