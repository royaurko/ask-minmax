This note is devoted to the study of the finite volume methods used in the
discretization of degenerate parabolic-hyperbolic equation with zero-flux
boundary condition. The notion of an entropy-process solution, successfully
used for the Dirichlet problem, is insufficient to obtain a uniqueness and
convergence result because of a lack of regularity of solutions on the
boundary. We infer the uniqueness of an entropy-process solution using the tool
of the nonlinear semigroup theory by passing to the new abstract notion of
integral-process solution. Then, we prove that numerical solution converges to
the unique entropy solution as the mesh size tends to 0.
