For every finitely generated recursively presented group G we construct a
finitely presented group H containing G such that G is (Frattini) embedded into
H and the group H has solvable conjugacy problem if and only if G has solvable
conjugacy problem. Moreover G and H have the same r.e. Turing degrees of the
conjugacy problem. This solves a problem by D. Collins.
