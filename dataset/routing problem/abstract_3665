We present a new formulation of the maximum clique problem of a graph in
complex space. We start observing that the adjacency matrix A of a graph can
always be written in the form A = B B where B is a complex, symmetric matrix
formed by vectors of zero length (null vectors) and the maximum clique problem
can be transformed in a geometrical problem for these vectors. This problem, in
turn, is translated in spinorial language and we show that each graph uniquely
identifies a set of pure spinors, that is vectors of the endomorphism space of
Clifford algebras, and the maximum clique problem is formalized in this setting
so that, this much studied problem, may take advantage from recent progresses
of pure spinor geometry.
