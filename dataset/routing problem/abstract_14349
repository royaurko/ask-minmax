In non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) downlink, multiple data flows are
superimposed in the power domain and user decoding is based on successive
interference cancellation. NOMA's performance highly depends on the power split
among the data flows and the associated power allocation (PA) problem. In this
letter, we study NOMA from a fairness standpoint and we investigate PA
techniques that ensure fairness for the downlink users under i) instantaneous
channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter, and ii) average CSI.
Although the formulated problems are non-convex, we have developed
low-complexity polynomial algorithms that yield the optimal solution in both
cases considered.
