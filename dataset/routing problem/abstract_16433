It is well know that the theory of minimal blocking sets is studied by
several contributor. Another theory which is also studied by a large number of
researchers is the theory of hyperplane arrangements. We can remark that the
affine space $AG(n,q)$ is the complement of the line at infinity in $PG(n,q)$.
Then $AG(n,q)$ can be regarded as the complement of an hyperplane arrangement
in $PG(n,q)$! Therefore the study of blocking sets in the affine space
$AG(n,q)$ is simply the study of blocking sets in the complement of a finite
arrangement in $PG(n,q)$. In this paper the contributor generalizes this remark
starting to study the problem of existence of blocking sets in the complement
of a given hyperplane arrangement in $PG(n,q)$. As an example she solves the
problem for the case of braid arrangement. Moreover she poses significant
questions on this new and interesting problem.
