The purity of Werner state in nonextensive formalism associated with two
different constraints has been calculated in a previous paper by G. B. Bagci et
al. [G. B. Bagci et al., Int. J. Mod. Phys. 20, 2085 (2006)]. Two different
results have been obtained corresponding to ordinary probability and escort
probability whereas the former has been shown to result in negative values
thereby leading contributors to deduce the advantage of escort probabilities over
ordinary probabilities. However, this results have been only for a limited
interval of q values which lie between 0 and 1. In this paper, we solve the
same problem for all values of nonextensive index q by using a perturbative
approach and show that the simultaneous use of both types of constraint is
necessary in order to obtain the solution for whole spectrum of nonextensive
index. In this sense, the existence of these different constraints in
nonextensive formalism must not be seen as a deficiency in the formalism but
rather must be welcomed as a means of providing solution for all values of
parameter q.
