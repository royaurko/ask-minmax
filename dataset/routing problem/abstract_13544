The macro-objectivation problem derives from the fact that the Schrodinger
equation is linear and thus requires that a macroscopic system interacting with
an entangled state must be entangled as well. However, such a requirement
entails that the Schrodinger equation must also be solvable in the macroscopic
world in the same way as it is solvable in the microscopic world, which itself
is an assumption. In this work, the alternative assumption that the Schrodinger
equation is in general an intractable problem is considered.
