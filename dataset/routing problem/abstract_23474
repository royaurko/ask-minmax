I study the spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry when higher-dimensional
Yang-Mills or the type-I $SO(32)$ string theory are compactified on magnetized
tori. Because of the universal gyromagnetic ratio $g=2$, the splittings of all
multiplets are given by the product of charge times internal helicity
operators. As a result such compactifications have two remarkable and robust
features: {\it (a)} they can reconcile {\it chirality} with {\it extended}
low-energy supersymmetry in the limit of large tori, and {\it (b)} they can
trigger gauge-symmetry breaking, via Nielsen-Olesen instabilities, at a scale
tied classically to $m_{SUSY}$. I exhibit a compactification of the $SO(32)$
superstring, in which magnetic fields break spontaneously $N=4$ supersymmetry,
produce the standard-model gauge group with three chiral families of quarks and
leptons, and trigger electroweak symmetry breaking. I discuss supertrace
relations and the ensuing ultraviolet softness. As with other known mechanisms
of supersymmetry breaking, the one proposed here faces two open problems: the
threat to perturbative calculability in the decompactification limit, and the
problem of gravitational stability and in particular of the cosmological
constant. I explain, however, why a good classical description of the vacuum
may require small tadpoles for the dilaton, moduli and metric.
