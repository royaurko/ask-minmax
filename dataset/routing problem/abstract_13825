We introduce statistical constraints, a declarative modelling tool that links
statistics and constraint programming. We discuss two statistical constraints
and some associated filtering algorithms. Finally, we illustrate applications
to standard problems encountered in statistics and to a novel inspection
scheduling problem in which the aim is to find inspection plans with desirable
statistical properties.
