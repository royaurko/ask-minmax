Using thermal value of zeta function instead of zero temperature, the
partition function of quantized fields in arbitrary stationary backgrounds was
found to be independent of undetermined regularization constant in
even-dimension and the long drawn problem associated with the trace anomaly
effect had been removed. Here, we explicitly calculate the expression for the
coincidence limit so that the technique may be applied in some specific
problems. A particular problem dealt with here is to calculate the partition
function of massless scalar field in Schwarzschild background.
