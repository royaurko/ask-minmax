We study graph orientations that minimize the entropy of the in-degree
sequence. The problem of finding such an orientation is an interesting special
case of the minimum entropy set cover problem previously studied by Halperin
and Karp [Theoret. Comput. Sci., 2005] and by the current contributors
[Algorithmica, to appear]. We prove that the minimum entropy orientation
problem is NP-hard even if the graph is planar, and that there exists a simple
linear-time algorithm that returns an approximate solution with an additive
error guarantee of 1 bit. This improves on the only previously known algorithm
which has an additive error guarantee of log_2 e bits (approx. 1.4427 bits).
