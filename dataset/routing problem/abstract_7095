We derive a compatible discretization method that relies heavily on the
underlying geometric structure, and obeys the topological sequences and
commuting properties that are constructed. As a sample problem we consider the
vorticity-velocity-pressure formulation of the Stokes problem. We motivate the
choice for a mixed variational formulation based on both geometric as well as
physical arguments. Numerical tests confirm the theoretical results that we
obtain a pointwise divergence-free solution for the Stokes problem and that the
method obtains optimal convergence rates.
