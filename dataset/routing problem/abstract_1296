We study collective T-duality transformations along one, two and three
directions of isometry for the three-sphere with H-flux. Our aim is to obtain
new non-geometric backgrounds along lines similar to the example of the
three-torus. However, the resulting backgrounds turn out to be geometric in
nature. To perform the duality transformations, we develop a novel procedure
for non-abelian T-duality, which follows a route different compared to the
known literature, and which highlights the underlying structure from an
alternative point of view.
