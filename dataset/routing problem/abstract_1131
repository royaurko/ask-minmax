We report the chemical synthesis route, structural characterization, and
physical properties of nanofluid magnetic graphite (NFMG) obtained from the
previously synthesized bulk organic magnetic graphite (MG) by stabilizing the
aqueous ferrofluid suspension with an addition of active cationic surfactant.
The measured magnetization-field hysteresis curves along with the temperature
dependence of magnetization confirmed room-temperature ferromagnetism in both
MG and NFMG samples.
