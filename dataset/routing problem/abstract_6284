Let K/F be a cyclic field extension of odd prime degree. We consider Galois
embedding problems involving Galois groups with common quotient Gal(K/F) such
that corresponding normal subgroups are indecomposable Fp[Gal(K/F)]-modules.
For these embedding problems we prove conditions on solvability, formulas for
explicit construction, and results on automatic realizability.
