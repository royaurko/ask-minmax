We study a 2+2 body problem introduced in a previous paper as the circular
double Sitnikov problem. Since the secondary bodies are moving on the same
perpendicular line where evolve the primaries, almost every solution is a
collision orbit. We extend the solutions beyond collisions with a symplectic
regularization and study the set of energy surfaces that contain periodic
orbits and their foliations .
