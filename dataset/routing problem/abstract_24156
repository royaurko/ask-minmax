The calculation of the conductance of disordered rings requires a theory that
goes beyond the Kubo-Drude formulation. Assuming "mesoscopic" circumstances the
analysis of the electro-driven transitions show similarities with a percolation
problem in energy space. We argue that the texture and the sparsity of the
perturbation matrix dictate the value of the conductance, and study its
dependence on the disorder strength, ranging from the ballistic to the Anderson
localization regime. An improved sparse random matrix model is introduced to
captures the essential ingredients of the problem, and leads to a generalized
variable range hopping picture.
