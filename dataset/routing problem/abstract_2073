After the application of an ultrashort laser pulse, the antiferromagnetic
alignment in rare earth-transition metal alloys can temporarily become
ferromagnetic with the rare-earth polarity.
  Proposed models merely describe this effect, without showing the route for
its manipulation. Here we use extensive atomistic spin model simulations and
micromagnetic theory for ferrimagnets at elevated temperatures to predict that
the polarity of this transient ferromagnetic-like state can be controlled by
initial temperature. We show that this arises because the magnetic response of
each lattice has a different temperature dependence, at low temperatures the
transition metal responds faster than the rare earth, while at high
temperatures this role is interchanged. Our findings contribute to the physical
understanding and control of this state and thus open new perspectives for its
use in ultrafast magnetic devices.
