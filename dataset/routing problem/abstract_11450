The correlation between the neutral electromagnetic pion decay, the
Sutherland-Veltman paradox and the $AVV$ triangle anomaly phenomenon is
discussed within the framework of an alternative strategy to handle the
divergences involved in the perturbative evaluation of the associated physical
amplitudes. We show that the general characteristic of the adopted strategy
allows us to recover the traditional treatment for the problem as well as
allows us to construct an alternative way to look at the problem where the
ambiguities play no relevant role.
