Within the framework of restricted four-body problem, we study the motion of
an infinitesimal mass by assuming that the primaries of the system are
radiating-oblate spheroids surrounded by a circular cluster of material points.
In our model, we assume that the two masses of the primaries $m_2$ and $m_3$
are equal to $\mu$ and the mass $m_1$ is $1-2\mu$. By using numerical approach,
we have obtained the equilibrium points and examined their linear stability.
The effect of potential created by the circular cluster and oblateness
coefficients for the more massive primary and the less massive primary, on the
existence and linear stability of the libration point have been critically
examine via numerical computation. The stability of these points examined shows
that the collinear and the non-collinear equilibrium points are unstable. The
result presented in this paper have practical application in astrophysics.
