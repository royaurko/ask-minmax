We analyze a new property of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), called
layerwidth, arising from a class of DAGs proposed by Eiter and Lukasiewicz.
This class of DAGs permits certain problems of structural model-based causality
and explanation to be tractably solved. In this paper, we first address an open
question raised by Eiter and Lukasiewicz - the computational complexity of
deciding whether a given graph has a bounded layerwidth. After proving that
this problem is NP-complete, we proceed by proving numerous important
properties of layerwidth that are helpful in efficiently computing the optimal
layerwidth. Finally, we compare this new DAG property to two other important
DAG properties: treewidth and bandwidth.
