We study the existence, uniqueness and approximation of solutions of
stochastic differential equations with constraints driven by processes with
bounded p-variation. Our main tool are new estimates showing Lipschitz
continuity of the deterministic Skorokhod problem in p-variation norm.
Applications to fractional SDEs with constraints are given.
