The time-dependent electromagnetic field can results both pair waves and pair
particles. It can be for mathematical relations between two functions with
identical argument and difference of phases equal to $\pi$. Two examples both
the opportunity of phase synchronism for different frequencies of at atom-field
interaction with known abnormal dispersion of refraction and the possible
trajectories for pair particles are considered.
