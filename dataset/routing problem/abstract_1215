We address the possibility of non-magnetic doping induced magnetism, in Li
doped SnO2 nano-particles. The compounds have been prepared by solid state
route at equilibrium and were found to be crystallized in single rutile phase.
The magnetization measurements have shown that Li-doping induces magnetism in
SnO2 for a particular range of Li concentration. However, for other Li
concentrations, including pure SnO2, the samples exhibit diamagnetism. To
investigate the possible origin of the induced magnetism, we have studied the
variation of the magnetization as a function of the average nano-particle
radius. Possible scenarios for the appearance of magnetism in these compounds
are discussed.
