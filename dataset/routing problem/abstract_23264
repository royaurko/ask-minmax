Bound q\bar q -systems are considered in the framework of three different
versions of the 3-dimensional reduction of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, all
having the correct one-body limit when one of the constituent quark masses
tends to infinity, and in the framework of the Salpeter equation. The spin
structure of confining qq interaction potential is taken in the form
x\gamma_{1}^{0}\gamma_{2}^{0}+(1-x)I_{1}I_{2}, with 0 \leq x \leq 1. The
problem of existence (nonexistence) of stable solutions of 3-dimensional
relativistic equations for bound q\bar q systems is studied for different
values of x from this interval. Some other aspects of this problem are
discussed.
