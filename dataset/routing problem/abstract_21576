An inverse scattering transform method corresponding to a Riemann-Hilbert
problem is formulated for CH2, the two-component generalization of the
Camassa-Holm (CH) equation. As an illustration of the method, the multi -
soliton solutions corresponding to the reflectionless potentials are
constructed in terms of the scattering data for CH2.
