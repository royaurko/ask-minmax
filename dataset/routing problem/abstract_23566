We discuss a scenario where at least part of the homogeneity on a brane world
can be directly related to the hierarchy problem through warped space. We study
the dynamics of an anti-D3-brane moving toward the infrared cut-off of a warped
background. After a region described by the DBI action, the self-energy of the
anti-D3-brane will dominate over the background. Then the world-volume scale of
the anti-D3-brane is no longer comoving with the background geometry. After it
settles down in the infrared end, the world-volume inhomogeneity will appear,
to a Poincare observer, to be stretched by an exponentially large ratio. This
ratio is close to that of the hierarchy problem between the gravitational and
electroweak scales.
