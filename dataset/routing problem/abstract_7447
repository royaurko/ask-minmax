This paper deals with an extremal problem for bounded harmonic functions in
the unit ball of $\mathbf{R}^n$. We consider the generalized Khavinson problem
in a specific situation -- near the boundary of the unit ball. This problem was
precisely formulated by G. Kresin and V. Maz'ya for harmonic functions in the
unit ball and in the half--space of $\mathbf{R}^n$. The aim is to find the
optimal pointwise estimates for the norm of the gradient of real--valued
harmonic functions. In the case of the unit disc, or the half--plane, theses
estimates are well known, and may be seen as the consequences of the classical
Schwarz lemma.
