It has long been claimed that the antisymmetric tensor field of the second
rank is pure longitudinal after quantization. In my opinion, such a situation
is quite unacceptable. I repeat the well-known procedure of the derivation of
the set of Proca equations. It is shown that it can be written in various
forms. Furthermore, on the basis of the Lagrangian formalism I calculate
dynamical invariants (including the Pauli-Lubanski vector of relativistic spin
for this field). Even at the classical level the Pauli-Lubanski vector can be
equal to zero after applications of well-known constraints. The importance of
the normalization is pointed out for the problem of the description of
quantized fields of maximal spin 1. The correct quantization procedure permits
us to propose a solution of this puzzle in the modern field theory. Finally,
the discussion of the connection of the Ogievetskii-Polubarinov-Kalb-Ramond
field and electrodynamic gauge is presented. PACS: 03.50.-z, 03.50.De,
