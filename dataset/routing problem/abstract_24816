Natural phenomenon of coevolution is the reciprocally induced evolutionary
change between two or more species or population. Though this biological
occurrence is a natural fact, there are only few attempts to use this as a
simile in computation. This paper is an attempt to introduce reciprocally
induced coevolution as a mechanism to counter problems faced by a typical
genetic algorithm applied as an optimization technique. The domain selected for
testing the efficacy of the procedure is the process of finding numerical
solutions of Diophantine equations. Diophantine equations are polynomial
equations in Mathematics where only integer solutions are sought. Such
equations and its solutions are significant in three aspects-(i) historically
they are important as Hilbert's tenth problem with a background of more than
twenty six centuries; (ii) there are many modern application areas of
Diophantine equations like public key cryptography and data dependency in super
computers (iii) it has been proved that there does not exist any general method
to find solutions of such equations. The proposed procedure has been tested
with Diophantine equations with different powers and different number of
variables.
