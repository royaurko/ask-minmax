It is an efficient and effective strategy to utilize the nuclear norm
approximation to learn low-rank matrices, which arise frequently in machine
learning and computer vision. So the exploration of nuclear norm minimization
problems is gaining much attention recently. In this paper we shall prove that
the following Low-Rank Representation (LRR) \cite{icml_2010_lrr,lrr_extention}
problem: {eqnarray*} \min_{Z} \norm{Z}_*, & {s.t.,} & X=AZ, {eqnarray*} has a
unique and closed-form solution, where $X$ and $A$ are given matrices. The
proof is based on proving a lemma that allows us to get closed-form solutions
to a category of nuclear norm minimization problems.
