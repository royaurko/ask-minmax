This paper considers a portfolio optimization problem in which asset prices
are represented by SDEs driven by Brownian motion and a Poisson random measure,
with drifts that are functions of an auxiliary diffusion 'factor' process. The
criterion, following earlier work by Bielecki, Pliska, Nagai and others, is
risk-sensitive optimization (equivalent to maximizing the expected growth rate
subject to a constraint on variance.) By using a change of measure technique
introduced by Kuroda and Nagai we show that the problem reduces to solving a
certain stochastic control problem in the factor process, which has no jumps.
The main result of the paper is that the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for
this problem has a classical solution. The proof uses Bellman's "policy
improvement" method together with results on linear parabolic PDEs due to
Ladyzhenskaya et al.
