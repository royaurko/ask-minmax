In this paper we describe a method to derive classical solutions of the
Navier-Stokes equations for non-stationary initial value problems in domain R^n
(n = 2, 3 or higher). A new closed-form analytic solution of the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations on the decay of vortices in a viscous fluid in R3 is
presented.
