In this report, we consider how to dynamically select transmission bands and
multi-hop routes for device-to-device (D2D) communications in co-existence with
a cellular network overlay. Firstly, we consider different wireless routing
algorithms, i.e. broadcasting-routing (BR) method, and shortest-path-routing
(SPR) method. The results show that depending on the co-existence cellular
users' outage constraint, different routing strategies have different merits.
BR is acceptable at the low D2D user density but is terrible at high density.
We also consider the channel band performance (Uplink band and Downlink band).
The results show that the multi-hop D2D can achieve a low outage probability
using the uplink band (approximately 5%), and D2D in the downlink band performs
a little poorly (approximately 12%) outage with SPR.
