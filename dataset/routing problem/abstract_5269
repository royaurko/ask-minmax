A multigrid method is proposed in this paper to solve eigenvalue problems by
the finite element method based on the shifted-inverse power iteration
technique. With this scheme, solving eigenvalue problem is transformed to a
series of nonsingular solutions of boundary value problems on multilevel
meshes. Since replacing the difficult eigenvalue solving by the easier solution
of boundary value problems, the multigrid way can improve the overall
efficiency of the eigenvalue problem solving. Some numerical experiments are
presented to validate the efficiency of this new method.
