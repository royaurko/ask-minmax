The Milnor problem on one-dimensional attractors is solved for S-unimodal
maps with a non-degenerate critical point c. It provides us with a complete
understanding of the possible limit behavior for Lebesgue almost every point.
This theorem follows from a geometric study of the critical set $\omega(c)$ of
a "non-renormalizable" map. It is proven that the scaling factors
characterizing the geometry of this set go down to 0 at least exponentially.
This resolves the problem of the non-linearity control in small scales. The
proofs strongly involve ideas from renormalization theory and holomorphic
dynamics.
