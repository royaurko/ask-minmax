We introduce a general algebraic setting for describing linear boundary
problems in a symbolic computation context, with emphasis on the case of
partial differential equations. The general setting is then applied to the
Cauchy problem for completely reducible partial differential equations with
constant coefficients. While we concentrate on the theoretical features in this
paper, the underlying operator ring is implemented and provides a sufficient
basis for all methods presented here.
