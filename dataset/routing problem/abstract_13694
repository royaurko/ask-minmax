Quantum tunneling across multiple barriers as yet is an unsolved problem for
barrier numbers greater than five. The complexity of the mathematical analysis
even for small number of barriers pushed it into the realms of Numerical
Analysis. This work is aimed at providing a rigorously correct solution to the
general N barrier problem, where N can be any positive integer. An exact
algebraic solution has been presented, which overcomes the complexity of the
WKB integrals that are traditionally employed, and matches the earlier results
reported for small number of barriers. The solution has been explored to
considerable depth and many startling consequences have been pointed out for
500 and 1000 barriers. These are quite revealing and open up many avenues for
engineering applications and further research.
