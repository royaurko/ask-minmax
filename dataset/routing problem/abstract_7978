The most efficient known method for solving certain computational problems is
to construct an iterated map whose fixed points are by design the problem's
solution. Although the origins of this idea go back at least to Newton, the
clearest expression of its logical basis is an example due to Mermin. A
contemporary application in image recovery demonstrates the power of the
method.
