We present the solution of a longstanding internal problem of noncommutative
geometry, namely the computation of the index of a transversally elliptic
operator on an arbitrary foliation. The new and crucial ingredient is a certain
Hopf algebra associated to the transverse frame bundle. Its cyclic cohomology
is defined and shown to be canonically isomorphic to the Gelfand-Fuks
cohomology.
