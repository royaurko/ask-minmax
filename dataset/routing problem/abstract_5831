We investigate fast methods that allow to quickly eliminate variables
(features) in supervised learning problems involving a convex loss function and
a $l_1$-norm penalty, leading to a potentially substantial reduction in the
number of variables prior to running the supervised learning algorithm. The
methods are not heuristic: they only eliminate features that are {\em
guaranteed} to be absent after solving the learning problem. Our framework
applies to a large class of problems, including support vector machine
classification, logistic regression and least-squares.
  The complexity of the feature elimination step is negligible compared to the
typical computational effort involved in the sparse supervised learning
problem: it grows linearly with the number of features times the number of
examples, with much better count if data is sparse. We apply our method to data
sets arising in text classification and observe a dramatic reduction of the
dimensionality, hence in computational effort required to solve the learning
problem, especially when very sparse classifiers are sought. Our method allows
to immediately extend the scope of existing algorithms, allowing us to run them
on data sets of sizes that were out of their reach before.
