We consider the problem of collisions of vortex filaments for a model
introduced by Klein, Majda and Damodaran, and Zakharov to describe the
interaction of almost parallel vortex filaments in three-dimensional fluids.
Since the results of Crow examples of collisions are searched as perturbations
of antiparallel translating pairs of filaments, with initial perturbations
related to the unstable mode of the linearized problem; most results are
numerical calculations. In this article we first consider a related model for
the evolution of pairs of filaments and we display another type of initial
perturbation leading to collision in finite time. Moreover we give numerical
evidence that it also leads to collision through the initial model. We finally
study the self-similar solutions of the model.
