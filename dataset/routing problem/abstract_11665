For a class C of finite lattices, the question arises whether any lattice in
C can be embedded into some atomistic, biatomic lattice in C. We provide
answers to the question above for C being, respectively, --The class of all
finite lattices; --The class of all finite lower bounded lattices (solved by
the first contributor's earlier work). --The class of all finite
join-semidistributive lattices (this problem was, until now, open). We solve
the latter problem by finding a quasi-identity valid in all finite, atomistic,
biatomic, join-semidistributive lattices but not in all finite
join-semidistributive lattices.
