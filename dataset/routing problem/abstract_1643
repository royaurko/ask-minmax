This paper is crucial part of an experiment aimed to investigate whether
Social Networks can be of help for Astrophysics. In the present case, in
helping to eliminate the deep-routed wrong misconception of Flat Rotation
Curves of Spiral Galaxies, more rapidly and efficiently than the traditional
method of publishing peer-reviewed papers and organizing a number of
international conferences. To reach this goal we created the Facebook Group
"Rotation Curve are not Flat" that we filled with all the evidence necessary
for an immediate and definite confrontation with the above fallacious legendary
belief. In this paper, we solicit the interested Astrophysicist/Cosmologist FB
users to join this group. Finally, the paper informs the Astrophysical
Community that a widespread belief is instead an hoax, whose consideration may
slow down the progress of science and that must be taken care by innovative
means of communicating scientific advances. This test case may anticipate the
future in which Web n.0 will become an effective scientific tool for
Astrophysics.
