In this paper, we consider a fundamental problem of describing the dynamics
of internal gravity waves in the stratified ocean with shear flows. We develop
an asymptotic representation of the wave fields in terms of the Green's
functions. We explore the far field of the internal gravity waves generated by
disturbing sources, and propose asymptotic algorithms for calculating its
dynamics.
