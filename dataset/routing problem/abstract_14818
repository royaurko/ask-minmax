We consider the problem of intruder deduction in security protocol analysis:
that is, deciding whether a given message $M$ can be deduced from a set of
messages $\Gamma$ under the theory of blind signatures and arbitrary convergent
equational theories modulo associativity and commutativity (AC) of certain
binary operators. The traditional formulations of intruder deduction are
usually given in natural-deduction-like systems and proving decidability
requires significant effort in showing that the rules are "local" in some
sense. By using the well-known translation between natural deduction and
sequent calculus, we recast the intruder deduction problem as proof search in
sequent calculus, in which locality is immediate. Using standard proof
theoretic methods, such as permutability of rules and cut elimination, we show
that the intruder deduction problem can be reduced, in polynomial time, to the
elementary deduction problems, which amounts to solving certain equations in
the underlying individual equational theories. We further show that this result
extends to combinations of disjoint AC-convergent theories whereby the
decidability of intruder deduction under the combined theory reduces to the
decidability of elementary deduction in each constituent theory. Although
various researchers have reported similar results for individual cases, our
work shows that these results can be obtained using a systematic and uniform
methodology based on the sequent calculus.
