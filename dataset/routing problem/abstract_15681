In superstring theories, there exist various dilaton and modulus fields which
masses are expected to be of the order of the gravitino mass $m_{3/2}$. These
fields lead to serious cosmological difficulties, so called ``cosmological
moduli problem'', because a large number of moduli particles are produced as
the coherent oscillations after the primordial inflation. We make a
comprehensive study whether the thermal inflation can solve the cosmological
moduli problem in the whole modulus mass region $m_\phi \sim 10 eV - 10^4 GeV$
predicted by both hidden sector supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking and
gauge-mediated SUSY breaking models. In particular, we take into account the
primordial inflation model whose reheating temperature is so low that its
reheating process finishes after the thermal inflation ends. We find that the
above mass region $m_\phi (\simeq m_{3/2}) \sim 10 eV - 10^4 GeV$ survives from
various cosmological constraints in the presence of the thermal inflation.
