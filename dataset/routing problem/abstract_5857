The paper is concerned with the problem of a semi-infinite crack at the
interface between two dissimilar elastic half-spaces, loaded by a general
asymmetrical system of forces distributed along the crack faces. On the basis
of the weight function approach and the fundamental reciprocal identity (Betti
formula), we formulate the elasticity problem in terms of singular integral
equations relating the applied loading and the resulting crack opening. Such
formulation is fundamental in the theory of elasticity and extensively used to
solve several problems in linear elastic fracture mechanics (for instance
various classic crack problems in homogeneous and heterogeneous media). This
formulation is also crucial in important recent multiphysics applications,
where the elastic problem is coupled with other concurrent physical phenomena.
A paradigmatic example is hydraulic fracturing, where the elasticity equations
are coupled with fluid dynamics.
