In this paper, we investigate the reconstruction of permutations on {1, 2,
..., n} from betweenness constraints involving the minimum and the maximum
element located between t and t+1, for all t=1, 2, ..., n-1. We propose two
variants of the problem (directed and undirected), and focus first on the
directed version, for which we draw up general features and design a polynomial
algorithm in a particular case. Then, we investigate necessary and sufficient
conditions for the uniqueness of the reconstruction in both directed and
undirected versions, using a parameter k whose variation controls the
stringency of the betweenness constraints. We finally point out open problems.
