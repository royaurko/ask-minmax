We consider continuous-time mean-variance portfolio selection with bankruptcy
prohibition under convex cone portfolio constraints. This is a long-standing
and difficult problem not only because of its theoretical significance, but
also for its practical importance. First of all, we transform the above problem
into an equivalent mean-variance problem with bankruptcy prohibition without
portfolio constraints. The latter is then treated using martingale theory. Our
findings indicate that we can directly present the semi-analytical expressions
of the pre-committed efficient mean-variance policy without a viscosity
solution technique but within a general framework of the cone portfolio
constraints. The numerical simulation also sheds light on results established
in this paper.
