The maximum clique problem is a well known NP-Hard problem with applications
in data mining, network analysis, informatics, and many other areas. Although
there exist several algorithms with acceptable runtimes for certain classes of
graphs, many of them are infeasible for massive graphs. We present a new exact
algorithm that employs novel pruning techniques to very quickly find maximum
cliques in large sparse graphs. Extensive experiments on several types of
synthetic and real-world graphs show that our new algorithm is up to several
orders of magnitude faster than existing algorithms for most instances. We also
present a heuristic variant that runs orders of magnitude faster than the exact
algorithm, while providing optimal or near-optimal solutions.
