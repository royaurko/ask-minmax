Recently, a new scheme was proposed for deniable authentication. Its main
originality lied on applying a chaos-based encryption-hash parallel algorithm
and the semi-group property of the Chebyshev chaotic map. Although original and
practicable, its insecurity and inefficiency are shown in this paper, thus
rendering it inadequate for adoption in e-commerce.
