In this paper, we put forth distributed algorithms for solving loosely
coupled unconstrained and constrained optimization problems. Such problems are
usually solved using algorithms that are based on a combination of
decomposition and first order methods. These algorithms are commonly very slow
and require many iterations to converge. In order to alleviate this issue, we
propose algorithms that combine the Newton and interior-point methods with
proximal splitting methods for solving such problems. Particularly, the
algorithm for solving unconstrained loosely coupled problems, is based on
Newton's method and utilizes proximal splitting to distribute the computations
for calculating the Newton step at each iteration. A combination of this
algorithm and the interior-point method is then used to introduce a distributed
algorithm for solving constrained loosely coupled problems. We also provide
guidelines on how to implement the proposed methods efficiently and briefly
discuss the properties of the resulting solutions.
