We study maximal regularity in interpolation spaces for the sum of three
closed linear operators on a Banach space, and we apply the abstract results to
obtain Besov and H\"older maximal regularity for complete second order Cauchy
problems under natural parabolicity assumptions. We discuss applications to
partial differential equations.
