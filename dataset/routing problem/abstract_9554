We consider the problem of finding k centers for n weighted points on a real
line. This (weighted) k-center problem was solved in O(n log n) time previously
by using Cole's parametric search and other complicated approaches. In this
paper, we present an easier O(n log n) time algorithm that avoids the
parametric search, and in certain special cases our algorithm solves the
problem in O(n) time. In addition, our techniques involve developing
interesting data structures for processing queries that find a lowest point in
the common intersection of a certain subset of half-planes. This subproblem is
interesting in its own right and our solution for it may find other
applications as well.
