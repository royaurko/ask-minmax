Let $T=t_0 ... t_{n-1}$ be a text and $P = p_0 ... p_{m-1}$ a pattern taken
from some finite alphabet set $\Sigma$, and let $\dist$ be a metric on
$\Sigma$. We consider the problem of calculating the sum of distances between
the symbols of $P$ and the symbols of substrings of $T$ of length $m$ for all
possible offsets. We present an $\epsilon$-approximation algorithm for this
problem which runs in time $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}n\cdot
\mathrm{polylog}(n,\abs{\Sigma}))$
