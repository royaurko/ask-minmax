We prove that the Cauchy problem for the Dirac-Klein-Gordon system of
equations in 1+3 dimensions is locally well-posed in a range of Sobolev spaces
for the Dirac spinor and the meson field. The result contains and extends the
earlier known results for the same problem. Our proof relies on the null
structure in the system, and bilinear spacetime estimates of
Klainerman-Machedon type.
