The problem of detecting a wide-sense stationary Gaussian signal process
embedded in white Gaussian noise, where the power spectral density of the
signal process exhibits uncertainty, is investigated. The performance of
minimax robust detection is characterized by the exponential decay rate of the
miss probability under a Neyman-Pearson criterion with a fixed false alarm
probability, as the length of the observation interval grows without bound. A
dominance condition is identified for the uncertainty set of spectral density
functions, and it is established that, under the dominance condition, the
resulting minimax problem possesses a saddle point, which is achievable by the
likelihood ratio tests matched to a so-called dominated power spectral density
in the uncertainty set. No convexity condition on the uncertainty set is
required to establish this result.
