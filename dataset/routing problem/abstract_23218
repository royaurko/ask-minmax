The symbolic manipulation program Schoonschip is being made freely available
for a number of computers with Motorola 680x0 cpu's. It can run on machines
with relatively modest memory and disk resources, and is designed to run as
fast as possible given the host constraints. Memory and disk utilization can be
adapted to tune performance. Recently added capabilities include a system for
efficient generation of diagrams, gamma algebra for continuous dimensions,
algorithmic improvements for handling large problems, and an increase in the
allowed number of {\tt X} expressions.
