This paper proposes a novel framework for delay-tolerant particle filtering
that is computationally efficient and has limited memory requirements. Within
this framework the informativeness of a delayed (out-of-sequence) measurement
(OOSM) is estimated using a lightweight procedure and uninformative
measurements are immediately discarded. The framework requires the
identification of a threshold that separates informative from uninformative;
this threshold selection task is formulated as a constrained optimization
problem, where the goal is to minimize tracking error whilst controlling the
computational requirements. We develop an algorithm that provides an
approximate solution for the optimization problem. Simulation experiments
provide an example where the proposed framework processes less than 40% of all
OOSMs with only a small reduction in tracking accuracy.
