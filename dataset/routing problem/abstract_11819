Recent approaches to the problem of inferring a continuous probability
distribution from a finite set of data have used a scalar field theory for the
form of the prior probability distribution. This letter presents a more general
form for the prior distribution that has a geometrical interpretation which is
useful for tailoring prior distributions to the needs of each application.
Examples are presented that demonstrate some of the capabilities of this
approach, including the applicability of this approach to problems of more than
one dimension.
