Recently, split ring-resonators (SRR's) have been realized experimentally in
the near infrared (NIR) and optical regime. In this contribution we numerically
investigate light propagation through an array of metallic SRR's in the NIR and
optical regime and compare our results to experimental results.
  We find numerical solutions to the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations by using
advanced finite-element-methods (FEM). The geometry of the problem is
discretized with unstructured tetrahedral meshes. Higher order, vectorial
elements (edge elements) are used as ansatz functions. Transparent boundary
conditions and periodic boundary conditions are implemented, which allow to
treat light scattering problems off periodic structures.
  This simulation tool enables us to obtain transmission and reflection spectra
of plane waves which are incident onto the SRR array under arbitrary angles of
incidence, with arbitrary polarization, and with arbitrary
wavelength-dependencies of the permittivity tensor. We compare the computed
spectra to experimental results and investigate resonances of the system.
