We explore the three-body problem in two dimensions using the adiabatic
hyperspherical representation. We develop the main equations in terms of
democratic hyperangular coordinates and determine several symmetry properties
and boundary conditions for both interacting and non-interacting solutions.
From the analysis of the three-body effective potentials, we determine the
threshold laws for low energy three-body recombination, collision-induced
dissociation as well as inelastic atom-diatom collisions in two dimensions. Our
results show that the hyperspherical representation can offer a simple and
conceptually clear physical picture for three-body process in two dimensions
which is also suitable for calculations using finite range two-body
interactions supporting a number of bound states.
