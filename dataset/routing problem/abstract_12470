The aim of this paper is to argue that the "preferred basis problem" is not a
real problem in measurement. We will show that, given an apparatus, among the
infinite corrrelations that can be established in the final state by means of a
change of basis, one and only one makes physical sense. It is the apparatus,
through its interaction Hamiltonian, what selects a single basis and determines
the observable to be measured, even without decoherence.
