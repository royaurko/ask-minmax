Let k be a global field and \pp any nonarchimedean prime of k. We give a new
and uniform proof of the well known fact that the set of all elements of k
which are integral at \pp is diophantine over k. Let k^{perf} be the perfect
closure of a global field of characteristic p>2. We also prove that the set of
all elements of k^{perf} which are integral at some prime \qq of k^{perf} is
diophantine over k^{perf}, and this is the first such result for a field which
is not finitely generated over its constant field. This is related to Hilbert's
Tenth Problem because for global fields k of positive characteristic, giving a
diophantine definition of the set of elements that are integral at a prime is
one of two steps needed to prove that Hilbert's Tenth Problem for k is
undecidable.
