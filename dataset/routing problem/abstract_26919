We consider the numerical solution of scalar, nonlinear degenerate
convection-diffusion problems with random diffusion coefficient and with random
flux functions. Building on recent results on the existence, uniqueness and
continuous dependence of weak solutions on data in the deterministic case, we
develop a definition of random entropy solution. We establish existence,
uniqueness, measurability and integrability results for these random entropy
solutions, generalizing \cite{Mishr478,MishSch10a} to possibly degenerate
hyperbolic-parabolic problems with random data. We next address the numerical
approximation of random entropy solutions, specifically the approximation of
the deterministic first and second order statistics. To this end, we consider
explicit and implicit time discretization and Finite Difference methods in
space, and single as well as Multi-Level Monte-Carlo methods to sample the
statistics. We establish convergence rate estimates with respect to the
discretization parameters, as well as with respect to the overall work,
indicating substantial gains in efficiency are afforded under realistic
regularity assumptions by the use of the Multi-Level Monte-Carlo method.
Numerical experiments are presented which confirm the theoretical convergence
estimates.
