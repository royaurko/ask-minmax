There has been recent progress in showing that the exponential dependence on
treewidth in dynamic programming algorithms for solving NP-hard problems are
optimal under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). We extend this
work to $r$-domination problems. In $r$-dominating set, one wished to find a
minimum subset $S$ of vertices such that every vertex of $G$ is within $r$ hops
of some vertex in $S$. In connected $r$-dominating set, one additionally
requires that the set induces a connected subgraph of $G$. We give a
$O((2r+1)^{\mathrm{tw}} n)$ time algorithm for $r$-dominating set and a
$O((2r+2)^{\mathrm{tw}} n^{O(1)})$ time algorithm for connected $r$-dominating
set in $n$-vertex graphs of treewidth $\mathrm{tw}$. We show that the running
time dependence on $r$ and $\mathrm{tw}$ is the best possible under SETH. This
adds to earlier observations that a "+1" in the denominator is required for
connectivity constraints.
