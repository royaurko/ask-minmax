By identifying the Higgs field as an internal component of a higher
dimensional gauge field it is possible to solve the little hierarchy problem.
The construction of a realistic model that incorporates such a gauge-Higgs
unification is an important problem that demands attention. In fact, several
attempts in this direction have already been put forward. In this letter we
single out one such attempt, a 6D SU(3) extended electroweak theory, where it
is possible to obtain a Higgs mass prediction in accord with global fits. One
shortcoming of the model is its prediction for the Weinberg angle, it is too
large. We slightly modify the model by including brane kinetic terms in a way
motivated by the orbifold action on the 6D fields. We show that in this way it
is possible to obtain the correct Weinberg angle while keeping the desired
results in the Higgs sector.
