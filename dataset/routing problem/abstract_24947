This paper addresses the theoretical conditions necessary for some subject of
study to survive forever. A probabilistic analysis leads to some prerequisite
conditions for preserving, say, electronic data indefinitely into the future.
The general analysis would also apply to a species, a civilization, or any
subject of study, as long as there is a definition of "survival" available. A
distinction emerges between two approaches to longevity: being many or being
smart. Natural selection relies on the first method, whereas a civilization,
individual, or other singular subject must rely on the latter. A computational
model of survival incorporates the idea of Kolmogorov-type complexity for both
strategies to illustrate the role of data analysis and information processing
that may be required. The survival-through-intelligence strategy has problems
when the subject can self-modify, which is illustrated with a link to Turing's
Halting Problem. The paper concludes with comments on the Fermi Paradox.
