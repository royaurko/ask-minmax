In this paper we propose a nonconforming finite element method for the
solution of the ill-posed elliptic Cauchy problem. We prove error estimates
using continuous dependence estimates in the $L^2$-norm. The effect of
perturbations in data on the estimates is investigated. The recently derived
framework from \cite{Bu13,Bu14} is extended to include the case of
nonconforming approximation spaces and we show that the use of such spaces
allows us to reduce the amount of stabilization necessary for convergence, even
in the case of ill-posed problems.
