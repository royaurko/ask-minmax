This paper deals with a popular form of counted-thread embroidery: the
cross-stitch. More precisely, we are interested in the minimal length of
embroidery thread one need to fill a given picture. We give a complete answer
to this problem for 4-connexe pictures (the notion is defined in the paper). In
a last part, we study several other examples.
