Fast evolution of Internet technologies has led to an explosive growth of
video data available in the public domain and created unprecedented challenges
in the analysis, organization, management, and control of such content. The
problems encountered in video analysis such as identifying a video in a large
database (e.g. detecting pirated content in YouTube), putting together video
fragments, finding similarities and common ancestry between different versions
of a video, have analogous counterpart problems in genetic research and
analysis of DNA and protein sequences. In this paper, we exploit the analogy
between genetic sequences and videos and propose an approach to video analysis
motivated by genomic research. Representing video information as video DNA
sequences and applying bioinformatic algorithms allows to search, match, and
compare videos in large-scale databases. We show an application for
content-based metadata mapping between versions of annotated video.
