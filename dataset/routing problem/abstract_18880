We first study the properties of solutions of quadratic programs with linear
equality constraints whose parameters are estimated from data in the
high-dimensional setting where p, the number of variables in the problem, is of
the same order of magnitude as n, the number of observations used to estimate
the parameters. The Markowitz problem in Finance is a subcase of our study.
Assuming normality and independence of the observations we relate the efficient
frontier computed empirically to the "true" efficient frontier. Our
computations show that there is a separation of the errors induced by
estimating the mean of the observations and estimating the covariance matrix.
In particular, the price paid for estimating the covariance matrix is an
underestimation of the variance by a factor roughly equal to 1-p/n. Therefore
the risk of the optimal population solution is underestimated when we estimate
it by solving a similar quadratic program with estimated parameters. We also
characterize the statistical behavior of linear functionals of the empirical
optimal vector and show that they are biased estimators of the corresponding
population quantities.
