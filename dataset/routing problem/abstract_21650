We use death processes and embeddings into continuous time in order to
analyze several urn models with a diminishing content. In particular we discuss
generalizations of the pill's problem, originally introduced by Knuth and
McCarthy, and generalizations of the well known sampling without replacement
urn models, and OK Corral urn models.
