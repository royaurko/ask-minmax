Conventional IP routing protocols are not suitable for multimedia
applications which have very stringent Quality-of-Service (QoS) demands and
they require a connection oriented service. For multimedia applications it is
expected that the router should be able to forward the packet according to the
demand of the packet and it is necessary to find a path that satisfies the
specific demands of a particular application. In order to address these issues,
in this paper, we have presented a QoS aware IP routing protocol where a router
stores information about the QoS parameters and routes the packet accordingly.
