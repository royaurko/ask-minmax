We consider the problem of how an individual can use term life insurance to
maximize the probability of reaching a given bequest goal, an important problem
in financial planning. We assume that the individual buys instantaneous term
life insurance with a premium payable continuously. By contrast with Bayraktar
et al. (2014), we allow the force of mortality to vary with time, which, as we
show, greatly complicates the problem.
