We define an enhanced compactification of Floer trajectories under Morse
background using the adiabatic degeneration and the scale-dependent gluing
techniques. The compactification reflects the 1-jet datum of the smooth Floer
trajectories nearby the limiting nodal Floer trajectories arising from
adiabatic degeneration of the background Morse function. This paper studies the
gluing problem when the limiting gradient trajectories has length zero through
a renomalization process. The case with limiting gradient trajectories of
non-zero length will be treated elsewhere.
  An immediate application of our result is a proof of the isomorphism property
of the PSS map : A proof of this isomorphism property was first outlined by
P\"unihikin-Salamon-Schwarz \cite{PSS} in a way somewhat different from the
current proof in its details. This kind of scale-dependent gluing techniques
was initiated in [FOOO07] in relation to the metamorphosis of holomorphic
polygons under Lagrangian surgery and is expected to appear in other gluing and
compactification problem of pseudo-holomorphic curves that involves `adiabatic'
parameters or rescales the targets.
