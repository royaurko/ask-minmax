In this paper, we study a class of quadratic Backward Stochastic Differential
Equations (BSDEs) which arises naturally when studying the problem of utility
maximization with portfolio constraints. We first establish existence and
uniqueness results for such BSDEs and then, we give an application to the
utility maximization problem. Three cases of utility functions will be
discussed: the exponential, power and logarithmic ones.
