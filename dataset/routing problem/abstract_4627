We incorporate explicit Nystrom methods into the RKQ algorithm for stepwise
global error control in numerical solutions of initial-value problems. The
initial-value problem is transformed into an explicitly second-order problem,
so as to be suitable for Nystrom integration. The Nystrom methods used are
fourth-order, fifth-order and 10th-order. Two examples demonstrate the
effectiveness of the algorithm.
