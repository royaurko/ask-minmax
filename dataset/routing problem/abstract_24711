We revisit the approach proposed by Mukamel and coworkers to describe
interacting excitons through infinite series of composite-boson operators for
both, the system Hamiltonian and the exciton commutator -- which, in this
approach, is properly kept different from its elementary boson value. Instead
of free electron-hole operators, as used by Mukamel's group, we here work with
composite-exciton operators which are physically relevant operators for excited
semiconductors. This allows us to get \emph{all} terms of these infinite series
explicitly, the first terms of each series agreeing with the ones obtained by
Mukamel's group when written with electron-hole pairs. All these terms nicely
read in terms of Pauli and interaction scatterings of the composite-exciton
many-body theory we have recently proposed. However, even if knowledge of these
infinite series now allows to tackle $N$-body problems, not just 2-body
problems like third order nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(3)}$, the necessary
handling of these two infinite series makes this approach far more complicated
than the one we have developed and which barely relies on just four
commutators.
