We study initial-boundary value problems for the Lagrangian averaged alpha
models for the equations of motion for the corotational Maxwell and inviscid
fluids in 2D and 3D. We show existence of (global in time) dissipative
solutions to these problems. We also discuss the idea of dissipative solution
in an abstract Hilbert space framework.
