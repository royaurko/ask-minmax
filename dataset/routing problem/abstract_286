The coupling-parameter method, whereby an extra particle is progressively
coupled to the rest of the particles, is applied to the sticky-hard-sphere
fluid to obtain its equation of state in the so-called chemical-potential route
($\mu$ route). As a consistency test, the results for one-dimensional sticky
particles are shown to be exact. Results corresponding to the three-dimensional
case (Baxter's model) are derived within the Percus-Yevick approximation by
using different prescriptions for the dependence of the interaction potential
of the extra particle on the coupling parameter. The critical point and the
coexistence curve of the gas-liquid phase transition are obtained in the $\mu$
route and compared with predictions from other thermodynamics routes and from
computer simulations. The results show that the $\mu$ route yields a general
better description than the virial, energy, compressibility, and
zero-separation routes.
