We describe a mechanism for using discrete symmetries to solve the
doublet-triplet splitting problem of four-dimensional supersymmetric GUT's. We
present two versions of the mechanism, one via ``deconstruction,'' and one in
terms of M-theory compactification to four dimensions on a manifold of G_2
holonomy.
