We give a short survey on computational techniques which can be used to solve
the representation conversion problem for polyhedra up to symmetries. We in
particular discuss decomposition methods, which reduce the problem to a number
of lower dimensional subproblems. These methods have been successfully used by
different contributors in special contexts. Moreover, we sketch an incremental
method, which is a generalization of Fourier-Motzkin elimination, and we give
some ideas how symmetry can be exploited using pivots.
