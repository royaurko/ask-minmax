We present the geodesics on homogeneous and isotropic negatively curved
spaces in a simple form suitable for application to cosmological problems. We
discuss how the patterns in the microwave sky of anisotropic homogeneous
universes can be predicted qualitatively by looking at the invariances that
generate their three-geometries.
