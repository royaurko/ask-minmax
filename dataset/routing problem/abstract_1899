We report an easy-to-implement method that allows the direct generation of
water-in-water (w/w) single emulsions. The method relies on direct perturbation
of the pressure that drives the flow of the dispersed phase of the emulsions.
The resultant inner jet is induced to break up into droplets due to the growth
of the perturbation through Rayleigh-Plateau instability [L. Rayleigh, Proc. R.
Soc. London 29, 71-97 (1879)]; this leads to the formation of monodisperse
droplets. By implementing this method on a modified microfluidic device, we
directly generate water-in-water-in-water (w/w/w) double emulsions with good
control over the size and the number of encapsulated droplets. Our approach
suggests a new route to apply droplet-based microfluidics to completely
water-based systems.
