This paper considers robust stability analysis of a large network of
interconnected uncertain systems. To avoid analyzing the entire network as a
single large, lumped system, we model the network interconnections with
integral quadratic constraints. This approach yields a sparse linear matrix
inequality which can be decomposed into a set of smaller, coupled linear matrix
inequalities. This allows us to solve the analysis problem efficiently and in a
distributed manner. We also show that the decomposed problem is equivalent to
the original robustness analysis problem, and hence our method does not
introduce additional conservativeness.
