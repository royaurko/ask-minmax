We discuss existence of mixed state of multicomponent system with given
spectrum and given reduced density matrices. We give a complete solution of the
problem in terms of linear inequalities on the spectra, accompanied with
extensive tables of marginal inequalities, including arrays up to 4 qubits. In
the second part of the paper we pursue another approach based on reduction of
the problem to representation theory of the symmetric group.
