We present a constructive approach to surface comparison realizable by a
polynomial-time algorithm. We determine the "similarity" of two given surfaces
by solving a mass-transportation problem between their conformal densities.
This mass transportation problem differs from the standard case in that we
require the solution to be invariant under global M\"{o}bius transformations.
We present in detail the case where the surfaces to compare are disk-like; we
also sketch how the approach can be generalized to other types of surfaces.
