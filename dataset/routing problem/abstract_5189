In this paper, the linear Gaussian relay problem is considered. Under the
linear time-invariant (LTI) model the problem is formulated in the frequency
domain based on the Toeplitz distribution theorem. Under the further assumption
of realizable input spectra, the LTI Gaussian relay problem is converted to a
joint design problem of source and relay filters under two power constraints,
one at the source and the other at the relay, and a practical solution to this
problem is proposed based on the projected subgradient method. Numerical
results show that the proposed method yields a noticeable gain over the
instantaneous amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme in inter-symbol interference
(ISI) channels. Also, the optimality of the AF scheme within the class of
one-tap relay filters is established in flat-fading channels.
