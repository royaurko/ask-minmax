It is demonstrated that the three-slit interference, as obtained from
explicit solutions of Maxwell's equations for realistic models of three-slit
devices, including an idealized version of the three-slit device used in a
recent three-slit experiment with light (U. Sinha {\sl et al.}, Science 329,
418 (2010)), is nonzero. The hypothesis that the three-slit interference should
be zero is the result of dropping the one-to-one correspondence between the
symbols in the mathematical theory and the different experimental
configurations, opening the route to conclusions that cannot be derived from
the theory proper. It is also shown that under certain experimental conditions,
this hypothesis is a good approximation.
