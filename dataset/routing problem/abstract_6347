We consider the local equivalence problem for the class of linear second
order hyperbolic equations in two independent variables under an action of the
pseudo-group of contact transformations. E. Cartan's method is used for finding
the Maurer - Cartan forms for symmetry groups of equations from the class and
computing structure equations and complete sets of differential invariants for
these groups. The solution of the equivalence problem is formulated in terms of
these differential invariants.
