We study regularity for a parabolic problem with fractional diffusion in
space and a fractional time derivative. Our main result is a De
Giorgi-Nash-Moser Holder regularity theorem for solutions in a divergence form
equation. We also prove results regarding existence, uniqueness, and higher
regularity in time.
