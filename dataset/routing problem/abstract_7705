This paper examines the mathematical properties of the relativistic diffusion
equation. The peculiar solution which Hiscock and Lindblom identified as an
instability is shown to emerge from an ill-posed initial value problem. These
do not meet the mathematical conditions required for realistic physical
problems and can not serve as an argument against the relativistic
hydrodynamics of Landau and Lifshitz.
