Problems that arise in the application of general prescriptions of the
so-called strategy of regions for asymptotic expansions of Feynman integrals in
various limits of momenta and masses are discussed with the help of
characteristic examples of two-loop diagrams. The strategy is also reformulated
in the language of alpha parameters.
