In this paper we review some old and new results about the enlargement of
filtrations problem, as well as their applications to credit risk and insider
trading problems. The enlargement of filtrations problem consists in the study
of conditions under which a semimartingale remains a semimartingale when the
filtration is enlarged, and, in such a case, how to find the Doob-Meyer
decomposition. Filtrations may be enlarged in different ways. In this paper we
consider initial and progressive filtration enlargements made by random
variables and processes.
