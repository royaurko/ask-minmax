Potential games, originally introduced in the early 1990's by Lloyd Shapley,
the 2012 Nobel Laureate in Economics, and his colleague Dov Monderer, are a
very important class of models in game theory. They have special properties
such as the existence of Nash equilibria in pure strategies. This note
introduces graphical versions of potential games. Special cases of graphical
potential games have already found applicability in many areas of science and
engineering beyond economics, including artificial intelligence, computer
vision, and machine learning. They have been effectively applied to the study
and solution of important real-world problems such as routing and congestion in
networks, distributed resource allocation (e.g., public goods), and
relaxation-labeling for image segmentation. Implicit use of graphical potential
games goes back at least 40 years. Several classes of games considered standard
in the literature, including coordination games, local interaction games,
lattice games, congestion games, and party-affiliation games, are instances of
graphical potential games. This note provides several characterizations of
graphical potential games by leveraging well-known results from the literature
on probabilistic graphical models. A major contribution of the work presented
here that particularly distinguishes it from previous work is establishing that
the convergence of certain type of game-playing rules implies that the
agents/players must be embedded in some graphical potential game.
