Inspired by the work done by Belavkin [BelavkinV.P.Stochastics,1,315(1975)]
and C. Mochon [Phys.Rev.A73,032328,(2006)], we formulate the problem of minimum
error discrimination of an ensemble of n linearly independent pure states by
embedding the optimal conditions in a matrix equation and matrix inequality.
This isolates the rotationally invariant aspect of the problem from the
rotationally covariant part of it. Employing the implicit function theorem in
the matrix equation we get a set of first-order coupled ordinary non-linear
differential equations which can be used to drag the solution from an initial
point (where solution is known) to another point (whose solution is sought).
This can be done through a simple taylor series expansion and analytic
continuation when required. Thus, we complete the work done by Belavkin and C.
Mochon by ultimately leading their theory to a solution for the MED problem of
LI pure state ensembles. We also compare the computational complexity of this
technique with a barrier-type interior point method of SDP and show that our
technique is computationally less expensive than the SDP algorithm, with the
added advantage of being simpler to implement.
