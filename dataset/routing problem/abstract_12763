The Hurwitz problem of composition of quadratic forms, or of "sum of squares
identity" is tackled with the help of a particular class of
$(\mathbb{Z}_2)^n$-graded non-associative algebras generalizing the octonions.
This method provides an explicit formula for the classical Hurwitz-Radon
identity and leads to new solutions in a neighborhood of the Hurwitz-Radon
identity.
