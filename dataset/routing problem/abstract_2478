In view of the increasing accuracy of Casimir experiments, there is a need
for performing accurate theoretical calculations. Using accurate experimental
data for the permittivities we present, via the Lifshitz formula applied to the
standard Casimir setup with two parallel plates, accurate theoretical results
in case of the metals Au, Cu and Al. Both similar and dissimilar cases are
considered. Concentrating in particular on the finite temperature effect, we
show how the Casimir pressure varies with separation for three different
temperatures, T={1, 300, 350}K. The metal surfaces are taken to be perfectly
plane. The experimental data for the permittivities are generally yielding
results that are in good agreement with those calculated from the Drude
relation with finite relaxation frequency. We give the results in tabular form,
in order to facilitate the assessment of the temperature correction which is on
the 1% level. We emphasize two points: (i) The most promising route for a
definite experimental verification of the finite temperature correction appears
to be to concentrate on the case of large separations (optimum around 2
micrometres); and (ii) there is no conflict between the present kind of theory
and the Nernst theorem in thermodynamics.
