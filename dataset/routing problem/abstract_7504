Here we consider scalar conservation law in one space dimension with strictly
convex flux. Goal of this paper is to study two problems. First problem is to
know the profile of the entropy solution. In spite of the fact that, this was
studied extensively in last several decades, the complete profile of the
entropy solution is not well understood.
  Second problem is the exact controllability. This was studied for Burgers
equation and some partial results are obtained for large time. It was a
challenging problem to know the controllability for all time and also for
general convex flux.
  In a seminal paper, Dafermos introduces the characteristic curves and obtain
some qualitative properties of a solution of a convex conservation law. In this
paper, we further study the finer properties of these characteristic curves. As
a bi-product we solve these two problems in complete generality. In view of the
explicit formulas of Lax - Oleinik, Joseph - Gowda, target functions must
satisfy some necessary conditions. In this paper we prove that it is also
sufficient. Method of the proof depends highly on the characteristic methods
and explicit formula given by Lax - Oleinik and the proof is constructive. This
method allows to solve the optimal controllability problem in a trackable way.
