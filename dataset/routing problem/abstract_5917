We study the complexity of several parameterizations for \textsc{max $k$-set
cover}. Given a family of subsets $\mathcal S=\{S_1,\ldots,S_m\}$ over a set of
elements $X=\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ and an integer $p$, \pSC{} consists of finding
a set $\mathcal T$ of at most $k$ subsets covering at least $p$ elements. This
problem, when parameterized by $k$, is W[2]-hard. Here, we settle the
multiparameterized complexity of \pSC{} under pairs of parameters as
$(k,\Delta)$ and $(k,f)$, where $\Delta=\max_i\{|S_i|\}$ and $f =\max_i|\{j |
x_i \in S_j\}|$. We also study parameterized approximability of the problem
with respect to parameters $k$ and $p$. Then, we investigate some similar
parameterizations of a satisfiability problem \textsc{max sat-$k$} which is
close to \textsc{max $k$-set cover}. Finally, we sketch an enhancement of the
classes of the W[$\cdot$] hierarchy that seems more appropriate for showing
completeness of cardinality constrained W[$\cdot$]-hard problems.
