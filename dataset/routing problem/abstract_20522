Examples of the construction of Hamiltonian structures for dynamical systems
in field theory (including one reputedly non-Hamiltonian problem) without using
Lagrangians, are presented. The recently developed method used requires the
knowledge of one constant of the motion of the system under consideration and
one solution of the symmetry equation.
