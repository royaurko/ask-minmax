Modeling of high order multivariate probability distribution is a difficult
problem which occurs in many fields. Copula approach is a good choice for this
purpose, but the curse of dimensionality still remains a problem. In this paper
we give a theorem which expresses a multivariate copula by using only some
lower dimensional ones based on the conditional independences between the
variables. In general the construction of a multivariate copula using this
theorem is quite difficult, due the consistency properties which have to be
fulfilled. For this purpose we introduce the sample derivated copula, and prove
that the dependence between the random variables involved depends just on this
copula and on the partition. By using the sample derivated copula the theorem
can be successfully applied, in order to to construct a multivariate discrete
copula by using some of its marginals.
