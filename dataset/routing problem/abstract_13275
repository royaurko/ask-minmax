In this article I will address some questions about a mathematical problem
that my friend Patrizio Frederic, a researcher in statistics at the University
of Modena, proposed to me. Given some parallel line segments, is there at least
one straight line that passes through all of them? If there were many lines
that solve the problem, can I choose a "best one" among all of them? I will
fully address the first question. As for the second question, I will illustrate
it with some "experimental" examples and suggest an outline for future
explorations.
