Coupled problems with various combinations of multiple physics, scales, and
domains are found in numerous areas of science and engineering. A key challenge
in the formulation and implementation of corresponding coupled numerical models
is to facilitate the communication of information across physics, scale, and
domain interfaces, as well as between the iterations of solvers used for
response computations. In a probabilistic context, any information that is to
be communicated between subproblems or iterations should be characterized by an
appropriate probabilistic representation. Although the number of sources of
uncertainty can be expected to be large in most coupled problems, our
contention is that exchanged probabilistic information often resides in a
considerably lower dimensional space than the sources themselves. In this work,
we thus use a dimension-reduction technique for obtaining the representation of
the exchanged information. The main subject of this work is the investigation
of a measure-transformation technique that allows implementations to exploit
this dimension reduction to achieve computational gains. The effectiveness of
the proposed dimension-reduction and measure-transformation methodology is
demonstrated through a multiphysics problem relevant to nuclear engineering.
