Fluid motion in tanks is usually described in space industry with the
so-called Lomen hypothesis which assumes the vorticity is null in the moving
frame. We establish in this contribution that this hypothesis is valid only for
uniform rotational motions. We give a more general formulation of this coupling
problem, with a compact formulation. We consider the mechanical modelling of a
rigid body with a motion of small amplitude, containing an incompressible fluid
in the linearized regime. We first establish that the fluid motion remains
irrotational in a Galilean referential if it is true at the initial time. When
continuity of normal velocity and pressure are prescribed on the free surface,
we establish that the global coupled problem conserve an energy functional
composed by three terms. We introduce the Stokes - Zhukovsky vector fields,
solving Neumann problems for the Laplace operator in the fluid in order to
represent the rotational rigid motion with irrotational vector fields. Then we
have a good framework to consider the coupled problem between the fluid and the
rigid motion. The coupling between the free surface and the ad hoc component of
the velocity potential introduces a "Neumann to Dirichlet" operator that allows
to write the coupled system in a very compact form. The final expresion of a
Lagrangian for the coupled system is derived and the Euler-Lagrange equations
of the coupled motion are presented.
