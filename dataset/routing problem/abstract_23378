We address the question whether we have to perform the analytic continuation
to 4 space-time dimensions before or after the perturbative expansion has been
made. Using the simple model of large-N scalar field theory, we show how this
affects quantities like the thermal mass and the pressure, why the two
procedures give different results, and how this relates to the infrared
behaviour of the theory. We conclude that the correct procedure is to take the
limit d -> 4 before performing the perturbative expansion. Infrared divergences
arise if one makes the perturbative expansion before going to the physical
space-time dimension and they correspond to logarithms of the coupling in the
exact (nonperturbative or resummed) expression. Finally, we outline how this
may be relevant to the infrared problems encountered in thermal QCD.
