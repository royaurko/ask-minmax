I analyze common problems of interlayer tunneling in Bi-2212 mesa structures,
such as self-heating and nonuniformity of junctions. Numerical simulations have
shown that self-heating does not mask the temperature dependence of the
superconducting gap. Major problems can be avoided by decreasing mesa sizes.
