We study the relationship between the competitive ratio and the tail
distribution of randomized online minimization problems. To this end, we define
a broad class of online problems that includes some of the well-studied
problems like paging, k-server and metrical task systems on finite metrics, and
show that for these problems it is possible to obtain, given an algorithm with
constant expected competitive ratio, another algorithm that achieves the same
solution quality up to an arbitrarily small constant error a with high
probability; the "high probability" statement is in terms of the optimal cost.
Furthermore, we show that our assumptions are tight in the sense that removing
any of them allows for a counterexample to the theorem. In addition, there are
examples of other problems not covered by our definition, where similar high
probability results can be obtained.
