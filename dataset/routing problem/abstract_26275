SUSY CP problem in the gauge mediation supersymmetry breaking model is
reconsidered. We pay particular attention to two sources of CP violating phases
whose effects were not seriously studied before; one is the effect of the
breaking of the GUT relation among the gaugino masses due to the field
esponsible for the GUT symmetry breaking, and the other is the supergravity
effect on the supersymmetry breaking parameters, in particular, on the
bi-linear supersymmetry breaking Higgs mass term. We show that both of them can
induce too large electric dipole moments of electron, neutron, and so on, to be
consistent with the experimental bounds.
