When we discuss problems on gravity, we can not avoid some fundamental
physical problems, such as space-time, inertia, and inertial reference frame.
The goal of this paper is to discuss the logic system of gravity theory and the
problems of space-time, inertia, and inertial reference frame. The goal of this
paper is to set up the theory on space-time in gauge theory of gravity. Based
on this theory, it is possible for human kind to manipulate physical space-time
on earth, and produce a machine which can physically prolong human's lifetime.
