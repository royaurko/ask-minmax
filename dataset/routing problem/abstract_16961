The aim of power management policies is to reduce the amount of energy
consumed by computer systems while maintaining satisfactory level of
performance. One common method for saving energy is to simply suspend the
system during the idle times. No energy is consumed in the suspend mode.
However, the process of waking up the system itself requires a certain fixed
amount of energy, and thus suspending the system is beneficial only if the idle
time is long enough to compensate for this additional energy expenditure. In
the specific problem studied in the paper, we have a set of jobs with release
times and deadlines that need to be executed on a single processor. Preemptions
are allowed. The processor requires energy L to be woken up and, when it is on,
it uses one unit of energy per one unit of time. It has been an open problem
whether a schedule minimizing the overall energy consumption can be computed in
polynomial time. We solve this problem in positive, by providing an O(n^5)-time
algorithm. In addition we provide an O(n^4)-time algorithm for computing the
minimum energy schedule when all jobs have unit length.
