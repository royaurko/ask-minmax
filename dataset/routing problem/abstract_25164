Although taxonomy is often used informally to evaluate the results of
phylogenetic inference and find the root of phylogenetic trees, algorithmic
methods to do so are lacking. In this paper we formalize these procedures and
develop algorithms to solve the relevant problems. In particular, we introduce
a new algorithm that solves a "subcoloring" problem for expressing the
difference between the taxonomy and phylogeny at a given rank. This algorithm
improves upon the current best algorithm in terms of asymptotic complexity for
the parameter regime of interest; we also describe a branch-and-bound algorithm
that saves orders of magnitude in computation on real data sets. We also
develop a formalism and an algorithm for rooting phylogenetic trees according
to a taxonomy. All of these algorithms are implemented in freely-available
software.
