In this short note, we consider the problem of bi-Lipschitz contact
equivalence of complex analytic function-germs of two variables. It is
inquiring about the infinitesimal sizes of such function-germs, up to
bi-Lipschitz changes of coordinates. We show that this problem is equivalent to
the problem of the right topological classification.
