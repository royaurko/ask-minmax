We discuss the convergence problem for coordinate transformations which take
a given vector field into Poincar\'e-Dulac normal form. We show that the
presence of linear or nonlinear Lie point symmetries can guaranteee convergence
of these normalizing transformations, in a number of scenarios. As an
application, we consider a class of bifurcation problems.
