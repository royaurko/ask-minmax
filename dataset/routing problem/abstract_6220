A supersymmetric model based on a left-right symmetric gauge group, which
`naturally' leads to hybrid inflation, is studied. It is shown that the mu
problem can be easily solved in this model. The observed baryon asymmetry of
the universe is produced via a primordial leptogenesis. For masses of nu_mu,
nu_tau from the small angle MSW resolution of the solar neutrino problem and
SuperKamiokande, maximal nu_mu-nu_tau mixing can be achieved. The required
values of the relevant parameters are, however, quite small.
