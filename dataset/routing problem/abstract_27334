We answer Question~3.2 from Shelah \cite{Sh:666}: Given a maximal almost
disjoint (mad) family $\mathcal A$ of size $\aleph_1$, we construct a forcing
${\mathbb Q}(\mathcal A)$ that has Axiom A, is ${}^\omega \omega$-bounding,
preserves selective ultrafilters, has the $\aleph_2$-properness isomorphism
condition (p.i.c.), and destroys the mad family $\mathcal A$. We develop a new
construction technique for partial orders, combining ladder systems for
$\omega_1$ with trees of normed creatures.
  Countable support iteration of the new kind of iterands solves Roitman's
problem in the case of $d=\aleph_1$ and also simultaneously the open question
about the relative consistency of $u = \aleph_1 < a$: It is consistent relative
to ZFC that there is a dominating set of size $\aleph_1$ and a selective
ultrafilter with character $\aleph_1$ and the minimal size of a mad family is
$\aleph_2$, like the continuum.
