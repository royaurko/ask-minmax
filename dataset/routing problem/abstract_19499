The paper presents results for deriving closed-form analytic solutions of the
non-relativistic linear perturbation equations, which govern the evolution of
inhomogeneities in a homogeneous spatially flat multicomponent cosmological
model. Mathematical methods to derive computable forms of the perturbations are
outlined.
