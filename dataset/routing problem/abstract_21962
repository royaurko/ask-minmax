Two concepts of random stopping times in continuous time have been defined in
the literature, mixed stopping times and randomized stopping times. We show
that under weak conditions these two concepts are equivalent, and, in fact,
that all types of random stopping times are equivalent. We exhibit the
significance of the equivalence relation between stopping times using stopping
problems and stopping games. As a by-product we extend Kuhn's Theorem to
stopping games in continuous time.
