We analyze the dynamics of Brownian ratchets in a confined environment. The
motion of the particles is described by a Fick-Jakobs kinetic equation in which
the presence of boundaries is modeled by means of an entropic potential. The
cases of a flashing ratchet, a two-state model and a ratchet under the
influence of a temperature gradient are analyzed in detail. We show the
emergence of a strong cooperativity between the inherent rectification of the
ratchet mechanism and the entropic bias of the fluctuations caused by spatial
confinement. Net particle transport may take place in situations where none of
those mechanisms leads to rectification when acting individually. The combined
rectification mechanisms may lead to bidirectional transport and to new routes
to segregation phenomena. Confined Brownian ratchets (CBR) could be used to
control transport in mesostructures and to engineer new and more efficient
devices for transport at the nanoscale.
