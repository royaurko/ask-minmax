A possible approximate route to obtain the equation of state of the
monodisperse hard-sphere system in the metastable fluid region from the
knowledge of the equation of state of a hard-sphere mixture at high densities
is discussed. The proposal is illustrated by using recent Monte Carlo
simulation data for the pressure of a binary mixture. It is further shown to
exhibit high internal consistency.
