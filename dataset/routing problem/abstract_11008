We compute the thermodynamic properties of the 3-satisfiability problem in
the infinite connectivity limit. In this limit the computations can be strongly
simplified and the thermodynamical properties can be obtained with an high
accuracy. We find evidence for a continuous replica symmetry breaking in the
region of high number of clauses, $\alpha > \alpha_c$.
