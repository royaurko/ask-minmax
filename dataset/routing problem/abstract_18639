In this article, we present a new approach to averaging in non-Hamiltonian
systems with periodic forcing. The results here do not depend on the existence
of a small parameter. In fact, we show that our averaging method fits into an
appropriate nonlinear equivalence problem, and that this problem can be solved
formally by using the Lie transform framework to linearize it. According to
this approach, we derive formal coordinate transformations associated with both
first-order and higher-order averaging, which result in more manageable
formulae than the classical ones.
  Using these transformations, it is possible to correct the solution of an
averaged system by recovering the oscillatory components of the original
non-averaged system. In this framework, the inverse transformations are also
defined explicitly by formal series; they allow the estimation of appropriate
initial data for each higher-order averaged system, respecting the equivalence
relation.
  Finally, we show how these methods can be used for identifying and computing
periodic solutions for a very large class of nonlinear systems with
time-periodic forcing. We test the validity of our approach by analyzing both
the first-order and the second-order averaged system for a problem in
atmospheric chemistry.
