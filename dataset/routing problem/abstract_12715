This review provides an elementary discussion of electroweak symmetry
breaking in the minimal and the next-to-minimal supersymmetric models with the
focus on the fine-tuning problem -- the tension between natural electroweak
symmetry breaking and the direct search limit on the Higgs boson mass. Two
generic solutions of the fine-tuning problem are discussed in detail: models
with unusual Higgs decays; and models with unusual pattern of soft
supersymmetry breaking parameters.
