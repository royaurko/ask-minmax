Superconductivity of high critical temperature ($T_{c}$) superconductors is
usually realized through chemical dopant or application of pressure in a
similar way to induce charge carriers of either electrons or holes into their
parent compounds. For chemical doping, superconductivity behaves asymmetrically
with the maximum $T_{c}$ often higher for optimal hole-doping than that of
optimal electron-doping on the same parent compound. However, whether electron
carriers could be in favour of higher $T_{c}$ than holes in such high-$T_{c}$
superconductors is unknown but attractive. Here we show that the application of
pressure can drive KFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ from hole- to electron-superconductivity
after passing the previously reported $V$-shape or oscillation regime. The
maximum $T_{c}$ in the electron-dominated region is tripled to the initial
value of 3.5 K or the average in the low-pressure hole-dominated region. The
structural transition takes place from the tetragonal to collapsed tetragonal
phase when the carrier characteristic is changed upon compression. Our results
unambiguously offer a new route to further improve superconductivity with huge
$T_{c}$ enhancement for a compound through carrier switch. The strong
electronic correlations in KFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ are suggested to account for the
unexpected enhancement of superconductivity in the collapsed tetragonal phase.
