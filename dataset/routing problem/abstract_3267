This paper presents a canonical dual approach for solving nonconvex quadratic
minimization problem. By using the canonical duality theory, nonconvex primal
minimization problems over n-dimensional Lorentz cone can be transformed into
certain canonical dual problems with only one dual variable, which can be
solved by using standard convex minimization methods. Extremality conditions of
these solutions are classified by the triality theory. Applications are
illustrated.
