It is reported that the numerical simulations of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam problem
were performed by a young lady, Mary Tsingou. After 50 years of omission, it is
time for a proper recognition of her decisive contribution to the first ever
numerical experiment, central in the solitons and chaos theories, but also one
of the very first out-of-equilibrium statistical mechanics study. Let us quote
from now on the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou problem.
