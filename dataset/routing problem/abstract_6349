We apply the asymptotic iteration method (AIM) [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 36,
11807 (2003)] to solve new classes of second-order homogeneous linear
differential equation. In particular, solutions are found for a general class
of eigenvalue problems which includes Schroedinger problems with Coulomb,
harmonic oscillator, or Poeschl-Teller potentials, as well as the special
eigenproblems studied recently by Bender et al [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 34 9835
(2001)] and generalized in the present paper to higher dimensions.
