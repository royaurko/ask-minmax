The well-known gyrokinetic problem regards the perturbative expansion related
to the dynamics of a charged particle subject to fast gyration motion due to
the presence of a strong magnetic field. Although a variety of approaches have
been formulated in the past to this well known problem, surprisingly a purely
canonical approach based on Lie transform methods is still missing. This paper
aims to fill in this gap and provide at the same time new insight in
Lie-transform approaches.
