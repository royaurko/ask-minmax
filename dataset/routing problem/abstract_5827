A modification of the well-known step-by-step process for solving
Nevanlinna-Pick problems in the class of $\bR_0$-functions gives rise to a
linear pencil $H-\lambda J$, where $H$ and $J$ are Hermitian tridiagonal
matrices. First, we show that $J$ is a positive operator. Then it is proved
that the corresponding Nevanlinna-Pick problem has a unique solution iff the
densely defined symmetric operator $J^{-1/2}HJ^{-1/2}$ is self-adjoint and some
criteria for this operator to be self-adjoint are presented. Finally, by means
of the operator technique, we obtain that multipoint diagonal Pad\'e
approximants to a unique solution $\varphi$ of the Nevanlinna-Pick problem
converge to $\varphi$ locally uniformly in $\dC\setminus\dR$. The proposed
scheme extends the classical Jacobi matrix approach to moment problems and
Pad\'e approximation for $\bR_0$-functions.
