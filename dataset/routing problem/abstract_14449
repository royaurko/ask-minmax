We show the short time existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Cauchy
problem for fully nonlinear systems of arbitrary even order on closed manifolds
which are strongly parabolic at the initial values. The proof uses a
linearization procedure and a fixed-point argument, and the key ingredient is
the well known Schauder estimates for linear, strongly parabolic systems.
