Low-scale supersymmetry breaking in string motivated theories implies the
presence of O(100) TeV scale moduli, which generically lead to a significant
modification of the history of the universe prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.
Such an approach implies a non-thermal origin for dark matter resulting from
scalar decay, where the lightest supersymmetric particle can account for the
observed dark matter relic density. We study the further effect of the decay on
the baryon asymmetry of the universe, and find that this can satisfactorily
address the problem of the over-production of the baryon asymmetry by the
Affleck-Dine mechanism in the MSSM. Remarkably, there is a natural connection
between the baryon and dark matter abundances today, which leads to a solution
of the `Cosmic Coincidence Problem'.
