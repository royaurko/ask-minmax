The goal of this paper is to review the main trends in the domain of
uncertainty principles and localization, emphasize their mutual connections and
investigate practical consequences. The discussion is strongly oriented
towards, and motivated by signal processing problems, from which significant
advances have been made recently. Relations with sparse approximation and
coding problems are emphasized.
