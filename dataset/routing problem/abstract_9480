First of all, this paper presents some improvements of DSMC method in the
form of new schemes and approaches, that, for a wide class of problems,
increase performance and reduce the demands on computer resources. The most
important improvement is the scheme of temporal factors, allowing the use of
different time step for different sorts of particles, thus reducing the
complexity and/or resource usage in simulation of stationary problems with very
different collisional cross-sections between components of a mixture. Other
improvements include the similarity parameter for efficient estimation of the
number of simulational particles required for 1D, 2D and 3D computations, the
new scheme for solving axisymmetric problems, an approach to detect and reject
repetitive collisions. Also, some advice on technical optimization of algorithm
for modern computers is offered.
