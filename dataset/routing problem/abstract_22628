We review some of the recent developments and challenges posed by the data
analysis in modern digital sky surveys, which are representative of the
information-rich astronomy in the context of Virtual Observatory. Illustrative
examples include the problems of an automated star-galaxy classification in
complex and heterogeneous panoramic imaging data sets, and an automated,
iterative, dynamical classification of transient events detected in synoptic
sky surveys. These problems offer good opportunities for productive
collaborations between astronomers and applied computer scientists and
statisticians, and are representative of the kind of challenges now present in
all data-intensive fields. We discuss briefly some emergent types of scalable
scientific data analysis systems with a broad applicability.
