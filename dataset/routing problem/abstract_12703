The paper surveys recent progress in establishing uniqueness and developing
inversion formulas and algorithms for the thermoacoustic tomography. In
mathematical terms, one deals with a rather special inverse problem for the
wave equation. In the case of constant sound speed, it can also be interpreted
as a problem concerning the spherical mean transform.
