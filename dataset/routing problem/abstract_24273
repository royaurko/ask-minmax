Recht, Fazel, and Parrilo provided an analogy between rank minimization and
$\ell_0$-norm minimization. Subject to the rank-restricted isometry property,
nuclear norm minimization is a guaranteed algorithm for rank minimization. The
resulting semidefinite formulation is a convex problem but in practice the
algorithms for it do not scale well to large instances. Instead, we explore
missing terms in the analogy and propose a new algorithm which is
computationally efficient and also has a performance guarantee. The algorithm
is based on the atomic decomposition of the matrix variable and extends the
idea in the CoSaMP algorithm for $\ell_0$-norm minimization. Combined with the
recent fast low rank approximation of matrices based on randomization, the
proposed algorithm can efficiently handle large scale rank minimization
problems.
