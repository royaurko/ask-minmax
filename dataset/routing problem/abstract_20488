The problem of defining time (or phase) operator for three-dimensional
harmonic oscillator has been analyzed. A new formula for this operator has been
derived. The results have been used to demonstrate a possibility of
representing quantum-mechanical time evolution in the framework of an extended
Hilbert space structure. Physical interpretation of the extended structure has
been discussed shortly, too.
