We consider the oscillating dark energy with periodic equation of state in
two equivalent formulations: ideal fluid or scalar-tensor theory. It is shown
that such dark energy suggests the natural way for the unification of
early-time inflation with late-time acceleration. We demonstrate how it
describes the transition from deceleration to acceleration or from non-phantom
to phantom era and how it solves the coincidence problem. The occurence of
finite-time future singularity for the oscillating (phantom) universe is also
investigated.
