The goal of this paper is to give a new, abstract approach to
cover-decomposition and polychromatic colorings using hypergraphs on ordered
vertex sets. We introduce an abstract version of a framework by Smorodinsky and
Yuditsky, used for polychromatic coloring halfplanes, and apply it to so-called
ABA-free hypergraphs, which are a special case of shift-chains. Using our
methods, we prove that (2k-1)-uniform ABA-free hypergraphs have a polychromatic
k-coloring, a problem posed by the second contributor. We also prove the same for
hypergraphs defined on a point set by pseudohalfplanes. These results are best
possible.
  We also introduce several new notions that seem to be important for
investigating polychromatic colorings and epsilon-nets, such as shallow hitting
sets and balanced polychromatic colorings. We pose several open problems
related to them. For example, is it true that given a finite point set $S$ on a
sphere and a set of halfspheres $\FF$, such that $\{S\cap F\mid F\in \FF\}$ is
a Sperner family, we can select an $R\subset S$ such that $1\le |F\cap R|\le 2$
holds for every $F\in \FF$?
