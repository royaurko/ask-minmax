Recently it has been shown that self-interactions of condensed polaritons can
be tuned by Feshbach resonances [Nat. Phys. 10, 500-504 (2014)], providing one
possible route towards attractive exciton-polariton condensates. On that basis,
we predict the mechanism for bright soliton generation in spinor polariton
condensates. We provide analytical expressions for bright (half) solitons as
minimizing functions of a generalized non-conservative Lagrangian supported by
a detailed numerical analysis that reveals the rich soliton dynamics inferred
by their instability and mutual interactions.
