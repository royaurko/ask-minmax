We have examined the stability of triangular equilibrium points in Robes's
generalised restricted three body problem. The problem is generalised in the
sense that more massive primary has been taken as an oblate spheroid. We have
found the position of triangular equilibrium points. We have obtained
variational equations of the problem. With the help of characteristic roots, we
conclude that the triangular points are unstable. Robe's result may be verified
from the generalised result.
