This papers aims at revisiting Minkowski space-time with a modified outlook
and making it more consistent (III.8). The paper scrutinizes the special case
of relativistic hypothesis (STR). The paper tries to solve the problems faced
by relativistic hypothesis by proposing a purely mathematically formulated
reference (and not a frame like aether) frame that suits string theory. Then
checking the validity of the frame by applying to various phenomenon and
aspects explained by STR; and also its properties when the experimental
statistics are taken into account in a homogeneous and isotropic large scale
structure of Universe. Further more the paper checks whether introducing the
frame solves the problems in STR; then looks into the occurrences of new
paradoxes in the frame, if any present.
