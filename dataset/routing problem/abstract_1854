Here we demonstrate a sieve for analysing primes and their composites, using
equivalence classes based on the modulo 6 return value as applied to the
Natural numbers. Five features of this 'Hexile' sieve are reviewed. The first
aspect, is that it narrows the search for primes to one-third of the Natural
numbers. The second feature is that we can obtain from the equivalence class
formulae, a property of its diophantine equations to distinguish between primes
and composites resulting from multiplication of these primes. Thirdly we can
from these diophantine formulations ascribe a non-random occurence to not only
the composites in the two equivalence classes but by default and as a
consequence : non-randomness of occurence to the resident primes. Fourthly we
develop a theoretical basis for sieving primes. Of final mention is that the
diophantine equations allows another route to a prime counting function using
combinatorics or numerical analysis.
