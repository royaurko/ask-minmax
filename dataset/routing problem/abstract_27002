BitCoin transactions are malleable in a sense that given a transaction an
adversary can easily construct an equivalent transaction which has a different
hash. This can pose a serious problem in some BitCoin distributed contracts in
which changing a transaction's hash may result in the protocol disruption and a
financial loss. The problem mostly concerns protocols, which use a "refund"
transaction to withdraw a deposit in a case of the protocol interruption. In
this short note, we show a general technique for creating
malleability-resilient "refund" transactions, which does not require any
modification of the BitCoin protocol. Applying our technique to our previous
paper "Fair Two-Party Computations via the BitCoin Deposits" (Cryptology ePrint
Archive, 2013) allows to achieve fairness in any Two-Party Computation using
the BitCoin protocol in its current version.
