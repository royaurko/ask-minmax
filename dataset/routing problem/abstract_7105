We consider the problem of computing approximate solution of Poisson equation
in the low-parametric tensor formats. We propose a new algorithm to compute the
solution based on the cross approximation algorithm in the frequency space, and
it has better complexity with respect to ranks in comparison with standard
algorithms, which are based on the exponential sums approximation. To
illustrate the effectiveness of our solver, we incorporate into a Uzawa solver
for the Stokes problem on semi-staggered grid as a subsolver. The resulting
solver outperforms the standard method for $n \geq 256$.
