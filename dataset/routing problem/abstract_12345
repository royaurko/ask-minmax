Progress in the study of the peripheral nuclear interactions in $^{14}N$
dissociation at $2.1A GeV$ in nuclear emulsion is outlined. The leading role of
the multiple fragmentations in the most peripheral nucleus interactions is
discussed. The production of unusual states, for which a regrouping of nucleons
beyond the $\alpha$-particle clustering is needed, is identified for this
channel.
