A scattering problem (or more precisely, a transmission-reflection problem)
of linearized excitations in the presence of a dark soliton is considered in a
one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger system with a general nonlinearity: $
\mathrm{i}\partial_t \phi = -\partial_x^2 \phi + F(|\phi|^2)\phi $. If the
system is interpreted as a Bose-Einstein condensate, the linearized excitation
is a Bogoliubov phonon, and the linearized equation is the Bogoliubov equation.
We exactly prove that the perfect transmission of the zero-energy phonon is
suppressed at a critical state determined by Barashenkov's stability criterion
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, (1996) 1193.], and near the critical state, the
energy-dependence of the reflection coefficient shows a saddle-node type
scaling law. The analytical results are well supported by numerical calculation
for cubic-quintic nonlinearity. Our result gives an exact example of scaling
laws of saddle-node bifurcation in time-reversible Hamiltonian systems. As a
by-product of the proof, we also give all exact zero-energy solutions of the
Bogoliubov equation and their finite energy extension.
