We consider possible mechanical masses that could appear in supersymmetry,
other than by direct Higgs coupling to fermions and we speculate that the
existence of such a type of mass would allow one to have the Higgs mass of the
$u$ quark zero, and the Higgs mass of the $d$ quark (at 1 \gev) of $\approx 1
\to 2 MeV$, thus solving at the same time the strong CP problem and arranging
the grand unification prediction $m_{\mu}/m_{e} = m_{s, Higgs}/m_{d, Higgs}.$
One possible mechanism for this is related to, but not identical with the quark
condensate. Here a mass is generated which is the same for all quarks, and
which adds to the Higgs type mass. Unfortunately, the numerical value of the
generated mass falls short of the desired value (some 5 MeV) by orders of
magnitude. An alternate mechanism, through Higgs-induced left-right couplings
in the squark sector may produce masses of the correct order of magnitude if
the mixing angles are diferent in the squark and quark sectors. To get the
desired result for the $u$ quark mass, we need a stop component mixing of 1/20
for the $LR$ $\tilde{u}$ squark coupling, so the strong CP problem may still be
solved. For the $d$ mass, this mechanism is not really sufficient to solve the
grand unification mass ratio problem.
