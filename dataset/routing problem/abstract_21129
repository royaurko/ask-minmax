We study the scattering problem for the Schr\"odinger equation on the
half-line with Robin boundary condition at the origin. We derive an expression
for the trace of the difference of the perturbed and unperturbed resolvent in
terms of a Wronskian. This leads to a representation for the perturbation
determinant and to trace identities of Buslaev-Faddeev type.
