In many applications that require matrix solutions of minimal rank, the
underlying cost function is non-convex leading to an intractable, NP-hard
optimization problem. Consequently, the convex nuclear norm is frequently used
as a surrogate penalty term for matrix rank. The problem is that in many
practical scenarios there is no longer any guarantee that we can correctly
estimate generative low-rank matrices of interest, theoretical special cases
notwithstanding. Consequently, this paper proposes an alternative empirical
Bayesian procedure build upon a variational approximation that, unlike the
nuclear norm, retains the same globally minimizing point estimate as the rank
function under many useful constraints. However, locally minimizing solutions
are largely smoothed away via marginalization, allowing the algorithm to
succeed when standard convex relaxations completely fail. While the proposed
methodology is generally applicable to a wide range of low-rank applications,
we focus our attention on the robust principal component analysis problem
(RPCA), which involves estimating an unknown low-rank matrix with unknown
sparse corruptions. Theoretical and empirical evidence are presented to show
that our method is potentially superior to related MAP-based approaches, for
which the convex principle component pursuit (PCP) algorithm (Candes et al.,
2011) can be viewed as a special case.
