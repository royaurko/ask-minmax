We consider a system of trimers and monomers on the triangular lattice, which
describes the adsorption problem on (111) $1 \times 1$ surface of diamond
structure. We give a mapping to a 3-state vertex model on the square lattice.
We treat the problem by the transfer-matrix method combined with the
density-matrix algorithm, to obtain thermodynamic quantities.
