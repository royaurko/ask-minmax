This paper studies eigenvalues of some Steklov problems. Among other things,
we show the following sharp estimtes. Let $\Omega$ be a bounded smooth domain
in an $n(\geq 2)$-dimensional Hadamard manifold an let $0=\lambda_0 <
\lambda_1\leq \lambda_2\leq ... $ denote the eigenvalues of the Steklov
problem: $\Delta u=0$ in $\Omega$ and $(\partial u)/(\partial \nu)=\lambda u$
on $\partial \Omega$. Then $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda^{-1}_i \geq
(n^2|\Omega|)/(|\partial\Omega|) $ with equality holding if and only if
$\Omega$ is isometric to an $n$-dimensional Euclidean ball. Let $M$ be an
$n(\geq 2)$-dimensional compact connected Riemannian manifold with boundary and
non-negative Ricci curvature. Assume that the mean curvature of $\pa M$ is
bounded below by a positive constant $c$ and let $q_1$ be the first eigenvalue
of the Steklov problem: $ \Delta^2 u= 0$ in $ M$ and $u= (\partial^2
u)/(\partial \nu^2) -q(\partial u)/(\partial \nu) =0$ on $ \partial M$. Then
$q_1\geq c$ with equality holding if and only if $M $ is isometric to a ball of
radius $1/c$ in ${\bf R}^n$.
