Power circuits are data structures which support efficient algorithms for
highly compressed integers. Using this new data structure it has been shown
recently by Myasnikov, Ushakov and Won that the Word Problem of the one-relator
Baumslag group is in P. Before that the best known upper bound has been
non-elementary. In the present paper we provide new results for power circuits
and we give new applications in algorithmic algebra and algorithmic group
theory: 1. We define a modified reduction procedure on power circuits which
runs in quadratic time thereby improving the known cubic time complexity. The
improvement is crucial for our other results. 2. We improve the complexity of
the Word Problem for the Baumslag group to cubic time thereby providing the
first practical algorithm for that problem. 3. The main result is that the Word
Problem of Higman's group is decidable in polynomial time. The situation for
Higman's group is more complicated than for the Baumslag group and forced us to
advance the theory of power circuits.
