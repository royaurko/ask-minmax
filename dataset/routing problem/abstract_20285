We develop a general approach of the almost sure central limit theorem for
the quasi-continuous vectorial martingales and we release a quadratic extension
of this theorem while specifying speeds of convergence. As an application of
this result we study the problem of estimate the variance of a process with
stationary and idependent increments in statistics.
