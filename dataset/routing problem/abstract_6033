This is a survey on the infinite group problem, an infinite-dimensional
relaxation of integer linear optimization problems introduced by Ralph Gomory
and Ellis Johnson in their groundbreaking papers titled "Some continuous
functions related to corner polyhedra I, II" [Math. Programming 3 (1972),
23-85, 359-389]. The survey presents the infinite group problem in the modern
context of cut generating functions. It focuses on the recent developments,
such as algorithms for testing extremality and breakthroughs for the k-row
problem for general k >= 1 that extend previous work on the single-row and
two-row problems. The survey also includes some previously unpublished results;
among other things, it unveils piecewise linear extreme functions with more
than four different slopes. An interactive companion program, implemented in
the open-source computer algebra package Sage, provides an updated compendium
of known extreme functions.
