The families index theory for the overlap lattice Dirac operator is applied
to derive topological features of the space of SU(N) lattice gauge fields on
the 4-torus: The topological sectors, specified by the fermionic topological
charge, are shown to contain noncontractible even-dimensional spheres when
$N\ge3$, and noncontractible circles in the N=2 case. We describe how certain
obstructions to the existence of gauge fixings without the Gribov problem in
the continuum setting correspond on the lattice to obstructions to the
contractibility of these spheres and circles. We also point out a canonical
connection on the space of lattice gauge fields with monopole-like
singularities associated with the spheres.
