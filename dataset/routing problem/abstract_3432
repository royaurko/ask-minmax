Using an approach that seems to be patterned after that of Yannakakis, Hofman
argues that an NP-complete problem cannot be formulated as a polynomial
bounded-sized linear programming problem. He then goes on to propose a
"construct" that he claims to be a counter-example to recently published linear
programming formulations of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the
Quadratic Assignment Problems (QAP), respectively. In this paper, we show that
Hofman's construct is flawed, and provide further proof that his
"counter-example" is invalid.
