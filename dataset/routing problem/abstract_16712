The complementary problems of masking and amplifying channel state
information in the Gel'fand-Pinsker channel have recently been solved by Merhav
and Shamai, and Kim et al., respectively. In this paper, we study a related
source coding problem. Specifically, we consider the two-encoder source coding
setting where one source is to be amplified, while the other source is to be
masked. In general, there is a tension between these two objectives which is
characterized by the amplification-masking tradeoff. In this paper, we give a
single-letter description of this tradeoff.
  We apply this result, together with a recent theorem by Courtade and Weissman
on multiterminal source coding, to solve a fundamental entropy characterization
problem.
