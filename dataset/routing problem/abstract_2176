The inelastic scattering of electrons is one route to study the vibrational
and electronic properties of materials. Such experiments, also called electron
energy-loss spectroscopy, are particularly useful for the investigation of the
collective excitations in metals, the charge carrier plasmons. These plasmons
are characterized by a specific dispersion (energy-momentum relationship),
which contains information on the sometimes complex nature of the conduction
electrons in topical materials. In this review we highlight the improvements of
the electron energy-loss spectrometer in the last years, summarize current
possibilities with this technique, and give examples where the investigation of
the plasmon dispersion allows insight into the interplay of the conduction
electrons with other degrees of freedom.
