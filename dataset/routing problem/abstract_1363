Max-min fairness (MMF) is a widely known approach to a fair allocation of
bandwidth to each of the users in a network. This allocation can be computed by
uniformly raising the bandwidths of all users without violating capacity
constraints. We consider an extension of these allocations by raising the
bandwidth with arbitrary and not necessarily uniform time-depending velocities
(allocation rates). These allocations are used in a game-theoretic context for
routing choices, which we formalize in progressive filling games (PFGs).
  We present a variety of results for equilibria in PFGs. We show that these
games possess pure Nash and strong equilibria. While computation in general is
NP-hard, there are polynomial-time algorithms for prominent classes of
Max-Min-Fair Games (MMFG), including the case when all users have the same
source-destination pair. We characterize prices of anarchy and stability for
pure Nash and strong equilibria in PFGs and MMFGs when players have different
or the same source-destination pairs. In addition, we show that when a designer
can adjust allocation rates, it is possible to design games with optimal strong
equilibria. Some initial results on polynomial-time algorithms in this
direction are also derived.
