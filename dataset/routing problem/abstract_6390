The ^3He^4He_2 three-atomic system is studied on the basis of a hard-core
version of the Faddeev differential equations. The binding energy of the
^3He^4He_2 trimer, scattering phase shifts, and the scattering length of a ^3He
atom off a ^4He dimer are calculated using the LM2M2 and TTY He-He interatomic
potentials.
