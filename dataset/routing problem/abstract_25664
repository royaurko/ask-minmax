This paper begins with a discussion of integration over probability types
(p-types). After doing that, the paper re-visits 3 mainstay problems of
classical (non-quantum) Shannon Information Theory (SIT): source coding without
distortion, channel coding, and source coding with distortion. The paper proves
well-known, conventional results for each of these 3 problems. However, the
proofs given for these results are not conventional. They are based on complex
integration techniques (approximations obtained by applying the method of
steepest descent to p-type integrals) instead of the usual delta & epsilon and
typical sequences arguments. Another unconventional feature of this paper is
that we make ample use of classical Bayesian networks (CB nets). This paper
showcases some of the benefits of using CB nets to do classical SIT.
