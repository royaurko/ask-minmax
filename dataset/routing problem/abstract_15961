In this paper we develop new Newton and conjugate gradient algorithms on the
Grassmann and Stiefel manifolds. These manifolds represent the constraints that
arise in such areas as the symmetric eigenvalue problem, nonlinear eigenvalue
problems, electronic structures computations, and signal processing. In
addition to the new algorithms, we show how the geometrical framework gives
penetrating new insights allowing us to create, understand, and compare
algorithms. The theory proposed here provides a taxonomy for numerical linear
algebra algorithms that provide a top level mathematical view of previously
unrelated algorithms. It is our hope that developers of new algorithms and
perturbation theories will benefit from the theory, methods, and examples in
this paper.
