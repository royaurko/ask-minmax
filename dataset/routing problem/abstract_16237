We present two infinite sequences of polynomial eigenfunctions of a
Sturm-Liouville problem. As opposed to the classical orthogonal polynomial
systems, these sequences start with a polynomial of degree one. We denote these
polynomials as $X_1$-Jacobi and $X_1$-Laguerre and we prove that they are
orthogonal with respect to a positive definite inner product defined over the
the compact interval $[-1,1]$ or the half-line $[0,\infty)$, respectively, and
they are a basis of the corresponding $L^2$ Hilbert spaces. Moreover, we prove
a converse statement similar to Bochner's theorem for the classical orthogonal
polynomial systems: if a self-adjoint second order operator has a complete set
of polynomial eigenfunctions $\{p_i\}_{i=1}^\infty$, then it must be either the
$X_1$-Jacobi or the $X_1$-Laguerre Sturm-Liouville problem. A Rodrigues-type
formula can be derived for both of the $X_1$ polynomial sequences.
