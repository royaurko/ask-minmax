This paper is centered on using chemical reaction as a computational metaphor
for simultaneously solving problems. An artificial chemical reactor that can
simultaneously solve instances of three unrelated problems was created. The
reactor is a distributed stochastic algorithm that simulates a chemical
universe wherein the molecular species are being represented either by a human
genomic contig panel, a Hamiltonian cycle, or an aircraft landing schedule. The
chemical universe is governed by reactions that can alter genomic sequences,
re-order Hamiltonian cycles, or reschedule an aircraft landing program.
Molecular masses were considered as measures of goodness of solutions, and
represented radiation hybrid (RH) vector similarities, costs of Hamiltonian
cycles, and penalty costs for landing an aircraft before and after target
landing times. This method, tested by solving in tandem with deterministic
algorithms, has been shown to find quality solutions in finding the minima RH
vector similarities of genomic data, minima costs in Hamiltonian cycles of the
traveling salesman, and minima costs for landing aircrafts before or after
target landing times.
