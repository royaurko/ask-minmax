Compound nouns such as example noun compound are becoming more common in
natural language and pose a number of difficult problems for NLP systems,
notably increasing the complexity of parsing. In this paper we develop a
probabilistic model for syntactically analysing such compounds. The model
predicts compound noun structures based on knowledge of affinities between
nouns, which can be acquired from a corpus. Problems inherent in this
corpus-based approach are addressed: data sparseness is overcome by the use of
semantically motivated word classes and sense ambiguity is explicitly handled
in the model. An implementation based on this model is described in Lauer
(1994) and correctly parses 77% of the test set.
