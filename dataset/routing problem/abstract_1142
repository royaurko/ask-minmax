We describe a new methodology of synthesizing the oxypnictide superconductors
with potassium fluoride as a source as a source of fluorine instead of LaF3.
This route also allows the substitution of potassium at lanthanum sites which
leads to an increase in the upper critical field as would be expected for a
multiband superconductor. We also report the highest reported Tc onset of 28.5K
and highest upper critical field in these superconductors.
