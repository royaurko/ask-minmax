The most profound effect of disorder on the elastic response of solids is the
nonaffinity of local displacements whereby the atoms (particles, network
junctions) do not simply follow the macroscopic strain, as they do in perfect
crystals, but undergo additional displacements which result in a softening of
response. Whether disorder can produce further effects has been an open and
difficult question due to our poor understanding of nonaffinity. Here we
present a systematic analysis of this problem by allowing both network disorder
and lattice coordination to vary continuously under account of nonaffinity. In
one of its limits, our theory, supported by numerical simulations, shows that
in lattices close to the limit of mechanical stability the elastic response
stiffens proportionally to the degree of disorder. This result has important
implications in a variety of areas: from understanding the glass transition
problem to the mechanics of biological networks such as the cytoskeleton.
