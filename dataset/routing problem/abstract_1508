A common approach to overcome the limited nature of sensor networks is to
aggregate data at intermediate nodes. A challenging issue in this context is to
guarantee end-to-end security mainly because sensor networks are extremely
vulnerable to node compromises. In order to secure data aggregation, in this
paper we propose three schemes that rely on multipath routing. The first one
guarantees data confidentiality through secret sharing, while the second and
third ones provide data availability through information dispersal. Based on
qualitative analysis and implementation, we show that, by applying these
schemes, a sensor network can achieve data confidentiality, authenticity, and
protection against denial of service attacks even in the presence of multiple
compromised nodes.
