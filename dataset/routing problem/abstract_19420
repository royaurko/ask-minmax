Seamless computing and data access is enabled by the emerging technology of
mobile micro-clouds (MMCs). Different from traditional centralized clouds, an
MMC is typically connected directly to a wireless base-station and provides
services to a small group of users, which allows users to have instantaneous
access to cloud services. Due to the limited coverage area of base-stations and
the dynamic nature of mobile users, network background traffic, etc., the
question of where to place the services to cope with these dynamics arises. In
this paper, we focus on dynamic service placement for MMCs. We consider the
case where there is an underlying mechanism to predict the future costs of
service hosting and migration, and the prediction error is assumed to be
bounded. Our goal is to find the optimal service placement sequence which
minimizes the average cost over a given time. To solve this problem, we first
propose a method which solves for the optimal placement sequence for a specific
look-ahead time-window, based on the predicted costs in this time-window. We
show that this problem is equivalent to a shortest-path problem and propose an
algorithm with polynomial time-complexity to find its solution. Then, we
propose a method to find the optimal look-ahead window size, which minimizes an
upper bound of the average cost. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach by simulations with real-world user-mobility traces.
