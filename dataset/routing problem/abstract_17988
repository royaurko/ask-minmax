We present a simple method for summing so-called parquet diagrams of
fermionic many-body systems with competing instabilities using the functional
renormalization group. Our method is based on partial bosonization of the
interaction utilizing multi-channel Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations. A
simple truncation of the resulting flow equations, retaining only the
frequency-independent parts of the two-point and three-point vertices amounts
to solving coupled Bethe-Salpeter equations for the effective interaction to
leading logarithmic order. We apply our method by revisiting the X-ray problem
and deriving the singular frequency dependence of the X-ray response function
and the particle-particle susceptibility. Our method is quite general and
should be useful in many-body problems involving strong fluctuations in several
scattering channels.
