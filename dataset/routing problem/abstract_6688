Nowadays the Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation is extensively studied in several
settings. The main questions on avery spaces are explicit solutions for the
classical Cauchy problems with the second data null. In this note we will
generalize and unify several results on Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation. In this
note we consider the Cauchy problem with modified conditions for the
Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation. We give the explicit solutions in terms of
Gauss 2F1 and Appel F4 hypergeometric functions with applications to the
classical and radial wave equations
