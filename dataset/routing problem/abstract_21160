We discuss the effect of structure-preserving perturbations on complex or
real Hamiltonian eigenproblems and characterize the structured worst-case
effect perturbations. We derive significant expressions for both the structured
condition numbers and the worst-case effect Hamiltonian perturbations. It is
shown that, for purely imaginary eigenvalues, the usual unstructured
perturbation analysis is sufficient.
