We calculate the region of the MSSM parameter space (i.e. $M_{1/2}$, $m_{0}$,
$\mu$, \ldots) compatible with a correct electroweak breaking and a realistic
top-quark mass. To do so we have included {\em all} the one-loop corrections to
the effective potential $V_{1}$ and checked their importance in order to obtain
consistent results. We also consider the fine-tuning problem due to the
enormous dependence of $M_{Z}$ on $h_{t}$ (the top Yukawa coupling), which is
substantially reduced when the one-loop effects are taken into account. We also
explore the reliability of the so-called "standard" criterion to estimate the
degree of fine-tuning. As a consequence, we obtain a new set of upper bounds on
the MSSM parameters or, equivalently, on the supersymmetric masses perfectly
consistent with the present experimental bounds.
