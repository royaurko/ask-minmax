A new approach is proposed, namely CSSF MIMO radar, which applies the
technique of step frequency (SF) to compressive sensing (CS) based multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) radar. The proposed approach enables high resolution range,
angle and Doppler estimation, while transmitting narrowband pulses. The problem
of joint angle-Doppler-range estimation is first formulated to fit the CS
framework, i.e., as an L1 optimization problem. Direct solution of this problem
entails high complexity as it employs a basis matrix whose construction
requires discretization of the angle-Doppler-range space. Since high resolution
requires fine space discretization, the complexity of joint range, angle and
Doppler estimation can be prohibitively high. For the case of slowly moving
targets, a technique is proposed that achieves significant complexity reduction
by successively estimating angle-range and Doppler in a decoupled fashion and
by employing initial estimates obtained via matched filtering to further reduce
the space that needs to be digitized. Numerical results show that the
combination of CS and SF results in a MIMO radar system that has superior
resolution and requires far less data as compared to a system that uses a
matched filter with SF.
