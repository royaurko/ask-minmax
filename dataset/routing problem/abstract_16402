We study boundary value problems for linear elliptic differential operators
of order one. The underlying manifold may be noncompact, but the boundary is
assumed to be compact. We require a symmetry property of the principal symbol
of the operator along the boundary. This is satisfied by Dirac type operators,
for instance.
  We provide a selfcontained introduction to (nonlocal) elliptic boundary
conditions, boundary regularity of solutions, and index theory. In particular,
we simplify and generalize the traditional theory of elliptic boundary value
problems for Dirac type operators. We also prove a related decomposition
theorem, a general version of Gromov and Lawson's relative index theorem and a
generalization of the cobordism theorem.
