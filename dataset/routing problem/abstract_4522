In this work, we study discontinuous Sturm-Liouville type problems with
eigenparameter dependent boundary condition and transmission conditions at
three interior points. A self-adjoint linear operator A is defined in a
suitable Hilbert space H such that the eigenvalues of such a problem coincide
with those of A. We show that the eigenvalues of the problem are analytically
simple, and the eigenfunctions of A are complete in H.
