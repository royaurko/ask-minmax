We define a new notion of entropy for operators on Fock spaces and positive
definite multi-Toeplitz kernels on free semigroups. This is studied in
connection with factorization theorems for (multi-Toeplitz, multi-analytic,
etc.) operators on Fock spaces. These results lead to entropy inequalities and
entropy formulas for positive definite multi-Toeplitz kernels on free
semigroups (resp.multi-Toeplitz operators) and consequences concerning the
extreme points of the unit ball of the noncommutative analytic Toeplitz algebra
F_n^\infty.
  We obtain several geometric characterizations of the multivariable central
intertwining lifting, a maximum principle, and a permanence principle for the
noncommutative commutant lifting theorem. Under certain natural conditions, we
find explicit forms for the maximal entropy solution (and its entropy) for this
multivariable commutant lifting theorem.
  All these results are used to solve maximal entropy interpolation problems in
several variables. We obtain explicit forms for the maximal entropy solution
(as well as its entropy) of the Sarason, Caratheodory-Schur, and
Nevanlinna-Pick type interpolation problems for the noncommutative
(resp.commutative) analytic Toeplitz algebra F_n^\infty (resp.W_n^\infty)and
their tensor products with B(H,K). In particular, we provide explicit forms for
the maximal entropy solutions of several interpolation (resp.optimization)
problems on the unit ball of C^n.
