In this paper, we prove the existence portion of the Bertram-Feinberg-Mukai
Conjecture for an infinite family of new cases using degeneration technique.
This not only leads to a substantial improvement of known results but also
develops finer tools for analyzing the moduli of rank two limit linear series
which should be useful for other applications to other higher-rank
Brill-Noether Problems.
