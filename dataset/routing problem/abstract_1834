It is promising to apply quantum-mechanically confined graphene systems in
field-effect transistors. High stability, superior performance, and large-scale
integration are the main challenges facing the practical application of
graphene transistors. Our understandings of the adatom-graphene interaction
combined with recent progress in the nanofabrication technology indicate that
very stable and high-quality graphene nanostripes could be integrated in
substrate-supported functionalized (hydrogenated or fluorinated) graphene using
electron-beam lithography. We also propose that parallelizing a couple of
graphene nanostripes in a transistor should be preferred for practical
application, which is also very useful for transistors based on graphene
nanoribbon.
