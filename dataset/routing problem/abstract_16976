In a wide class of direct and semi-direct gauge mediation models, it has been
observed that the gaugino masses vanish at leading order. It implies that there
is a hierarchy between the gaugino and sfermion masses, invoking a fine-tuning
problem in the Higgs sector via radiative corrections. In this paper, we
explore the possibility of solving this anomalously light gaugino problem
exploiting strong conformal dynamics in the hidden sector. With a mild
assumption on the anomalous dimensions of the hidden sector operators, we show
that the next to leading order contributions to the gaugino masses can
naturally be in the same order as the sfermion masses. \mu/B_\mu problem is
also discussed.
