For some positive integers $g$ and $n$ we consider a subgroup
$\mathbb{G}_{g,n}$ of the $2g$-dimensional modular group keeping invariant a
certain locus $\mathcal{W}_{g,n}$ in the Siegel upper half plane of degree $g$.
We address the problem of describing a fundamental domain for the modular
action of the subgroup on $\mathcal{W}_{g,n}$. Our motivation comes from
geometry: $g$ and $n$ represent the genus and the number of ovals of a generic
real Riemann surface of separated type; the locus $\mathcal{W}_{g,n}$ contains
the corresponding period matrix computed with respect to some specific basis in
the homology. In this paper we formulate a general procedure to solve the
problem when $g$ is even and $n$ equals one. For $g$ equal to two or four the
explicit calculations are worked out in full detail.
