Low temperature and low frequency properties of a spin-boson model are
investigated within a super operator and Liouville space formulation. The
leading contributions are identified with the help of projection operators
projecting onto the equilibrium state. The quantities of interest are expressed
in terms of weighted bath propagators and static linear and nonlinear
susceptibilities. In particular the generalized Shiba relation and Wilson ratio
are recovered.
