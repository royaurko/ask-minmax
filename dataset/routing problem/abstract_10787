Creating a swarm of mobile computing entities frequently called robots,
agents or sensor nodes, with self-organization ability is a contemporary
challenge in distributed computing. Motivated by this, this paper investigates
the plane formation problem that requires a swarm of robots moving in the three
dimensional Euclidean space to reside in a common plane. The robots are fully
synchronous and endowed with visual perception. But they have neither
identifiers, access to the global coordinate system, any means of explicit
communication with each other, nor memory of past. Though there are plenty of
results on the agreement problem for robots in the two dimensional plane, for
example, the point formation problem, the pattern formation problem, and so on,
this is the first result for robots in the three dimensional space. This paper
presents a necessary and sufficient condition to solve the plane formation
problem. An implication of the result is somewhat counter-intuitive: The robots
cannot form a plane from most of the semi-regular polyhedra, while they can
from every regular polyhedron (except a regular icosahedron), which consists of
the same regular polygon and contains "more" symmetric robots than semi-regular
polyhedra.
