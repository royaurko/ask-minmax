This article describes the first implementation of the GADEL system : a
Genetic Algorithm for Default Logic. The goal of GADEL is to compute extensions
in Reiter's default logic. It accepts every kind of finite propositional
default theories and is based on evolutionary principles of Genetic Algorithms.
Its first experimental results on certain instances of the problem show that
this new approach of the problem can be successful.
