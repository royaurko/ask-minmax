The work is based on the equation of relativistic dynamics, the law of mass
conservation of material body moving in gravitational field and the influence
of gravitation on time passage discovered by Einstein. The formulae describing
changes of inert and gravitational masses of material body were found. A new
formula for the power of gravitational interaction of material bodies was
derived. Newtons formula was shown to be the approximation of the new formula.
It was determined that the equivalence principle of inert and gravitational
masses is not universal. This principle is true with definite accuracy within
the Solar system, when the sum of kinetic and potential energies of a material
body is equal to zero. Limitation of the equivalence principle of inert and
gravitational masses for galactic star systems erases the problem of dark
matter.
