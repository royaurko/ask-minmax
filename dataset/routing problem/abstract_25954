We present semi-streaming algorithms for basic graph problems that have
optimal per-edge processing times and therefore surpass all previous
semi-streaming algorithms for these tasks. The semi-streaming model, which is
appropriate when dealing with massive graphs, forbids random access to the
input and restricts the memory to O(n*polylog n) bits.
  Particularly, the formerly best per-edge processing times for finding the
connected components and a bipartition are O(alpha(n)), for determining
k-vertex and k-edge connectivity O(k^2n) and O(n*log n) respectively for any
constant k and for computing a minimum spanning forest O(log n). All these time
bounds we reduce to O(1).
  Every presented algorithm determines a solution asymptotically as fast as the
best corresponding algorithm up to date in the classical RAM model, which
therefore cannot convert the advantage of unlimited memory and random access
into superior computing times for these problems.
