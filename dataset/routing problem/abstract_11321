QCD in a five-dimensional sliced bulk with chiral extra-quarks on the
boundaries is generically free from the strong CP problem. Accidental axial
symmetry is naturally present except for suppressed breaking interactions,
which plays a role of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry to make the strong CP phase
sufficiently small.
