Social utility maximization refers to the process of allocating resources in
such a way that the sum of agents' utilities is maximized under the system
constraints. Such allocation arises in several problems in the general area of
communications, including unicast (and multicast multi-rate) service on the
Internet, as well as in applications with (local) public goods, such as power
allocation in wireless networks, spectrum allocation, etc. Mechanisms that
implement such allocations in Nash equilibrium have also been studied but
either they do not possess full implementation property, or are given in a
case-by-case fashion, thus obscuring fundamental understanding of these
problems.
  In this paper we propose a unified methodology for creating mechanisms that
fully implement, in Nash equilibria, social utility maximizing functions
arising in various contexts where the constraints are convex. The construction
of the mechanism is done in a systematic way by considering the dual
optimization problem. In addition to the required properties of efficiency and
individual rationality that such mechanisms ought to satisfy, three additional
design goals are the focus of this paper: a) the size of the message space
scaling linearly with the number of agents (even if agents' types are entire
valuation functions), b) allocation being feasible on and off equilibrium, and
c) strong budget balance at equilibrium and also off equilibrium whenever
demand is feasible.
