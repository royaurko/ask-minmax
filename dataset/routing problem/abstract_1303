When nodes in a mobile network cluster together or move according to common
external factors (e.g., cars that follow the road network), the resulting
contact patterns become correlated. In this work we address the question of
modelling such correlated mobility movements for the analysis of intermittently
connected networks. We propose to use the concept of node colouring time to
characterise dynamic node contact patterns. We analyse how this model compares
to existing work, and demonstrate how to extract the relevant data from actual
trace files. Moreover, we show how this information can be used to derive the
latency distribution of DTN routing protocols. Our model achieves a very good
fit to simulated results based on real vehicular mobility traces, whereas
models which assumes independent contacts do not.
