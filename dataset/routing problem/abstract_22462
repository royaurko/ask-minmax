We consider the evolution of the light elements ($Li, Be$ and $B$)
incorporating the effects of their production by both neutrino process and
cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis. We test the viability of the neutrino process to
resolve the long standing problem of the $^{11}$B/$^{10}$B isotopic ratio which
amounts to 4 at the time of the formation of the solar system. This hypothesis
may be ultimately constrained by the $B/Be$ ratio observed in halo stars.
Though we are able to obtain a solar isotopic ratio $^{11}B/^{10}B \simeq 4$,
the current paucity of data at low metallicity prevents us from making a
definitive conclusion regarding the resolution of this problem. We show
however, that neutrino process nucleosynthesis leads to a relatively model
independent prediction that the $B/Be$ elemental ratio is large ($>$ 50) at low
metallicities ($[Fe/H] < -3.0$), if $Be$ is produced as a secondary element (as
is the case in the conventional scenario of galactic cosmic-ray
nucleosynthesis).
