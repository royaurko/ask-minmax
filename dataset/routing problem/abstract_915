We report the synthesis of fine particles of a well-known geometrically
frustrated spin-chain compound Ca3Co2O6 through a new route, namely, a
pyrophoric method employing triathanolamine (TEA) and studied the magnetic
behavior of such specimens. We find that this synthesis yields particles made
up of rods whose diameter appears to be controllable by the fraction of TEA
during synthesis. It is seen that the two well-known magnetic transitions (near
24 and 8 K) remain unaffected for all TEA concentrations used. The most notable
finding is that the multi-step feature in the M versus magnetic-field isotherm
reported for single crystalline form tends to smoothen out gradually with
decreasing rod thickness (from about 1 micron to about a few hundred nm).
Further, unlike for the single crystalline form known in the literature, there
is no tendency for the relaxation time (tau) to remain constant at low
temperatures (<10 K) and tau remains temperature dependent up to the lowest
temperature measured (1.8K) in all the specimens. These findings suggest that
the multistep magnetization anomaly in this system may be characterized by a
magnetic correlation length.
