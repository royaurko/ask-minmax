Analysis based reconstruction has recently been introduced as an alternative
to the well-known synthesis sparsity model used in a variety of signal
processing areas. In this paper we convert the analysis exact-sparse
reconstruction problem to an equivalent synthesis recovery problem with a set
of additional constraints. We are therefore able to use existing
synthesis-based algorithms for analysis-based exact-sparse recovery. We call
this the Analysis-By-Synthesis (ABS) approach. We evaluate our proposed
approach by comparing it against the recent Greedy Analysis Pursuit (GAP)
analysis-based recovery algorithm. The results show that our approach is a
viable option for analysis-based reconstruction, while at the same time
allowing many algorithms that have been developed for synthesis reconstruction
to be directly applied for analysis reconstruction as well.
