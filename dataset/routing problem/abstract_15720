This talk consists of two parts. In part I we review how the minimal
renormalizable supersymmetric SO(10) model, an SO(10) framework with only one
10 and one 126 Higgs multiplets in the Yukawa sector, is attractive because of
its highly predictive power. Indeed it not only gives a consistent predictions
on neutrino oscillation data but also gives reasonable and interesting values
for leptogenesis, LFV, muon g-2, neutrinoless double beta decay etc. However,
this model suffers from problems related to running of gauge couplings. The
gauge coupling unification may be spoiled due to the presence of Higgs
multiplets much lighter than the grand unification (GUT) scale. In addition,
the gauge couplings blow up around the GUT scale because of the presence of
Higgs multiplets of large representations. In part II we consider the minimal
SO(10) model in the warped extra dimension and show a possibility to solve
these problems.
