This report provides an introduction to algorithms for fundamental linear
algebra problems on various parallel computer architectures, with the emphasis
on distributed-memory MIMD machines. To illustrate the basic concepts and key
issues, we consider the problem of parallel solution of a nonsingular linear
system by Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting. This problem has come to
be regarded as a benchmark for the performance of parallel machines. We
consider its appropriateness as a benchmark, its communication requirements,
and schemes for data distribution to facilitate communication and load
balancing. In addition, we describe some parallel algorithms for orthogonal
(QR) factorization and the singular value decomposition (SVD).
