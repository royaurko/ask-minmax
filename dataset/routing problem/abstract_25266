Modeling the rotation history of solar-type stars is still an unsolved
problem in modern astrophysics. One of the main challenges is to explain the
dispersion in the distribution of stellar rotation rate for young stars.
Previous works have advocated dynamo saturation or magnetic field localization
to explain the presence of fast rotators and star-disk coupling in pre-main
sequence to account for the existence of slow rotators. Here, we present a new
model that can account for the presence of both types of rotators by
incorporating fluctuations in the solar wind. This renders the spin-down
problem probabilistic in nature, some stars experiencing more braking on
average than others. We show that random fluctuations in the loss of angular
momentum enhance the population of both fast and slow rotators compared to the
deterministic case. Furthermore, the distribution of rotational speed is
severely skewed towards large values in agreement with observations.
