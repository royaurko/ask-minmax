We consider two basic problems arising in the theory of synchronizing
automata: deciding, whether or not a given $n$-state automaton is synchronizing
and the problem of approximating the reset threshold for a given synchronizing
automaton.
  For the first problem of deciding whether or not a given $n$-state automaton
is synchronizing we present an algorithm based on~\cite{RandSynch} with linear
in $n$ expected time, while the best known algorithm is quadratic on each
instance.
  For the second problem, we prove that unless \textsf{P} = \textsf{NP}, no
polynomial time algorithm approximates the reset threshold for a given
$n$-state $2$-letter automata within performance ratio less than $0.5 c
\ln{(n)}$ where $c$ is a specific constant from~\cite{AMS6}. This improves the
previous result of the contributor~\cite{MyTOCS2013} about non-approximability
within any constant factor and also gives the positive answer to the
corresponding conjecture from~\cite{Gerb1}.
