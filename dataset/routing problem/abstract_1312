Light polarization rotators and non-reciprocal optical isolators are
essential building blocks in photonics technology. These macroscopic passive
devices are commonly based on magneto-optical Faraday and Kerr polarization
rotation. Magnetoplasmonics - the combination of magnetism and plasmonics - is
a promising route to bring these devices to the nanoscale. We introduce design
rules for highly tunable active magnetoplasmonic elements in which we can
tailor the amplitude and sign of the Kerr response over a broad spectral range.
